			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Collecting: Contemporary art gets a foot in the door - Nicholas Powell casts an eye over Europe's only works-on-paper fair THE salon du dessin de collections, Europe's only works-on-paper fair and the only one in the world which shows drawings but not prints, has moved this year from its cosy but crowded basement in the Hotel George V to the far loftier Grand Palais. The deliberately uniform and sober style of presentation - by Paris standards, at least - remains the same. But the salon is booming and 24 dealers, compared with 17 last year, are presenting a much wider range in twice as much space. The salon, which proved an immediate success when launched in 1991, is still a purely French affair, despite the eagerness of foreign galleries to take part and the readiness of some of the younger Paris dealers to let them in. Prices, meanwhile, are still an average 40 per cent down on what they were before the 1990 slump. Catering for Parisian taste as well as international collectors, the salon has been top-heavy in the past with decorative Flemish and 18th century French drawings and lacking totally in contemporary art. All that changes this year with the defection of Northern School specialists Segoura and Bob Habold, and the arrival of eight top Paris galleries specialising in modern and contemporary work. Gallerie Di Meo, Yvon Lambert and Louis Carre have all brought works by their stables of artists. Pierre Brulle is concentrating on 1930s' drawings by German artist Karl Hubbuch, while Gallerie Claude Bernard is showing figurative pastels, watercolours and drawings by French painter Jacques Truphemus. Durand-Dessert is mounting a one-man show of recent watercolours by another leading French artist, Gerard Garouste (priced from FFr30,000-100,000), while Fanny Guillon-Laffaille is exhibiting drawings by Matisse from the 1930s and '40s, and watercolours from the same period by Dufy. Marwan Hoss is showing a wide range of mainly unpublished works. Priced at between FFr25,000-250,000, these include charcoals by reclusive Canadian artist Riopelle; figurative and abstract works by French painter Helion; drawings by the Uruguayan constructivist Torres-Garcia; and a series of very rare drawings by Spanish sculptor Julio Gonzalez (Hoss organised the retrospective of his work at New York's Guggenheim in 1983). Newcomer Francois Perreau-Saussine, a 19th century specialist, has hung a large-format 1959 Picasso ink drawing of a bullfight (price: FFr1.2m) alongside his more customary Ingres, Degas, Millet and Barbizon school drawings. Hopkins-Thomas has a stunning (and highly unusual) drawing of a kitten by Manet in charcoal and white chalk; a very rare and highly characterful 1912 cubist portrait of the poet and critic, Apollinaire, by his Polish-born friend, Marcoussis, at just over FFr700,000; and a dozen more affordable Vuillard pencil drawings of interiors at FFr20,000-60,000. Those heavyweights of the international drawings market, Proute and Bayser, again are showing a wide range of 16th to 20th century drawings while keeping their most expensive works in the gallery - no one believes in economic miracles. Nicolas Joly, who runs the works-on-paper department of Galerie Yves Mikaeloff, is at the salon for the first time with 40 mainly 17th and 18th century works - including an early La Hire of 1620 and one of the very few drawings by the 17th century French artist, Nicolas Mignard, not yet in the Louvre - plus 10 early-20th century drawings by Andre Mare. The French 18th century is represented by both Patrick Perrin, whose booth is devoted to red chalk drawings, and Galerie Cailleux, showing works by Jean-Baptiste Tiepolo, Fragonard and Greuze. Galerie de la Scala has opted for a display of the themes of architectural studies and portraits, including an exquisite charcoal sketch of a baby (circa 1819) by Pierre-Paul Proudhon which his mistress, Constance Mayer, used for her painting, Reve de Bonheur, in the Louvre. The studies are mainly by 18th century artists such as Hubert Robert and Delafosse, and aim at Parisian taste. They contain two recently-identified rarities: ink and brown wash preparatory sketches of 1735 done by Panini for the decoration of King Philip V of Spain's bedchamber in his residence, La Granja, near Segovia. The other two drawings in the series, also combining highly-elaborate architectural structures and scenes from the life of Christ, are in the Prado. Italian masters are represented by two dealers, Moatti and Baroni. The former is showing 15 unpublished 16th century drawings, including preparatory sketches for jewellery of 1560 by the Florentine school of Francesco Salviati and a little-known Italian period drawing by Simon Vouet. Baroni, a gallery which opened in 1991, has thirty 16th to 18th century Italian drawings by the likes of Confortini, Cipriani and Cambiaso on show, hoping to attract the eye of French museum curators.</p>

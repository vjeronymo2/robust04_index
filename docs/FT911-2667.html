			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Construction Contracts: Harrogate market project LAING YORKSHIRE has landed the Pounds 18m contract to build Speyhawk Retail's shopping development on the former market hall site in Harrogate which is being financed by NPI (National Provident Institution). As well as boosting shopping facilities in the town, the Victoria Gardens scheme will provide a new home for the market traders who are currently based in temporary accommodation adjacent to the site. The new market hall will be located in the lower ground floor of the new development and above will be three levels of shopping around a central atrium, providing about 90,000 sq ft of retail space. In total, 58 shops are being provided catering for the needs of multiple retailers at ground and first floors, with smaller speciality units and two restaurants on the second floor. Construction will comprise an in situ reinforced concrete frame, ornate natural external stonework and a curved copper perimeter roof. The development includes a footbridge link over Station Parade which will be a steel-framed structure enclosed with curtain walling and a curved copper roof. The bridge will link the shopping centre to Harrogate Borough Council's new 700 space car park. The building contract also involves internal finishes.</p>

Britain's THE SUNDAY TIMES, for  example, forecasts not only Ukraine's economic collapse, but a  war between it and Russia. "If the crisis continues," the  newspaper writes, "the majority of the Russians in Ukraine will  choose the path of unification with Russia. This will provoke a  civil war." TRUD's correspondent asked Ukrainian Acting Prime  Minister Yukhym Leonidovich Zvyahilskyy to comment on this and  other similar forecasts.    [Zvyahilskyy] These are the ravings of a madman. Clearly,  some people would very much like our relations to develop  according to that kind of scenario, but no one is going to get  us to fall out. Close, equitable ties with Russia were and  remain our main policy priority. Russia is our biggest economic  partner. We have historical, cultural, and linguistic  connections. There are 12 million Russians living in our  country.    Ukraine is a major partner of Russia's. The Ukrainian market  is equal to one-third of the Russian market. Major lines of  communication to Europe and the Black Sea area run through our  country. The economies of the Russian oblasts bordering us are  the most stable because they maintain direct economic links with  Ukrainian enterprises, and, you know, tens of millions of people  live in those oblasts.    In short, a strong and stable Ukraine is in the interests of  Russia and its people. We should always live in peace and  friendship. But there is no point in adhering to the principle  that one's own interests are what count and everyone else's must  fit in with "big brother's." I am sure that's how it will be  when politics stop dominating economics and commonsense. It can  be said that we are already en route to that today. We are  boldly developing bilateral relations and are setting up joint  ventures. We should eliminate more quickly the problem of  nonpayments and obtain the opportunity to pay in a normal way  for the raw materials and commodities of both Russian and our  own enterprises. Nonpayments is a common ill, and we have to  cure it together, and not by relying on some benefactor to  endlessly provide nonrepayable loans.    [Prokopchuk] You are thinking of supplies of Russian gas?    [Zvyahilskyy] I cannot fault Russia at all here. We  ourselves are to blame for the temporary halt in gas supplies.  Russia provides us with 140 million cubic meters of gas a day.  But there were several days when we were taking 180 million a  day, thereby reducing the pressure in the export gas pipelines.  Who is going to put up with that kind of presumptuousness.  That is why my deputy, V. Landik, flew to Moscow and guaranteed  Gazprom that we would not allow such outrageous behavior in  future.    [Prokopchuk] Is it true that the Russian joint-stock company  Gazprom is demanding that the main gas pipelines and the  underground gas reservoirs be transferred to it to make up the  arrears?    [Zvyahilskyy] That is idle speculation. Different terms  were proposed: Namely, that a controlling block of shares be  given to Gazprom during the flotation of the Ukrainian gas  transportation enterprises and gas refineries. But we will not  accept that. We propose something else -- flotation with the  participation of Russian capital. But Ukraine will retain the  controlling block of shares here. We are now preparing  documents on yet another issue on which it is time we reached  agreement. This involves the so-called "zero option" division  of the former USSR's debts and property. Russia has repeatedly  asked us to agree this option, saying that no one is to owe  anyone anything, while the huge amount of former Soviet property  belongs in its entirety to Russia. We insist that Ukraine has  its own share of this foreign property. We have agreed to pay  the appropriate proportion of the former debts to it. We are  preparing a letter to the Russian Government.    [Prokopchuk] Property is a good thing. But you will agree  that you will have to wait a long time for it to yield a profit,  while the situation in the country is already explosive. Half  the population lives below the poverty line and millions are  unable to buy the necessities of life. Are there any hopes  today of a better outcome, of stabilization?    [Zvyahilskyy] Our predecessors pinned their hopes on foreign  loans. No one gave us any, and we can see that they are not a  panacea. Hopes pinned on the possibility of rapid integration  within the European economy and help from Ukrainians abroad were  likewise dashed. Our government, headed by the president,  relies solely on its own devices and possibilities.  Unfortunately, serious mistakes in both the strategy and  tactics of reform have been made in the last two years. As a  result last year alone prices increased 100-fold while wages  went up 50-fold. In what kind of normal state could you  increase the return on fuel oil to 5,000 percent while raising  the payment of bank loans to 320-percent interest per annum?    This is not an expose of things done in the past, they  represent inescapable facts of the present day.    [Prokopchuk] The cabinet headed by the president has been in  office five months. Has it managed to achieve anything?    [Zvyahilskiy] Although the economic position in the country  is difficult, the first signs of stabilization have nevertheless  already emerged. The inflation rate did not exceed 20 percent  in January-February, which is 4.5-times less than last December.  Prices for the most important foodstuffs are not going up.  Prices for sugar, butter, and vodka are actually going down.  The rate of exchange of the karbovanets against the Russian  ruble and the U.S. dolar has stabilized. It has not changed  since January.    I understand the sowing campaign is proceeding normally. We  have settled our debts with the countryside and the numerous  enterprises which sent their products to CIS countries last year  under a clearing agreement. We are abandoning that this year.  Accounts will be kept only in rubles or freely convertible  currency. Prices for the next crop of wheat, sugarbeet, and  sunflower have been fixed, as have prices for petroleum  products, fertilizers, and plant protection agents. We will be  granting credits for the sowing and harvesting campaigns solely  in the form of goods, not money, because monetary credits,  regardless of control, have vanished God knows where via the  commercial banks.    [Prokopchuk] Credits were surreptitiously converted into  dollars and landed in foreign banks. Will you be able to get  the money repatriated?    [Zvyahilskyy] Only credits worth 8.6 trillion karbovantsi  have been returned. Some $30 million for products sold last  year under state contracts have not been. That is without  taking account of what disappeared via commercial structures.  Henceforth, we are introducing flexible currency regulation; we  want to achieve through this a real correlation of prices for  basic kinds of foodstuffs here and among our main business  partners. We intend to determine precisely in terms of kinds of  produce that proportion of the currency which must be sold to  the state without fail. A plan to improve tax legislation hass  been outlined; it will be geared toward the interest of  manufacturers rather than traders.    All these measures should resolve the chief problem -- that  of ensuring the prompt repatriation of hard-currency export  earnings. A number of decisions were made recently to that end.  Under those decisions, all currency will pass solely through  one state bank. Top managers are trying to torpedo this  decision, but we are standing firm -- no licences or quotas will  be issued unless accounts are opened in the Ukreksimbank and  agreement is obtained for all export-import transactions to be  serviced by that bank. That will enable us to establish control  over currency transactions and introduce a system of liability  for the repayment of credits. I think that if we instil order in  this sphere we will have the wherewithal to pay for fuel  supplies from Russia.    I should talk, in particular, about our debts for gas. The  government has instructed the main gas consumers -- the Ministry  of Industry with its chemical and metallurgical concerns, and  the Ministry of Machine Building Industry -- to pay for it in  rubles or freely convertible currency, only on a prepayment  basis. This arrangement will also be introduced for other  consumers. The state will pay only for gas intended for  municipal and domestic needs.    Today we are caused many problems by the fact that  karbovantsi, rubles, and dollars circulate in parallel within  the country. We think that the state should have only one  national currency -- the karbovanets. This will above all raise  its exchange rate to a normal level and block off ways of  deliberately padding the dollar exchange rate. If we want to  block off the channel for currency speculation only the National  Bank and its branches should, in my opinion, buy and sell  currency.    [Prokopchuk] You have set your sights on what is the most  profitable business for commercial structures....    [Zvyahilskyy] I am under strong pressure for that reason.  Sometimes government decisions are blocked. We issue someone  currency, and it takes 15-20 days to reach the recipient. It is  daylight robbery. We are trying to do something, but there is  so much to do. I can see that it is time to put a stop to the  anarchy and total licence for which Ukraine was "famous" in  1992-93.    [Prokopchuk] But the enormous apparatus of the cabinet comes  under you.    [Zvyahilskyy] I do not know what will happen after the  election of the new parliament, but I am sure that the cabinet  needs to be restructured. It is clear that there will be  structural and cadre changes in it. I have been able to see  during my five months that the apparatus is not overburdened  with people willing to give their all in the defense of state  interests. A program has been adopted to make considerable cuts  in the strength of the administrative-managerial apparatus at  both central and local level. Incidentally, the first stage in  the cutting of the Army's strength by 92,000 will also start  this year.    In short, I am sure that these and other measures --  privatization and the restructuring of our energy-intensive  industry -- will clear up the lamentable consequences of the  "Ukrainianization of the economy" of past years. As far as the  forecasts of Ukraine's "collapse" are concerned, they will not  materialize. Our country has huge potential reserves. And we, I  am sure, like our friendly neighbor, Russia, will be able to tap  them for the good of our people.</p>

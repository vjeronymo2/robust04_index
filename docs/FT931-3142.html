			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Peace hopes hit by violence in Israel ONE Palestinian was killed and more than 60 suffered bullet wounds in Gaza yesterday as intensified violence in the occupied territories cast a deeper shadow over prospects for a resumption of Middle East peace negotiations. The mood in the occupied territories and Israel itself contrasts strongly with the upbeat assessment of the peace process provided by President Bill Clinton and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, after more than three hours of talks at the White House on Monday. A spokesman for Mr Rabin said he would be returning three days earlier than expected from the US in order to address the problem of worsening violence. The clashes yesterday between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops at the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza were said to be the worst since the outbursts which followed the deportation of 415 Palestinians by Israel to southern Lebanon in December. Palestinian negotiators insist they will not resume peace talks until Israel makes a public commitment not to resort to mass deportations. Mr Clinton said on Monday that the deportation issue had already been dealt with and had not featured in his talks with Mr Rabin. This further angered the Palestinians and Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the spokeswoman for the negotiating team, said it was a mistake for the US and Israel to think they could just push the issue to one side. In Gaza, doctors said that a 17-year-old boy died after being shot in the chest. At least 10 Israelis and 58 Palestinians have been killed since the upsurge in violence provoked by the expulsion of the 415 Palestinians.</p>

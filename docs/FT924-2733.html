			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Iraq bans range of imports IRAQ has adopted a severe austerity package to try to rescue the country from economic disarray. In what is seen as an attempt to conserve the country's depleted foreign currency reserves, save the Iraqi dinar, and curtail profiteering merchants, the regime is due today to implement a blanket ban on 146 imported consumer goods. Frenzied trading in Baghdad has been reported over the past few days with merchants selling the now banned commodities at knockdown prices to clear their shelves by the deadline which expired last night. A relief agency official in the city said: 'From early in the morning to late at night, thousands of people are buying and selling. A newcomer to Baghdad would never believe that the country is suffering under the economic embargo.' The ban includes a wide range of 'luxury items' such as cheese, canned vegetables, foreign cigarettes, frozen chicken, furniture and electrical equipment, and Christmas trees which are no longer permitted to be sold. Alcohol has been exempted from the ban. Earlier this year, 42 merchants were executed in Iraq for so-called 'economic sabotage'.</p>

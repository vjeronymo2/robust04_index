			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Technology: Fighting against the odds - A look at a UK government inquiry into why so few women take up careers in science The results of the UK government's first fundamental review of science and technology for more than 20 years will not be known until early summer when a white paper is published. But, already, there has been one potentially valuable spin-off: the setting up of the first government inquiry into why there are so few women working in science and technology, particularly at senior levels. The inquiry, which is operating under the aegis of the Office of Public Service and Science - part of the Cabinet Office - is chaired by William Stewart, the government's chief scientific adviser. Apart from Stewart, the committee is composed of women from various disciplines. Nancy Lane, a cell biologist from Girton College, Cambridge, has provided the impetus for the investigation and is the person responsible for drawing up the report on the findings. Already a member of the prime minister's advisory team on the Citizen's Charter, she was well-placed to suggest that the white paper address the question of women in science and technology - the inquiry is the result. As well as her research, teaching, and Citizen's Charter responsibilities, Lane is a non-executive director of Smith &amp; Nephew, the healthcare group. Her early post-doctoral experience was to be mistaken constantly for a secretary or technician. She says: 'I was never thought to be 'the scientist' because you couldn't be a post-doc if you were a girl - that was obviously impossible. Things have improved and there are now many more girls doing PhDs in the biological sciences. It's after that that they drop out,' she says. Figures she is gathering illustrate the point: in the biological sciences half of graduates and contract researchers are female but only 8.5 per cent of readers and senior lecturers and 3.5 per cent of professors are women. Out of 537,000 qualified engineers, fewer than 5 per cent are female. In maths and physics, a third of undergraduates and a fifth of graduates are female but fewer than 2-4 per cent of readers and senior lecturers and 1 per cent of professors are women. The lack of role models in senior positions has a negative effect, according to Lane: 'Girls must be encouraged to believe there is a potential career for them in science and that, to some extent, depends on there being more role models.' The old boys' network has a grip on the positions of power, Lane has found. 'When it comes to a name for a committee or a candidate for promotion, men rarely think of putting women forward. Sometimes, if you prick their consciences, they agree they should try to think of one. Any woman who actually makes it has done rather better than any man - she's got to be startlingly good to be appointed.' The National Health Service, with its central policy of women on every shortlist and interviewing committee, provides a model which might usefully be emulated elsewhere, she says, although she is anxious not to be seen as pre-empting her committee's findings. For women who want children, science as a career has its particular problems. Says Lane: 'In science you have to be in a lab doing experiments and that's incompatible with trying to work at home. Not many universities or companies have good creche facilities on site.' For women who decide to stop work while their children are young, Lane points out there is a re-entry problem. 'If you're a scientist you can't just come back in as a returner - you have to retrain because the field has moved on. You've got to learn new techniques which have been developed in your absence.' Academic scientists, if they take a break, have the added problem of gaps in their publications and sometimes even age bars. 'Some of the institutions, for example some of the research councils, have age limits for grants which work particularly against women,' she says. 'An age limit of, say, 30 might be fine for a man - he's got his PhD and a couple of years post-doctoral experience by then. But a woman, even if she hasn't had children, may have had to move jobs because of her husband's work and that may have disrupted her research and her publications.' Even for those women whose careers are not disrupted by marriage or children, Lane still considers there is evidence of an inferior career structure. 'Women are often given short-term research contracts, with perhaps money for one to three years. At the end of that time, you don't know what's going to happen to you. Very often women find they can't get proper funding.' Her committee's report will outline possible solutions to some of these problems. For example, the idea of 'benchmarks' could be put forward. Under these, organisations would state that by a particular date they would expect a certain proportion of posts at a particular grade to be held by women. Benchmarks are not the same as quotas, emphasises Lane. She has a horror of tokenism: 'Who wants to be doing a job and to be thought to have been given it only because you happen to be a woman?' Members of the committee on women in science and technology: William Stewart, chief scientific adviser; Nancy Lane, Girton College Cambridge; Ingrid Allen, Queen's University, Belfast; Jean Balfour, fellow Royal Society Edinburgh; Eileen Buttle, Natural Environmental Research Council; Patricia Clarke, vice president Royal Society; Agnes Kaposi, Women's Engineering Society; Anne McLaren, foreign secretary Royal Society; Eleanor Linton, Cabinet Office secretariat.</p>

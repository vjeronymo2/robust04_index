			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has commented on the  ruling on the electoral process issued by the Constitutionality  Court [CC] and on the implications of this ruling for the  current political situation:    [Begin De Leon recording] As for the resolution issued by  the honorable CC, I said from the very beginning when the amparo  was filed, that I would respect the independence of the state  branches. The role of the Executive Branch is over. In a state  of law in a legal regime, it is absolutely normal for a person,  institution, or group to adopt the corresponding legal actions  should he or it disagree with an action, resolution, or law.  That is how any citizen, such as this deputy, files a recourse.    At that time I said that I would respect the ruling issued  by  the CC, the top constitutional justice tribunal. That is just  what I did. At that time I also said -- and this can be  confirmed today -- that Guatemalans have great trust in one of  the most credible institutions in Guatemala, the CC. They also  trust the integrity, and above all, the  juridical-political-electoral capabilities of the honorable  magistrates who make up the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Given  the experience and knowledge of this organization, the  population was sure that the call for elections was based on  legal grounds. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Report highlights bogus job adverts CASES of bogus job offers are highlighted in the latest Advertising Standards Authority monthly report. A complaint by the Department of Trade and Industry was upheld against Worldwide Recruitment Services, which put an advertisement in a national newspaper suggesting that building work was available in Hong Kong. Respondents were required to pay a Pounds 10 administration fee. The DTI maintained that as an abundance of local workers was present in Hong Kong and China, such jobs would probably not be available to UK residents. The advertisers failed to respond to the authority's inquiries. The latest ASA report covers complaints against 63 companies.</p>

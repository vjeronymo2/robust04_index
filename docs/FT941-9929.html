			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Pressure on Italian bank ratings The long-term credit ratings of Italian commercial banks are under considerable downward pressure because of worries about the quality of bank assets, the US ratings agency Moody's Investor Services said yesterday. In a strongly pessimistic report on Italy's 280 commercial banks, Moody's said that they were suffering from poor asset quality, mediocre control of operating expenses, and pressure on margins between deposit and loan interest rates. Moody's said that the median long-term debt rating of banks had already fallen three notches from the Aa1 level of a year ago. Although the immediate cause was the lowered ceiling rating for Italy, it might have happened in any case. The Moody's report says that difficulties facing Italian banks due to domestic recession and exposure from rapid loan growth in the past few years are an extreme case of those experienced in other deregulated banking markets. The pessimism of Moody's assessment is likely to reinforce concerns over the effect on continental European banking systems of the prolonged recession. UK banks have already started to recover from similar problems. Moody's said that despite worries over asset quality, competition in the Italian banking sector was rising and deposit and loan pricing were coming under pressure. At the same time, expenses were being poorly-controlled, with the number of bank branches rising from 15,600 in 1989 to 20,800 in 1992 and reductions in staff numbers being largely offset by wages increases for the remaining staff. Moody's expressed concern about the consistently rapid increase in banks' assets, with an average rise of 15 per cent per year between 1988 and 1992. This asset growth was the main reason that banks managed to increase operating profits.</p>

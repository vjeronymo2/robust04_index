			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: The power behind Pechiney's Dunkirk smelter - An aluminium project that owes its conception to overgeneration of electricity IT STARTED with a convivial lunch-time conversation between two of France's most powerful industrialists. From that friendly chat was to spring one of Europe's biggest industrial projects in recent times, the Dollars 1bn Dunkirk aluminium smelter. One of the industrialists at that lunch, Mr Pierre Delaporte, president of Electricite de France, the state-owned power generation group, had a big problem. EDF, like other energy suppliers which need to forecast demand many years ahead, had miscalculated. It was going to have too much nuclear generating capacity in the early 1990s. EDF contacted some of its best customers, those with huge energy requirements, to see if something could be worked out with them. That is why Mr Delaporte sat down to lunch with Mr Jean Gandois, president of Pechiney, France's state-owned aluminium group. A modern aluminium smelter, producing about 250,000 tonnes a year, will consume as much electricity as a city the size of Sheffield or Lyons. Mr Gandois was already in an expansionist frame of mind. At the time of the lunch with Mr Delaporte, the autumn of 1988, he was secretly putting the final touches to a deal for Pechiney to buy American National Can, the world's biggest packaging company, for Dollars 4bn. His response to Mr Delaporte's overtures was equally audacious. 'Let's build a new aluminium smelter in France,' he suggested. Some would have dismissed this as a foolish proposition because all through the 1980s aluminium production had been steadily drifting from countries where energy costs were high to those with abundant, low-cost supplies - particularly countries with hydro-electric power. In that process nearly all of Japan's aluminium smelters closed down while new ones were built in Canada, South America and the Middle East. However, some European industrialists are worried about this growing separation of aluminium production and the main consuming markets. They suggest it makes the European industry more vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations (aluminium prices are usually quoted in US dollars) and say nobody can guarantee that the governments of the energy-rich countries will not develop Opec-type pricing policies for their aluminium sometime in the future. So Mr Gandois could not resist grabbing EDF's offer. There was a snag though. That low-cost power was available only for a few specific years at the beginning of the 1990s and Pechiney would have to act very quickly to take advantage of EDF's offer. Pechiney and EDF did some fast research and chose Dunkirk, near the coast across the Channel from Britain, for the site of the smelter. It is an area of high unemployment (more than 16 per cent) and close to an EDF nuclear power station. The proposed smelter was to cost about Dollars 750m and working capital requirements would take the total cash needed to about Dollars 1bn. Pechiney's balance sheet was also about to be burdened with the cost of American National Can so a complex financing arrangement for the smelter was worked out. Consequently, Pechiney controls 35 per cent of Aluminium Dunkirk, the company which owns the Dunkirk smelter. French and foreign banks and insurance companies hold the rest. Pechiney also has a one-third share in the company that operates the smelter with the rest of the equity shared by the ownership company and EDF. Pechiney is responsible for supplying all the smelter's alumina (aluminium oxide) - 400,000 tonnes a year of this essential raw material - and for selling the aluminium. When Mr Gandois told his technical people that Pechiney was to build a new smelter they said: 'Give us another 18 months or two years and we will have some fantastic new technology for you.' But he told them it was not possible to wait. The start-up of the smelter had to synchronise with EDF's period of excessive capacity. And, probably because every bit of technology employed at Dunkirk has been tried and tested elsewhere before on a commercial scale, the smelter was built and brought into operation in only 22 months, probably a record for a smelter on a greenfield site. That is not to say that Dunkirk's technology is old-fashioned. Apart from being Europe's biggest aluminium producer and third in the world outside the former Soviet Union, Pechiney claims leadership in sales of aluminium technology - two out of three new smelters built in the past 10 years have employed some of its technology. In aluminium smelting, the aim is to push as much electricity through the raw material as possible - the higher the amperage, the more metal can be produced. But this is a tricky business. The magnetic fields created by all this power can play havoc and create very dangerous conditions in the smelter if not properly controlled. Pechiney won many technical contracts because it was the first company to operate a pot line functioning at more than 280,000 amperes. At Dunkirk Pechiney has brought into operation the first complete set of electrolytic reduction cells (called pots in the trade) running on a direct current of 300,000 amperes. This technology makes the smelter the most productive anywhere in the world, Pechiney claims, with an output of 400 tonnes a year for each one of the 550 members of the workforce. This is made possible by the design of the pot conductor circuits, which are able to optimise the magnetic fields in the 'pad' of metal and thereby ensure its stability. Also, Dunkirk's 264 pots are in one long line rather than split into two or three lines as seen in other modern smelters. This not only keeps down capital costs but needs fewer people to operate the pots. Pechiney claims, too, that Dunkirk emits virtually no pollution. When Pechiney and EDF announced the smelter in November 1988, there was widespread suspicion it was possible only because EDF would be supplying electricity subsidised in some way by the French taxpayer. Some critics suggested the European Commission might veto the scheme. The commission's investigation certainly took some time but the partners pressed on with construction. They had spent Dollars 500m and still the commission was withholding its necessary blessing. Even though Mr Jacques Delors, the French president of the commission, was supportive, Pechiney and EDF only gained the necessary EC approval from Sir Leon Brittan, the Competition Commissioner, by undertaking that the proposed price of electricity to the smelter would be increased by 10 per cent in the three years from 1997. The commission said pricing before that three-year period was fair. The smelter's first pot started up in November, only 22 months after work started. On May 15 this year the smelter was running at its nominal full annual capacity rate: 215,000 tonnes. Mr Bernard Allais, the pot line manager, says it will be stabilised at this level for some months for some 'fine tuning'. Nevertheless, Dunkirk will produce 180,000 tonnes of aluminium this year and is breaking even at the operating level. Pechiney has closed two small smelters, at Riouperoux in the French Alps and Noguere in south western France, which between them produced about 80,000 tonnes. So Dunkirk represents an addition of about 135,000 tonnes to its annual capacity. Its total output this year is predicted to be 870,000 tonnes. Mr Gandois, pleased with the success of his venture, says the Dunkirk smelter proves there is still a place for big, heavy industrial projects in Europe. Others are not so sure. Mr David Morton, chairman of Pechiney's rival, Alcan of Canada, almost certainly has Dunkirk in mind when he says: 'One must question whether a crowded region like Europe should use so much of its energy resources to create the relatively few jobs available in an aluminium smelter.'</p>

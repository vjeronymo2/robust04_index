			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARTOON OPERAS  </P> <P> Martin Bernheimer's review ("Some Sonic Sendak at the Music Center," June 9) of  the two cartoonish operas current at the Music Center Opera, "Higglety-Pigglety  Pop!" and "Where the Wild Things Are," while typically (for Bernheimer) snide  and oh-so superior, misses what I consider the main objection to this  repertory.  </P> <P> Lest I create the impression I am a wizened reactionary, let me say that I'm in  my mid-30s and a relative newcomer to opera. But this season I did not purchase  season tickets. I have no interest in cartoons to music or tired musicals. Los  Angeles for many years had no indigenous professional opera. Now that we do,  couldn't they stick to the real thing?  </P> <P> DAVID STUDHALTER  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

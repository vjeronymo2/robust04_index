			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Arts: A long way from the Nile - Elijah Moshinsky's new production of 'Aida' at Covent Garden With its challenging lead roles and prohibitive demands for choral and scenic splendour, Aida is an opera that companies do not essay often. Failure in it can be both spectacular and costly, as the opera tempts the incautious into stagings that only end in boom or bust. The Royal Opera had a bad experience with it last time in 1984. This new production has been entrusted to Elijah Moshinsky, whose previous encounters with Verdi had shown him to be a safe pair of hands. Faced with a relatively small stage and a budget probably of the same proportions, he elected to try the bare stylish look in vogue in so many other recent productions. Moshinsky and his designer, Michael Yeargan, seem to have seen them all. An informed opera audience could spend happy hours spotting visual references that were striking elsewhere and (given the lack of anything else to exercise the mind) probably will. Do not expect pyramids or vistas of the Nile. An imposing curtain decorated with hieroglyphics is the only pointer towards Egypt, while the costumes are outlandish in every sense: the triumph scene looked like a United Nations convention attended by Arabs, Indians, assorted Africans and a few guests who had turned up in fancy dress. Without being told beforehand, one would be hard pressed to tell that this was a new production, so diffuse is its concentration. For all its pomp and show, Aida focusses intently on several of the themes most personal to Verdi: the tension between church and state, the dilemma of the individual forced to choose between private emotions and public duty. In the final act these opposing forces should generate such intensity that the characters seem torn apart from within. In fact, the only individual on whom Moshinsky gets a grip is Radames. In this production we watch his precipitous tumble from triumphant warrior hailed in a shower of gold to a grizzled, grey-haired, broken man, buried alive while the rigid Egyptian society which has condemned him carries on its daily routine above. Dennis O'Neill is no Pavarotti (the steely vibrato in the voice is an unappealing feature) but he has spontaneity, passion and guts. He delivered the goods. Singing her first Aida, Cheryl Studer signally failed to do that. This voice, which has excelled in so many types of music on disc, is essentially a lyric soprano, on the shallow side for the heavier Verdi roles. It was clear from the start that she wanted to make a lyrical (not a dramatic) Aida, spinning long Straussian vocal lines, but as the evening progressed her confidence seemed to slip away and her sense of pitch slipped with it. Later performances may find her in better form. Luciana d'Intino is a young and attractive Amneris, with a fondness for old-fashioned gestures. Her voice is firm, well-centred, just big enough at Covent Garden: she keeps strictly within her means, which would be admirable in any role but this, which asks for a singer who will let rip (as Cossotto did so memorably). Alexandru Agache makes a forceful, brutish Amonasro. Mark Beesley's King had trouble keeping in tune. A bald Robert Lloyd looks as if he is leading the local Hare Krishna group, but sang with gravity as Ramfis. His incitement to war failed to enthuse the chorus, whose cries of 'Guerra' were so tepid as to promise immediate surrender. Edward Downes is the conductor, who roused himself and the orchestra to more urgent action after the interval. Even so, this is a score of violent contrasts, of sounds wildly high and low, loud and quiet, harsh and soft, which he renders as a solid grey. A self-confessed Egyptologist assures me that, when translated, the hieroglyphics on that curtain read, 'Yes, bust again] Better luck next time'. Sponsored by P&amp;O. Further performances until July 22 (with changes of cast).</p>

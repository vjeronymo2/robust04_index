			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We solicited public comments on ProPAC's proposal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestions concerning the development of an exceptions or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeals process, if appropriate, for possible implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in FY 1995. We also solicited comments on a number of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues such as the feasibility of using road miles instead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of air miles, a process to verify hospital locations, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what the process should be to establish a wage index for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals. We stated that we planned to continue our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis of alternatives based on the current MSA based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system that have appeared promising in the past, and that we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planned to evaluate all potential labor market revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using the same basic criteria. Comments on these issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were due to HCFA by August 31, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In both the proposed and final rules for FY 1994, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated our intention to analyze the comments we received as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as to conduct the research we outlined. We also stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that we would continue to consult with ProPAC and study any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional information they developed. We stated our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intention to publish a proposal for formal public comment in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FY 1995 proposed rule if hospital-specific labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas based on the nearest neighbor concept proved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promising. We indicated that we would include information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describing all aspects of our proposal, and consider all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, before issuing a final rule for implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the May 26, 1993 proposed rule, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received a total of 266 comments on the nearest neighbor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index proposal, including 28 from national, State, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local organizations representing hospitals. In all, 33  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters were in favor of the nearest neighbors proposal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 128 were opposed and 105 were in support if changes were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made to satisfy their concerns. The areas of major concern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raised by the commenters were the redistribution of Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments that would occur if hospital-specific labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas were adopted, how the boundaries should be drawn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> around hospitals to define labor market areas, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nature and extent of an exceptions process. Several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters also had reservations about whether a hospital's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nearest neighbors were reflective of its labor market area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We discuss these and other issues below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Redistribution of Medicare Payments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Many commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were concerned about whether instituting hospital-specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor market areas would lead to major shifts in Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments at the same time that hospitals face an uncertain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial future because of the impact of health care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reform. One state hospital association noted that adoption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the nearest neighbors proposal would cause a major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redistribution of payments among rural hospitals, and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many hospitals that would be adversely affected were already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in precarious financial condition. Another state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association commented that the effects of the proposal on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hospitals in its State would vary greatly, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially increased payments to some hospitals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decreased payments to others. Many commenters suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that if we were to adopt the nearest neighbors proposal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some type of phase-in over several years would be essential.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definition of Labor Market Areas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Several commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that hospital characteristics such as size, services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offered, and case mix are a more reliable determinant of who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a hospital competes with for labor than who its nearest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neighbors are. One state association stated that its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis of the wage index computed under the nearest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neighbors proposal demonstrates that geographic proximity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not provide an accurate measure of the amount a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital must pay to compete for labor. Since there are a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wide range of options for defining hospital-specific labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market areas, many of the commenters suggested variations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depending on their perception of what new labor market areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should achieve. Some favored changing the size of labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market areas so as to increase payment to a particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital or type of hospital, while others favored defining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor markets in a way that would decrease the payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shifts that would occur under the options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to minimize the payment changes that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result from the wage index, some groups supported including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a larger number of hospitals in each labor market, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others supported limiting the size of labor market areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One state association asserted that both nearest neighbor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and fixed boundary labor market alternatives are problematic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because neither method allows a sufficient amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility for determining labor market areas. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association believes that it would be more accurate if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direction and distance of worker commuting patterns were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated into the determination of a hospital's nearest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neighbors. Another association stated that it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to identify a uniform approach that is equitable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for all areas of the country, and urged HCFA to consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using different methodologies in different regions as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. A national association stated that while the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nearest neighbors proposal has conceptual appeal, whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the association would support a nearest neighbor proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ultimately would depend on where HCFA draws the line around  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

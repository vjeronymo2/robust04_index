			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> HOT STOVE LEAGUE: The Rams (C1) are history and the weather (A1) is lousy, so  let's talk baseball. . . . With only 32 days left until spring training, some  Angels were working out Monday at Anaheim Stadium, but more were practicing  their swings at Western Hills Country Club in Chino, site of pitcher Bert  Blyleven's celebrity tournament. "The Rams had kind of the same season we had  with Oakland," Blyleven said, recalling the Angels' bid to beat the A's. "But I  think when you get that close, when you get a taste of it, it can carry you all  the way the next year." Steve Emmons and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

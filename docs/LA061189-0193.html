			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACCUSATIONS AND BIAS  </P> <P> Gail Buckley complains that "(Steven) Corbin's three black male characters are  lamentable in the extreme. Two are more or less homosexual. . . ." This  shockingly homo-phobic statement is an example of a biased and ignorant kind of  thinking that is itself much more "lamentable in the extreme" than the sexual  orientation of any person, whether fictional or not.  </P> <P> SIBYL MARSHALL  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P></p>

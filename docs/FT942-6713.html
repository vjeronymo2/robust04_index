			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Dollar struggles An upward revision in US first quarter GDP figures failed to bolster the dollar which finished the week at the same low levels where it started, writes Philip Gawith. Trade was fairly light ahead of the long weekend - US and UK markets are closed on Monday - and the dollar closed in London at DM1.6444 against the dollar from DM1.6438. Against the yen, it finished at Y104.400 from Y104.405. There was little movement in Europe, with the D-Mark finishing at FFr3.417 against the French franc from FFr3.418. Sterling again traded in tandem with the dollar, finishing virtually unchanged at DM2.4806 against the D-Mark and Dollars 1.5086 against the US currency. The upward revision in US first quarter GDP growth to 3 per cent from 2.6 per cent gave a midday fillip to the dollar. This was soon erased by reports of sales of dollars for Swiss francs. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of currency research at UBS in London, said this was simply a case of traders taking 'a flyer' in thin trading ahead of the long weekend. He said the market was trying to break through the key level of Sfr1.40 against the dollar. The UBS analyst said he remained of the view that the market was ignoring fundamentals. The key for the dollar, said Mr Chertkow, would come when US short-term interest rates rose above those in Germany. In the futures market, the December contract finished five basis points lower at 93.78, with 20,410 lots traded. The back months gave up more ground. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, said the longer end of the market had taken its lead from the gilts market where there had been a big cash seller. Euromark volumes were again good, with the December contract trading 48,000 lots. Sentiment was improved by comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, clarifying observations he had made earlier in the week suggesting that interest rate reductions were on hold. Mr Tietmeyer said he had been referring to official rates, with the repo rate still free to fall. The December contract continued its rally from the sell-off at the start of the week, closing nine basis points up at 94.88. In the UK money market the Bank of England provided assistance of Pounds 860m after forecasting a Pounds 900m shortage. Overnight money traded between 3 per cent and 5 1/2 per cent. German call money rates fell sharply as banks disposed of surplus cash holdings ahead of the weekend. Overnight money rates were quoted at 4.50/5 per cent from 5.15/5.25 per cent. Rates are expected to rise above 5 per cent after the weekend. The Greek drachma and the Portuguese escudo, both of which have been under pressure recently, had fairly quiet days. The escudo closed at Es104 from Es104.1 against the D-Mark, while the drachma was fixed firmer at Dr149 from Dr150.070 on Thursday. Buying pressure was seen at Es104, with unconfirmed reports that the Bank of Portugal was in the market. The central bank intervened on Thursday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 17 (XINHUA) -- The Clinton  administration asked Congress here today for special authority  to negotiate free trade agreements with Latin American countries.    Some of these countries have expressed the hope that they be  included in an expanded North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA) which links the U.S., Canada and Mexico.    With fast-track authority, sought by the administration when  negotiating NAFTA and the General Agreement of Tariffs and  Trade, the trade agreement negotiated by the administration  allows no congressional amendment.    Sources said bilateral negotiations between the U.S. and  Chile on the latter's joining of NAFTA will begin later this  year. Chile reportedly hoped the agreement can be concluded by  early 1995.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Question-and-answer portion of news conference by Ukrainian </F> President Leonid Krachuk in Kiev on 11 March -- live]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Danylo [surname indistinct], for  the journals PHILOSOPHICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL THOUGHT and EASTERN  ECONOMIST. Esteemed Mr. President, you have just returned from  an official visit to the United States. But there is no  official information as to your meeting on Sunday night in New  York with the management of the J.P. Morgan Group; for example  there is not a word on that in this press release. The group's  spokespersons did not confirm the report that you were there as  a private person. I would like to ask you, in this connection,  whether you could give official information as to specifically  who you spoke to, what the subject and the results of the  meeting were, and how it will help the state you have the honor  to be head of.    [Kravchuk] I already said that I held many meetings with  corporations, there was a meeting at the OPIC [Overseas Private  Investment Corporation], a meeting with a group of businessmen  led and organized by the Fund for Assistance to Ukraine's  Independence, and a meeting with the United States' largest  corporations, such as Johnson and Johnson, Pepsico, and other  very large companies. And all the discussions that concerned  our meetings were conducted along the lines of encouraging  investment in Ukraine. As reported in the U.S. and other press  by such people as the president of OPIC, they gave figures that  these corporations could invest considerable funds in Ukraine  that amount to billions of dollars, and that OPIC takes upon  itself the task of insuring these [investments] and other things.    That is to say that there were no secrets during the  meetings. As regards the fact that something might not have been  reported in greater detail, the president does not have private  meetings. This is obvious. There were no secrets because as a  rule correspondents were present at all of these meetings and  they were reported. Perhaps we did not receive something. This  is another matter. We reached an agreement with this body that  specific instructions would be issued after the meeting with our  Foreign Economic Relations Ministry and other corresponding  structures that would elaborate official documents with regard  to this large company participating in investment in Ukraine.  This was the main task.    [Unidentified correspondent] Esteemed Leonid Makarovych. You  often speak about the political consequences and bilateral  relations. You have just mentioned that the official visit to  the United States also had an influence on multilateral  relations with regard to our state. Please comment on Russia's  reaction to the success of your visit.    [Kravchuk] I would like you to take into account a minor  matter. There is the reaction from Russia and there is the  reaction from Russia's mass media. Russia's reaction is the  reaction of the president, the prime minister, and corresponding  structures. Regarding the reaction of the mass media, then this  is not a Russian reaction. As they say in Odessa, these are two  different things.    It seemed to me that the Russian mass media still regard  themselves as the central newspapers, as it used to be under the  USSR when they were divided according to rank: central,  republican, and local newspapers. They have not yet become  accustomed to the fact that they are Russian [newspapers]. They  consider themselves to be central. If they are central then  this gives them the right to be scathing about anybody, in  particular within the framework of the CIS. Regarding how they  do this and what terminology and methods they use, then this is  not my misfortune but the misfortune of those who write about it  and is evidence of their culture and diplomatic status. This is  what I think. I think it is improper for me to comment on  articles in the mass media. This is a matter for you.    [Correspondent Lelytska] Lelytska, press service of the  Congress of National Democratic Forces of Ukraine. Esteemed Mr.  President. Could the change in U.S. policy toward Ukraine be  interpreted as though Ukraine is already emerging from Russia's  sphere of influence; and the second question, Yuriy Meshkov, the  newly-appointed president of Crimea, is dismissing Ukrainian  journalists, and is also reducing Ukrainian TV and radio. Will  there be an official reaction from Kiev? Thank you.    [Kravchuk] I would like to stress something that I have  often  spoken about and stressed. Ukraine's relations with Russia have  a special status. We never -- in any case I, as president, and  the government -- spoken about reducing or lowering the status  or in some way reviewing our conceptual relations with Russia.  They could be friendly and based on partnership, and I am  convinced that will be the case, irrespective of the fact of how  events will develop. History leaves us with no other option. We  may only talk about how official Moscow and official Kiev are  considering these relations. We consider them to be equal,  friendly and based on partnership. I think that is how official  Moscow considers them to be and indeed how it should consider  them to be.    Regarding unofficial structures that exist in Russia, and  incidentally they also exist in Ukraine, they may interpret them  as they please. But this interpretation should only be accepted  as a basis for further discussion and analysis. But this is not  the official position of Kiev nor of Moscow. There should be an  appropriate rank and status for these assessments and  interpretations. For this reason we are not setting a task that  Ukraine now...[pauses] You said that it is under the influence  of Russia. I would like this to be a mutual influence: Russian  influence on democratic process in Ukraine and Ukrainian  influence on democratic processes in Russia. If that is how the  issue were to be put, and if we all understood it to be the case  then it would be to Russia's and Ukraine's benefit. I am deeply  convinced of this. There is no other alternative for us. Russia  is a great state, this is a real historic fact and it has its  own long-term interests, including in Europe and in Ukraine.  And for it to suddenly lose its...[pauses] It is simply  impossible for me, as the president of Ukraine, to interfere  with Russia's long-term interests. I can only hope that these  Russian interests and influences in Ukraine are positive, that  this influences democratic reform, market reform, stability,  partnership, and friendship. If this is the kind of policy then  it has a sense and good results, but if it is otherwise then it  is dangerous.    That is why our relations with the United States are not a  counterbalance to relations with Russia. I would like this to  be understood by everyone. Many people simply do not want to  think about this. I read the Russian mass media and it is  somewhat painful to read this when they do not understand simple  matters. We never said that we wanted to cooperate normally  with somebody to harm Russia. The contrary is true. I have  become convinced that the United States is most interested in  peace and accord between Russia and Ukraine. The United States  is most interested in this. But their interest depends on our  policies and on how we understand this in Ukraine, Kiev and  Moscow. If we understand that we are partners, that we are  historically doomed to be partners in friendship, then this  corresponds to the long-term strategic interests of both Europe  and the world. Unfortunately, I cannot say today that everybody  understands it in this way.    Well, I hope this is a formative period for the new  authorities in Crimea and its new power institutions. We know  from the first experience of establishing, for example,  presidential structures that paved their way for the first time  in our land and in the lands of the former Soviet Union, that  these are painful processes. Sometimes, people pursuing this  policy do not reckon with the real situation. I would not like  this kind of start, and we will protect the interests of not  only the media in Crimea, but the interests of all the people in  Crimea, their rights and freedoms. This accords with our  Constitution and our strategic political [word indistinct].    [Correspondent Heorhiy Chornomorskyy, in Russian] [Word  indistinct] Heorhiy Chornomorskyy. You were saying, Leonid  Makarovych, that the United States is granting us additional  financial aid. But Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk said  yesterday that we would have to pay this year's gas debts in  dollars. Will this aid suffice to settle our accounts by the  time the new bill arrives in April?    [Kravchuk] I understand. Nobody has ever given anybody a  loan to pay fuel debts. This is not envisaged by the  legislation of, in this case, the United States. Critical  import loans are a special kind of loans, there are critical  import loans, fuel import loans, loans on preferential terms,  and nonreturnable loans. These groups of loans were not  discussed. We discussed economic aid and aid toward nuclear  arms elimination. But I can tell you this, whatever loans we  may take, if our Ukrainian economy does not start working for  real, does not start earning money, be it dollars or marks, no  aid will help us. That is why we are aiming for start-up loans,  in order to give a starting boost to the movement toward the  market, privatization, stabilization of the finance-and-credit  system, thus to make the economy self-sufficient.    What do we have now? Ukraine, for its economy, its resources  and products is not a poor country. And yet we cannot earn hard  currency. Why? I will tell you why. We could sell our  products on the Russian market, that is not we, but our  enterprises. However, every enterprise must sell not just on  the market, but to another enterprise that they have a contract  or a long-term agreement with, an agreement they signed  previously. But Russian enterprises are out of rubles. You  know this. Therefore, we cannot sell out products and earn  these rubles to pay for fuel.    There is another way. We could sell traditional Ukrainian  products to Europe. What is traditional? I also call them  sensitive commodities. These are metal, metal goods, coal,  chemical products, textiles, etc, that is goods that were  traditionally sold to Europe. But we need quotas, which we do  not have. Thus, we are in this complex situation. We have  products, a labor force, a colossal potential, but we are unable  to make money. In Russia, there is no money, and here [in  Europe] there are no quotas.    There is another thing. After Ukraine and other states  declared their independence, the strategic long-term economic  policy in Russia was such that ministries were instructed to  duplicate the products previously imported from Ukraine. Thus,  many of those products are now manufactured in Russia itself.  Hence, the stance of those who say we need to restore the old  ties looks completely ill-considered. They are impossible to  restore. In order to restore the old ties we need to break the  ones we have now. We need new ties that would accord with the  interests of Ukraine and Russia, we must deepen them on the  basis of market reform and democratic change. Calls to restore  the old ties today is simply beyond reality.    Many people, by the way, fail to realize this, the fact that  a new situation has come to pass, both in Russia and Ukraine.  Now we need, on the basis of the interests and needs of the  Ukrainian and Russian economies and the population, to forge  contacts between enterprises, and those enterprises who had  already realized this made contact with one another without our  help, and are not demanding any help from the presidents. They  have found each other, and they are working, the only  complication being the payment situation. So, do not take this  aid to us as aid toward our payment for fuel. We must pay for  fuel with the help of our own economy. Yes, we need aid, but as  a start-up loan, or as critical import credits.    [Correspondent Kucherenko] Tamara Kucherenko, Radio Ukraine  World Service. Esteemed Mr. President. During your U.S. visit,  you met official representatives of the IMF and World Bank. How  successful were these meetings? Did you talk about any specific  programs in support of economic reforms in Ukraine? What  specific financial resources can we count on, and are there any  financial agreements to this effect? Did you discuss a  stabilization fund for our national currency, if yes, what did  you manage to achieve?    [Kravchuk] Even before the visit, back in January, our  economic delegation led by Economy Minister Roman Shpek visited  the United States and conducted extensive work with the IMF and  its experts, and the World Bank. The World Bank and the IMF  experts also worked in Ukraine. We are greatly helped in this  matter by Mr. Kaufman, a World Bank representative who is  working in Ukraine. One week before the visit, our delegation  made up of the same people visited the United States and again  worked with international financial organizations. And we  managed to work out all the sections of a government and IMF  program. There are about five of them. At issue now is putting  all these sections into a single program. This program should  be completed in the near future.    As I gathered from conversations with the representatives,  the director, and the president of the World Bank and the IMF,  there are grounds for saying this agreement is a positive one.  As soon as the program is agreed, we can count both on credits  and on a stabilization fund. Thus, at the end of March we  should be able to say that this program has been completed and  agreed on both sides, the government of Ukraine and these  international organizations.    [Correspondent Kudryn] Mykhaylo Kudryn, EKSPRESS-KHRONIKA,  Moscow, and RESPUBLIKA agency, Kiev. Pardon me, this is about  our Ukrainian affairs. Recently, you have been saying in  interviews for numerous media, particularly the SPIEGEL magazine  and a group of freelance journalists led by Ihor Storozhuk, as  well as in the United States, that if the election fails to take  place on 27 March we are in store for a power vacuum. But the  Supreme Council statement of 25 February says there will be no  power vacuum, since the present Supreme Council will preserve  its constitutional powers and will be active until March next  year. Let me ask, who are we to believe, you, the popularly  elected president of Ukraine, or our dear Supreme Council also  popularly elected, or do we believe nobody at all? Thank you.    [Kravchuk] Well, first of all, whenever I speak about this  issue I never say that it is precisely how it will be. I say,  there could be a power vacuum. You accurately laid stress on  this. I will give you an example, there is a constitution  standard and this is how it really is. Until a new Supreme  Council is elected, the old Supreme Council carries out its  functions. But I ask myself, and in order not to offend  anybody, let us take Mykola Khomenko, secretary of the  president's administration, who is a deputy in Konotop electoral  district, and on 27 March they elect Sydorenko instead of  Fomenko [word indistinct]. One was elected under the Soviet  regime when Ukraine was part of the USSR under that electoral  law, and this one will be elected on 27 March, and he will be  given authority by the Electoral Commission that there were no  violations and that he was elected in accordance with the law.  Which deputy do I consider to be more important? Do you  understand? [passage omitted]    After this, the situation could worsen considerably, because  [assume] there is no new Supreme Council, and new deputies have  already been elected in place of the old ones. Assume they also  come to Kiev and they ask: What are we to do? This is what I am  talking about. How long will these elections go on for? Will  they be finished immediately on 27 March or will they continue  for two weeks or even longer. This period could be  significantly complex. I am simply making a prognosis. I would  like people to realize what this means. When I call on them to  vote, I am doing it willingly because firstly, I know that it is  an important stage and secondly, because no democratic country  can consider itself really democratic if parliament and the  freedom of political parties are absent from it. This is not a  democratic state. I understand the difficulties, economic  problems, etc. but voters must understand that they must elect a  new Supreme Council. I do not want to predict now what type of  parliament it will be, or how many democrats or partocrats will  be there. I do not want to analyze this situation now. I want  to say only one thing: We need a new parliament that would  represent Ukraine on the basis of a new electoral law and  freedom etc., as a democratic state.    Regarding the elections that follow, this is another  problem.  I have already told you about them. Let us say, what kind of  president will be elected? One that is set out in the  Constitution, as the present one who is head of state and of the  executive power with his powers, or another kind of president?  There is no law.    Next point. What sort of powers will the elected head of the  council at town, village, rayon, and oblast level have? What  sort of relations will he have with the center, the president,  and the government? Which law governs his powers and functions?  There is no law.    There is, therefore, a danger that somebody could be elected  tomorrow over whom the voters have no real influence. It will  depend, therefore, on the individual who may or may not  understand the situation. Since individuals vary one cannot  count on understanding. It is necessary to clearly indicate  this in law. Because I am saying this, it does not mean that I  am defending my interests. I am describing the real situation  so that the people and the mass media understand it, so they do  not look for pitfalls, but see the real situation and the  dangers for Ukraine if we really feel for Ukraine, not in words  but in deeds.    [Correspondent Lemin] Olha Lemin, VYBIR information agency.  The presidential elections are taking place at the same time as  local elections. What do you mean that the presidential  elections and local elections should be slightly delayed? If  you did not mean this, then who will make the decision for the  local elections to be held separately from the presidential  elections?    [Kravchuk] I said both together. I do not separate the  presidential [elections] and the local power bodies. The way I  see it, is that the parliament adopts the appropriate laws with  regard to the president and the local power bodies, clearly  delimits their powers and functions, their rights, obligations  and relations in detail, and sets this out in the constitution  because this is the power. We have an example of two laws being  adopted about the presidential representative and the local  organs of power, and if these provisions had not been written in  the Constitution...[pauses] You are aware that during every  session somebody says: This is unconstitutional. This is  reality. Power should be written into the Constitution. It is  obligatory. This is why I am saying that two laws should be  adopted, first one and then the other. They should both be  elected. When? When the law is adopted. We cannot first elect  them then pass a law. [passage omitted] I am not dividing them.  I want them to be elected at the same time but only after laws  are passed. This is an obligatory norm.    [Unidentified correspondent] Japanese TV and Radio  corporation [word indistinct]. Could you tell us, Mr.  President, whether Ukraine plans to dismantle all of its nuclear  weapons, and what the prospects are for getting real security  guarantees after their elimination.    [Kravchuk] According to the trilateral agreement, Ukraine  will dismantle all of its nuclear arms. Incidentally, START I,  which the Supreme Council has ratified, and Paragraph 5 of the  Lisbon Protocol reservations on which have been lifted, imply  precisely that -- elimination of all nuclear arms. According to  the bilateral agreements, in particular those with Russia,  Ukraine will abide by its commitments provided other states do  the same and abide by their commitments, without creating  complications during the period of eliminating nuclear arms. We  must find ways to solve the most complex issues without putting  brakes on this extremely important process for the entire world  and all the people.    As for security guarantees, the United States, Russia, and  other states have given their consent for such guarantees, and  this is no longer any problem. Our ministry is currently  working on a relevant mechanism to determine whether it will be  a statement or an agreement, who will sign it and what its  content will be. But we also realize that both Russia and the  United States tie the provision of security guarantees in a  documented form with the ratification of the Non-Proliferation  Treaty [NPT], although, by lifting the reservations as to the  Lisbon Protocol, Ukraine has committed itself to joining the NPT  as a non-nuclear state. It is a commitment and not mere words,  but the NPT has to be ratified. Relevant documents have been  submitted to the Supreme Council, and we will work persistently  together with the ministry and the Cabinet of Ministers in order  to gradually push it through and work this problem out.    I am convinced that Ukraine will, in accordance with its  obligations and the conceptual principles it declared, act  consistently in this sensitive global area. This is a long-term  and fundamental policy for our state.    [Correspondent Zavytskyy] Myroslav Zavytskyy, NASHE SLOVO  and  ZA VILNU UKRAYINU newspapers. Esteemed Mr. President. The  world views Ukraine with great hope as a factor of stability in  (?this) part of Europe. But will the polls, which (Parnishkov)  and his colleagues from Donetsk and Lugansk intend to conduct,  not have negative consequences for this stability and for the  preservation of Ukraine's unity?    The second question, essentially a domestic one: How long  will the attendants at the president's palace and other  government structures address visitors in languages other than  Ukrainian? Thank you.    [Kravchuk] Well, one could reply to the second question  formally thus: that in our law on languages of the Ukrainian  SSR, as you remember, five years were given for people to be  addressed thus. The five years are not up yet. But in this case  I am against these five years. I believe that individuals in  Ukraine can communicate in any language. That is their right.  But as far as officials are concerned, and on official  premises, then this should be in Ukrainian. This is the norm of  any state. Well, whoever does not do this, perhaps he didn't  have enough time or intelligence or the talent to master the  Ukrainian language. Or perhaps he has simply forgotten about  this law. We will remind them of it. But if you tell me the  names, I could remind them more precisely.    Now, with regard to the first question about the poll that  is  being conducted. Well, I knew that this issue is an acute one,  and so I have already brought something here. I knew that this  question would be asked without fail, especially as edicts have  already been signed by Crimea's president. That is, at issue  there is a poll of three questions in President Meshkov's edict.    The first one: Are you in favor of renewing the clause in  the Republic of Crimea's constitution, which was there back in  May 1992, regulating relations between Crimea and Ukraine on the  basis of treaties and agreements? That is the first question.  The second: do you favor the Republic of Crimea's citizens  having the right to dual citizenship? And the third: are you in  favor of edicts from the Republic of Crimea's president on  issues unregulated by legislation having the force of law?    Well, I will simply remind you that this was already in the  Republic of Crimea's constitution in 1992. It was there. For  example, if one takes the first issue, there was this formula of  6 May 1992 in these words: The Republic of Crimea is part of  the state of Ukraine and determines its relations with it on the  basis of treaties and agreements.    But then on 25 September 1992, after Ukraine submitted a  request to the Supreme Council to bring its Constitution in line  with Ukraine's Constitution, it was noted thus: The Republic of  Crimea is part of the composition of Ukraine and determines its  relations with it on the basis of mutually agreed legislative  acts and agreements. That is, these issues were in the  constitution. Crimea's Supreme Council withdrew them and  brought them into line with Ukraine's constitution.    Now, by means of a referendum -- consultative referendums  and  referendums are envisaged there in the law on referendums of the  republic of Crimea. Polls are not envisaged. But a poll is  possible in a resolution by Crimea's Supreme Council. Well,  clearly it has no legislative or legal force. We are currently  studying this issue. Our group of lawyers is studying it. That  is, in whatever aspect it appears, it has no legal force. This  is, well, an important element.    It seems to me that it would be better to wait until  Ukraine's constitution is adopted and act so that the interests  of all regions are taken account of most fully in the  constitution, and not to push people toward, say, confrontation,  to an exacerbation of the situation. This is not a noble  matter, but nobility is a relative concept. And the law, which  is adopted, has legal force, and we will be guided namely by the  law in our actions, and not by moral norms, because they are not  noted, for example, in the legislative regulation of these  problems. I expect that we will find a resolution of this  issue. If it creates conflict, say, our services study it and  come to this conclusion, then we will try to find a mutually  acceptable resolution. But one thing is clear, whatever the  outcome, it will not have legal force.    [Correspondent Tykhyy] Esteemed Mr. President. Serhiy  Tykhyy, UNIAN agency. Esteemed Mr. President: It is well known  that one of the fundamental conditions for investing in the  economy of another state is political and economic stability.  If one is to proceed from your statement about your refusal to  stand in the June presidential elections, and also your  arguments for this stance, and also that which has been said at  this press conference today, it is too early at the moment to  speak of stability in Ukraine. In this connection my question  is this: What arguments and what guarantees did you use in your  conversations with your U.S. interlocutors to persuade them to  invest funds in Ukraine's economy? Thank you.    [Kravchuk] Well, in general to speak of some kind of serious  stability in the transitional period -- from one life to  another, from one society to another, from one economic system  to another, and the political system, and the spiritual belief  system, and the spiritual view of those problems -- is probably  not easy. But everyone sees that in spite of all this in this  time we in Ukraine have won independence without conflicts, that  we are working without some kind of confrontational encounters,  where blood is shed, where people shoot and kill.    That is, I can say absolutely that we have peace and calm in  Ukraine. And this is the most important sign of stability. But  such stability as is connected with forming bodies of power  cannot be identified, for example, if there is a president, then  there is stability; if there is no president, then straight away  there is no stability; if there is a Supreme Council, there is  stability; if there is no Supreme Council, there is no  stability. At issue is a vacuum of power. This is what it is  about.    This is why I say: If a situation arises whereby this vacuum  becomes a reality, then the president should be highly  responsible, for he has been elected by the people, and he  cannot run for election at this time. Well, what sort of a  president is it who stands for election in these circumstances,  tell me please. He would then have put himself on a par with  the other contenders.    Say, for example, the Supreme Council had not been formed.  Accordingly the government, the new government with a new  program, similarly to the Supreme Council, had not been formed  -- and the president runs for election. Then all the bodies of  power in the localities run for election. This is what is at  issue.    That is why I say that at this time I, if these steps have  not been taken, if the Supreme Council has not been elected and  if the government has not been formed, then the Supreme Council  (?sets to work), it produces a program, it appoints a new  government, together with the president naturally, at least in  accordance with the current constitution. The government  assumes power. One might even manage to adopt a law on the  Cabinet of Ministers. Then there is a Supreme Council, there is  a Cabinet of Ministers, its powers and relations have been  determined. Then one can take the next step. This is what it  is about.    I do not want you to connect, well, some kind of  exacerbation  of instability namely with this. This will not be. After all  there is a president. And he has responsibility. There are  bodies of power in the localities. This is the most important  thing. There are deputies of the current composition of  parliament, who can still assemble before 27 March, and if the  good will is there, as they say, resolve these questions too.  Why not? If there are laws, they can be adopted. That is, one  cannot say that we are now in a dead-end. There are realistic  possibilities. They should be made use of.    But I convinced, well, how did I convince my, say, partners?  I related to them the true situation, which exists in Ukraine.  Incidentally, they know about it very well. One cannot say now  that the situation in Ukraine is worse than in other regions. I  can say absolutely that it is not worse, and in many cases  better even. I would only wish that all of us together  understood it thus, all together. Because some understand that  this Ukrainian, this political striptease, is the biggest  victory for those who write or speak. I think otherwise.    [Correspondent Skachko] Volodymyr Skachko, NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA. Mr. President, when arguing your refusal to run in the  election, you said that you were offended by deputies, by the  press, which supposedly badgers the president, who has been  elected by the people. So this is my question: on the scales of  history whose outrage is worse, yours at the press and deputies,  or that of the people, who are still waiting for economic  reforms? That is, to put the question more specifically: to what  extent has your "Five D's" program been implemented? This is  the first thing.    Second: I would simply like to draw attention to the fact  that such a thing has never occurred in this hall before -- news  conferences always were held live. People simply came and wrote  their names down and conveyed information. This time Comrade  Ivanyn (?simply) pushed to one side a whole lot of journalists  and brought in those whom he believes are of his opinion. So I  would simply like to tell both your press secretary and you that  if he wanted to do something for your image in this way, it is  simply not done in this way.    [Kravchuk] I do not know what you mean on the second point.  I understand this question as an observation to our press  service that it should take account of your wishes for some kind  of record, you understand, I cannot even imagine what you are  talking about. What record? A record of what? I do not  understand this. But if you have a question in the hall, then  you can put any question you like. Raise your hand and I will  ask you to raise it, and I do not think that this is a problem  for our hall. We can debate for as long as you have the  strength, and I will have sufficient strength. That is the first  thing.    The second thing: I did not say that I was offended. I  always emphasize that in politics one should never take offense  at anyone. One can only be offended by close people, by those  with whom we have some kind of mutual relations. But in  politics taking offense is out of place. I am talking about  something else -- that Ukraine can become a phenomenon, first,  in how our own home-grown lords are undressing their own Ukraine  in public, and consider this to be an achievement.    Second, I said that Ukraine could become a phenomenon of the  consolidated boorishness in relation to the president elected by  the people, namely boorishness. Because the Ukrainian language  is very rich in words, in intonations, and in accents. Culture  means that one can make use of this to express everything one  needs to -- whether to the president or to anyone else. I said  that I am not going to compete with anyone in boorishness  because I know in advance that I am doomed to defeat. Because I  know the capabilities of those, who are competing in this. I  know their capabilities. Especially as I have never set myself  the task, and will never set myself the task of shutting someone  up.    If he has a pen, and Ukraine has given him the freedom of  speech, namely independent Ukraine, before speaking one should  think about whom this benefits. I always say that before taking  any political decision or writing -- if you have children, come  home in the evening, sit them down opposite you and look into  their eyes and listen to what is happening -- refugees, death,  blood, -- and then write, then call on people to act.    It is namely this that I was talking about. I am convinced  that no nation, no people, in the person of its intelligentsia,  in the person of its elite, to which incidentally journalists  belong, and whom I sincerely respect, will not become famous by  being boorish or disrespectful to persons who have been elected  by the people. They can face elections again, they can be, say,  if they are involved in crime or something, there are  appropriate bodies to deal with this. But there is no need  whatever to compete in this. I advise you not to make use of  these methods, because history has its own ways. (?Everything)  that is written is to be remembered and submitted to the  archives. Each person will be answerable to history, and for  culture and for everything which has been done, and for the five  D's, and for the six Ds, and for the three Ps, and will be  answerable for everything.    [Correspondent Veresen] Mykola Veresen, BBC. I would like to  ask two questions to clarify details. What will the president  of Ukraine, that is, you, do in the event that the Russians do  not compensate for the missiles, which have already gone to  Ukraine. As far as we understand, as far as I understand, there  was to be a simultaneous crossing of the border by missiles on  the part of Ukraine, and fuel elements, or compensation, on the  part of Russia. Second, what will you do if Crimea separates  despite everything -- because there is going to be a poll on the  27th and they will have grounds to leave Ukraine. The mood  there is that the majority of people do not want to belong to  Ukraine.    [Kravchuk] I will start from the second question. I have  read the questions to you. There is nothing there about what  you are saying with regard to separating. The issue is dual  citizenship and in what sort of composition the Republic of  Crimea finds itself in Ukraine. On the contrary. There is  nothing about separating. So that is not at issue. I cannot  say on the basis of these three questions, which I expressed for  you -- here they are -- that the poll is about separating. That  is not there. Therefore, we will not speak about this. I am  talking about the legal and lawful force of this, say, edict,  which in this case we are studying, in relation to Ukraine's  constitution and in relation to the law on the delimitation of  powers between Ukraine and the republic of Crimea. This is the  only area in which I can comment.    Well, we have concluded an agreement with Russia -- it has  been signed -- on compensation for the weapons, which have been  taken out of Ukraine -- missiles are not taken out, warheads are  taken out -- on respective compensation for uranium, which is in  the form of fuel elements and fuel assemblies for Ukrainian  nuclear power stations. This will be implemented. However, if  one side suddenly ceases to implement it, then the other side  will cease to implement it as well. This is a normal  phenomenon; this is how it will be, but I do not expect it to  come to this. We should work at it because this is in the  interests of everyone -- Ukraine and Russia and the whole world.  One cannot stop this process, say, by some unwise decision.  Whoever is the first to make this decision will bear all of the  historial responsibility for this.    [Makarovych] Leonid Makarovych, (?INTERFAX-Ukraine). Tell  me, please, what your attitude is to the possibility of the  Russian joint stock company Gazprom being given the controlling  package of shares in the flotation of Ukrainian gas pipelines  and gas repositories on Ukraine's territory? This proposal was  made yesterday at the talks in Moscow. Thank you.    [Kravchuk] I know that we have long been discussing this  issue on the flotation of, for example, our enterprises in  Ukraine, including oil processing enterprises, and on setting up  an appropriate Ukrainian corporation, for example Ukrnaftohaz  [Ukrainian oil and gas]. This issue is also being raised.  Setting up such a corporation and setting up joint stock  enterprises, which will be part of this corporation -- this  issue is being analyzed and documents are being elaborated. The  issue is that the Ukrainian side must have the controlling  package of shares without fail. This is an indispensable norm.  We will not agree to another.    [Makarychenko] Leonid Makarychenko, Intelnews agency.  Esteemed Leonid Makarovych, I would still like to get a more  precise reply to the question of whether the movement of fuel  for Ukraine's nuclear power stations in the reverse direction,  from Russia, has begun. Second, will your accord with Russia and  the United States, your dialogue, allow a market to open to  Ukrainian enterprises for conventional armaments? Third,  Ukraine's space program -- the carriers, which launch space  ships, can also easily launch other loads. Will these  limitations not concern space programs?    [Kravchuk] Well, we have just taken out 60 warheads. So,  this is not yet such a, say, large amount that one can talk  about a reverse movement. We are to take out 200 warheads by  May, the end of May. An appropriate scheme is being elaborated.  I stress that the agreement, which has been concluded and signed  by Ukraine and Russia, envisages this -- that is, whenever this  may be, for example, in one week or in two, but it is envisaged.  This does not mean that fuel assemblies meet nuclear warheads,  greet each other, and go their separate ways. There should be a  certain time, but this is envisaged in the agreement. That is,  both in the trilateral statement and in the documents affixed to  it this is envisaged. Noone, neither Russia nor Ukraine, have  refused to do this. That is, this will be carried out.    I have already stressed to you that we submitted a draft  document to the United States on cooperation in the sphere of  space technology. In our conversations, and also at the  Pentagon, we found support for participation by the United  States. Prior to this we also had appropriate consultations and  relations with French managers about the possibility of  cooperation in the sphere of space technology, taking into  account that this is, well, highly developed here, as we say,  both the construction of the rockets themselves and the systems  for controlling the rockets.    Approximately...[pauses] not approximately, but on 22 March  a  delegation from the United States will come to Ukraine. It is  headed by [U.S. Defense Secretary] Minister [William] Perry, and  these issues will be further elaborated. That is, we have put  them on the agenda, and we will elaborate them. That is, this  is not being taken off the agenda. We want our rocket  technology, our experience, our, say, priorities here, to be  made use of not only for the benefit of Ukraine, but for the  possibilities of other states. The United States and other  countries have an understanding attitude to this.    What else did you ask? [Makarychenko's reply indistinct] We  did not discuss this issue in the United States with anyone.    [Krushko] Ihor Hrushko, HOLOS UKRAYINY. Leonid Makarovych, I  have one question for you, which is important in my opinion,  which my colleagues have not considered. As is well known,  during the trilateral talks in Moscow the question of  compensation to Ukraine for the tactical nuclear weapons, which  were taken out of Ukraine, was also raised. The question was  raised, but as far as I know, it has not been resolved yet.  Please tell me, when you were in Washington, did you discuss  this with the American President?    [Kravchuk] We discussed this with the Russian side and in  this agreement, which I mentioned has been initialled and is to  be signed on the part of Russia and Ukraine by their respective  governments, such compensation is envisaged, and it is envisaged  as a whole. All of this is noted in this document.    [Verchuk] Mr. President, tell me, did people go to the  United  States with you who are capable of creating competitive  production or were they mainly intermediaries? For we can get  out of the economic crisis only when we begin to produce  competitive products. Stepan Verchuk.    [Kravchuk] Well, products are produced by people. These are  workers, engineers, designers. These people did not go with me,  because there are 52 million such people in Ukraine in all.  Ministers and advisors came with me. They do not produce  products, but that Ukraine can produce competitive products is a  real fact. [passage omitted]    That is, there are colossal possibilities in Ukraine for  going over to the best competitive products. However, you see  the situation that has arisen. All of these products were  produced on the basis of raw materials and energy-carriers,  which came from other states, but now prices have gone up  thousands of times. We have ended up in a difficult situation.  [passage omitted] Everything has to be reformed. The structure  has to be changed. We have to make what we have the  possibilities for and find our niche on the world market, in  Europe and America.    Incidentally, our agreements envisage all of this, that  goods  will move and that there will not be, say, these various customs  hindrances, or dual taxation. That is, all of this is  envisaged. Time is needed. [passage omitted] We have to take on  board experience; we have to work. The main thing is that all  are convinced that only by working can the problem be shifted.  There is no other way. Not a single country has yet resolved  its problems without people beginning to work in an organized  and qualified way, making use of their own possibilities. There  is no other way.    [Unidentified correspondent] POLITYKA I CHAS [POLITICS AND  TIME]. Esteemed Mr. President, we have received information  that part of the money that Washington will give us for economic  assistance will be spent on purchasing grain or soya. Would it  not be more expedient to buy progressive technology with this  money? I understand that noone in the United States is going to  sell us anything very good, because at the same time if they  give us the opportunity to sell our natural resources, they will  lose a market, the Russian market. But are work and searches  under way in this direction, for example, among the Ukrainian  diaspora in the United States, in that agricultural country  Argentina, for example, where Ukrainians play a large role in  agriculture, because this is a very topical issue? [passage  omitted]    [Kravchuk] Well, this money will not be spent on purchase  of grain. This money includes 352 million for nuclear arms  elimination and 350 million to solve our economic problems  having to do with, first of all, know-how, structural reform,  privatization, and other factors. The issue about granting us a  credit to buy pesticides and [word indistinct] is dealt with  separately but it does not concern grain. What is special about  these credits is that they take account of everything: If we  are allowed, say, 150 million this year for nuclear arms  elimination, we must decide together where this money should be  channelled to, whether more could be channelled toward fuel  processing, the dismantling of a part of the infrastructure, the  elimination of warheads, missiles, and other areas. We also,  however, have a problem with conversion, a problem with housing  for officers, a problem with social security. During our talks  at the Pentagon and with the secretary of defense, we emphasized  the need to use more money for these purposes, to ensure social  stability. Thus, this money is for a specific purpose.  [passage omitted]    [Kurbas, in Russian] Oleksiy Kurbas, KOMMERSANT UKRAINY. The  new credits will be granted to Ukraine on condition that market  reforms continue. Meanwhile, our government has won a  reputation of being against reforms. Can we expect, therefore,  any changes in the cabinet in the near future?    [Kravchuk] Well, this is not the case of a new government  coming to power and making itself a reputation. Many of the  present members worked under former Prime Ministers [Vitold]  Fokin and [Leonid] Kuchma. Incidentally, this government  inherited all the members of the previous one, formed by Leonid  Danylovych [Kuchma] together with the Supreme Council, and I do  not deny my own hand in this. However, one can say this: If  you take the current reforms -- say, privatization -- and  measure them then you will see that real privatization has only  just begun, I mean real, not verbal, privatization. For  example, recently the Kramatorsk heavy machine-building plant  was privatized.    I was asked today by representatives of the West, what are  the criteria? What will be the next step? I will tell you:  There are dozens of appeals in my daily mail coming from  directors, who are often labelled red directors, saying that  they want to have their enterprises privatized. Just a year ago  nobody wrote this. On the contrary, they wrote: What are you  doing? Where are you leading us? But now they write: Permit us  to privatize. These are former leaders, Communists, labelled  red and other labels. This is what they say now. Life itself  leads an individual toward certain steps. If we are planning to  privatize over 30,000 small, medium-sized, and large enterprises  this year, and this has already begun to happen, this is real  privatization, and these are real reforms.    We are talking about a certain extent of stabilization in  the  finance-and-credit system and a drop in inflation. I am not  about to talk of great successes. I am afraid to. However, in  January inflation was already 19 percent, and in February, 20  percent. If you compare this to last year's, it is poles apart.  I am not saying these are great successes, but you can see that  something is breaking through and taking shape. Something new  is being born, something old is dying, and something of the old  is still holding on. Of course, I would like to see land reform  gain pace. I would like other processes in the bank and credit  system to gain pace. However, you cannot force them; otherwise  you would have to use administrative methods, use force. People  need to mature for this.    Take land reform, for example. It is a very painful issue.  I recently returned from Lithuania where I spoke to President  Brazauskas. The most serious problem for them today is the  problem of the countryside, because they declared reforms in the  countryside, gave land to the people, and now the people say,  take it back. To take the land, one needs to have an  infrastructure, not only for production but to know to whom and  when to sell it, how to pay, to have mini-technology, and to  know where to buy pesticides and mineral fertilizers, in order  to be on the market. If you do not have all this, you can only  declare reforms. You will end up killing the countryside,  because it is not that simple. I do not think we can look at it  this way: If we declare reforms today, they will take off  tomorrow, because, whatever criticism you may fire at the  Supreme Council, it did pass a privatization program for 1994  the same way it approved anti-inflation measures. People change  under the pressure of life, and reforms will take off. There is  no alternative to that. We will not build socialism in one  country, Ukraine. That is a fact, and everybody understands it.  [passage omitted]    [Rudenko] SVOBODA newspaper, Raisa Rudenko. Do you believe  that the improvement in relations between Ukraine and America  will affect Ukraine's nation-building? Do you see it posing any  threat to Ukrainian sovereignty?    [Kravchuk] How should one analyze this? If you analyze it  from the point of purely Soviet Communist mentality, it would  look like this: If a country is suddenly helping us, look  deeper. If people interpreted the favorable attitude of the  United States, its friendly attitude toward Ukraine, its  willingness to help, like that, it would make one think.  Because I remember the times when one was made to think that if  any country is treating you well, you must look for some  underlying reasons. However, I think those times are a thing of  the past, and the majority of people understand that without the  assistance of large countries, without their favorable attitude  it is practically impossible to build an independent Ukraine.    A very important factor to me is the fact that the U.S.  President said without reservation that he respects Ukraine's  sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and that  this is something to be reckoned with. This was also said in  other documents and statements. This was said in the trilateral  statement signed in Moscow. Thus, I would like to say, if those  who think that holding onto nuclear weapons one cannot use is a  guarantee of security, continue to think so, then I guess they  cannot think otherwise, they are doomed.    It is clear now that only with help, with support, with  guarantees and good relations with the neighbors within the CIS  and beyond we can build an independent Ukrainian state. If only  we cna also come to terms among ourselves. [passage omitted]    Therefore, I am convinced that these kinds of relations are  the only guarantee, provided we work ourselves, take advantage  of this situation, and use this assistance in the interests of  the economy and the people, that Ukraine will move faster toward  reforms and toward a better lifestyle. Wondering whether  Ukraine is to be or not to be, as some put it, is something I  will never stand for. Ukraine is here to stay, by all means.  Nobody can reverse the course of history. One can [word  indistinct] it, one can impudently tear at it, but one has to be  mad to wonder whether it is to be or not to be. Forgive me for  saying this, but one gentleman said to me: What do you think,  will Ukraine survive or not? I replied in a not-so-tolerant  way: I have no doubt that Ukraine will survive as I have no  doubt that it will outlive you.    [Boyko] Oksana Boyko, VECHIRNIY KIEV newspaper. Leonid  Makarovych, I would like you to clarify two more aspects of your  American visit. The Clinton administration is often accused of  taking a personalized approach to relations with certain  countries, particularly Russia, treating Russia as Yeltsin. It  looks like the same personalization is taking place now in  seeing Ukraine through Kravchuk. You were talking about the  next presidential election. If there is an early election, and  you indeed do not take part in it, do you think it will put a  freeze on our thawing relations with America? Another thing: In  January this year, American intelligence predicted that Ukraine  may split into several separate nuclear states. Did you sense  any reference to this prediction during your negotiations at the  White House, or does the White House ignore the predictions of  its intelligence?    [Kravchuk] I will begin with the second question. Why read  American intelligence reports? Read our own publications and  you will find there that Ukraine will definitely split into  three or four or as many as one feels like, parts. No need for  intelligence, you can read what we say and write ourselves. This  does not mean that we cannot think this way or make predictions,  but I would not think there are any grounds for seeing any  tragedy in this. The main thing is for us to understand that  our cause is to unite around the highest task of building an  independent, democratic, law-governed, friendly, and peaceful  Ukraine, one that takes advantage of its wealth; its natural,  human, scientific, and technical potential; joins all European  and world structures; makes friends with neighbors and does not  settle any scores with anyone. I think we will cope with this  task because we have no alternative. Everybody must understand  this.    As for personalization, I talked about this in the United  States when I was asked similar questions. By the way, nobody  asked me this in the White House, but journalists did ask. I  said: Ukraine is there, START-I has been ratified, and  reservations have been lifted on Paragraph 5 of the Lisbon  Protocol. Finally, there are programs set by the Supreme  Council and the government. These are real facts. To turn away  from this course, which has already begun to pave its way  straight on the fields, at the factories, and in the mentality  and souls of the people by consolidating this realization, would  not be that simple.    Every period is associated with a certain personality, but  this does not mean that the people would allow themselves to  elect a president who would pursue a different course, against  independence or against statehood. I cannot imagine that.  People will not stand for that. They would elect a person who  would fight for the state, for a democratic, law-governed state.  If something should suddenly happen, well, there are zig-zags  in history, but it would be impossible today. That is what I  think, and there is no tragedy in it. There are no eternal  presidents. Everyone must do his job and let others do theirs.  It is up to the people to decide who they should elect.    Thank you for the meeting. I wish you all the best.</p>

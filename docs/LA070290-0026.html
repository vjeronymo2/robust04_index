			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> SEASTRAND WIDOW TO SEEK ASSEMBLY SEAT  </P> <P> Andrea Seastrand, widow of Assemblyman Eric Seastrand of Salinas, announced she  will run for her husband's seat. Eric Seastrand, 52, an assembly member since  December, 1982, died June 20 of cancer.  </P> <P> His district includes portions of Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara  counties. "My children are in college now, and I have reached that point in my  life where I can devote my undivided attention to serving in the tradition of  my late husband," said Andrea Seastrand, 49. The GOP central committees in the  three counties must meet to select a replacement for the November ballot by  Aug. 30. Only one other Republican has expressed interest, Steve MacElvainy, a  member of the state Coastal Commission. Since the district leans Republican by  a 48% to 40% margin, the chosen candidate has a leg up in the race.  </P></p>

[passage omitted]    The government explained that opposition Radio Liberte was  destroyed by security forces at dawn yesterday as a punitive  measure. Radio Liberte has chosen the incitement to hatred,  violence, and intolerance as its editorial policy. This  dangerous option, Idriss Ngari, chief of the general crisis  staff explained, brought about the military operation against  the radio station. He said in an interview published this  morning that the Armed Forces acted to safeguard the interest of  the nation.    Justifying the operation that led to the destruction of  Radio  Liberte, the chief of the general crisis staff said that the  Armed Forces could no longer accept to be the target of  opposition party militiamen and that soldiers could no longer  allow themselves to be killed by what he called fanatics and  agent provocateurs. According to General Idriss Ngari,  Radio-Tele Liberte has been broadcasting messages in all  national languages calling for civil disobedience, hatred,  revolt, and civil war for a month now.

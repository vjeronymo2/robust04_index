			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Upjohn ahead 9.8% despite flat US sales UPJOHN, the US pharma-ceuticals group, yesterday posted a 9.8 per cent improvement in underlying first-quarter earnings to Dollars 199.2m from Dollars 181.5m a year earlier. Operating revenues rose 7.2 per cent to Dollars 932.7m from Dollars 875.8m. Net income, including the cumulative effect of accounting changes and other special items, was Dollars 144.6m, or 81 cents a primary share, against a net deficit of Dollars 85.3m, or 50 cents, a year ago. Operating income rose to Dollars 184.1m from Dollars 177.6m, with a strong performance from agricultural operations offsetting a slight decline in health care. Mr Ley Smith, chief operating officer said: 'We await the resolution of the debate over the reform of the US healthcare system, confident that the strength of our product pipeline and the flexibility of our organisation will result in a respectable ongoing performance.' On Wednesday, the company said Mr Smith had assumed the responsibilities of chief executive because of the deteriorating health of Mr Theodore Cooper, Upjohn's chairman and chief executive. Upjohn's R&amp;D expenditure was steady at 16 per cent of sales, but the company trimmed marketing and administrative costs to 36 per cent from 37 per cent of sales. Healthcare sales were flat in the US and up 1 per cent worldwide, with growth led by antibiotics. However, several of Upjohn's traditional money-spinners had slower sales in the quarter.</p>

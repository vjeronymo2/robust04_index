			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (11): A wealth of spare talent - Drastic cost-cuts in research and defence projects have left top scientists with an uncertain future FOR DECADES one of the showpieces of Communist rule, Russian brains are turning out to be one of the better buys for investors seeking opportunities in the newly-capitalist country. The Soviet Union's collapse last December, followed by price liberalisation and drastic government spending cuts in January, has left an impressive state-sponsored system of scientific research in complete disarray. This, in turn, has opened up the chance for outsiders to tap the wealth of scientific talent in Russia and the other newly-independent republics. In the meantime, the disintegration of the old Soviet system has triggered fears among western governments that under-paid scientists will sell Soviet nuclear and other military secrets to Third World dictators. These fears are no doubt exaggerated  - there are still restrictions on the scientists' movement, the Russian government has promised to increase their pay, and many do not actually want to leave the country. Still, the future appears extremely bleak to many scientists, who have been looked after by the state all their lives and now have to find their own solutions  - 'if they told us to be patient for a year or two, then we could at least go and work as doormen in the meantime,' says Sergei, a computer programmer who has not been paid this year. While his institute waits for overdue grants from the state (the government blames a physical shortage of banknotes for the delay), Sergei and his colleagues are surviving on a few unofficial orders from defence and other state-owned plants. But even these are at risk because the industry's own financial resources are rapidly declining as a result of 'across the board' spending cuts. These include a reduction in defence procurement  - a leading employer of scientific talent  - to 13 per cent of last year's level. Some scientists have lost no time in helping themselves. One such pioneer is Professor Boris Babayan, who created the supercomputers used in the Soviet space programme and the design of nuclear weapons. He and a team of colleagues at the Institute for Precision Mechanics and Computer Technology are now putting the finishing touches to an agreement to carry out research in Moscow for Sun Microsystems, a Californian computer company. Prof. Babayan, seeking funds to complete work on a new super-computer, the Elbrus 3, began talking to foreign computer companies a year ago. He is not saying how much Sun will pay him and his colleagues, but it does not take much to improve on his current monthly salary of Rbs2,000 (Dollars 20) a month. Other scientists are choosing to leave the country. One of Prof Babayan's colleagues is emigrating to the US, while three others have taken a prolonged leave of absence of abroad. While such solutions may secure the future of the very top scientists or those with easily marketable skills, such as programming, they will not be applicable to all. Nowhere is this clearer than in the akademgorodok (scientific village) set in beautiful forest-land, 30km outside Novosibirsk, the biggest city in Siberia. Conceived in 1957 as a place for scientists to think in peace and live in comfort, it contains more than 20 research institutes  - ranging from nuclear physics, mining, inorganic chemistry, and semiconductor physics. The livelihood of 30,000 scientists, receiving an average monthly wage of Rbs1,400, depend on it. 'Our policy is to hang in here until the very last. There's nowhere else to go,' says Mr Sergei Kuznetsov, a 44-year-old mathematician at the local Computing Centre, which can carry out mathematical modelling for everything from the weather to military aircraft. Apart from the shortage of housing which makes it difficult to move ('we're no longer tied here by internal passport rules but by our apartments'), Mr Kuznetsov says sharp price rises make it prohibitively expensive to travel around to look for other jobs. An air ticket to Moscow costs Rbs540  - or a third of his monthly salary. He heads the Computing Centre's department for seeking foreign grants to fund joint research projects with the outside world  - 'it's embarrassing to seek help,' he says. 'But we perfectly understand that the hand of the state will not reach out to us. We have to do something ourselves. 'Before, we always felt important. Fundamental science used to be one of the achievements thanks to which we compared ourselves to the civilised world, but now we live in a situation where there is little money, poverty and unemployment.' Some western public money, at least Dollars 40m already pledged by Germany and the US, has already been promised for a centre within Russia to occupy scientists involved in nuclear weapons production. Western backers of the project explain that the aim is to attract matching private funds for joint research projects. Another way out is through domestic entrepreneurship. In a small factory set up on premises belonging to the Botanical Gardens, just outside the akademgorodok, Mr Yuri Yurchenko, a microbiologist who used to be involved in the production of biological weapons, now oversees the production of cosmetics.

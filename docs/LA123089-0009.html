			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE TRUSTEE CREDENTIALS, CHANCELLOR'S SALARY INCREASE  </P> <P> The Times article does not give a balanced portrayal of the chairwoman of the  California State University Board of Trustees, Marianthi Lansdale. I have been  a member of the board since 1974 and served as board chair from 1979-1981. I  was one of Lansdale's fellow trustees who elected her to board vice- chair in  1987-88, to chairwoman in 1988-89 and for a second term in 1989-90. Clearly, I  and my fellow board members have admired her leadership skills and commitment  to the university.  </P> <P> Lansdale has been an ardent supporter of child care services for student  parents in the CSU system and advocated equity and access to higher education  by single parents, ethnic minorities and others who traditionally have not had  an opportunity to attend college. She has worked hard on achieving better  fiscal support for CSU, including salary and research support.  </P> <P> Lansdale is an active supporter of the fine arts and has given generously of  her time and resources to California higher education. She brings to our board  energy, wit, enthusiasm and dedication.  </P> <P> CLAUDIA H. HAMPTON  </P> <P> Member, CSU Board of Trustees  </P></p>

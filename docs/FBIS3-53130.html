In a statement to AL-HAYAH he  said that these contacts are designed to arrange direct contacts  between the ruling authority and detained FIS leaders,  specifically Shaykhs Abbassi Madani and Ali Belhadj.    Haddam added that all contacts ended with informing the  various parties and brokers that "none of the FIS leaders can  negotiate with the ruling clique separately, and the regime must  recognize the Front's legitimate leadership and enable the  detained shaykhs to meet with its shura council."    Haddam, who currently lives in the United States, heads the  Front's parliamentary mission, and was elected in the canceled  elections, pointed to the existence of other new parties "which  should be taken account of when the negotiations begin, namely  leaders of armed action."    A few weeks ago the Front announced its conditions for  negotiation, not dialogue, as it prefers to call the process.  These conditions included releasing the Front's leaders,  enabling them to meet with the Front's shura council, and then  holding negotiations in a neutral country.    Haddam also denounced what he termed "the ruling clique's  attempts to divide the Front's leadership by contacting  illegitimate elements who do not belong to the FIS line." He  added: "The regime tried to divide the Front before following  the 1991 June incidents. It also tried to create an alternative  leadership to the Front but its scheme failed, and any attempt  to make contact with an illegitimate leadership is also doomed  to fail." [passage omitted]</p>

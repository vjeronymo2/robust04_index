			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Heseltine fails to calm Tory fears on pits THE THREAT of a Tory revolt today over pit closures was re-emerging last night as Mr Michael Heseltine failed to calm the fears of some Conservatives that the 12 reprieved pits may not survive more than a year. The trade and industry secretary shrugged off concern among a growing number of Tory MPs that British Coal might scupper the hopes raised by his coal rescue package. He said 'dramatic opportunities' had been given to the industry via government subsidies worth Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m. A hint from British Coal executives that further pit closures were inevitable around April next year was, 'one hypothetical doom-laden scenario', Mr Heseltine said on BBC television yesterday. But he admitted he could not 'sign up in blood' to a guarantee that pits would stay open, and indicated government subsidies would last only two years, until privatisation. There was comfort for Mr Heseltine, however, when it emerged the electricity and coal industries had finally reached agreement on contracts through which the UK's power companies would buy 160m tonnes of coal from British Coal in the next five years. Signings are expected to be completed today. This will secure a future for the 19 pits which British Coal considers its best and will clear the way for talks on additional contracts aimed at providing a lifeline for another 19 which last week were told they would either be reprieved, mothballed or developed without being mined. The contracts, which they have started signing after months of wrangling within the coal and electricity industries, are worth Pounds 5.5bn to British Coal. In parliament, government business managers are braced for a possible anti-government vote by at least two Conservative MPs. Another six or more might abstain. A trade union lobby of parliament will increase the pressure on wavering Tories but the government was last night confident of winning the vote. Defeat would require 11 Tories to vote against the government, if all the other political parties were opposed to the package. The Ulster Unionists could decide to abstain, however, making defeat still less likely. In a move timed to help the vote, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, will today announce extra help for former miners suffering from chronic bronchitis and emphysema, implementing recommendations last November by the Industrial Injuries Advisory Committee. Industry disablement benefit will be available to those suffers who have worked more than 20 years underground. Potential Tory rebels meet this morning to discuss tactics. The most vociferous yesterday, Mr Winston Churchill, said he was 'looking for very specific assurances by the chairman of British Coal' about the future of the 12 reprieved pits. Without them, 'the government would need to be very worried about its majority', he said.

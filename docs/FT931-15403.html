			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Patten's progress LAST OCTOBER'S proposals to widen Hong Kong's democratic base by Mr Chris Patten, the governor, angered China's hardline communists. They demanded complete withdrawal. Mr Patten then challenged Beijing to suggest a better framework for the 1995 Legislative Council (LegCo) elections. This fruitless exchange left Hong Kong people, who will fall under Chinese sovereignty in 1997, worried about their future. China's threats and hostility seemed to put at risk the 'one country, two systems' principle which they had been promised. But Mr Patten's proposals have had another effect. They have sparked precisely the kind of political debate in Hong Kong which, presumably, Beijing abhors. This healthy development may offer a way forward. Mr Patten has repeatedly said he can only go as far as the people of Hong Kong want him to. For him personally, this approach offers a political escape route - he does not need to go down with the ship of his proposals. But it also means that Hong Kong's legislators have to assume the higher degree of responsibility for Hong Kong's future that greater democracy implies. If democracy is to mean anything, disagreements must provoke a public debate which can change things. Such debate is now under way in Hong Kong and may well produce workable alternatives to Mr Patten's proposals. The time for deliberation has been extended by the decision of the Executive Council, Mr Patten's appointed advisory body, to spend the next month discussing the issue. Then the governor's proposals, amended or not, will go to LegCo, which will also debate them at length. Suggestions for amendments have begun to emerge. The leading conservative faction on LegCo says it will table amendments withdrawing the elements most objectionable to China. Ranged against it are those who back Mr Patten's proposals as the best they are likely to be offered. The battle-lines are still rudimentary. The essential point is that debate within Hong Kong is under way on determining the colony's future. This is the best guarantee of the 'one country, two systems' approach and thus the one most likely to maintain business confidence. It would not necessarily be easy for China to scrap electoral arrangements determined by the Hong Kong people after it took over - and it might not even want to.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Rocky Loses to Museum: It looks as if Rocky Balboa has lost his bout with the  Philadelphia Museum of Art. The 8-foot, 6-inch statue of the fictional South  Philadelphia palooka is scheduled to leave its spot atop the art museum's steps  today for its former home at the Spectrum arena, a museum spokeswoman said  Sunday.  </P> <P> The statue of Rocky was moved from the Spectrum for the filming of "Rocky V."  The film's producers had agreed to put the statue back when they were through,  but Sylvester Stallone and Rocky fans tried to persuade the museum to keep it  on the spot made famous in the original "Rocky." But art museum officials say  it's out of place in front of the Greco-Roman building. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

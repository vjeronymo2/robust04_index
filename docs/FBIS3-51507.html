The documents, which AFP received tonight in advance, are  addressed to Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho and Samuel Ruiz,  bishop of this city. They note that the guerrillas have not  received "any written communication" regarding the proposed  amnesty announced last week by the government, which would cover  rebel actions staged between 1 and 16 January.    In this regard, the rebels note that the "mentioned amnesty  law" is "premature in the current dialogue process, because the  political and social causes that gave rise to our movement still  prevail."</p>

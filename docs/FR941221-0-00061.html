			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Congress could have required the minimum number to be ``not less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> greater of''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as opposed to ``not less than the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> lesser of,''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensured a minimum of 10 percent of the number of units in a covered project to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be reserved for non-elderly disabled families. Alternatively, the Congress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could have drafted the statute to provide that in the event the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units occupied by disabled families on the two dates in paragraph (b)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [cited above] equaled zero, the minimum percentage of units to be reserved for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-elderly disabled families would be 10 percent or such other percentage as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Congress may have desired to impose. The Congress took neither of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> courses of action, and without these or similar provisions, there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> question that the calculation in paragraph (b) could result in zero  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reservation of units. However, as stated in the preamble to the May 3, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim rule, HUD believes that few, if any, covered section 8 housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects will fall into the category of having no disabled families occupying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units in the project on the date of enactment of the HCD Act of 1992 or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the replacement of the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``mobility impaired'' with the term ``tenants needing the accessibility features  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the unit'' represents a significant change. The commenter stated that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term departs from the language of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1973 and HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 8 which use the term ``individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with physical handicaps.'' The commenter stated that this substitution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms will make accessible units available to any disabled person who can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish a need for the accessible features of a unit regardless of whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or not the individual has a physical disability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As an initial matter, HUD points out that the term ``tenants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needing the accessibility features of the unit'' is not used in the subtitle D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, but was used in the preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule. (See 59 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22920). Secondly, HUD notes that while the term ``mobility impaired'' does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appear in HUD's part 8 regulations (see 24 CFR 8.22(b)) issued in June 1988,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is now recognized that this term does not adequately reflect the broad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range of disabilities which may cause an individual with a disability to need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a unit with accessible features. The term ``mobility impaired'' was too often  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perceived as synonymous with the term ``persons in wheelchairs'' and did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriately reflect persons with other types of disabilities who may need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessible features of a unit. The term ``tenants needing the accessibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> features of the unit'' used in the May 3, 1994 interim rule is not inconsistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the language in HUD's section 504 regulations in 24 CFR part 8. The part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8 regulations also use the term ``applicant or occupant having [disabilities]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring the accessibility features of a unit.'' (See, e.g., 24 CFR 8.27).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, to have been more clear as to the types of tenants who may need the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessibility features of a unit, the preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should have used the term ``tenants with a disability that makes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessibility features of the unit necessary.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the commenter's concern that a project owner may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indiscriminately assign accessible units to tenants, HUD notes that its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 504 regulations require owners to take reasonable nondiscriminatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steps to maximize the utilization of such units by eligible individuals whose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability requires the accessibility features of the particular unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, as stated earlier in this preamble, where an accessible unit is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not available to a person with disabilities who needs an accessible unit, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing provider is to accommodate the person either by (1) making the unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessible (so long as doing so would not result in a fundamental alteration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the nature of the program or activity or undue financial and administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdens), or (2) by transferring a tenant who is living in an accessible unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but does not need an accessible unit to the inaccessible unit, and offering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the accessible unit to the disabled family. Given these requirements, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unlikely that owners will not make every effort to maximize the utilization of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessible units by families who need the accessibility features of the unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the interim rule failed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acknowledge that subtitle D requires owners who elect an elderly preference to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> open admissions to all section 8 eligible families without regard to age or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability when there are vacant units in the project and an insufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of elderly families to fill those vacant units. Another commenter made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a similar comment in stating that the final rule must clarify that an owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who does not elect to provide a secondary preference may admit any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible person if there is an insufficient number of applicants on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiting list to fill either the elderly units or the units reserved for non-elderly disabled families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD acknowledges that although the May 3, 1994 interim rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> touches upon this issue, the language of the rule is not as clear on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point as it could or should be. The May 3, 1994 interim rule provides: ``If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the owner of an elderly project who has elected to adopt the secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferences in paragraph (d) of this section determines, in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families for whom the preference, including secondary preference, in occupancy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been given, to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> the owner shall make the vacant units generally available to otherwise eligible families who apply for housing, without regard to the preferences and reservation of units provided in this section.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Emphasis added.) (See &sect;880.612a(e) and comparable sections in other parts covered by this rule.) HUD recognizes that this paragraph indicates that the open admission requirement when there are vacant units is only applicable to owners who elected to adopt the secondary preferences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

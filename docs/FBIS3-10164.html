Antonio Rios made this statement, noting that the  CTV will maintain this position as long as the measure helps  combat speculation.    Rios disclosed that he will deliver to the president a  document containing the conclusions reached by the CTV after an  assessment of the country's political, economic, and social  situation, specifically in light of the workers.    In this regard, Rios noted that the document includes  several  recommendations made by the CTV in the face of the crisis. The  recommendations include fighting inflation, better public  services, the guarantee of a comprehensive social security  system, and the creation and protection of jobs --jobs that  should be the key issue in the permanent dialogue among the  government, management, and organized labor.    [Begin Rios recording] We feel that the suspension of  guarantees is good for workers and the people because they do  not have to worry about speculation or an increase in the  inflation rate because the government had to utilize its  resources to cover the deficit. These deficits are being  created while the government solves problems such as those  presented by Banco Latino or other banks that might require its  attention. [end recording]    In terms of the CTV stand on an increase in the minimum  wage,  Rios reiterated that it should be closely linked to the prices  of the basic food basket.</p>

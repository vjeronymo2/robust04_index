			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Canadian banks to cut rates Canadian banks will lower their prime lending rate on Monday from 6 per cent to 5.75 per cent, the lowest level in 26 years, Bernard Simon reports from Toronto. This will be the first time in almost a decade that a key Canadian interest rate has fallen below the US, where the prime is 6 per cent. The prime rate in Canada reached a peak of 14.75 per cent in mid-1990. Its slide since then is largely due to the Bank of Canada's success in bringing down inflation to an annual rate of 1.8 per cent, a percentage point below that of the US. Despite the cut in interest rates, the Canadian dollar remained steady yesterday at just above 78 US cents.</p>

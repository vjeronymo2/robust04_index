			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jovan Lakicevic from the "An Argument More" </F> program]    [Text] After the cowardly, repeated attack by U.S.  aircraft from NATO formations on medical vehicles and civilian  targets of the Bosnian Serbs, many things remain unclear and  puzzling, especially regarding the real, undeclared aims of the  inspirers of the aforementioned pirate action. It is,  therefore, too early to draw any conclusions on the political  and military effects of this act, which can be considered  criminal in every respect. In other words, it is too early to  judge what was gained and what was lost lost by different sides.    Nevertheless, one could say that all those who believed in a  peaceful and quick settlement of the Bosnian conflict are the  losers. Moreover, all those who thought that the U.S.  involvement in the forced creation of some kind of Muslim-Croat  federation serves the peace process are also disappointed. Even  the last skeptics must now be clear that this was a simple  camouflage for a quick renewal of an anti-Serbian coalition so  the Serbs could be militarily pressed and forced, with NATO's  help, to accept the dictate of the Western alliance.    Those who believed in the impartial and peaceful role of the  United Nations also feel deceived. What can be said about those  who thought for at least one moment that the belligerent and  anti- Serbian hawks in NATO would play peace pigeons here under  the trade mark of the United Nations? In other words, that they  would keep aside of the interethnic war in Bosnia.    The Russians could also be considered political losers. With  these unilateral actions by the Americans, they -- to put it  mildly -- lost a step on the way back to the Balkan region.  Subsequent, unconvincing anger by Russian leaders -- because  they were allegedly not informed about NATO's intentions -- was  directed more toward, as the U.S. President said, the public at  home rather than Washington and Brussels.    The only winner appears to be NATO, which, without major  upheavals in the international public and, so far, without  Serbian revanchism, won a chance to go a step further in its  offensive on neutral territory.    For the first time in its history, NATO attacked ground  targets (?in Europe) from the air. The fact that this was done  with a limited, relatively small number of aircraft indicates  that this was a trail balloon and yet another forced precedent.  This is paving the way for similar actions by NATO in the  future in this and some other regions.    It would not be superfluous to recall that it was precisely  in Bosnia's case that NATO, with the decisive role of the United  States, first succeeded in becoming something of an extended  hand of the United Nations in the peacetime military operations,  then in becoming a protector of the United Nations Protection  Forces [UNPROFOR] from the air, and finally in bombing targets  on the ground. The right to make decisions on air strikes,  which was first given to Butrus-Ghali, then to Yasushi Akashi,  ended with the one who Washington and NATO headquarters in  Brussels wanted to have it right from the very beginning -- with  one of NATO military commanders. Since all these variations  were peformed almost without any criticism, let alone resistance  by the instrumentilized and deceived international public, and  without any reaction by the corrupted and immature politicians,  one can rightly expect NATO's next move to be according to the  U.S. dictate. This would be the landing and intervention by  ground forces that will carry out not only the UN tasks but the  orders of the military organization of the Atlantic Alliance.    It is not impossible at all that this precedent-variation  will be tested and endorsed by the public in Bosnia. Regarding  this, the report that the landing of planes with weapons and  NATO forces for rapid intervention on Bihac airport is  indicative. If this report turns out to be correct, then this  would undoubtedly be the beginning of the last, the hitherto  untested, but the most dangerous variation of NATO formations'  involvement.    The Serbs have suspected for a long time, and have now  finally seen, that their opponents in the Bosnian war are not  only the Croats and the Muslims, but also, to the same extent,  NATO and the United States for their own reasons. They finally  revealed themselves in the true light of friends of the Serbian  enemies. Of course this fact is not easy to take, but it must  be faced.    If the rest of the world does not realize in time that NATO  military involvement in Bosnia is not only a matter or a problem  that exists between the Bosnian Serbs and NATO formations, but  playing out of all types of possible interventions by NATO for  some future actions and some new territories, so much the worse  for the rest of the indifferent world. The world will very soon  face a military monster that will be a merciless punishing whip  for the unsuitable and disobedient peoples in the hands of the  protagonists of the new world order.    Therefore, the U.S. bombs that were dropped on Serbian  targets in Bosnia not only represent an act of aggression and  crime toward the Serbian people, but have a much more dangerous  and foreboding meaning.</p>

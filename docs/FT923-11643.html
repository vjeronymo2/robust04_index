			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / C and W joins the dawn chorus insomniacs or investors. The chairman of Cable and Wireless might well have thought the former were more likely to watch his dawn performance of Britain's first televised annual meeting yesterday. Cable &amp; Wireless - The AGM was broadcast at 'the unearthly hour of 5.30am', according to Lord Young. 'Rather more shareholders, who are normally awake at a more civilised hour will, I trust, set their video recorders,' he said. The taped performance was aimed at the company's vast number of small shareholders, who are often unable to attend either the AGM or the regional meetings around the country. Some 56 per cent of C and W's 150,000 UK-based investors own 500 shares or less and are scattered from John O'Groats to Land's End. Yet such worthy motives have their economic attractions as well. The bill for a 30-minute broadcast comes to about Pounds 40,000, considerably less than the cost of a 10-day jaunt around the country involving top executives. A C and W spokesman admitted that cost was one of the main reasons for televising the AGM, and ending the regional meetings. The idea is catching on, with Nuclear Electric and Scottish Power set to debut in the next two weeks. The big question remains whether shareholders will be dedicated enough to get up at the crack of dawn. Research will be carried out by C and W and the channel which carried the programme, BMH, to determine the company's ratings. If C and W has a blockbuster, viewers can look forward to AGM II.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> REGENTS HALT HUTTENBACK'S PAY  </P> <P> University of California regents today announced the suspension without pay of  former UC Santa Barbara Chancellor Robert Huttenback, pending appeal of his  conviction for misusing school discretionary funds to finance home  improvements.  </P> <P> UC spokesman Paul West said the decision was reached on the second day of  meetings by the regents held at UC San Francisco.  </P> <P> Huttenback, a history professor, was chancellor of UC Santa Barbara for nine  years. He resigned before his conviction and continued to draw his salary as a  tenured professor. After the conviction he was suspended from teaching, but  still continued to draw pay.  </P> <P> Huttenback, 61, insisted again today that he was innocent and blamed the  university's "confusing" policy on a chancellor's use of discretionary funds  and failure to explain the matter publicly for his problems.  </P></p>

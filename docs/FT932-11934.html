			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Observer: Out spokesman It seems that the gravitas of foreign secretary Douglas Hurd will no longer be balanced around the world by the urbanity of his spokesman Francis Cornish, whose humorous as well as authoritative daily briefings have been like manna to diplomatic correspondents. Observer hears he is to be British trade commissioner in Hong Kong - a job in which he'll report to London, rather than to governor Chris Patten, and represent Britain's as distinct from the HK government's interests. What's more, the office Cornish will head is set to be the core of Britain's future diplomatic representation in Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. He's replacing former ambassador to Tunisia Stephen Day, who only moved to the job last year. Cornish is also well stocked with diplomatic skills, and not only as a result of dealing with the media. He has been a High Commissioner to Brunei and an information counsellor in Washington, not to mention an assistant private secretary to the Prince of Wales.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / People: Nigel Lester quits County Nigel Lester, who heads County NatWest Investment Management, is leaving for personal reasons, but has been asked by the board of NatWest Markets to stay on for another three months while a successor is found. The fund management operation has been hit by a string of departures, with two other senior figures quitting just recently. David Gamble, deputy chief executive, has left to run the British Airways Pension Fund, and Bruce Pullman, who was in charge of quantitative product development, is moving to Hill Samuel Life and Investment Management. County denies that these departures are connected or reflect changing fortunes of the operation. Total funds under management last year rose from Pounds 12.6bn to Pounds 14bn. Lester, 40, had been at County for three years.</p>

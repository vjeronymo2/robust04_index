			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER SIDE TO SCHOOL STORY  </P> <P> I am writing about your article on Oak Ridge Private School ("Noisy New  Neighbor Shows Up on Block," Nov. 21). More exactly, I am writing about the  duty inherent in the exercise of privilege.  </P> <P> I would have hoped that the reporters, as professional journalists, would have  taken the time to investigate the entire story rather than only one side. The  obvious slant with which this story was written leads me to believe that the  reporters were either sloppy in their research attempts or that they  intentionally misrepresented facts. Neither makes sense. Neither is acceptable.  </P> <P> The guarantee of freedom of speech and expression is a treasure that we all  enjoy, and few invoke its guarantees more vociferously than the press. But at  what cost do you, as professionals, eschew the spirit of the law for the  letter?  </P> <P> No one cares more about safety precautions being met at the school than do the  parents of the children. Never was there any questioning of the need for fire  doors, as the article insinuated. Oak Ridge has been held to, and has met,  safety standards that are higher than those for public schools in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech is something that my child,  as a student at Oak Ridge Private School, will learn about. He will also learn  about fairness and truth and that, inherent in any privilege, is the  responsibility to exercise these freedoms with integrity and honor.  </P> <P> CHRISTINE EASTWOOD, Santa Ana  </P></p>

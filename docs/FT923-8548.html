			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Coca-Cola Amatil rises 19% in first six months SUCCESSFUL international diversification has helped Coca-Cola Amatil, Australia's biggest soft drink and snack food company, overcome recessed domestic conditions and record a solid earnings rise in the first half to June. The company yesterday announced a 19 per cent advance in net profits to ADollars 25.1m (USDollars 18.5m) from ADollars 21.1m a year earlier, on a 15 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 968.3m. from ADollars 841.7m. The interim dividend is being raised to 8.5 cents a share from 7.5 cents. A breakdown of pre-tax profits showed that profits from Australia fell to ADollars 59.9m from ADollars 64.3m, on virtually static sales of ADollars 640.5m. However, combined earnings of the company's Asian and European divisions jumped to ADollars 26.5m from ADollars 16.4m on a 62 per cent jump in sales from ADollars 200.1m to ADollars 324.8m. The bulk of earnings again came from the company's beverage division, which lifted pre-tax profits to ADollars 70.6m from ADollars 68.5m, while the snack food division's profits rose to ADollars 15.7m from ADollars 12.3m. The directors said soft drinks in Austria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia continued to achieve growth in sales and profits, but European snack food businesses were affected by intense competition. West Australian Newspaper Holdings, the newly floated Perth media group, is on the way to exceeding its prospectus forecasts for the current year to June, after a solid maiden earnings report yesterday. The group unveiled net profits of ADollars 14.1m for the six months to June 30, it's first period as a public company. Sales totalled ADollars 101.4m and a 4 cents a share final dividend has been declared. Mr Trevor Eastwood, chairman, said yesterday that transactions during the period under review lifted the group's estimated tax losses to about ADollars 320m from ADollars 79.9m, subject to tax office approval.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / NatWest changes Arrow case lawyers NATIONAL WESTMINSTER Bank has appointed new solicitors to act for it during the latest Department of Trade and Industry inquiry into the Blue Arrow affair, the bank disclosed yesterday. The move was made because partners with Wilde Sapte, the law firm which has advised NatWest over Blue Arrow until now, are expecting to be called to give evidence to the inspectors. Mr Malcolm Glover, a Wilde Sapte senior partner, yesterday confirmed that he expected to be called to give evidence to the inspectors. The latest DTI inquiry is investigating the roles played in the scandal by the management of NatWest, rather than individuals in County NatWest, its investment banking subsidiary - the subject of the first inquiry. Mr Glover and Wilde Sapte acted for NatWest throughout both the first inquiry and the recent trial which ended in four advisers being convicted of conspiracy to defraud. The court heard how the firm played a leading part in supplying documents to the first DTI inquiry. During the trial, defence lawyers found documents with handwritten additions by senior NatWest executives which had not been submitted to the inspectors. The secretary to the first inquiry, Mr Simon Morris, told the court he was surprised that one document, on which Mr Tom Frost, the NatWest chief executive had written, had not been submitted to the inspectors. NatWest will now be represented in the second inquiry by Allen &amp; Overy. The bank said: 'NatWest and Wilde Sapte have agreed that as Wilde Sapte partners are expected to be giving evidence to the DTI inspectors, NatWest should be advised by another law firm not connected with this inquiry.' Nevertheless, lawyers from Wilde Sapte will continue to work with Allen &amp; Overy to ensure full co-operation with the inquiry, the bank added.</p>

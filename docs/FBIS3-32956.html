			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raul Gutierrez and Azucena Lievano; from the "24 </F> Hours" newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded]    [Text] Alvaro Gomez [leader of the National Salvation  Movement, MSN] replied to Andres Pastrana today and in so doing  made the political news of the year: The MSN backs fully the New  Democratic Force [NFD] leader.    [Gomez] "We know if we free politics from its current  commitments, Colombians will be able to change those hopes into  national goals. We have seen in your presidential campaign, in  your independence, in the clear style you have given it, and in  your sensible proposals an opportunity to again effect these  tasks in which we have believed all along."    The day before, Pastrana had sent Gomez a letter in which  Pastrana pledged to carry out a deep political renewal,  beginning with a moral recovery as a proposal for the  consolidation of democracy.    [Gomez] "You have the intelligence and knowledge to carry  out  all of this and what is even more valuable, the aptitude to  instill credibility."    Gomez then replied to all types of questions. He said on no  account will he run for president, that the choice of vice  president will be entirely up to Pastrana.    [Gutierrez] "Is it an adherence, a support, an alignment  from  the political point of view?"    [Gomez] "It is support; naturally, it is an attempt to  fulfill a dream, because the MSN has always wanted to have a  proposal for Colombians. Our desire to always have a proposal  was made possible via Dr. Pastrana."    The decision to back Pastrana is not an act against the  Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, or the government; it is  for a change, Gomez concluded.    Alvaro Gomez Hurtado's support for the Pastrana campaign is  of immense political and personal value, according to Andres  Pastrana Arango. He said this support strengthens the party's  union for the presidential elections.    [Pastrana] "It is especially meaningful, because we agree on  the program. Just as Alvaro Gomez himself said in his message  and as I have said, this is a flight plan; there are important  points of agreements regarding the program we have presented for  Colombians to examine."    According to Pastrana, this is the consolidation of a  political process, but more than a victory, Pastrana says  politics have changed:    [Pastrana] "We have clearly demonstrated one can leave  behind  old feelings of resentment and situations that arose between the  Pastrana and Gomez families."    The presidential candidate said he is pleased with the entry  of the MSN party, and the doors are open for other groups. He  said contacts with leader Alvaro Gomez started the day his  candidacy was launched, and campaign coordinator Luis Alberto  Moreno handled the contacts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chin Chang-uk from Washington] </F>   [Text] On 4 February, the permanent members of the UN  Security Council, including the United States, the United  Kingdom, France, Russia, and China, held a closed-door meeting  at the request of the United States to discuss the North Korean  nuclear issue. It has been learned that China was informed of a  UN plan to impose economic sanctions against North Korea. China  was then asked to cooperate with the plan.    This indicates that the UN Security Council has initiated  its  meetings to earnestly discuss sanctions against North Korea as  the deadline for the nuclear inspection of North Korea by the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] -- which is scheduled  for 22 February -- is imminent. It is therefore very  significant.    A source said: Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the  United Nations, who arranged that day's meeting, gave a briefing  on the status of the negotiation process between the IAEA and  North Korea, and said that the UN Security Council should take  "action" against North Korea if no agreement was reached between  the IAEA and North Korea. British, French, and Russian  ambassadors supported the U.S. position.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Wolseley shows rise of 67% Wolseley, the world's biggest supplier of heating and plumbing equipment, lifted annual profits 67 per cent after a strong performance from all divisions and good contributions from acquisitions. Pre-tax profits for the year to July 31 were at the top end of analysts' expectations at Pounds 202.3m, up from Pounds 121.1m. Turnover rose by 31 per cent from Pounds 2.49bn to Pounds 3.25bn. Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman and managing director, said the results from the divisions across Europe and the US had an element of Alice in Wonderland  -'everyone has won and everyone deserves prizes'. The biggest gain came from the US, where profits from building distribution leapt from Pounds 47m to Pounds 86.8m on turnover up from Pounds 1.21bn to Pounds 1.72bn. The first full contribution from Erb Lumber, acquired last September, was Pounds 13.5m. Mr Lancaster said Erb and Carolina Builders, both lumber distributors, had been 'on a roll for two years' with 30 per cent annual sales growth, but the rate would slow this year. In Europe, profits from building distribution improved from Pounds 57.1m to Pounds 81m on sales up from Pounds 1bn to Pounds 1.14bn. The UK, where the group has 444 outlets, performed strongly, but Wolseley warned that the British recovery was fragile, and that it was impossible to predict the housing market. The manufacturing division lifted profits from Pounds 26.8m to Pounds 36.6m on turnover up from Pounds 278.5m to Pounds 390.3m including a good first full contribution from Enertech, the Swedish oil and gas burner manufacturer. Net debt at the end of the year fell from Pounds 62.3m to Pounds 56.3m, leaving gearing at 10.1 per cent (14.7 per cent). Net interest payable fell from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 2.1m. Earnings per share rose from 33.60p to 50.77p. Wolseley proposes to raise the final dividend from 9.75p to 12p a share, to take the total for the year to 16.72p (13.30p). The board, which is offering a scrip alternative for the first time, is also proposing a one-for-one scrip issue. Lex, Page 24</p>

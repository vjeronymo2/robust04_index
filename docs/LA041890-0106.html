			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER;  </P> <P> ZELMAN URGES REPLACING PRIVATE HEALTH COVERAGE WITH STATE PLAN  </P> <P> Insurance commissioner candidate Walter Zelman on Tuesday urged creation of a  universal state health care system in California, replacing most private health  insurance, to be financed through a payroll tax of about 10%.  </P> <P> Zelman's proposal is one of the boldest by any of the candidates for insurance  commissioner and he pledged to make enactment of such a system his priority if  elected in November.  </P> <P> All Californians served by the plan could choose their own doctors, but the  state would negotiate a price scale with the medical practitioners to hold down  costs, he said.  </P> <P> Some arrangements might entail modest co-payments by the patients, he added,  and in some instances patients wanting special care, such as private hospital  rooms, would be required to pay for that themselves.  </P> <P> Unemployed persons would be covered by the state out of the surplus collected  through the payroll tax, said Zelman, who is former director of California  Common Cause. But visitors to the state would not be covered.  </P> <P> Zelman, saying that more than 5 million Californians have no health insurance  and that that number has grown by 50% in the last three years, told a Westwood  news conference that the present system is intolerable and that "surgery," not  a Band-Aid approach, is necessary.  </P> <P> One other candidate in the crowded race, Democratic ex-television commentator  Bill Press, has advocated a universal health care plan in his speeches, but he  has not presented details of how it would operate.  </P> <P> The Legislature has been considering several less comprehensive plans, ranging  from requiring all employers to buy private health insurance to giving  employers a choice between buying private coverage or paying an 8% payroll tax  for state insurance. A variation would mandate state subsidies to some  employers who are unable to afford full insurance payments, but this would  entail a general tax increase.  </P></p>

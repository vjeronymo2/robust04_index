			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Recovery in margins should boost Tesco - Other Companies Tesco, the UK's second-largest food retailer, is expected tomorrow to announce an increase in interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 247m, from Pounds 235m last year, adjusting for new depreciation policies and before Pounds 4m property losses. Some recovery in margins is expected, but uncertainty over the extent of this, and over the fortunes of the Catteau chain in France, is reflected in the wide range of forecasts, from Pounds 240m to Pounds 252m.</p>

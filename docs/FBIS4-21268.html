			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rick Catlin: "Customs Support for Coalition </F> Against Drugs"]    [Text] New Customs Task Force Supervisor Mr. Langley Powery  is in full support of a recent proposal for a Joint Task Force  (with officers from various agencies) to wage war against drugs  in the Cayman Islands.    "The formation of the Task Force will eliminate overlapping  of duties and the compiling of equipment and resources," said  Mr. Powery.    At present, he said, numerous agencies (Police, Customs,  Immigration, etc.) receive information about drugs. Sometimes,  "we can have two groups working on the same case." With all  information being channeled to one agency, "this would avoid a  lot of overlap."    Additionally, the JTF will be able to make good use of all  equipment needed in the war on drugs and coordinate purchases.  He said his office is currently compiling a list of equipment  needed.    Among the items of equipment he'd like to see the JTF have  is  an Ionscan machine. The new device, currently being used at  selected US and Canadian airports, detects guns, drugs and  dangerous chemicals in baggage or being carried by passengers.    "It may not be viable for customs full time, but (it) would  be a big help on boats and for the Joint Task Force to make good  use of along with the dogs," he pointed out.    The Customs Task Force, which he took over in December 1993,  does not have the manpower nor equipment to effectively keep  drugs out of Cayman when much of the unguarded and unpatrolled  coast line is used.    His department has just 11 people full time to combat the  importation of drugs. Combined with the 14 from the Police Drugs  Squad unit, this means just 25 officers are available from Drugs  Squad and Customs in the fight against drugs. Recently, several  politicians have said drugs is the Number One crime problem in  the Cayman Islands.    "We really need to double the size of the task force," he  said. "Many of his officers are putting in long hours every day,  but have to avoid burnout and keep morale high."    He has requested an additional six officers, but he feels  three staff will be going to man the Marine Unit which will  patrol the coast line.    Mr. Powery is 100 percent behind the formation of the Marine  Unit/coast guard unit, but cautioned that "one boat is not going  to be enough."    "We have too much coast line plus we have 12 miles out (to  patrol) from all three islands."    He said ideally the coast guard, which likely will be a unit  of the Joint Task Force, should have at least three boats and  possibly four. Two should be around 48-foot with radar  capability while a third boat is needed for "pursuit and  interception."    "We also need a small boat for going into shallow waters,"  he  pointed out.    And how serious is the problem of drugs coming into the  Cayman Islands? "The number of incidents of drugs (encountered  by Customs) has doubled in the past five years," he stated. "The  public are probably not aware of the business of drugs. It's a  business and island demand is growing."    Along with several of his peers, Mr. Powery believes around  80 percent of drugs in Cayman are coming from Jamaica, Honduras  and Colombia for shipment to the U.S. However, he disputes that  Customs only seizes 10 percent of illegal drugs entering Cayman.  "Along the coast line, we probably only get 10 percent right  now, because we don't have patrol boats. But at the airport,  port and depot, we get much more than 10 percent."    He noted the Customs Task Force has had good success against  `mules' heading to the U.S. with drugs brought to Cayman from  other locations. However, that success does not mean his  department is getting overconfident.    "Each officer is aware of the drugs problem. They are  dedicated officers, regardless of how much we get or don't get."    During 1993, the CTF arrested 22 people and seized 50.32  kilos of ganja and 54.7 grams of cocaine. Among those arrested  were 8 Jamaicans, 7 Americans, 4 Caymanians and two from Chile.    While the amount of illegal drugs seized declined from 1992,  the number of people arrested went up. He's hoping the JTF will  be able to improve considerably on drugs seized and persons  arrested.    Despite the growing problem of drugs, Powery is committed to  the battle, regardless of his resources or equipment. "This  (job) is a definite challenge, and I've been working real hard.  I'm optimistic about the future. Our officers are highly  motivated and we are working well with drug squads."    "I really hope the Joint Task Force concept becomes a  reality."</p>

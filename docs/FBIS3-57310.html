Conflict Building Up Between Foreign Ministry and  Duma"]    [Text] Andrey Kozyrev has rejected Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's  ultimatum and does not intend to take a pro-Serb stance in the  Bosnian conflict. The minister made this statement in an  interview with the INTERFAX agency a few minutes before his  flight from Moscow to Bishkek. Last Friday [21 January] the  leader of the liberal democrats threatened Kozyrev with  dismissal unless he changed his policy on the Balkans within a  week and put himself unconditionally on the Serbs' side.    According to Kozyrev, by making such demands, Zhirinovskiy  is  pushing Moscow toward a world war. "Certain political forces,"  the minister said, "are trying to drag Russia into a global  catastrophe, and use this to their own advantage, to seize  power.... If Zhirinovskiy or anyone else demands my  resignation, I will perceive this as the best admission that my  policy is correct."    A conflict between the Duma and the Foreign Ministry looks  inevitable. More than likely, as early as next week -- having  completed his trips to Yugoslavia and Poland -- Zhirinovskiy  will put his threat into practice and demand a vote of no  confidence in Kozyrev. The majority of factions in the Duma  will scarcely be able to resist the temptation to settle scores  with the minister, who has always been an object of hatred for  the nationalists and Communists and, following Gaydar's  departure, will probably become the main target of their  criticism. The "anti-Kozyrev lobby" in the lower chamber of  parliament is very influential, uniting representatives of the  most diverse political forces -- from the liberal democrats to  Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the International Affairs Committee  and until recently Russian ambassador in Washington, whose  strained relations with his former boss are no secret to anyone.    Two-thirds of Duma members may vote no confidence in  Kozyrev,  which, admittedly, does not commit either the minister himself,  or President Yeltsin, to anything. In the recent past, the  Russian leader ignored the majority of foreign policy  resolutions adopted by the Congress and the Supreme Soviet. Is  Yeltsin likely to start heeding the opinion of the Duma which,  under the new Constitution, has considerably less power than  Khasbulatov's parliament?    Especially since, once they discard any liberal-democrat  demagoguery, the deputies will hardly be able to clearly define  the turnabout they expect from Russia's diplomacy. Since the  middle of last year, the Foreign Ministry can hardly be blamed  for any lack of pro-Serb sympathies: Russia was among the first  to call for an easing of sanctions against Belgrade and, just  like before, is against any strikes by NATO aviation against  Bosnian Serb positions.    Even if we were to agree with the highly dubious thesis that  our foreign policy's priority must be to uphold Serb interests,  it must be admitted that Kozyrev has not given all that many  causes for criticism in the recent past. Provided, of course,  that one does not take the positions of Zhirinovskiy who is  calling for Russian divisions to be sent to the Balkans and is  prepared to confront the entire world for the sake of the  "Serbian brothers."</p>

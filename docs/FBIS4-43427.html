			<p>BFN     [Text] The UN Security Council this evening renewed the  mandate of UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] and, at the same time,  stressed the urgent need to implement the confidence-building  measures.    Resolution No. 927, which was approved unanimously, stresses  that the Security Council will proceed with a full review of the  situation, including the UN role in Cyprus, within the framework  of its examination of the secretary general's 31 May report. It  also calls on all interested parties to be committed to a  substantial reduction in the number of foreign troops in Cyprus  and in the arms expenditures of the Republic of Cyprus, in order  to further the restoration of trust between the parties and as a  first step for the withdrawal of the non-Cypriot forces as  stipulated in the [Butrus-Ghali] set of ideas.    The Security Council also notes in its resolution that it  will continue to examine the secretary general's report and that  additional information is expected.    The Pakistani delegate claimed in his speech, without making  any reference to our side, that the Turkish Cypriot leadership  demonstrated political will to make progress in the  confidence-building measures on the questions of Famagusta and  the Nicosia Airport as well as for an overall settlement of the  problem. In order to support his views, the Pakistani delegate  referred to the acceptance in principle by Rauf Denktas of the  secretary general's report of July 1993. He referred to the  agreement that Denktas concluded with the United Nations in  Vienna under the condition that the agreement would be  incorporated into the secretary general's latest report.</p>

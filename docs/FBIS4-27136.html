			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  will hold working group meetings in Tokyo from next week to  discuss government procurement areas of the bilateral trade  "framework" talks, a top Foreign Ministry official said Monday.    The working group meeting on telecommunications equipment  will be held June 3-4 and the meeting on medical equipment will  be held June 7-8 in Tokyo, the official said.    Japan and the U.S. agreed last week to resume the trade  framework talks after a three-month deadlock. The trade  negotiations have been stalled since February due to differences  over the definition of "objective criteria." Japan has strongly  refused U.S. demands to set numerical targets to measure  progress in the opening of the Japanese market.</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WESTLAKE VILLAGE TO ALLOW MENORAH DISPLAY  </P> <P> The Westlake Village City Council, which stirred a controversy in December by  initially refusing to exhibit a Hanukkah menorah, has informally agreed to  allow the display of small candelabras alongside City Hall Christmas trees,  City Manager Larry Bagley said Friday.  </P> <P> Although Bagley had asked the council to set a policy on religious and ethnic  displays following the dispute, the decision was not put in writing, enabling  the city to continue considering such requests on a case-by-case basis.  </P> <P> The council reached its decision by consensus Wednesday at a meeting attended  by about 15 people, Bagley said. Each of the several speakers favored the  display of menorahs, he said.  </P> <P> Bagley, whose rejection of a six-foot menorah focused attention on the  otherwise quiet, affluent community, said Friday that he will refer requests to  the City Council for approval. Bagley has said he based his decision on the  fact that the city's storefront headquarters had no room for the large menorah  offered by Chabad, an Orthodox Jewish group, and that Hanukkah is not  considered a federal holiday.  </P> <P> Of the municipalities in the Los Angeles area approached by Chabad, Westlake  Village was the only one to deny the request. The City Council later reversed  Bagley's decision and allowed a table-top-sized menorah to be displayed next to  the city Christmas tree.  </P> <P> The American Civil Liberties Union and mainstream Jewish groups oppose the  Chabad displays, arguing that menorahs are religious symbols. But the U.S.  Supreme Court upheld Chabad's position in July in a landmark ruling that found  menorahs, as well as Christmas trees, to be a secular holiday symbol.  </P> <P> Bagley said the city has received only one other request since that by Chabad,  from an atheist organization seeking a pagan exhibit for the spring equinox  later this month. But no one from Truth Missions attended Wednesday's council  meeting despite his invitation, Bagley said.  </P></p>

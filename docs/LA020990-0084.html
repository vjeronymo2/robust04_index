			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL SLICK REACHES SHORE AT NEWPORT, HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: SHIFT IN WIND ENDS HOPE TO CONTAIN SPILL FROM TANKER, ALTHOUGH  MOST REMAINS SEVERAL MILES FROM COAST. WILDLIFE SANCTUARY IS SPARED.  </P> <P> After drifting for more than a day off the Southern California coast, the first  wave of 300,000 gallons of crude oil spilled by the disabled tanker American  Trader began washing up along several miles of Orange County shoreline Thursday  night.  </P> <P> Fishermen who braved the advancing slick had to wipe the black goo from their  lines, while spectators who ventured to the water's edge scooped up handfuls of  the muck and struggled to clean their hands. And Newport Beach's mascot,  Charlie the Sea Lion, swam through the muck near the Newport Pier.  </P> <P> Lifeguards and city officials in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach reported  that an oily brown foam began appearing along the surf line in both cities at  about dusk, and continued washing ashore through the night. At first the oil  appeared as droplets in the surf, but within hours the water's surface had  turned to a thick, foamy concentration fouling at least half a mile of  beachfront.  </P> <P> But Coast Guard officials said the bulk of the slick remained several miles off  Huntington Beach, where efforts continued to scoop up the Alaskan crude that  spewed from the tanker on Wednesday afternoon.  </P> <P> After a day of optimistic predictions that favorable weather conditions might  keep the slick at sea long enough to be cleaned up, a late-afternoon breeze  foiled hopes of keeping the oil away from the coastline.  </P> <P> The shift in winds, however, apparently spared a prized wildlife sanctuary any  serious damage, authorities said. The Bolsa Chica wetlands, home to several  endangered species of birds, was threatened for a time early Thursday as the  oil slick drifted northeast from the leaking 800-foot tanker, which apparently  struck its own anchor as it attempted to moor off Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> About a dozen oil-coated birds were picked up Thursday by volunteers and  biologists, who set up a command post and wildlife treatment center on the sand  south of the Huntington Beach Pier. So far, 25 oil-covered birds have  reportedly been recovered, of which eight have died.  </P> <P> "Hitting the beaches is obviously a disaster for us -- oil up and down the  beaches, the marinas, into the boats, just one thing after another," said  Newport Beach City Councilman Clarence J. Turner. "The whole area is critical."  </P> <P> As scores of anxious environmentalists, local officials and state experts  monitored the worst spill in Southern California in two decades, the purplish  slick -- about 2 miles long and 4 1/2 miles wide -- had drifted slowly most of  the day.  </P> <P> Officials said it was too large to encircle with a boom, so cleanup efforts  focused on scooping up the light crude from the damaged tanker.  </P> <P> Federal officials had initially ruled out using chemical dispersants because of  their toxic nature. But on Thursday, the Coast Guard was seeking permission  from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Fish  and Game to employ dispersants to break up the slick. A decision is expected  sometime today.  </P> <P> Investigators zeroed in on one of the ship's anchors as the apparent cause of  the 7,000-barrel spill late Wednesday afternoon in relatively shallow coastal  waters. The 21-year-old tanker attempted to moor offshore when the port-side  anchor apparently punctured the single-hulled vessel, the ship's owner said.  </P> <P> Thousands of gallons of oil poured through a three-foot gash before emergency  teams capped the leak early Thursday. The tanker, in a routine maneuver, was  preparing to unload its cargo of crude oil through underwater pipelines leading  to a Santa Fe Springs refinery.  </P> <P> The anchor theory was supported by Coast Guard officials. "It's very likely the  anchor," said Chief Warrant Officer Dan Dewell. "Our investigators have have  seen the damage to the anchor." Another Coast Guard officer said: "The anchor  is now bent like a banana."  </P> <P> Although the cause of the spill is still under investigation, the ship's owner  said that alcohol tests performed Wednesday night on the tanker's captain,  second mate and pilot -- administered by Coast Guard officials in the presence  of Navy investigators -- appeared to be negative. The results of drug tests,  however, will not be known for at least two days.  </P> <P> Owners of the tanker, American Trading Transportation Co. of New York, deployed  divers to assess the damage to the ship.  </P> <P> A stream of local and state politicians descended on Huntington Beach Thursday,  staging a series of press conferences to voice support for cleanup efforts and  to raise questions about oil drilling and tanker movement in Southern  California coastal waters.  </P> <P> "I hope this oil spill sends a strong message to Sacramento and Washington,"  Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy said at a morning press conference on the beach  overlooking the spill. "It was just pure dumb luck we didn't have a tragedy. We  shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security."  </P> <P> In Washington, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said he would meet  with President Bush to brief him on the accident, adding that the oil company  and owners of the tanker expressed their "commitment to me" to help in cleaning  up the oil.  </P> <P> As the spill cleanup moved into its second day, protests from offshore drilling  opponents grew.  </P> <P> The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization, said  little comfort could be taken in the fact that most of the spill had remained  offshore or that cleanup operations were under way.  </P> <P> "Even though the flow of oil has been stopped, the ability of the oil industry  and the government to clean up the 300,000 gallons that were spilled into the  Pacific Ocean is pathetic," the NRDC said in a statement.  </P> <P> Lynne Edgerton of the council's Los Angeles office said: "The spreading slick  from the impaled American Trader presents an imminent threat to the  ecologically important wetlands of Bolsa Chica, Anaheim Bay and Upper Newport,  some of the healthiest wetlands left in Southern California."  </P> <P> The National Ocean Industries Assn. issued a statement asserting that the spill  should not be used as a reason to delay oil leasing off the California coast or  any other state.  </P> <P> The trade group said that since 1970, there have been only 10 oil spills in  excess of 1,000 barrels on the outer continental shelf. None of those spills  caused significant environmental damage, it said.  </P> <P> "Critics of offshore energy development must not be allowed to confuse the  facts in an effort to shut down one of the nation's safest sources of future  energy supplies," the association said.  </P> <P> Despite the warnings, officials said that so far the environmental impact has  been remarkably minimal in the worst oil spill since the catastrophic 1969  Santa Barbara spill, when 3.2 million gallons of crude fouled beaches for  months and killed thousands of shore birds.  </P> <P> "We got lucky; it could have been a lot worse," said biologist Victor Leipzig,  executive director of the Bolsa Chica Conservancy, a grass-roots environmental  group.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach officials, who declared a state of emergency, met Thursday  night to map out cleanup strategies, keeping their fingers crossed that their  shoreline would be spared major damage.  </P> <P> "We've been dodging bullets for 24 hours," City Councilman Jim Silva said.  "This is one of the most popular beaches in California. It would be a shame if  we lost it."  </P> <P> Fear persisted, however, that the oil could wreak environmental havoc if it  reaches shore in quantity.  </P> <P> "Clearly, if the wind and currents shift and it starts moving in, we're going  to have what we always said -- significant shoreline impacts," said Brian  Baird, an oil spill expert with the California Coastal Commission.  </P> <P> Department of Fish and Game director Peter Bontadelli said that if the oil hits  the Bolsa Chica wetlands, upper Newport Harbor and the mouth of the Santa Ana  River, it would take 2 1/2 years for the ecosystem to recover. The Bolsa Chica  wetlands, the focus of intense battles between environmentalists and  developers, is home to dozens of bird species, including the light-footed  clapper rail and the least tern, both endangered species.  </P> <P> "The wetlands are the key to all marine life, as well as shore birds and  wintering water fowl," Bontadelli said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, British Petroleum confirmed Thursday that the spilled oil was  Alaskan North Slope crude, the same oil that gushed from the Exxon Valdez last  March.  </P> <P> However, California's warmer climate may cause the oil to dissipate sooner than  it did in Alaska's Prince William Sound, as well as making it appear lighter in  color.  </P> <P> "With warmer water temperatures, the (more volatile components of the oil)  would (dissipate) quicker," said Charles Webster, BP's manager of crisis  management.  </P> <P> "As far as the persistence of what's left, it's probably not a great deal  different (from Valdez), except it might remain more liquid than it would if it  were in an extremely cold climate," Webster said.  </P> <P> A federal emergency response team considered attempting to clean up the oil by  using chemical dispersants or setting the oil slick on fire. But both options  were ruled out after reviewing the scene, said Kathleen Shimmin of the EPA.  Both ideas were abandoned because of health concerns.  </P> <P> "It's too close to land," Shimmin said. "We would never consider using  dispersement if mechanical cleanup is working, and in this case it's working. .  . . We'd use putting toxic chemicals into the environment and posing a  potential hazard to the wildlife to clean up a spill as a last step."  </P> <P> The use of chemical dispersants is controversial because they are toxic to  marine life and because their effectiveness is uneven, according to the  National Academy of Sciences. State Fish and Game officials said that if  dispersants are used, the chemicals would likely injure snails, halibut and  other bottom-dwelling creatures. It could also kill fish larvae in the spill  area.  </P> <P> "That's the trade-off for not hitting sensitive coastal areas," said Fish and  Game spokesman Curt Taucher.  </P> <P> Ecological experts and environmentalists who visited the scene said the oil  slick threatens to sicken or kill species all through the marine food chain --  from the microscopic plankton that float in seawater, through mussels and  anchovies and sardines, up to sea lions whose fur can be matted by the oil,  leaving them vulnerable to the cold.  </P> <P> Cleanup efforts centered around several large skimming vessels that were  attempting to scoop up the oil. Booms were placed around the front of the  tanker to contain spilled oil near the hole in the hull, but the size of the  larger slick made the use of skimmers necessary.  </P> <P> Mike Murphy, vice president of American Trading, said the company considers  tanker skipper Robert La Ware to be "an able and experienced seaman."  </P> <P> "He has been with our company 30 years and he's an extremely experienced master  on the West Coast," Murphy told reporters. "He has put this ship and many  others on moorings many, many times."  </P> <P> Shortly after dawn Thursday, about 150 spectators and volunteers gathered near  the Huntington Beach pier to watch the tanker wallowing offshore and look for  oil on the beach.  </P> <P> "I have lived in Huntington Beach all my life," said Sam Cracchiolo. "But never  in a million years did I think this would happen here."  </P> <P> Residents as far as two miles inland said they could smell the spilled oil.  Police dispatchers said they received several dozen calls from concerned  residents.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo), chairman of the Assembly Select  Committee on Spill Prevention, said that the American Trader's ruptured tanks  contained about 20,000 barrels of crude and that about 7,000 barrels were lost.  </P> <P> "The amount of oil spilled from the American Trader is about 3% of what was  spilled in the Exxon Valdez tragedy," Lempert said.  </P> <P> In Sacramento, the chairman of a task force that studied the Valdez spill in  Alaska warned state lawmakers that they cannot rely on a private company alone  to clean up a spill as large as the one off Huntington Beach, and added that  cleanup costs will skyrocket if much of the oil hits the sandy shore.  </P> <P> "Once you've got it on the beach, even if you have a successful cleanup, you're  going to incur a tremendous cost," said Walter B. Parker, chairman of the  Alaska Oil Spill Commission.  </P> <P> The following Times staff members contributed to the coverage of the Huntington  Beach oil spill.

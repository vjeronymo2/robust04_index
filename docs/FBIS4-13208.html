			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Full text" of speech by King Hassan II at the royal palace </F> in Marrakech, Morocco on 15 April--all quotation marks as  received]    [Text] Ministerial conference Marrakech, Apr. 16 (MAP) --  King Hassan II, flanked by Crown Prince Sidi Mohammed, hosted  Friday [April 15] at the royal palace here a banquet in honor of  participants in the GATT ministerial conference held in  Marrakech this April 12-15.    Here is the full text of the royal speech delivered before  delegations of over 124 countries: "Mr. Chairman, honorable  premiers, honorable ministers, Mr. Director General, honorable  delegates, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,    We, and the world at large with us, have just crossed a  watershed, one of those decisive moments in history in which  mankind unfailingly taps its wellspring of energy and  psychological strength to launch a new grand design, conjure up  hope of a brighter future and dispel the specter of despondency  or disheartenment.    The atmosphere of this moment we are sharing calls to mind  the unforgettable memory of the Anfa conference that took place  in Casablanca in 1943, at which we had the privilege of  accompanying his majesty our father, may God have him in his  mercy. The purpose of the conference, attended notably by  President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, was to prepare  the allied disembarkation in Europe, but it marked the beginning  not only of the allies' long march to victory but also of the  far-reaching movement of liberation of the people still under  colonial rule.    Those men, whose action and abnegation restored freedom and  democracy in the world, knew that the cessation of hostilities  was not the same thing as peace, and that as the same causes  will produce the same effects, they would be unable to establish  enduring peace except in a setting favorable to lasting economic  growth. The lessons they drew from the 1930s and in particular  from the impact of protectionism on world-wide economic activity  and security decisively shaped the drafting of the San Francisco  Charter and the Bretton Woods Agreements. The aborted  International Trade Organization would have rounded off the  institutional framework for the multilateral management of the  world economy, but the vagaries of politics dashed the hopes of  those architects of the peacetime world.    Thus, we have had to wait almost half-a-century in order at  last to manage to bring the privileges of power within the sway  of law.    By bringing into being the world trade organization today,  we  are enshrining the rule of law in international economic and  trade relations, thus setting universal rules and disciplines  over the temptations of unilateralism and the law of the jungle.  This collective profession of faith actually marks the end of  the colonial pact and embodies genuine interdependence.  Regardless of the size of our economies, from now on we shall  all enjoy the same rights and be subject to the same  obligations. we share the same goals and must meet the same  challenges: Tackling the scourge of unemployment, redressing  the problem of social exclusion, or finding appropriate ways of  responding to our environmental or other concerns.    The fact that the trade negotiations that we have just  solemnly concluded were launched in Punta del Este and ended in  Marrakech, in other words, in two countries of the south, must  be seen as heralding a new age in which the antagonisms between  the industrialized and developing countries will fade away. The  alliances forged during these negotiations between partners  having different levels of development show that this process is  now under way. It is up to us to deepen it and strengthen it.    The rise in the number of contracting parties, which lends a  universal dimension to the agreements just signed, together with  the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin wall, mark the end of  the ideological cleavages that have hampered the smooth  development of the world economy. Henceforth, four fifths of  the world's population live in market economies and over a  hundred countries have embarked on the privatization of  public-sector enterprises.    Lastly, the fact that the Marrakech meeting coincides with  the implementation of the agreements between the PLO and Israel  is a good omen. Those agreements, enabling the Palestinian flag  to fly over part of its territory, are the beginning of a  process that will finally extinguish the oldest hotbed in the  world.    All of this means that the world of tomorrow can scarcely  resemble the one in which we have lived until today. Changing  production systems and consumption patterns, the emergence of  new multimedia technologies and the rapid growth of related  services will further speed up the globalization of markets for  goods, services and capital.    This globalization could herald greater inequalities among  countries and aggravate the symptoms of social exclusion which  may be observed in the rich as the less prosperous countries.  It therefore calls for the creation and use of new machinery of  collective solidarity as well as a new approach to economic and  social development problems. The reason why many developing  countries have courageously restructured their economies in  order to integrate them better into the international economy is  that they are convinced of the virtues of financial discipline  and of the need to cushion the ensuing transitional social cost.  This cost requires a counterpart from the developed countries  in the form of corresponding adjustments favoring markets access  and transparent conditions of fair competition, in particular  through greater monetary stability.    The special situation of Africa deserves a particular  attention. Morocco, a Muslim, Arab and African country, was a  pioneer of emancipation movements in Africa and it is fully  aware of the challenges to be faced. We must assess the  situation with lucidity and admit that the results of forty  years of independence are mixed. Of course mistakes have been  made, successes have been achieved here and there, but no one  can ignore the latent risks of a situation in which the  imbalance in levels of development is so sharp. We must not  misjudge the shape of the future nor the danger of excluding a  whole continent from the global economy. After all the measures  taken to save Africa, we should ask ourselves if the time is not  ripe for a veritable Marshall plan to alleviate the poverty and  suffering of millions of people."    "Mr. Chairman, honorable premiers, honorable ministers, Mr.  Director General, honorable delegates, excellencies, ladies, and  gentlemen,    When we invited you to consider signing the final act of the  Uruguay round in Marrakech, an invitation which you did us the  honor and pleasure of accepting, we were motivated by a number  of important considerations.    To cite only some of them, for many centuries Marrakech has  been a crossroads of trade and civilization between Africa and  Europe and between the latter and the Arab world.    It was in Marrakech, in 1788, that the exchange of letters  between Sultan Sidi Mohammed Ben 'Abdellah and George Washington  led to the Kingdom of Morocco being the first nation to  recognize the independence of the United States of America.  These texts are still in force and deal with peace, friendship,  and freedom of navigation and trade.    It was also in Marrakech, in 1856, that an exchange of  diplomatic instruments took place between Queen Victoria and  Sultan Moulay Abderrahmane. The trade agreement which was the  subject of this exchange set up the frame for the majority of  treaties of the time. Its modernity and conformity with the  rules and disciplines we have just adopted today would surprise  many people: The most-favored nation clause was used in it for  the first time.    Thus it is in one of the oldest trading nations in the world  that the most complex and most important trade negotiations in  history have been concluded.    By putting its signature beside those of the contracting  parties present here, the Kingdom of Morocco is reaffirming a  tradition of free trade from which it never swerved from its  origin through the last world war.    This tradition is not simply confined to trade, but embraces  the wider area of the options facing society. In adopting  pluralism and prohibiting a single-party regime in its first  constitution proclaimed upon independence, Morocco was fully  aware of the fact that a truly liberal economic policy must  first of all be based on the values of democracy, and of  political and trade union pluralism.    Its steadfast determination to promote an economic system  which gives pride of place to private initiative and the  stimulus of equitable competition has allowed Morocco to follow  the path of sustainable growth, remedy structural imbalances and  attract foreign investment.    The experience we have gained over the centuries has allowed  us to establish our vocation as a land of reflection, courage  and innovation and has taught us the virtues of humility and the  essential need for lucidity.    This leads us to conclude that, although the Marrakech  agreements constitute a cornerstone of our common structure,  they cannot be considered as an end in themselves.    These agreements should rather give us food for thought and  spur our creative imagination for building a new international  order.    We believe that the conditions have just been provided for a  collective and calm reflection on the functioning of the global  economy in the next century.    Trade is only one element in a trilogy in which monetary and  financial issues are interdependent. The impact of the monetary  policies followed by the major actors in the international  economy often leads to counterproductive effects which  jeopardize what has been achieved by our restructuring efforts.    In this respect, we propose studying with your respective  heads of state the possibility of establishing an  intergovernmental group to study the new mechanisms for  international economic negotiations with a view to:    -- improved coordination of action by the IMF, the IBRD  [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development] and the  WTO [World Trade Organization]    -- a greater contribution by countries of the south to  concerted implementation of a strategy to give the global  economy a new impetus so as to come up with the appropriate  response to the scourge of the twenty first century, which will  be unemployment.    "Mr. Chairman, honorable premiers, honorable ministers, Mr.  Director General, honorable delegates, excellencies, ladies and  gentlemen,    We give thanks to God for having allowed our meeting to be  one of those which, in contributing to international  cooperation, widen its scope, strengthen its bases and  consolidate its rules. The Marrakech charter which concludes  this meeting is a further valuable contribution to the series of  international conventions on which our world of today has based  its unity, turning away from the causes of strife and enmity to  become part of the cycle of relations promoting the reign of  peace and understanding.    When Morocco expresses the pride it takes in having hosted  the meeting, it simply is rightfully expressing its aspirations  and its choice to always remain open onto the world and adhere  to the principles of international cooperation.    We should all therefore welcome the gigantic step forward  towards broader and more intensive international cooperation,  this progress towards the international solidarity which we hope  will be the hallmark of the next century. And more than any  other promise, it is the confirmation of this solidarity that we  hope for from the proposed new world order."</p>

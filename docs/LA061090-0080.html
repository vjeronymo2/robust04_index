			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF:  </P> <P> ** 1/2 LITA FORD, "Stiletto," RCA. Albums are rated from one star (poor) to  five stars (a classic).  </P> <P> Reunited with Mike Chapman, producer of her last (and first platinum) LP, Ford  rides her sex-bomb goddess image, serviceable vocals and one o' the lads  guitarwork hard 'n' heavy for almost one full side of this LP. While "Hungry"  is pure POP! and "Dedication " is pure raunch, "Lisa" is an honest-to-goodness  power ballad about her mom (!), and "The Ripper" a showcase for Ford's frenetic  axe murderings. Unfortunately, Side 2 sports a dumbbell version of Alice  Cooper's genuinely stoopid "Only Women Bleed" and notta lotta anythang else.  DON WALLER  </P></p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Forestry Commission waste criticised THE UK Forestry Commission could earn 15 per cent more revenue from timber sales if it improved its harvesting plans and stuck to them when carrying out tree felling, according to a critical report by the National Audit Office. The report, published yesterday, says the commission is foregoing Pounds 10.8m of income from timber sales, which in 1991-92 was Pounds 73m. But it acknowledges that a cause of the problem is that the commission has to meet diverse non-financial objectives set by the government. The NAO report to the House of Commons public accounts committee says its analysis showed that 49 per cent of trees were being felled on average more than five years before or after their age of maximum return, meaning that Pounds 5.6m of income was being foregone. This was because harvesting plans drawn up by the Edinburgh-based commission on the basis of its inventory are refined by local managers to take account of wind damage, environmental considerations and differences between actual and recorded stock levels. Even then, the NAO found, some 50 per cent of timber intended for harvesting in local plans was actually obtained from forest areas that were not in the plans. On average trees felled were three to five years younger than those planned to be harvested, meaning that an estimated further Pounds 5.2m of income was being foregone. The NAO said the commission needed a formal system to monitor variations between planned and actual harvesting. But it noted that that it had cut the cost of tree felling by 42 per cent in real terms since 1980. The commission manages 900,000 hectares of forest with an expected value of Pounds 2.8bn. It is expected by the Treasury to make a real rate of return of 3 per cent on its plantations, but also to meet the government's objectives of enhancing nature conservation, breaking up the uniform forests and providing recreational facilities.</p>

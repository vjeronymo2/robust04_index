			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Glaxo's sweeter pill Glaxo delighted its fans yesterday by flexing its financial muscles. Its 29 per cent interim dividend increase comes on the back of Pounds 1bn of interim profits and makes it all the harder to understand why Glaxo's shares have underperformed the market by 19 per cent over the past year, moving to a substantial yield premium. It takes an extraordinarily dim view of the world to believe Glaxo is not capable of sustaining above-average dividend growth for the foreseeable future. With Pounds 2bn in the bank to fund any strategic moves, Glaxo could afford to divert almost all its free cash flow into shareholders' pockets, promising a cash bonanza. Glaxo's underlying business is certainly demonstrating resilience in trying times. Zantac still produced a 5 per cent sales increase at constant exchange rates - although that growth may finally slow this year. New products, though, are performing well with Imigran, in particular, beginning to deliver on its promises. Despite the successes, Glaxo cannot conclusively counter the doubters who believe industry margins are about to change for good. As yet, such doubts are unanswerable. It may be that Glaxo's worrying sales falls in Germany and Italy merely reflect local difficulties and cyclical influences. Then again, they may really presage deeper structural changes. Glaxo appreciates the need to adapt fast in the US where Merck's merger with Medco threatens to transform the marketplace. Glaxo boasts the financial strength to contemplate any number of options. But the expectation of such moves may limit any bounce in Glaxo's shares in the meantime.</p>

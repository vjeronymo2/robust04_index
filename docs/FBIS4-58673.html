			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Dubai, May 5 (AFP)--Heavy gunfire broke out  around Yemen's presidential palace in Sanaa early Thursday and  rival northern and southern forces bombed the country's two main  airports in Sanaa and Aden.    Diplomatic sources contacted from the United Arab Emirates  said a plan to evacuate Western nationals could be put into  action later in the day.    No southern units are normally deployed in the capital, but  a  Western diplomat was unable to say whether the gunfire round the  palace of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was between factions of  the northern troops.    One source said Sanaa airport had been closed to air traffic  after being bombed by southern warplanes but that "the runway  was usable."    Anti-aircraft guns blazed into action in Sanaa as southern  fighter planes loyal to Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid dropped  bombs in a raid on government buildings and the radio and  television centre there, an AFP correspondent there reported.

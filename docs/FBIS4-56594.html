			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 15 April  1994 on pages 1, 11 reports that FSLN [Sandinist National  Liberation Front] leader Bayardo Arce no longer believes the  FSLN will split at the extraordinary congress to be held in May.  He says that, although he had noted in an interview he had given  in March that a split was possible, the risk disappeared when  the party united behind its opposition to the IMF agreement and  the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. Arce affirms that  Sandinist factions also agree that the Sandinist Assembly is the  party's highest authority between congresses and that candidates  for the new National Directorate will come from the Assembly,  which will be elected at the congress. The congress will also  elect the secretary general and deputy secretary general, who  will be chosen from the National Directorate. Arce believes out  that fear of "caudillismo" will be laid to rest by "a clear  definition of functions and collegial handling of  responsibilities."</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: TOURISM, MUSEUM GRANTS TO BE STUDIED  </P> <P> The Ventura City Council will consider today granting $400,000 to the Ventura  Visitor and Convention Bureau and $17,500 to the Ventura County Museum of Art  for the 1990-91 fiscal year that began in June.  </P> <P> Both grants were included in the current city budget and are expected to  receive the council's support.  </P> <P> Under an agreement with the city, the bureau will use the money to promote  tourism with brochures, pamphlets, posters, periodicals and convention  materials. It also would track visitor statistics, monitor legislation  affecting local tourism and present the council with a marketing plan outlining  the bureau's strategy for wooing tourism to Ventura.  </P> <P> The museum grant would go toward acquisition, development and promotion of  historical collections, artifacts and programs, said Assistant City Manager  Lauraine D. Brekke.  </P> <P> The agreement with the museum states that the city expects the museum  eventually to become self-sufficient. "It is not intended that the museum will  rely on the city for support," the document states. Ventura began funding the  museum in 1986.  </P> <P> Brekke said the grants are similar to allocations that the bureau and the  museum received last year. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL  </P></p>

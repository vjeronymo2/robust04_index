			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark weaker on rate hopes THE D-MARK was weaker against the dollar and most European currencies yesterday amid expectations that the Bundesbank would cut the rate at which it offers wholesale funds to commercial banks in its weekly money market operation, writes James Blitz. The German central bank yesterday announced a variable rate repurchase agreement - or repo - in this week's tenders. The lowest accepted rate last week was 8.17 per cent and there were strong expectations yesterday that the rate would be cut today to 8.10 per cent or lower. Poorer than expected economic indicators in Germany also raised expectations that the Bundesbank would veer on the side of easing monetary policy today. The unemployment level in western Germany in March rose by an adjusted 70,000 last month when the market had been expecting a 45,000 increase. Industrial orders for February were down 2.2 per cent on the month, when the market had been expecting a small net rise. After drifting lower against the German currency on Monday, the dollar closed yesterday a touch stronger. It ended in London at DM1.6125, up nearly 1 3/4 pfennigs. In New York it closed at DM1.6108. However, some analysts continued to be bearish for the US currency in the medium term. The economics team at James Capel in London said the dollar's bull run is at an end for the time being. Their economists suggest that the recent break through the DM1.60 level should lead to a sell-off to DM1.54 and, if this level fails to hold, to DM1.51. However, they also believe the prospect of higher US inflation in the second half of 1993 might lead to higher short-term US interest rates and a rise to DM1.80 by the year-end. The prospects of lower German rates also gave another lift to the French franc, which broke through the FFr3.39 level against the D-Mark in the European morning and spent much of the day on firm ground. The franc finished in London at FFr3.384 from a previous close of FFr3.391. Some dealers reported that the Bank of France had intervened in the market, buying the French currency when it looked set to break through critical chart points. Overall, however, the franc was underpinned by expectations that the French authorities would cut official interest rates tomorrow, when the Bank of France operates in the money market, depending on how much the Bundesbank eases policy today. The Italian lira performed more strongly against the D-Mark in the European afternoon after being pushed towards the L996 level by the continuing political turmoil in Italy. The Italian currency closed at L988.9 from a previous L993.0 Sterling also enjoyed a strong performance against the D-Mark, ending 1 1/2 pfennigs up at DM2.4425.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> CARRINGTON HAS FUN AT LE CAFE  </P> <P> Monday evening at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks, the 24-year-old drummer Terri Lyne  Carrington informed her audience that she and her fellow musicians were just  having fun and that the music would be non-electric. "I hope you're not  disappointed," she added.  </P> <P> No apology was called for. The quartet set its sights higher than Carrington  did on her recent album. There were no pop songs, no vocals, no commercial  concessions. The outcome was a dazzling performance by four brilliant young  musicians (in this company, pianist Patrice Rushen at 35 seemed like a  veteran).  </P> <P> Carrington announced that she would play some "obscure standards," though to  most of the crowd such vehicles as "Solar" by Miles Davis and "Oleo" by Sonny  Rollins could hardly have been unfamiliar. The ballads, Charles Lloyd's "Forest  Flower" and Horace Silver's "Peace," also are well-enough known to most jazz  fans.  </P> <P> These tunes provided perfect settings for Greg Osby, whose alto sax was tough,  fluent and never derivative; for Rushen, who too rarely has a chance to stretch  out on a straight-ahead jazz basis and, most remarkably, for Brian Bromberg,  whose technique on the upright bass is as original as Stanley Jordan's on the  guitar. His left hand at times performed duties normally reserved for the right  hand, and vice versa; sometimes both at once, producing lines and chords and  rhythmic convolutions that almost defied belief.  </P> <P> Carrington's drums kept a firm hold, her time feeling impeccable, her drive and  power catalytically irresistible. Once in a while, her offbeat bass drum  accents tended to dominate excessively, like so many thunder claps, but overall  she sustained the unity of this virtually new group (Bromberg had never worked  with her before).  </P> <P> Carrington's idea of "just having fun" deserves recorded preservation. One can  only hope that her next CD will be fashioned along these unswervingly  mettlesome lines.LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

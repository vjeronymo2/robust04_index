			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> GARDENA BUDGET PROVIDES FOR 13 MORE POLICE OFFICERS  </P> <P> The Gardena City Council has approved an increase of about $700,000 to the  Gardena Police Department's 1989-90 budget, enabling the department to hire 13  officers during the next two years to increase the force to 100 officers.  </P> <P> The increase, part of a $34.7-million city budget approved by the council  Tuesday night, will enable police to add a roving patrol car, which is not  assigned to a specific area, to the five that cruise sections of the city, said  Chief Richard K. Propster.  </P> <P> The increase brings the annual Police Department budget to $8.5 million.  </P> <P> Despite a 30% decrease in violent crimes in the city so far this year from  1988, and an overall decrease in crime of about 9%, the additional patrol car  is needed to enable officers "to respond to those areas of the city where  there's a demonstrated need for a high visibility patrol," Propster said.  </P> <P> The additional patrol car would be available in about two years, the estimated  time it will take to hire and train the 13 new officers needed to staff it  round-the-clock, officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Emergency Vehicle  </P> <P> The Fire Department budget increased by about $250,000, including funding for a  specially equipped paramedic-fire truck. Funding for the vehicle was approved  by the city in the wake of recent emergency room closures in the South Bay,  officials said.  </P> <P> The total city budget has increased by 12.5% over last year's budget of $30.9  million, and no new taxes or fee increases are anticipated, said City Manager  Kenneth Landau.  </P> <P> The council also approved a proposal Tuesday to adopt the budget every two  years, with a one year council review, rather than on an annual basis. The  two-year budget cycle will assist the city in formulating long-range financial  plans and will cut down on time and money needed to prepare a budget on a  yearly basis, city officials said.  </P></p>

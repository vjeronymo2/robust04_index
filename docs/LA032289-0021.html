			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROSECUTORS UNABLE TO LINK NOLAN TO REAGAN SIGNATURE FORGERY CASE  </P> <P> State prosecutors sought to indict former Assembly Republican Leader Pat Nolan  in connection with the forgery of former President Ronald Reagan's signature on  campaign letters but decided after presenting the case to a grand jury that  they could not prove that Nolan had committed a crime, according to a deputy  attorney general in charge of the case.  </P> <P> Instead, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp obtained an indictment only charging  Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) with a single count of forgery in  connection with the letters, which were sent to several hundred thousand  California voters in 1986.  </P> <P> "We had gone in (to the Sacramento County Grand Jury) looking to obtain an  indictment against both Assemblyman Lewis and Assemblyman Nolan," W. Scott  Thorpe, the supervising deputy attorney general, said in an interview. "But  after evaluating all the evidence, we just determined that there was  insufficient evidence to indict anyone but Lewis."  </P> <P> Thorpe declined to provide further details of the Justice Department's strategy  in the case, but his comments shed new light on a 350-page transcript of the  grand jury's proceedings that was unsealed Friday. The transcript shows  repeated attempts by Thorpe and co-prosecutor John A. Gordnier to place Nolan  in the chain of events that led to the mailing of as many as 480,000 of the  phony endorsements in six Assembly races.  </P> <P> Ultimately, however, no witness linked Nolan directly to the order to send the  letters without White House authorization.  </P> <P> Nolan, of Glendale, who resigned as Assembly GOP leader in November, could not  be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Thorpe told the grand jury in his opening statement Feb. 1 that at least two  assemblymen -- Nolan and Lewis -- "knew prior to the letters being distributed  that there had been no authorization from the President or the White House or  the Republican National Committee." He asked the jury to consider charging  Nolan and Lewis with forgery and conspiracy.  </P> <P> The prosecutors called nine witnesses, including two Republican aides, Henry  Olsen and Richard Temple, and a GOP consultant, Tim Macy, who were directly  involved either in seeking White House approval for the letters or mailing them  to voters. All three said they conferred regularly with Nolan and Lewis.  </P> <P> Lewis was implicated by both Olsen and Macy, and all three operatives testified  that Nolan told them to lie to the White House to protect him from  embarrassment after the phony endorsements were exposed. But no witness  provided firsthand knowledge of Nolan giving the directive to mail the letters  without White House consent.  </P> <P> Macy testified that Lewis told him that "they were debating whether they were  going (to) ask for approval or not."  </P> <P> "Did he define who 'they' was?" Macy was asked.  </P> <P> "The Assembly Republican leadership," Macy answered. "The handful of people  that Assemblyman Nolan would have around him helping making those decisions in  the campaigns."  </P> <P> The Republicans did submit drafts of their letters for approval, but the White  House rejected them in mid-October, Olsen said. The President's aides suggested  instead that the Californians use generic, "fill-in-the-blank" letters that  could be adapted for any candidate. Even these were supposed to be returned to  the White House for final approval before being mailed.  </P> <P> When he told Lewis of the White House rejection, Olsen said, Lewis told him the  unauthorized letters would "probably go out anyway."  </P> <P> Macy said the order to send the letters was given to him by Lewis in a  long-distance telephone conversation Oct. 24. Macy, in Sacramento, called  Lewis, who was at a GOP leadership meeting in the Fullerton district office of  Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-La Habra), and asked if the letters should be  mailed, he testified.  </P> <P> Lewis put him on hold, conferred with the other lawmakers and returned to the  phone to give the go-ahead, Macy said.  </P> <P> "They wanted the letters mailed," Macy said.  </P> <P> Nolan told him later that he was at the meeting, and that Assemblyman Dennis  Brown (R-Los Alamitos) also attended, Macy testified. He said Lewis told him  Johnson was there. None of the lawmakers was asked to testify before the grand  jury.  </P> <P> Thorpe said Nolan and Lewis were not called because they were targets of the  probe. Brown was not asked to testify because he had exercised his 5th  Amendment rights against self-incrimination.  </P> <P> Johnson was interviewed by prosecutors, who determined that his recollection of  the meeting was too weak to add anything to the case.  </P> <P> That left Macy's account of the telephone conversation with Lewis as the only  evidence implicating a legislator in the decision.  </P> <P> Testimony such as the following was typical of how prosecutors repeatedly fell  short in their effort to prove that Nolan was connected to the scheme:  </P> <P> Macy said Nolan was aware that the letters mailed by the Republicans were not  the generic forms received from the White House.  </P> <P> "So he knew that that was (a) different set of letters, that they were not the  same. Is that correct?" Thorpe asked.  </P> <P> "Correct," Macy replied.  </P> <P> But he could not say whether Nolan knew this before the election.  </P> <P> "I don't remember," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBITAILLE ICES IT IN OVERTIME;  </P> <P> KINGS' 7-6 VICTORY OVER CAPITALS ENDS ROAD WINLESS STREAK  </P> <P> When Luc Robitaille and Bernie Nicholls saw that John Tonelli was going to fire  a long shot at the Washington Capitals' net early in the overtime, they both  rushed in to help sweep up, if necessary.  </P> <P> They were both swinging, but it was Robitaille who finally brushed the puck  past relief goalie Clint Malarchuk 1 minute 39 seconds into the overtime period  to give the Kings a 7-6 victory -- their first victory on the road since just  before Christmas. They had gone 0-5-3 since winning Dec. 23 at Vancouver.  </P> <P> "It's about time we won on the road," Robitaille said. "If we want to win in  the playoffs, we're going to have to start winning on the road."  </P> <P> While Robitaille was dancing on the toes of his skates in celebration, a groan  went up from the 18,130 fans at the Capital Centre, who had their hopes set on  a replay of the Kings' January visit, when they led, 4-2, but finished in a 4-4  tie.  </P> <P> That game crossed Robitaille's mind when the Kings were ahead, 4-1, in the  second period.  </P> <P> "I said to myself, 'Oh, I hope we're not going to do the same thing we did the  last time,' " Robitaille said. "At 4-4, uh-oh. At 5-4 (after Robitaille's first  goal put the Kings up at 3:55 of the third period), I thought we would win.  But, after that, I didn't have time to think anymore. We just had to keep  scoring more goals.  </P> <P> "That was a lot of goals. All you can think is, hey, we have to get another  one."  </P> <P> During regulation, the Kings' six goals were scored by six players -- Nicholls,  Tim Watters, Tonelli, Jay Miller, Robitaille and Wayne Gretzky.  </P> <P> Nicholls scored after the puck bounced back from a block by Larry Murphy,  answering the goal that Rod Langway had scored earlier, and the first period  ended in a 1-1 tie.  </P> <P> Watters scored on another close-in goal to put the Kings ahead, 2-1, early in  the second period. Tonelli put a rebound over prone Washington goalie Pete  Peeters at 4:07, and Miller followed up a shot by Ron Duguay just 18 seconds  later to give the Kings their 4-1 lead and to chase Peeters back to the bench.  </P> <P> Washington Coach Bryan Murray said that he made the goalie change because  Peeters had given up three quick goals, and four on 9 shots.  </P> <P> "I was hoping that the change would make a difference, and it did," Murray  said. "Our team was able to get back into the game."  </P> <P> The Capitals scored the next three in a row. Dave Christian scored from the  right side on a pass that Kelly Miller pushed across from the left side. Geoff  Courtnall pulled the Capitals within a goal in the last minute of the second  period with a slap shot down the middle, and Mike Gartner tied it, 4-4, just  2:05 into the third period.  </P> <P> After Robitaille's goal made it 5-4, Courtnall's second tied it at 6:22. It was  Courtnall skating in on Glenn Healy again when Watters ran him down and checked  him -- into Healy. While the two were still in a heap, Steve Leach came into  the picture, picking up the loose puck and putting it into the net to put the  Capitals ahead, 6-5.  </P> <P> Gretzky kept the Kings alive by taking a pass from Mike Allison behind the net  and putting it into the left corner of the net with 11 1/2 minutes left in  regulation.  </P> <P> As time ran out, Nicholls and Robitaille were attacking Malarchuk. One last  shot in regulation bounced off Malarchuk's shoulder and then off his mask,  according to the goalie.  </P> <P> There was no way they would both come up empty in the overtime. As Nicholls put  it: "Luc gets pretty hungry when the puck is down low like that. But it doesn't  matter who scores the goal, as long as it goes in."  </P> <P> Tonelli, who was pretty busy all night, had taken the puck away from Courtnall  to set up his high-scoring teammates with the game-winner.  </P> <P> "Johnny worked well tonight," Nicholls said. "The first shift, we had the  coaches shaking their heads again, but we kept working and kept working. It's  guys like Johnny Tonelli, who have those Stanley Cup rings, who are showing us  what it takes."  </P> <P> Robitaille noted how hard Tonelli had worked and added: "If you see that and  don't work hard, too, you feel kind of guilty."  </P> <P> The Kings (29-22-5) moved back ahead of Edmonton into second place in the  Smythe Division.  </P> <P> "Every team goes through a slump from time to time, and you just have to work  your way out of it," Nicholls said. "I'm not saying we're out of it yet, but  tonight was a good start."  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> After the Kings' loss to the Boston Bruins on Thursday night, owner Bruce  McNall again was asked about Coach Robbie Ftorek's status. McNall is still  saying that despite the slump, and despite the "problems" to which players have  obliquely referred, he wants to avoid a "revolving door of coaches" if at all  possible. Asked if he felt convinced that Ftorek is the right coach for the  Kings, McNall said: "No. Not necessarily. But I'm not necessarily sure that he  isn't, either. I'm not a thousand percent sure of anything right now. I'm the  same as the players and the coaches. I'm a little confused. I know there are  problems, but I don't have any brilliant answers. We'll have to see how it  plays out." McNall has issued no ultimatums and has set no time frame for  deciding on whether Ftorek's contract will be extended beyond this season. But,  when pressed, he said: "I will be mightily disappointed if we don't get out of  the first round of the playoffs."  </P> <P> Once again the Kings were outshot, but this time it was just by 28-26. They  have been outshot in five of their last 24 games. Their 19 shots at Boston  represented their lowest total of the season.  </P></p>

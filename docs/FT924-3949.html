			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: B Elliott returns to SE with package to cut debt SHARES in B Elliott, the struggling engineering group, were relisted yesterday with the announcement of a refinancing package, including a Pounds 16.3m debt-equity swap. The effect is to reduce the group's debt by Pounds 27m, and to provide the base from which it can concentrate on its profitable businesses, specialist machine tool manufacture and electrical engineering. Reconstruction was triggered by the collapse of the UK and European machine tool trade, its core business in the past. Share trading resumed at 3p, giving a market value of Pounds 1.6m, compared with 80p and Pounds 45m 18 months ago. Proposals include converting 20 old shares into one new share and a Pounds 2.5m placing and open offer. Falkner Moller Partners, a development capital group, and funds managed by Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures and the Independent Investment Company will subscribe in cash for 15.6m shares to raise Pounds 9.5m. The subscription gives Falkner a 40 to 46.7 per cent stale in Elliott, but the Takeover Panel has waived any requirement that Falkner make a general cash offer to all shareholders. Elliott's bankers will convert Pounds 16.3m of debt into new ordinary and preference shares. Mr Michael Frye, chief executive, said Elliott had successfully reconstructed the business after demand for machine tools had come to a standstill - 'the worst conditions in the industry since the 1930s'. Elliott reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 487,000 (Pounds 106,000), on turnover of Pounds 45.8m (Pounds 56m). Operating profit improved to Pounds 2.15m (Pounds 1.2m) but interest charges rose to Pounds 2.65m (Pounds 1.27m). There is no interim dividend. Losses per share were 2.36p (3.64p).</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Letter: Trust broken if pay review suspended Sir, With rumours mounting that the government is set to suspend the pay review bodies ('Salary review bodies could be overridden', October 28) the UK's 38,000 midwives are quite rightly feeling angry and betrayed. The pay review body may not have always delivered exactly what midwives wanted, but it has always been seen to be fair, to have provided stability and to have removed midwives from confrontation with government. Midwives have promised never to strike in pursuit of pay claims; they care too much for their clients' welfare. In recognition they only ask that the government deals fairly with them. Suspending the pay review body would challenge this trust. It cannot be right that the existence of the pay review body should be sacrificed on the altar of a public sector pay freeze. As general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives, I have written, together with my colleague at the Royal College of Nursing, to John Major, the prime minister, seeking urgent clarification of this situation. It cannot be right for Britain's midwives to pay for the hoped for economic recovery in this way. Ruth Ashton, general secretary, The Royal College of Midwives, 15 Mansfield Street, London W1M 0BE</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Motoring: Mercedes makes it easy - Stuart Marshall takes a cruise in the 300 SE IT WAS, one felt, what the planners had in mind when motorways were invented. The A26 Reims-Calais autoroute was so peaceful that I reckon it was carrying no more than 500 vehicles an hour when I drove along it last week. No road could have been safer and less stressful. Would the French police turn a blind eye to the 81 mph (130 kmh) limit being bent just a little? I believed they might. So, I set the cruise control for 86 mph (140 kmh), at which speed the Mercedes-Benz 300SE's tachometer read 4,000 rpm precisely. Drivers who think all motorways must be like Britain's congested M25 and M1 will find it hard to believe but I was able to hold this speed for more than an hour. Not once did I have to touch the brake or even reduce engine power by easing back the cruise control lever. And, no, it was not in the small hours but the middle of the day. The double-glazed, air-conditioned Mercedes loped along with as little background noise as you would find in an airliner's business class. Could I have chosen a better car to drive to Geneva and back for the motor show? I thought not. The new S-Class cars are big - longer than a BMW 735i, Jaguar XJ6 or Lexus LS400 and only six inches shorter than a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit. They are wider inside and have a bigger boot than any of their potential rivals. Engines range from the 300SE's 3.2-litre, 231-horsepower in-line six to 4.2-litre (286 bhp) and five-litre (326 bhp) V8s and the 600SEL's mighty six-litre, 408 bhp V12. Prices start at Pounds 43,700 and go up to Pounds 89,600, although this is not the whole story. The 300SE I drove would have cost around Pounds 51,500. Its leather seats, metallic paint, cruise control, automatic climate control, alloy wheels and radio/tape player were extras, although such things tend to be included as you go up-range. From the outside, there is no way of telling a 300SE from a 400SE or 500SE. A 600SEL stands out only because it is slightly longer. And a new S-Class saloon does not look as big as it really is. You notice its bulk only when driving on narrow roads, in dense traffic and, particularly, when parking in a multi-storey. Then, you bless the little rods (like mini-aerials) that pop-up automatically from the rear wings when you select reverse and mark the car's extremities. They make backing into a bay less of a problem but, with rear bumper touching the wall, you find the front one is still up to a metre beyond that of a lesser car parked alongside. The 300SE rides superbly. The occasional small jolt when one of the 60-series, low-profile tyres drops into a pothole comes as a reminder that the Mercedes is running on, not just above, the road surface. Handling, too, is supremely good, whether on sweeping bends or the hairpins of a mountain pass. The generously power-assisted steering is light for low-speed driving, precise when getting a move on. The massive seats, with the most resilient upholstery I have encountered in any Mercedes, made the entire 1,200-mile (1,930 km) return trip to Geneva a pleasure, never a penance. Inside, the ambience is an agreeable blend of soft leather and wood-veneered luxury with practical controls and traditional instrumentation. Even the clock has hands. Driven hard, the 300SE will reach 62 mph (100 kmh) from a standstill in nine seconds, and the top speed is said to be just over 140 mph (225 kmh). A 3.2-litre engine has to work energetically for a driver determined to exploit an almost two-ton car's performance to the full. Kick down into third or second on a hill and you find the in-line six is subdued but no longer near-silent. Mostly, I drove with an eye on the instant fuel consumption meter. Every car should have one. The sight of the needle moving from, say, 30 mpg (9.4 l/100 km) to 10 mpg (28.2 l/100 km) during fierce acceleration when overtaking is salutary. So is the difference between 35 mpg (8.07 l/100 km) when cruising at 65 mph (105 kmh) and 25 mpg (11.3 l/100 km) at 80 mph (128 kmh). I was pleased, although not too surprised, that my light-footedness was rewarded by a consumption of 21.5 mpg (13.45 l/100 km) for the whole trip.</p>

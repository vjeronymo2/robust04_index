			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD &amp; WINE: OF RUSTIC ORIGINS;  </P> <P> THE HIGH-FIBER, LOW-IN-SATURATED-FATS MEDITERRANEAN DIET GOES UP-COUNTRY  </P> <P> AMERICANS have recently discovered the so-called Mediterranean diet, an eating  style common to inhabitants of the Mediterranean basin that is high in fiber,  low in saturated fats and full of grains, fruit, vegetables and seafood. This  diet is old news in Europe. French food writer Austin de Croze was aware of it  as early as 1931. That year, in a book entitled "What to Eat and Drink in  France," he wrote: "We know of the nutritive power of figs and walnuts to the  Greeks, of macaroni and polenta to the Italians, rice and pimentos to the  Spaniards, black olives and tomatoes to the Provencals, green pimentos and  garlic to the Languedocians, anchovies and garlic to the Roussillonnais -- all  the foods made golden by olive oil."  </P> <P> What de Croze didn't go on to say, however, is that one of the groups he  mentions, the Roussillonnais, temper their Mediterranean diet with the hearty  gastronomic imperatives of mountain living. The Roussillon occupies a corner of  France defined on one side by the Mediterranean and on another by the rugged  Pyrennes themselves.  </P> <P> The food of this region has an appealingly rustic honesty. Fruit and vegetables  are important ingredients in the cuisine, as they are in most of the  Mediterranean -- the apples, pears and cherries of the Pyrenean foothills are  particularly famous. Seafood is popular, especially shellfish and (as de Croze  noted) anchovies, but there is also quite a bit of wild game consumed, and both  veal and lamb are common.  </P> <P> Typical dishes of the Roussillon include spiny lobster civet (a rich,  wine-moistened stew), a garlicky near-bouillabaisse called la bouillinade,  sauteed partridge or pigeon with garlic and lemon slices, and a thick  rice-and-cabbage soup flavored with blood sausage and other charcuterie.  </P> <P> One other specialty of the region, somewhat less fearsome than the  aforementioned, is veal stewed with green olives. Like so many related dishes  on both sides of the eastern Pyrenees, this stew is based on a sofregit, or  "underfry," of onions and garlic, simmered for hours in olive oil until reduced  to a sweet near-puree. (Sweet is the right word: Food scientist Harold McGee  has pointed out that there are compounds in onions that "appear to be converted  into another complex molecule that is 50 to 70 times sweeter than a molecule of  table sugar.") To quote another gastronome of earlier times, a British writer  who signed himself Lieut.-Col. Newnham-Davis: "The seductions of the burnt  onion and the garlic clove are the foundations upon which rest the whole  edifice of Pyrenean cooking."  </P> <P> While this is admittedly a hearty dish, full of concentrated flavors, it isn't  laden with fat or dangerously spicy or crowded with strange varieties of  sausage. It's just a delicious example of what the Mediterranean diet can  encompass when it goes up-country. It can be served alone, over rice, or  Pyrenean-style with an accompaniment of simply cooked white beans.  </P> <P> Veal Stewed With Green Olives  </P> <P> 5 to 6 tablespoons olive oil  </P> <P> 3 large onions, coarsely chopped  </P> <P> 4 to 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced  </P> <P> 4 large, ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and finely chopped  </P> <P> 3 1/2 pounds veal stew meat or boneless veal breast or veal shank, cut into  irregular pieces about 1x2x3 inches  </P> <P> 2 cups veal or beef stock  </P> <P> 3 to 4 sprigs fresh marjoram leaves (or 1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram)  </P> <P> 4 to 5 sprigs parsley, minced  </P> <P> 1 bay leaf  </P> <P> Salt and pepper  </P> <P> 2 cups good-quality green olives (see note), rinsed and pitted  </P> <P> Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in large skillet. Add onions and garlic and simmer  uncovered over lowest heat, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 hours. Onion mixture  should be medium-brown in color and have consistency of coarse marmalade.  </P> <P> Add tomatoes to onion mixture, stir well, and continue cooking over low heat.  </P> <P> Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil in large stew pot or Dutch oven, and brown in  it meat on all sides over medium-high heat, turning meat with tongs often and  removing to a plate when browned.  </P> <P> Deglaze stew pot with stock, scraping burnt bits off bottom with wooden spoon;  then reduce heat to low and add onion-and-tomato mixture. Stir well into stock;  then return meat to pot. Add marjoram, bay leaf and half parsley to liquid.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover pot and simmer 3 hours, stirring  occasionally.  </P> <P> About 30 minutes before stew is done, stir in olives, re-cover pot, and  continue cooking. To serve, garnish with remaining parsley. Serves 8.  </P> <P> Note: Good choices include picholine du Gard olives, imported from France under  several labels, or Santa Barbara Brand Country-Style Olives. Avoid olives  strongly flavored with garlic or herbs. Pre-pitted olives seem to lose flavor  and texture in the pitting process. Food stylist: Amy Nathan  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TROOPS IN LITHUANIA CRACKDOWN;  </P> <P> SOVIETS MET BY DEFIANCE, SEIZE OFFICE  </P> <P> Soviet troops occupied Lithuania's Prosecutor's Office today after its staff  members refused to take orders from a new chief prosecutor appointed by Moscow,  Lithuanian officials said.  </P> <P> It marked the first time Soviet soldiers have taken control of a Lithuanian  government building since the Baltic republic defied Moscow and declared its  independence March 11.  </P> <P> The report came several hours after the White House announced that President  Bush had sent a letter to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev calling for a peaceful  resolution in Lithuania.  </P> <P> The letter, sent via diplomatic channels on Thursday, stated Bush's "support  and the American support for the aspirations of the Lithuanian people for  self-determination," presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> The trouble began at the Prosecutor's Office earlier today when Moscow  officials fired Lithuania's chief prosecutor in a bid to make the republic  adhere to Soviet law, then tried to install a new prosecutor of their choosing.  </P> <P> The move failed when the office's employees said they would remain loyal to  their former boss. The dispute became a standoff, with both chief prosecutors  trying to run the office at the same time.  </P> <P> Several hours later, soldiers of the Soviet Interior Ministry, with the help of  one employee, took over the building, Egidius Bickauskas, a Lithuanian  legislator, said on the republic's television. He did not elaborate.  </P> <P> He accused the Soviet Union of violating the republic's sovereignty.  </P> <P> A Lithuanian Interior Ministry spokesman confirmed that Soviet soldiers were  inside the Prosecutor's Office. He also said the soldiers had moved into the  Institute of Party History.  </P> <P> A foreign journalist who rushed to the scene said he saw a truckload of Soviet  Interior Ministry soldiers enter the building.  </P> <P> Soldiers previously had occupied a handful of Communist Party buildings in  Lithuania, but today was the first time they occupied a Lithuanian government  building.  </P> <P> The standoff began at the office when Moscow officials tried to replace Arturis  Paulauskas, the prosecutor appointed by the Lithuanian government on March 22.  Soviet Deputy Prosecutor Alexei Vasiliev told more than 100 members of the  Lithuanian prosecutor's staff to execute Soviet law. He brought with him an  ethnic Lithuanian, Antanas Petrauskas, to replace Paulauskas.  </P> <P> Tass later carried a statement from Soviet Prosecutor General Alexander  Sukharev firing Paulauskas and officially naming Petrauskas as his successor.  </P> <P> Staff members reacted during the meeting with angry questions.  </P> <P> "Do you know our government was elected legally?" one employee shouted.  </P> <P> Bickauskas, the Lithuanian legislator, told the staff:  </P> <P> "I hope you will consider your place is in your offices under the leadership of  Mr. Paulauskas." Nearly everyone applauded as they rose to leave the room and  returned to their desks.  </P> <P> "You must obey the orders of the general prosecutor of the U.S.S.R.," Vasiliev  said in a raised voice as people left. But his appeal had little effect until  the building was taken over later.  </P></p>

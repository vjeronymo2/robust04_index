			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Kohl aide's call on arms sales Mr Friedrich Bohl, a senior aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, yesterday called for a revision of Germany's strict guidelines on arms exports. Speaking on radio, Mr Bohl, minister in charge of the chancellery, defended a proposal by conservative parliamentarians last week to lower Germany's tough 1982 restrictions on weapons exports and harmonise them with less stringent standards in the European Union. Mr Bohl said it was 'fully unrealistic' to expect Germany's EU partners to raise their own arms trade restrictions. 'We have to reach a reasonable compromise in line with our moral standards and international obligations.' The restrictions include a ban on arms sales to any conflict zone or 'area of tension'. This rules out German arms exports to most of the Middle East. They also apply to technology easily converted from civilian to military use. Conservative members of parliament have recently stepped up pressure on the federal government with calls for a relaxation of the guidelines. Members of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), a key coalition partner for Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), have been particularly vocal in an effort to help the local arms industry, which faces large job-losses because of the recession and federal defence cuts. Mr Karl Lammers, foreign affairs spokesman for the CDU/CSU in parliament, last week put forward a proposal for more liberal guidelines to allow cross-border co-operation in the defence industry. The idea has received strong support from the powerful BDI industry federation. 'The threatened exit of German companies from the field of defence technology must be prevented. This would have drastic consequences for our competitiveness, our security and foreign policy and the capacity of our army,' said a BDI statement. German businessmen complain that Germany's tough restrictions are giving an unfair advantage to competitors, such as French companies. German restrictions on the sales of armaments abroad have been tightened in the last decade after it was found out that German defence equipment was used in Libya and Iraq.</p>

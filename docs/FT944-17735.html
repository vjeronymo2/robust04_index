			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: VSNL deal awaits government approval The long-awaited international equity offering from VSNL, the Indian international telecommunications monopoly, is to be delayed pending government approval, bankers said yesterday. The delay is likely to be some weeks while an Indian cabinet committee considers the pricing of the deal, which is led by Kleinwort Benson, Jardine Fleming and Salomon Brothers. This delay follows an earlier postponement in May, when market conditions changed just before the issue was launched, and the minimum price of Rs1,400 a share was seen as too expensive. The deal was revived last week following the successful issue by Pakistan Telecom which attracted Dollars 900m from international investors. Following its handling of that deal, Jardine Fleming was added to the mandate for VSNL, which is 85-per cent owned by the Indian government. Bankers believe there is currently good demand at the lower price of between Rs1,100 and Rs1,200, which would raise about Dollars 650m, but the government needs to tap that demand before market conditions change. The BSE 30-share index, which closed at 4,406 last Wednesday, had fallen to around 4,350 yesterday. The delay may highlight the decision-making processes of the government, widely held to blame for the first postponement. But one banker, not linked to the deal, said the government had made other difficult financial decisions. He said: 'The decision-making process which corporate financiers and bankers demand runs into hours and minutes. But it can take a week or two to get through the necessary processes.'</p>

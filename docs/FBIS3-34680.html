The opposition Iraqi National Congress said that Husayn  Kamil, 36, was undergoing emergency treatment for a brain tumour.    Medical officials would not divulge what was wrong with him,  but confirmed he had been admitted to hospital.    He holds the title "special advisor to the president" with  the rank of minister, and reports directly to Saddam.    He was minister of defence, and took over at the industry  ministry last September. He is head of the Military Industrial  Organisation, a key post overseeing arms production, and is one  of the most powerful men in the Iraqi government.    Despite his relatively youth, he was regarded as the father  of Iraq's chemical, bacteriological, ballistics and nuclear  weapons programmes, which have been destroyed under UN  resolutions following the Gulf war three years ago.    He is married to Saddam's eldest daughter, Raghad.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Taiyuan, 9 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--According to  the environmental protection work meeting of Shanxi Province  which was held a few days ago, environmental pollution in the  province has been very serious. With the exception of the six  cities directly under the provincial government, which have  managed to initially check the spreading contamination of the  atmosphere and surface water, the ecology of medium-sized and  small cities in the province is being increasingly disturbed,  and environmental pollution in some villages and towns is  worsening.    Shanxi is China's energy and heavy and chemical industrial  base. The province produces approximately 290 million tonnes of  coal a year, and its consumption of coal increases at a rate of  about 10 percent a year. At the same time, it releases 1  million tonnes of soot and 900,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a  year. These objective factors cast a shadow over Shanxi's  already seriously polluted environment.    The results of the monitoring of the quality of the  atmospheric environment of 17 cities in the province show: The  daily average value [zhi 0237] density of suspended particles  over the year is 216 to 833 micrograms per cubic meter,  surpassing the state's grade- 2 standard of atmospheric  environmental quality. The figure for some major cities of the  province is 130 percent higher than that for the cities in north  China.    The results of the monitoring of the 11 major rivers and  their tributaries in the province show: Although the major  rivers have not yet been contaminated, the river sections whose  waters are good for drinking and industrial and agricultural  purposes are very few, and 85 percent of the river sections are  contaminated to varying degrees. The sources of drinking water  and its quality in many cities have thus been adversely affected.    This grim situation has attracted great attention from the  province's environmental departments. They expressed readiness  to take an active part in comprehensive decisionmaking, to  strengthen the building of the legal system, and to strive to  urge the provincial people's congress to promulgate before 1997  the "Regulations of Shanxi Province on Environmental  Protection," the "Regulations of Shanxi Province on Prevention  and Control of Atmospheric Pollution," and relevant  administrative rules and standards.</p>

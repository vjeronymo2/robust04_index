			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AVON ACCEDES TO CHARTWELL IN PROXY FIGHT ON BOARD  </P> <P> Avon Products Inc., the embattled cosmetics giant that has been trying to fight  off uninvited overtures, said today that it has agreed to nominate two  directors proposed by unwanted suitor Chartwell Associates LP to its board.  </P> <P> Chartwell, an investment group that includes much smaller rival Mary Kay  Cosmetics, oil heir Gordon Getty and the Fisher real estate family of New York,  previously said it would make a bid for Avon if the group's candidates were  elected to Avon's board.  </P> <P> Chartwell Associates owns about 7.5% of Avon's voting shares and about 9.9% of  Avon's common.  </P> <P> New York-based Avon said it settled the proxy contest initiated by Chartwell by  agreeing to nominate the two directors proposed by Chartwell as well as two  incumbent Avon directors to Avon's board at its annual meeting May 3.  </P> <P> As part of the agreement, John Rochon will resign as vice chairman of Mary Kay  and become a consultant to Avon.  </P> <P> Avon also said it will establish a committee to consider alternatives to  maximize shareholder value.  </P> <P> The special committee will consist of James Preston, Avon's chairman and chief  executive, three incumbent members of Avon's board and the two Chartwell  nominees.  </P> <P> The Chartwell candidates are M. Anthony Fisher of the Fisher real estate family  and Marc Leland, representing the Getty interests.  </P> <P> Avon incumbents and candidates are Preston and Charles Locke, chairman of  Morton International Inc. Avon directors not standing for reelection are Emil  Mosbacher, an investor and independent oil and gas producer, and Merlin Nelson,  former vice chairman of AMF Inc.  </P> <P> Avon has been trying to fend off uninvited callers since last spring, when  Amway Inc. offered $2 billion for the company.  </P></p>

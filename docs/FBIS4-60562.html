[Begin al-Bid recording] Al-'Anad... [pauses] We are now  around al-'Anad and Jibah. We have been in and out of them for  a few days now. The north will not be able to achieve anything.  We will resist. We will impose our regime and method. We will  impose the Pledge and Accord Document, the document of Yemeni  national consensus. [end recording]    According to Military Communique No. 25 of the southern  Armed  Forces in Aden, the southern troops have scored new victories on  the al-'Anad-Kirsh line, regaining full control of the situation  on this line, inflicting heavy losses on northern forces, and  forcing them to retreat. Northern officers and soldiers have  been joining the southern forces in droves.    According to a southern military source, southern troops  backed with effective air support, successfully bombarded  northern troops trying to break through southern defenses in  Shabwah.    In Abyan, a southern military source said that southern  troops are still besieging al-'Amaliqah northern troops in  Zinjibar, the capital of Abyan. The source added that southern  artillery, jet fighters, and navy have dealt crushing blows to  the remnants of northern troops. Units of the southern commando  units in Zinjibar are locked in fierce battles with remaining  pockets of northern forces.    A responsible source at the Defense Ministry in Aden said  that preliminary reports indicate that thousands of northern  troops have been killed and that hundreds of tanks have been  destroyed. The source categorically denied that the southern  troops fired a missile on Sanaa last night. The source said  that citizens are not a target of any military operation by  southern troops.    Over the past two days, large demonstrations went out in  various governorates of the republic to denounce the rocket  bombardment by northern forces of a residential area in Aden two  days ago. The demonstrators also expressed their joy over the  creation of the Democratic Republic of Yemen.</p>

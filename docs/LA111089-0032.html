			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDLINING BY AUTO INSURERS  </P> <P> When I attended college in Philadelphia, I had to commute between two schools  twice weekly and wanted to purchase a car. I soon learned, however, that  Philadelphia is one of the highest cost cities in the country for auto  insurance and that the ZIP code in which I was located was the highest cost in  the city. I could not afford the premiums and was forced to forgo an  automobile.  </P> <P> The area in which I was located is predominantly black, and the effects of  territorial rating were very obvious. I, therefore, concur wholly with Mark  Ridley-Thomas and Mary Lee in their criticism of this practice. I must,  however, point out that this is only one inequity in the system, and it is not  nearly as blatant as others.  </P> <P> If rates are to be based on one's driving record, number of miles driven  annually, and years of driving experience, there is something very wrong with  the system. For instance, as a male I statistically have a better chance of  having an accident than a female and am charged more based on this fact alone.  Also, statistically, as a single person I am more likely to have an accident  than a married person, so I pay more here, too. In both cases my rates became  higher before I even drove an automobile for the first time. Worse yet, these  practices are perfectly legal.  </P> <P> As a white I should not pay less for auto insurance than a black simply because  of my race. I also should not pay more simply because of my gender and marital  status. Clearly much room for improvement exists in this industry.  </P> <P> JEFFREY M. WHITBRED  </P> <P> Hawthorne  </P></p>

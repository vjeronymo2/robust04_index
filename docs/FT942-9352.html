			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Europe's Changing Cities: St Petersburg's belief in better times fades - Reform has brought citizens little more than hardship A bust of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of Soviet Russia's hated secret police, still decorates the lobby of St Petersburg's police headquarters. Other than that, little tangible is left of the communist era as Russia's second city forges ahead with pioneering market reforms that have brought its inhabitants hardship, bewilderment, and mixed hopes for the future. Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, a pro-western reformer, dreams of transforming this port city of 5m people into an important financial centre and haven for foreign investment. Convincing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to hold its annual governors' meeting in St Petersburg last month was part of his efforts to 'sell' the city to the outside world. But the main challenge facing him and other liberals around the country is ensuring that market reforms deliver tangible benefits for ordinary people in time for presidential and parliamentary elections due in 1996. Few of his fellow citizens believe he can. Popular cynicism is such that city council elections last month almost aborted when turnout - traditionally high in the Soviet era - only reached the required 25 per cent minimum after polling was extended by a day. The discontent centres on crime and corruption, an inability among pensioners and the lower paid to make ends meet, nostalgia for the fixed prices and safe streets of the old order, and a lack of investment to restructure or convert St Petersburg's numerous defence plants to civilian uses. On the bright side, foreign and local investment in the retail sector has already contributed to a boom of western-style shops, restaurants and hotels in a city with considerable tourist industry growth potential. A few big companies - such as Gillette, ABB, and Unilever - have started to invest in the city's ailing manufacturing sector. But the trickle of investment has yet to turn into a flood. 'We can handle political instability, inflation, and even the Mafia,' says an executive for RJR-Nabisco, which makes cigarettes at a privatised local tobacco plant. 'But what we can't handle is the unstable legal and tax regime. That's where it all breaks down.' Mr Sobchak says that his plans for an economic renaissance are hampered not just by psychological and bureaucratic barriers to investment but by the 'slowness' of the Russian parliament and government in taking the decisions he needs from them. These range from state subsidies for transport to lower business costs, a reduction in companies' tax burdens, and new laws to fight economic crimes ushered in by market reform. Although he has already talked three western banks, the BNP-Dresdner alliance and Credit Lyonnais, into setting up subsidiaries in the former imperial capital, they have found little to do. Lacking both the volume of Moscow's forex market and the capital's range of western corporate clients, western banks, as everywhere else in Russia, are nervous about local lending opportunities. 'If Sobchak wants to make the city a financial centre, he has to offer appropriate incentives,' says Mr Yevgeny Yelin, head of St Petersburg's Currency Exchange, where well-dressed dealers trade dollars and D-Marks underneath a portrait of Catherine the Great. That has not stopped his exchange and 27 leading banks and investment funds from initiating a regional system for clearing share transactions in an effort to build a western-style stock market. However, despite Mr Sobchak's help in securing premises for western companies, Russian entrepreneurship has so far flourished in spite of, rather than thanks to, the authorities. A living embodiment of this state of affairs is Mr Vladislav Gerasimov, an ex-navy captain who, three years after acquiring the city's first privatised shop, has become a millionaire. This summer he plans to start manufacturing the womens' shoes he has been importing from China, at a new factory employing 400 people. But the price he has to pay for driving a top-of-the-range Mercedes, owning a beautiful house and having a daughter who has learnt fluent English at private school and visited 12 countries, is to keep himself 'free of enemies'. This means paying off not just the criminal Mafia, which at least does favours for him in return, but also corrupt officials. 'All I encounter from the state are extortion attempts by bureaucrats. If I knew that my money was being spent usefully I would not try to avoid paying taxes,' he says. Major General Arkady Kramariev, the city's police chief, who admits that corruption is rife among city officials, the judiciary, and even his own men, says the good news is that crime fell 11 per cent in the first quarter of this year. St Petersburg, with 845 murders last year compared to 150 a decade ago, is now only as dangerous as the most crime-ridden cities of western Europe but still safer than New York or Washington. Gen Kramariev says that much of the crime nowadays is due to an antiquated legal system which cannot cope with the requirements of a market economy. When, for instance, businessmen refuse to repay their debts, creditors' only resort is 'Judge Kalashnikov' because by the time a court takes a decision it is 'meaningless'. A large part of the problem is psychological - with an increase in domestic crime due to a loss of old certainties. Many citizens are convinced life is getting worse even if, in some areas, it is getting better. Despite earning a decent monthly salary of Rbs365,000 thanks to government attempts to strengthen law enforcement, Captain Victor Koverzin, a police officer who patrols the city's elegant tourist area, plans to vote for Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist leader, as the country's next president. His wife has been in effect laid off by a defence plant which has been closed since January but continues to pay her Rbs25,000 a month, just enough to buy a pair of shoes at one of Mr Gerasimov's stores. While Capt Koverzin does not believe all Mr Zhirinovsky's promises, he thinks that 'at least the world will stop pushing us around' if one of the few leaders 'untainted by office' comes to power. Mr Alexei Kudrin, the deputy mayor responsible for economics, is optimistic that economic reform will produce an upturn in time for 1996. 'The next two years will see the economic crisis peak, with unemployment and restructuring of enterprises. Hopefully, by that time there should also be some results, with the creation of new jobs and new manufacturing capacity.' The big unknown is whether an increasingly weary public will appreciate the improvements by the time they take place.</p>

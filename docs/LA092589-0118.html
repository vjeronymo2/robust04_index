			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'POOR SPORTSMEN': U.S. BLASTED IN NEW ZEALAND  </P> <P> Most New Zealanders consider Americans "poor sportsmen" and favor launching a  new international yachting event to replace the America's Cup, government  minister Mike Moore said today.  </P> <P> Moore, whose portfolio includes America's Cup affairs, said he had received a  number of letters from New Zealanders keen to see yachting's most famous trophy  replaced by a new sailing event.  </P> <P> He said that might eventually happen, adding that he does not believe the idea  should be officially explored until a long-running court dispute between the  San Diego Yacht Club and New Zealand's Mercury Bay Boating Club has been  resolved.  </P> <P> "There is another court round to go, one more chance for the American court  system to uphold the view that sports people should meet on equal terms," Moore  said.  </P> <P> "I think a lot of Kiwis find the prospect of yet another court round a bit  disappointing. But, on the other hand, I don't think they'd support our players  walking off the field before the game is over."  </P> <P> Moore said he doesn't agree that all Americans should be labeled poor sports,  despite a New York appellate court ruling last week saying there are no  constraints on the America's Cup defender's vessel. That ruling reversed an  earlier decision in favor of New Zealand.  </P></p>

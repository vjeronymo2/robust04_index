			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley banks on new blood infusion - The firm is pursuing an ambitious hiring plan despite the downturn Morgan Stanley, like other big securities firms on Wall Street, is not having a particularly great 1994, at least when compared with the industry's record-breaking results of last year. In the February-to-April reporting period, its profits fell 41 per cent to Dollars 199m as global financial markets were made suddenly unfavourable by an unexpected surge in US interest rates early in the year. Unlike every other firm on Wall Street, however, Morgan Stanley is pursuing an ambitious hiring strategy, in spite of the disturbing downturn in business. Last year, its payroll jumped by 11 per cent to 8,273, and it is expected to reach 9,300 by the end of this year. A good deal of the hiring has been concentrated in overseas operations, and in investment banking, where staffing is due to climb from 800 to 930 before the end of 1994. The hiring strategy at Morgan Stanley, one of the most aggressive seen on Wall Street in a long time, is remarkable because it runs counter to traditional Wall Street thinking, that payrolls should be trimmed, or at least frozen, when market conditions are unfavourable and profits are falling. 'We are going to use this difficult period to invest in the business, and not figure out a way to cut back,' says Mr Dick Fisher, Morgan Stanley chairman. The decision to stick with the hiring plan is predicated on two important assumptions: that the current downturn in market conditions is only temporary and the best prospects for Wall Street firms lie overseas, particularly in investment banking. Although the latter assumption is widely held within the industry, Morgan Stanley is taking something of a gamble in predicting a recovery in securities markets. Mr Fisher, admitting that many on Wall Street view the situation differently, says: 'We think that the current period of correction is an interruption of a very positive trend, not the end of the cycle.' While this optimistic view is clearly an important factor behind the hiring spree, there is another side to the story. The firm has been bringing in new people to its investment banking division partly because it needed to fill the holes which opened up when a string of top bankers followed the former president Mr Robert Greenhill out of the door last year. He defected to rival securities house Smith Barney Shearson. The departure of Mr Greenhill - who left Morgan Stanley after 31 years when he was overtaken by the current president Mr John Mack in the race to succeed Mr Fisher as chairman when he retires - was a big blow to the firm. Having made his name during the 1980s as one of the top mergers and acquisition bankers on Wall Street, Mr Greenhill enjoyed close working relationships with some of the biggest corporations in the US. His ties with the entertainment group Viacom, for example, ensured it was Smith Barney, not Morgan Stanley, which played a pivotal (and highly lucrative) advisory role in Viacom's Dollars 10bn merger with Paramount Communications earlier this year. The impact on the firm of Mr Greenhill's loss last June was exacerbated by the defection soon after of more than a dozen other Morgan Stanley bankers, many of whom joined Mr Greenhill at Smith Barney, whose investment banking unit has begun to gain ground on its rivals. The defections came at a particularly bad time for Morgan Stanley, because they fuelled the perception that the firm's investment banking powers, which have been waning for several years, were in permanent decline. The firm dominated the rest of Wall Street in the late 1970s and early 1980s  -consistently ranking first in the industry with a near-20 per cent share of the US stock and bond underwriting market - but it now sits well back in the pack, ranking seventh among underwriters last year with a market share of only 6.4 per cent. While Mr Fisher insists the loss of Mr Greenhill and others from the investment banking division was not a serious blow to the firm, he is unhappy with the steady decline in Morgan Stanley's share of the domestic underwriting market since the mid-1980s. 'We're not where we want to be and are taking steps to address that,' he says, steps that have involved reorganising the investment banking department's top management, and hiring fresh talent in the US and overseas. The firm's most notable newcomer is the former First Boston and Wasserstein Perella M&amp;A wizard, Mr Joseph Perella, who arrived at Morgan Stanley last summer with a fistful of blue-chip corporate clients. Mr Fisher says the infusion of new investment banking blood has begun to pay off at home and abroad. 'Five of the six largest equity deals this year have been lead managed by Morgan Stanley, and we've seen a significant upturn in European business.' With people like Mr Perella on board, Mr Fisher is especially bullish about the firm's M&amp;A business. The current M&amp;A assignment load is, he says, the heaviest in three-and-a-half years, and he sees great opportunities in particular sectors, notably healthcare. 'There is absolutely no doubt in our minds that we are in the very early stages of a major restructuring of healthcare, where you will see very large transactions.' Morgan Stanley's chairman, however, is keen to ensure the firm does not repeat the mistake of the 1980s, when, in its enthusiasm for deal-making, it neglected the underwriting side of the business. There is no question that we went through a period from 1986 to 1989 where we were paying too much attention to strategic work - M&amp;A and that kind of thing - and not enough attention to (customers') capital needs. We identified that problem in 1989, and have been correcting it.' Part of the correction has involved a rapid build-up in derivatives capabilities, and further expansion into foreign capital markets. With new offices in Shanghai and Bombay, Mr Fisher says the firm is always on the lookout for opportunities in emerging markets. 'We are finding, regularly, locations where we can put in place something more than a listening post.' The overseas expansion is paying off: last year just under 50 per cent of the firm's Dollars 9.2bn in revenues were generated overseas. If the current rate of growth is continued, with more traders and bankers hired for non-US operations, it will not be long before more than half of Morgan Stanley's revenues come from overseas. In an increasingly global financial world, it appears nothing would please Mr Fisher more.</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Arts: Iphigenie en Tauride - Opera Welsh National Opera have waited a long time - 45 years, to be precise  - before tackling their first Gluck opera. Patience is bounteously rewarded: on Monday his penultimate work surged out into the New Theatre, Cardiff, with unstoppable force and speed: in clock-time the performance lasted just over two hours, in psychological time it passed in a flash, and with a searing immediacy that can have left few in the audience in doubt they were encountering one of the essential masterpieces of music-drama. No theatre, said Gluck, can be too small for it; but the New, medium in size, 'close-up' in sound projection, seems just about perfect as an Iphigenie en Tauride auditorium. This is an advantage of which the conductor, Charles Mackerras, takes full account. He remains unbeatable as a Gluckian who combines 'period' niceness of balance and modern communicative passion. Playing and singing (in French never less than acceptable) are of the highest quality. Every note is rendered telling, reverberant with dramatic intensity precisely directed. The bareness of the score is made - as it must be - its supreme virtue: the silences speak as eloquently as the sounds, and where a single detail or colour (such as the grimly buzzing string tremolo in Thoas's aria) needs to set the tone, Mackerras works the effect with masterly authority. It is not spacious Gluck conducting. Edges are hard. Rhythms have a kick. Marbled neo-Classical grandeur gives way to immediacy of impact. This chimes with the style of the production by the admired young French team of Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser (UK debut). Robes, drapes and columns are thrown out; the set is a box whose mobile partitions have been decorated with faint scratches and striations; the dress is harsh modern (grey skirts for the priestesses, bare feet for all). A single prop (chair, knife) takes on deep resonance as a poetic image. Bleakness is indeed beautiful. The emphasis is on the trauma suffered by Agamemnon's survivors, the grip of fear and seemingly eternal violence in which both Greeks and Scythians are held. Since the physical action is so fiercely restrained, the smallest physical gesture of consolatory warmth between Pylades and Orestes becomes an emotional expression of overwhelming power. In all these respects, and in its insistence on seeking out the meaning under the marble, the production plainness manifests a genuinely Gluckian dramatic intelligence; but after a while it begins to seem rather a one-note sort of plainness. There is a lack of conversational variety, of detachment, of 'architecture'. With the same look of vacant-eyed misery Iphigeneia sings her four very differently expressive arias. Though in a programme interview Mr Leiser marvels at the way 'every situation . . . relates to the suffering that we can experience nowadays', he and his partner have not found a way of 'relating' the funeral rites that should close Act 2. The decision to cut this sublime passage leaves a scar on the whole enterprise. Luckily, strong advocacy for the production style comes from the excellent cast. Diana Montague, an experienced Iphigeneia (in France and on record), has never sung better on any British stage. Her soprano-ish mezzo carries a rounded gentleness of timbre not usually associated with this most imposing of dramatic-soprano roles. Perhaps the last degree of dramatic-soprano fire is missed - but how musically she deals with the tessitura agonies of 'O malheureuse Iphigenie]', how clear and fine her declamation] This titular heroine is worth crossing the country to hear and see; and so are those of the Orestes and Pylades, Simon Keenlyside and Peter Bronder. On a keyed-up first night Mr Keenlyside's lean high baritone sounded hard tested, but he, more than anyone else on stage, finds the expressive centre in economy of gesture and movement - and nowhere more than in the brilliantly staged account of Orestes's guilt-visions. Mr Bronder youthfully vibrant tenor rings out with exciting freedom; Pylades's role in the drama is made movingly fresh and artless. The dark-toned bass-baritone of Peter Sidhom takes a gallant, health-risking shot at Thoas's exhausting aria (but Mackerras should consider adopting the Gluckian precedent of lowering it a tone). Among the smaller roles the Diana of Alwyn Mellor, an Iphigeneia of the future, stands out. No less than its recent, much-acclaimed Pelleas, this WNO Iphigenie en Tauride is a bold stage venture vindicated by its music-making. In repertory until May 28, then on tour until July 16</p>

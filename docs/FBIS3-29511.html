			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the  United States reaffirmed Thursday that resumption of  inter-Korean dialogue is a prerequisite to the next round of  North Korea-U.S. high-level talks. The high-level talks would  have to completely resolve the North Korean nuclear dispute  including special inspection of suspected facilities yet to be  opened to the IAEA, they agreed.    This would entail a "comprehensive" solution to the problem,  with full-scale nuclear inspections allowed by Pyongyang in  exchange for permanent suspension of the South Korean-U.S.  military exercise "Team Spirit" and improvement in North  Korean-U.S. relations.    Visiting Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. officials  confirmed there was no change in requirements for the high-level  talks -- satisfactory nuclear inspections by the International  Atomic energy agency (IAEA) in North Korea and substantial  progress in inter-Korean talks such as an exchange of  presidential envoys. Han is carrying a personal letter from  President Kim Yong-sam which will be delivered when the foreign  minister meets President Bill Clinton on Friday, just before his  departure for Seoul.    While stating that the Seoul-Washington agreement reached at  last November's summit calls for a "thorough and broad" approach  to solving the North Korean nuclear problem, President Kim is  said to have reiterated that the two Koreas must exchange envoys  before the North Korea-U.S. meeting.    "The two countries concluded that North Korea's acceptance  of  IAEA inspections has allowed efforts to continue to solve the  problem through dialogue," said Director-General for American  Affairs Chang Chae-yong, accompanying Han in the United States.    "We concluded that our strategy of dialogue pursued under  close consultations between South Korea and the United States is  leading in the right direction," He said after Han's talks with  U.S. Assistant Secretaries Peter Tarnoff and Lynn Davis.    Pyongyang ended a lengthy stalemate Tuesday when it  announced  it would accept IAEA inspection of all of its seven declared  sites. An IAEA inspection team is expected to arrive in North  Korea early next week and start two to three weeks of checks on  whether Pyongyang has diverted nuclear material since the last  inspection a year ago.    Han meets U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor later in  the day to discuss bilateral economic issues and South Korea's  participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA). He delivers a keynote speech at the opening of the  South Korea-U.S. 21st Century Council on Friday morning before  leaving for Seoul.</p>

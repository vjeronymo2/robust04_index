			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. BOARD NAMES CAPIZZI AS D.A.; CHALLENGER SUES  </P> <P> Michael R. Capizzi, Cecil Hicks' longtime choice to succeed him as Orange  County district attorney, was unanimously selected for the job by the Board of  Supervisors on Tuesday, just moments before Hicks took the oath as a Superior  Court judge.  </P> <P> Capizzi, 50, who has held the title of chief assistant since 1986, directed  Hicks' campaign against political corruption in the 1970s. He also was  architect of most of Hicks' major policies in the 1980s, including an end to  most plea bargaining and closed-door agreements with defense lawyers.  </P> <P> But his first battle as district attorney may be over the right to keep his  job.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef, one of two challengers to Capizzi within the  office in the June, 1990, election, filed legal action Tuesday afternoon in  Superior Court in an attempt to void the supervisors' vote. He was joined by  Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright, who was next in line to succeed  Hicks if the supervisors had not acted.  </P> <P> Court Commissioner Julian Cimbaluk has set a Feb. 2 hearing date on Avdeef's  complaint that the board does not have the authority to replace Hicks. Avdeef  contends that the law requires that Enright, as chief deputy, replace Hicks  until a new district attorney is elected. The hearing is scheduled before  Superior Court Judge Eileen Moore.  </P> <P> If Avdeef's effort fails, Capizzi's appointment Tuesday to serve out the final  year of Hicks' term means he can run on the June ballot for the 1991-1995 term  as the incumbent. Most legal and political experts in the county believe that  would make him unbeatable. Avdeef and Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman,  the third candidate in the June race, acknowledge that it will give him "a  startling advantage."  </P> <P> Few people expect Avdeef's challenge to succeed. Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley  said he has been assured by the county counsel's office that the supervisors  have the authority to appoint Hicks' replacement.  </P> <P> There was a small uproar in 1966 when Hicks himself was appointed to fill the  term of retiring Dist. Atty. Kenneth Williams. But that challenge died without  going to court. The board has routinely made appointments to fill such  positions without challenge.  </P> <P> But Avdeef, in a letter to Riley, said he was bringing the issue to the board's  attention to spare the supervisors "embarrassment." The claim in his lawsuit  essentially is that the supervisors, as a county body, do not have the  authority to make an appointment to what amounts to a state agency.  </P> <P> "Tom (Avdeef) is wrong on the law," Capizzi said. "This just doesn't have any  merit."  </P> <P> If Capizzi was upset by the Avdeef lawsuit, which had been promised for weeks,  he did not show it. He spent most of the afternoon accepting congratulatory  telephone calls. A highlight of the day and his career, he said, was to have  Cecil Hicks administer the oath of office with Capizzi's own family, including  his mother, Adelaide, watching.  </P> <P> Hicks had endorsed Capizzi's candidacy before his judicial appointment came  through.  </P> <P> Hicks, 63, who has been district attorney for 23 years, announced five months  ago that he would not seek reelection in June. Soon after that he let Gov.  George Deukmejian know of his interest in a judgeship. The governor appointed  him to the bench on the Friday before Christmas.  </P> <P> Because Hicks' name is listed on all the criminal pleadings before the court,  he will not be able to handle criminal cases for a year or two. He was  appointed by Judge Leonard Goldstein, the new presiding judge, to Department 8,  which is a family law courtroom.  </P> <P> "I told them I'd go wherever I was needed," Hicks said.  </P> <P> Hicks told reporters that the judicial code of conduct limited any further  comment on Capizzi's candidacy, but added, "I can say that he is an  exceptionally outstanding choice to replace me."  </P> <P> Avdeef was present at the Hall of Administration when the supervisors vote 5 to  0 to appoint Capizzi. While he had said earlier that he might voice his  objections, he sat silently as the supervisors took turns lavishing praise on  Capizzi.  </P> <P> Supervisor Roger R. Stanton described Capizzi as Hicks' "field general in the  war on political corruption" in the 1970s.  </P> <P> "Mike did his job so well that those who would corrupt our political system are  out of positions of power," Stanton said.  </P> <P> Hicks' investigations led to 42 indictments of political figures during those  years. The charges stemmed primarily from misuse of public funds, money  laundering and bribery. Among those indicted were a congressman, Andrew J.  Hinshaw, and three county supervisors, Robert Battin, Ralph Diedrich and Philip  Anthony. Battin and Diedrich were forced from office and Anthony, while under  indictment, was defeated for reelection by Stanton in 1980.  </P> <P> Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez called Capizzi "tough but fair" and said he is  someone "who will continue that tradition of leadership built by Cecil Hicks."  </P> <P> Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder quipped that she benefited from Capizzi's  housecleaning when she began her own political career in the county in the  1970s.  </P> <P> "I didn't have some of the problems my predecessors had about where the files  were," she said.  </P> <P> Capizzi began his career in the district attorney's office in 1965 right after  passing the bar. He worked his way up to assistant -- a rank above deputy -- in  1971.  </P> <P> During the early 1980s, Enright was second-in-command on paper as chief deputy.  But Hicks in the mid-1970s had turned over most of the major duties for  day-to-day operations to Capizzi. In 1986, Hicks tried to make Capizzi's powers  within the office clearer by creating for him the title of chief assistant.  Enright was still second-in-command in the statutes, but it was Capizzi's name  under Hicks' in the county directory.  </P> <P> No one within the office doubts who had the real power.  </P> <P> "Mike's appointment really won't mean much different for us," said one deputy  prosecutor. "He's been running the office for years anyway."  </P> <P> Some in the office had seen Enright as the only viable candidate to run against  Capizzi in the June election. But Enright has been silent so far about whether  he will. Many believe now that if he is interested, he has waited too long.  </P> <P> But Enright did feel strongly enough about Capizzi's appointment to ask Avdeef  if he could join his lawsuit, said Avdeef attorney Kevin McDermott.  </P> <P> Enright's declaration states that he, not Capizzi, has always been in charge  any time Hicks was out of town or on vacation. Enright also noted that the  supervisors have never inquired about his interest in replacing Hicks.  </P> <P> Enright and Capizzi have long held a friendly but adversarial relationship  within the office. While Enright is popular with rank-and-file deputies,  Capizzi has the support of most of the top supervisors.  </P> <P> Capizzi is a former president of the Orange County Bar Assn. He won the  prestigious Outstanding Prosecutor award from the California District Attorneys  Assn. in 1980 for his political prosecutions. Capizzi received a bachelor of  science degree from Eastern Michigan University in 1961 and his law degree from  the University of Michigan in 1964, joining the Orange County district  attorney's office shortly thereafter.  </P> <P> NO CONTEST -- Michael R. Capizzi's ascension has long been expected. A16  </P></p>

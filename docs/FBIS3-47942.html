			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- A government-proposed  political reform package barely scraped through a vote in a  House of Councillors panel Thursday [20 January] morning, paving  the way for a showdown vote in the full chamber that could make  or break Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's five-month-old  administration.    The upper chamber's Special Committee on Political Reform  approved the package of four bills by a voice vote.    Eighteen committee members were in favor and 16 were  against.    Hosokawa has staked his job on the passage of the political  reform bills which call for members of the House of  Representatives to be elected through a combination of  single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, in  place of the current multiseat constituencies.    Originally designed to clean up Japan's scandal-tainted  political system, the package also calls for a limited  tightening of curbs on political funds.    It remains unclear, however, whether the coalition can  secure  their passage by a full session of the upper chamber in view of  dissent among some legislators of the Social Democratic Party,  the biggest party in the ruling coalition.    The coalition, which hopes to have the vote by the full  house  on Friday, has a slim majority with a combined force of 131,  compared with the opposition's 115. It needs 126 votes to be  sure of winning.    The committee vote came after eleventh-hour talks Wednesday  between the coalition and LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] failed  to achieve a compromise over LDP demands to modify the bills.    The powerful lower chamber passed the package on November  18.</p>

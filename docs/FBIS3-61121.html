First of all, all of us should answer simple questions  honestly. Why has Ukraine, one of the richest countries of  Europe, ended up in a catastrophic economic situation, with a  majority of its population turned into beggars? Why does the  wage of a working person range between $55 and $90 at present in  the Baltic republics of the former Soviet Union, whereas it is  dozens of times less in our country?    A tremendous deficit of the state budget is the main cause  of  our misfortune. Unfortunately, our government has long been  living beyond its means.    Some politicians and members of the government are now  assuring the people that commercial banks are to blame for high  prices, a shortage of goods, and the buildup of inflation. All  of this is slander.    Commercial banks that have been established control only  about 10 percent of all state finance. They have never carried  out credit emissions; they mainly serve market structures.  Moreover, it is precisely the established commercial banks that  provided and still provide services to citizens that protect  their savings in a hyperinflationary environment far better than  the state.    They accuse the commercial banks of generating great  profits,  assuring us that the banks are "getting fat." This does not  conform to the truth, either. The greatest profits have been  derived through the circulation of the "free-of-charge" emission  money which our banks do not have anything to do with directly.    We are warning you, citizens, that the current offensive  against the established commercial bank is an offensive against  private enterprises. It is the abandonment of the market-economy  path which all of humanity is taking. Our people have been  drenched in the blood of the revolution, and have survived  famine and Stalin's dungeons. Do we really have to once again go  through all the torture in order to ascertain that market-based  regulation of the economy is the most effective, and that it is  impossible without commercial banks?    Inflation is not a natural disaster; it is created by  governments and the economic forces that stand behind them. In  view of this, a government of social accord with a market  orientation, which will be capable of containing inflation, is  an urgent necessity.    The Supreme Soviet has been passing laws which have been  mostly prepared by the government. However, our prime ministers  have demanded additional extraordinary powers all along. As we  see it, the reason has been that people who were not familiar  with market-economy relations undertook to provide state  leadership. They, rather than the commercial banks have led the  people of Ukraine into the current catastrophic situation.    We understand that the people are tired, and pessimism  prevails in our society. However, under the circumstances we  call on you to support people with market-oriented thinking  rather than demagogues who are promising you social equality for  the n-th time.    Commercial banks have now been turned into a target for  dubious economic experiments. As a result of this, the state  loses enormous funds, and the life of the people worsens still  more. Credit "ceilings," bans on credit extension, and other  nonsensical ideas have put commercial banks and enterprises in a  very difficult situation. It is precisely for this reason that  store shelves have become barren, heat and light are in short  supply, and transportation operates poorly. Economic problems  are being solved in an administrative manner; a regulatory and  legislative base for the development of entrepreneurship is  lacking. However, we believe that reason, professionalism, and  balance will ultimately prevail. We call on all citizens who are  not indifferent to a future prosperous Ukraine to pool their  efforts in order to create, rather than destroy the economy.    We are also addressing our colleagues with a proposal to  hold  a meeting of all Ukrainian bankers shortly in order to  consolidate positions regarding the restoration of the credit  and finance system. A group of bankers from Kiev has agreed to  immediately begin the development of the drafts of key laws, and  is prepared to take part in the development of a government  program for overcoming the economic catastrophe. We consider it  feasible to create the Kiev Banking Union which will have an  opportunity to respond quickly and effectively to all changes in  the life of the state and its capital city.    In the future, commercial banks will continue efforts to  maintain and enhance the well-being of their depositors, proving  by their deeds that commercial banks serve the good of Ukraine  and each of its citizens.    On the eve of the New Year we wish you, fellow countrymen,  happiness and accord!    [Signed] O. Assonov--the Yunivers Joint-Stock Investment  Bank    S. Arzhevitin--the Azhio Joint-Stock Bank    V.

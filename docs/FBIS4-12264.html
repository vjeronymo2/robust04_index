			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] A total closure will be imposed on the  territories from 1700 [1400 GMT] this afternoon, following the  recent spate of terrorist attacks. Our correspondent Shlomo Raz  reports that from that hour onwards, Arabs from the territories  will not be permitted to enter the Green Line.    This morning, the chief of staff said it is impossible to  completely prevent terrorist attacks in retaliation for the  Hebron massacre. He praised the soldiers at the Ashdod Junction  for showing initiative by shooting and killing the terrorist.    The prime minister will convene the Ministerial Committee on  Security Affairs for a special session tomorrow in order to  discuss the deterioration in the security situation and decide  on the necessary steps.    The leaders of the opposition factions are meeting at Likud  headquarters in Tel Aviv this afternoon to discuss the  situation. They will demand the establishment of a commission of  inquiry into the wave of terrorist attacks and a halt to the  negotiations with the PLO. Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan called  on the government to resign and call new elections. [passage  omitted]</p>

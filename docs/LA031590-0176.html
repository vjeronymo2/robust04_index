			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> SOFTBALL TEAM FOCUSES ON PLIGHT OF YOUNG FAN  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton's women's softball team has attained the No. 1 ranking in  the nation, but the Titans also are working toward another goal.  </P> <P> Christina Schnabl, an 8-year-old from Placentia who was a batgirl for the  Titans last season, has leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant. The team  has dedicated the rest of its season to Schnabl and is helping to sponsor a  drive to find a compatible donor.  </P> <P> "There's not a lot we can do," shortstop Jill Matyuch said. "We are just a  softball team and we aren't on national television all the time. But we can do  something."  </P> <P> Last season Schnabl was a member of the Titan Tuffies, a fan club of the team,  and was a batgirl in several games. She also had been a member of local youth  softball and soccer teams. In January, she was diagnosed with leukemia and,  since then, has been hospitalized.  </P> <P> Matyuch said the Titans will be wearing red wrist bands during games in  Schnabl's honor. But their main goal, Matyuch said, is to get 300 people tested  for bone marrow compatibility April 23 at the university. The tests cost $75  and although about $4,000 remains from funds that helped 174 people get tested  in another drive last week, more money needs to be raised, said Linda Schnabl,  Christina's mother.  </P> <P> Several team members have gone to the hospital to visit Christina, a  third-grader at Warner Elementary School in Placentia. Christina's mother said  the visits are helping her daughter, who has been receiving chemotherapy  treatments.  </P> <P> "It really picks her spirits up when they come in," said Schnabl, a music  teacher in the Placentia Unified School District.  </P> <P> Titan Coach Judi Garman said the visits are helping the players, too.  </P> <P> "I think we all become winners because it helps us keep things in proper  perspective," Garman said. "When you see Christina's courage and enthusiasm at  what we are doing, it helps us go out and push even harder."  </P> <P> In his two-year career, Cedric Ceballos left the following imprints on the  Titan basketball record book:  </P> <P>  -- 22.1 career scoring average, breaking Leon Wood's record of 20.6.  </P> <P>  -- 669 points, second-best single-season total, behind Wood's 719 in 1984.  </P> <P>  -- 1,284 career points, sixth all-time and tops for two-year players.  </P> <P>  -- 362 rebounds, breaking single-season record of 326 set by Tony Neal in  1985.  </P> <P>  -- 618 career rebounds, fourth all-time and tops among two-year players.  </P> <P>  -- 12.5 rebounding average, breaking Neal's record of 11.2 set in 1985.  </P> <P> Mark Hill completed his career as the holder of most of the school's  three-point shooting records. Hill set records this season for three-pointers  made and attempted for a career (145 of 366), a season (77 of 186) and a game  (8 made against Cal State Northridge, 18 attempted against Nevada Las Vegas).  </P> <P> Three Titan wrestlers have qualified for the NCAA championships March 22-24 at  College Park, Md.: freshman Jeff Maes (126 pounds), sophomore Lyndon Campbell  (134) and junior David Jones (heavyweight).  </P> <P> The baseball team's record of 9-9 is not quite where the Titans want to be --  in more ways than one.  </P> <P> How often does a Southern California team get have rainouts this early in the  year?  </P> <P> Fullerton had two games at home rained out against Rice, and three more during  four days in Stockton, where a Big West Conference series against Pacific was  rained out.  </P> <P> "The rainouts have put us behind," Coach Larry Cochell said. "We haven't quite  jelled yet. We need to play more games to gain the momentum we need."  </P> <P> Two football players are competing on the track team this year, senior  sprinter/receiver Mark Hill, and junior long jumper/cornerback Nuygen  Pendleton. Hill ran the 200-meter dash in 22.22 seconds to win in a meet at UC  Santa Barbara last weekend, and Pendleton finished second in the long jump with  a distance of 6.87 meters.  </P> <P> The men's team dominated the 5,000-meter run, taking first, second and third  with Steve Frisone (15:13.78), Ray Trujillo (15:21.93) and Mike Richardson  (15:24.30).  </P> <P> Titan Notes  </P> <P> The Titan Athletic Foundation has a fundraising goal of $550,000, about $75,000  more than last year. The booster group will be trying to raise most of that  money during a drive that begins March 23 with a Casino Night -- an event that  will try to "put the fun back in fund drive," in the words of Walt Bowman,  associate athletic director and executive director of the athletic foundation.  The drive ends May 5 with the May Bowl, the spring football game. Fullerton  exceeded its drive goal of $425,000 last year by about $16,000.  </P> <P> Kelli Moore and Roseann Alva, Fullerton's No. 1 doubles team, recently defeated  the 13th-ranked women's doubles team in the country, Pacific's Leslie Powell  and Lisa Gratsushima, 7-5, 6-4.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Robyn Norwood contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

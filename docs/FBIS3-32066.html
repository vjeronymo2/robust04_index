De Leon  said he would not allow the transportation sector to go on  strike and that he would take legal measures, including  intervention.    A truck strike could lead to a lack of fuel and losses for  the industrial and commercial sectors, but Energy Minister Jose  Luis Terron has guaranteed gasoline and diesel supplies.    Miguel Luna, president of the National Transportation  Coordinating Board, reiterated today that the decision to stage  a strike on Tuesday remains firm if the government does not find  a solution to the sector's demands. Luna has not revealed the  amount of fare increase they are demanding for cement and fuel  transportation, but he reiterated that the decision to strike is  firm.</p>

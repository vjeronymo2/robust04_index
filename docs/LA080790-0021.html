			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: OPERA  </P> <P> Opera Turnarounds: Soprano Karen Beardsley will sing Marzelline in the Music  Center Opera production of "Fidelio," which opens the season with a  five-performance run Sept. 4.  </P> <P> She replaces Elise Ross, who decided that the part -- new to her -- was too  high for her voice, according to a company spokesman. Beardsley made her debut  with Music Center Opera in June, singing the role of Max in "Where the Wild  Things Are." In other changes to the announced season, David Pountney will make  his local debut directing "Elektra," which opens Feb. 23. Additionally, George  de la Pena and Heather Toma have been cast as the lead dancers in Mark Morris'  ballet segment of "Nixon in China," opening Sept. 11. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

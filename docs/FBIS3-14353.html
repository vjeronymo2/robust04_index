Concerning attempts to separate southern Sudan from the  north, the Sudanese foreign minister said that those attempts  would be fruitless. He added that Sudan would absolutely not  allow any attempt to dismantle its unity. He said that Egypt  had declared, strongly and frankly, its support for Sudan, as it  was aware of the dangers of disintegration and fragmentation,  not only with regard to Sudan itself, but in the entire region  as well.    Dr. Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih expressed his appreciation at  Egypt's strategic stand [word indistinct], out of its concern to  preserve the unity of Sudan, as the security of Sudan and Egypt  were closely linked.    For his part Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said that  he  had spoken with Dr. Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih concerning issues  of interest to the countries and the future of relations between  them, besides the subjects discussed by the Arab League Council.  Mr. 'Amr Musa stressed Egypt's stand on southern Sudan: That  it would not support any attempt for the separation of southern  Sudan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bloemfontein April 17 SAPA -- Umkhonto we Sizwe  [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing; MK] Commander Joe  Modise on Sunday [17 April] accused the SA [South African]  Defence Force [SADF] of "dragging its feet" over the integration  of various armed formations into an army for the future.    He said he suspected the SADF had its own agenda and wanted  to delay the integration process in the hope it could stay in  command and determine who joined a new national defence force.  "This we will not allow. We are very worried about it...but we  are going to ensure that integration takes its course once a new  government comes in."    The SADF had in the past had facilities for an intake of up  to 20,000 new recruits, but had now reluctantly identified three  of its bases where MK members could assemble. "We have had to  drag this information out of them," he said, adding that  allegations of stalling the integration process were being  raised with the defence force leadership.    Mr Modise, who has commanded MK since 1965 and is now a  candidate on the ANC's national list, said he was resigning from  the military. "I think it is time for me to rest and give a  chance for younger people."    He hinted that he may get involved in the proposed  vocational  training schools which the ANC hopes will absorb the thousands  of unemployed and militant youths who lack education.    He said he thought the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF]  was  capable of the task assigned to them, but wished they could have  had more training. The NPKF was, however, better than the  police's Internal Stability Division, he said.</p>

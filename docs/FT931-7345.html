			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Iraq threatens to shoot down two UN helicopters AN IRAQI anti-aircraft unit threatened to shoot down two United Nations helicopters on a surveillance mission on Monday in an 'extremely serious' new confrontation, the Security Council was told yesterday. Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN weapons inspection commission said the incident was part of Baghdad's 'salami tactics' of slicing away the scope of UN operations. Despite their past promises, the Iraqis had adopted a consistently negative attitude towards helicopter missions. Although Baghdad backed away from a serious confrontation in January in what was seen as a goodwill gesture towards the new US administration, there still had been 'no serious real change', Mr Ekeus said. 'I must say I have not discerned much of a difference in tactics on the Iraqi government side.' The latest incident occurred when UN inspectors led by the Russian Mr Nikita Smidovich began a search for Scud missiles and related equipment. The Iraqis are believed to have up to 200 Scuds, but Mr Ekeus said a search failed to turn up any of 'the big stuff'. Monday's mission which included two teams of inspectors was abandoned after the Iraqis twice trained their guns on UN aircraft west of Baghdad. Mr Ekeus stressed that UN resolutions authorised use of rotary-wing aircraft anywhere in Iraq and the authorities were advised in advance of the inspection operation. There were 35 helicopter crews in Iraq and their safety was at serious risk. An Iraqi official said they found nothing. A team leader declined to confirm this but indicated the inspectors were leaving Baghdad empty-handed. The UN believes Iraq is hiding missiles in defiance of the terms of the ceasefire which followed its defeat in the Gulf war at the hands of a multinational coalition. Turkey yesterday confirmed that it planned to send a charge d'affaires to Baghdad soon to reactivate its embassy closed since the Gulf war, Reuter reports. The diplomat, Mr Sadi Calislar, is expected to be sent to the Iraqi capital early next month.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sezai Sengun: "Argument on Arms Under Threat of </F> Embargo"]    [Text] Ankara--Ankara does not regard seriously the rumors  of a possible European arms embargo against Turkey because of  the Kurdish problem. The officials of the Defense Industry  Undersecretariat [DIU] have said that far from moving to impose  an arms embargo, the European countries are competing with each  other to sell their arms to Turkey. Recalling that France will  sell Super Puma helicopters to Turkey in 1995, the DIU officials  asserted: "They struggled for many months to sell those  helicopters. Will they now decide to inform Turkey that they  won't? The European countries will not find it easy to decide  to impose an arms embargo on Turkey with their arms industries  in difficulty. No one should be worried by the rumors, which  have been circulated by a few irresponsible deputies who support  the Workers Party of Kurdistan."    The same officials said that Turkey and Germany are working  on projects relating to frigates, submarines, and other weapon  systems. As for Britain, they asserted that the two countries  are only working on a project relating to HF-SSB communication  systems. The officials asserted: "Almost all the arms used by  the security forces in southeast Turkey have either been  manufactured locally or acquired from sources other than  Germany. Turkey has been acquiring BRT-60 armored vehicles,  causing significant argument by the Russian Federation. The  security forces will not be helpless if Europe moves to impose  an arms embargo on Turkey."    Although the DIU officials have said they do not regard the  rumors of a possible embargo by the European countries  seriously, they have stressed that a similar reaction by the  United States may cause a problem. For example, Turkish  military aircraft may find it difficult to fulfill their  missions.</p>

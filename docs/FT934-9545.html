			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Anglian Water Yesterday's solid interim figures aside, the stock market has decided Anglian will be among the losers from the forthcoming regulatory review. The 12 per cent slide in its shares over the last month is rougher treatment than that meted out to its peers. The low rate of return on new investment suggested by Ofwat last week is especially bad news for Anglian, which has a large capital spending programme. Its low interest and dividend cover relative to others in the sector leave little room for manoeuvre if faced with tough price limits in the second half of the decade. The snag with such a firm conclusion is that many elements of the review have been left open by the regulator. Ofwat has said that it will squeeze water companies' profits down to its target 5-6 per cent rate of return on capital over a period of 10 years. But the speed of convergence will be tailored for each company. Anglian might thus expect more leniency than Welsh, which has an embarrassment of riches. Anglian's relatively weak balance sheet certainly demands softer treatment, although the regulator has given little away about how far it believes each company's financial ratios might be stretched. Without more information on that score, picking winners and losers remains a matter of gut feel. Anglian has charms of its own, such as an unregulated engineering business which should cover its costs this year. After the latest bout of derating, it can also boast the highest yield in the sector.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- A tax revenue-sharing  (TRS) system introduced since the beginning of this year, which  readjusts interests between central and local governments, has  had the understanding of local officials, especially those from  rich provinces and cities.    Under the TRS system, one of a series of recent, major  reforms, taxes are classified and collected separately by the  central and local governments, ensuring that both have stable  income sources, with the central government gaining a larger  share of increased incomes. The new system has taken  international practices as reference.    Like other major reforms, the new taxation system will have  a  long-term and fundamental positive effect on local economies and  create some temporary difficulties for some departments or  localities.    Whether or not local governments will put the national  interests above their own and whether or not they are willing to  accept the new system, therefore, will decide the progress and  even the success or failure of the TRS system.    At the ongoing session of the Eighth National People's  Congress here, local leaders have shown their understanding of  the need to give priority to overall national interests when  discussing the new taxation system.    They agree that the TRS system will have great significance  for promoting a rational growth of state coffers, increasing the  central financial power and beefing up the central government's  macro- economic regulating capacity. In the long run, the new  system will be conducive to a fast, sustained and sound  development of the national economy. The local and central  governments have no differences on this understanding.    Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju said that a socialist market economy  will not work without behavioral standards. Reform of the  financial and taxation systems aim to set standards and norms to  adjust interest relations between the state enterprises and  between the central and local governments. If the proportion of  revenues for the central coffers is too small to carry out macro  regulations, the whole situation may be thrown into chaos and it  will be difficult for Shanghai to develop under such  circumstances. Therefore, Shanghai gives active support for the  TRS system.    Statistics show that the revenues of the central treasury  accounted for only 45 percent of the total financial revenues of  the country in 1992. During the year, the central treasury had  to pay half of its expenditures by issuing bonds and borrowing  loans.    While local financial departments gained substantial  increases of revenues last year, difficulties of central  finances deteriorated. A weakening of the central financial  power was attributed mainly to the contractual financial system  which diverted the lion's share of increased incomes to  localities in the past decade.    A goal of the TRS system is to increase the proportion of  revenues for the central coffers to 57 percent of the total,  which is considered necessary for the state treasury to perform  normally.    Chen Huanyou, governor of Jiangsu Province, said realization  of the goal means localities will increase their revenue  contributions to the central coffers gradually. Though local  economies may be affected to a certain extent, the impact should  be temporary only. "with a `bigger cake' and growth of the  national economy, localities will be benefited," he said.    Provincial officials estimate that Jiangsu will contribute  an  additional 18.5 billion yuan to the central coffers between now  and the year 2000 under the TRS system.    Shanghai and Jiangsu have led the country in contributions  to  the central treasury in the past decades. In 1993 Shanghai  handed over 13 billion yuan and jiangsu, 7.6 billion yuan,  accounting for 70 percent and 50 percent of their local  financial revenues respectively.    The new taxation system will affect some provinces that  develop rapidly. Guangdong will be at the front to bear the  brunt.    According to the new system, 70 percent of a locality's  increased revenues will be handed over to the central coffers,  with the locality itself keeping the rest. Of Guangdong's  financial revenues of 34 billion yuan in 1993, only two billion  yuan was turned over to the state under the old financial  system. Under the new TRS system, Guangdong has to hand over  many times that amount to the central treasury this year.    However, leaders of Guangdong Province expressed their  support for the new system. Governor Zhu Senlin said the new  system means a redefining of relations between the central and  local authorities rather than a recall of local power.    The measure will mobilize local initiatives and facilitate a  readjustment of the country's economic structure, he said.    Huang Kehua, director of the Finance Bureau of Shandong  Province, said increased revenues for the central government  will enable it to carry out macro-economic controls effectively.    Since the second half of last year, the central government  has adopted a series of macro-economic control measures, which  have alleviated and solved some economic contradictions and  problems. Achievements made so far have helped people understand  the necessity of macro-economic controls in the process of  establishing a market economy.    Zhang Ruifu, director of the Finance Bureau of Hunan  Province, said that macro-economic controls can alleviate and  solve the problems of unfair wealth distribution and regional  imbalance. Solution of the two problems is considered an  important factor for social and political stability in China.    "The central treasury, with increased revenues, can better  support underdeveloped areas, agricultural provinces and ethnic  minority areas," he added.    For this reason, Hunan, Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan and other  inland provinces have placed great hopes on the new taxation  system.    In enforcing the new TRS system, the central government has  adopted a gradual approach and shown a certain degree of  flexibility. This, meant to protect the vested interests of  localities, also wins votes for the TRS system.    For instance, the central treasury will return a certain  amount of revenues to localities based on their 1993  contributions; localities which used to receive subsidies from  the central coffers will continue to retain this privilege for a  period to come; provinces and regions with a concentration of  ethnic minority people will be allowed to adopt some  transitional methods to alleviate the pressure on lower-level  financial departments.    Though the new taxation system has been implemented smoothly  in the past months, financial experts said that it is necessary  to study contradictions and problems arising in its  implementation, study countermeasures timely and minimize its  negative effect.</p>

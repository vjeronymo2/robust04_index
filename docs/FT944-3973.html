			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: In train for better value today than in railways' golden age Sir, I am no defender of British Rail but I recently came across a copy of Punch, dated May 19 1937, in which the LMS Railway made the proud boast that the cost of its third-class travel was one old penny (0.4166 new pence) a mile. l decided to put this to the test against the Pounds 19.50 I recently paid for a day return from Bristol to Torquay (196 miles there and back). In 1937 this journey would have cost me 16 shillings and 4 pence (8l. 66p). On this basis, the journey price has gone up by a factor of 23.88. Taking an average take-home wage of Pounds 3 a week in 1937 and of Pounds 150 today, wages have gone up by a factor of 50. If anyone can prove otherwise, I will withdraw my assertion that rail travel today represents better value than it did in 1937. CS Guest, 30 Longmead Avenue, Horfield, Bristol BS7 8QD</p>

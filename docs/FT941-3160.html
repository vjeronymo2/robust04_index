			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Lid for a bubbling cauldron: Under a separatist president, Crimea's economic and political tensions are mounting The Crimean Peninsula  - a region of Ukraine, dominated by Russians  - is one of the world's new danger zones since the recent election of a president who appeared to promise it would again be part of Russia. The CIA sees it as one of the main threats to Russian-Ukrainian relations and Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former US national security adviser, has said in an article that it is 'on the verge of an ethnic explosion'. This impression was confirmed this week, when Mr Yuri Meshkov, the president, said he would go ahead with a March 27 'opinion poll' on broadening the region's autonomy  - expected to be a prelude to a closer relationship with Russia, if not full unity. President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine annulled the 'poll' on Tuesday night, saying it was a referendum under another name and thus illegal under the constitution: Mr Meshkov insists it will go ahead. The reality is alarming, but those who occupy the centre of the Crimean stage mock the warnings of disaster and insinuate that a deal is possible which would bring stability. Its conditions and structure will be important not just for the peninsula, but also for many of the areas in which 25m Russians live outside their motherland  - a diaspora constituting one of the greatest challenges to post-Soviet peace. Mr Meshkov, in his late 40s, uses the stump politician's passion to excoriate the world for misunderstanding him. He is not an extremist but a moderate, an anti-Communist and a reformer, he said in the Supreme Soviet (parliament) building in the capital, Simferopol. But will he hold the referendum he promised on the status of the republic  - a device to achieve a vote for union with Russia? He evades, talks about the need for economic stability, and finally says that 'the people are not concerned with a referendum'. It seems as close to an admission as it is possible to get that his election referendum pledge will be delayed: his announcement of an 'opinion poll' is a modified version, not binding on him or the government. Others around him are more explicit. Mr Yevgeny Saburov, a former Russian economics minister, has been tempted back to his native Crimea from Moscow on what he says is a sixth of his salary as a presidential adviser to plan the economic future of his region. Mr Saburov, grinning slyly from behind his pipe, says: 'The longer the referendum is delayed, the better it will be for the economy . . . The important thing is the standard of living. But any attempts to isolate Crimea from Russia would mean the strongest opposition here . . . if Ukrainianisation continues, then of course people will vote for joining Russia.' This appears to be a full consensus. What is on offer to President Kravchuk is a deal under which Crimea is allowed to go entirely its own way, in return for which it will allow itself to be governed, titularily, by Kiev. If, as expected, the opinion poll yields a large majority for greater autonomy, Mr Meshkov can be expected to claim a mandate for virtual economic independence. To adapt the old Soviet joke, the deal is: they pretend to rule us, we pretend to obey. In fact, Ukrainian rule would be a facade. Mr Saburov's fledgling economic plan is to recognise the dependence of Crimea on Russian markets  - especially for its agricultural produce  - and to legitimise the use of the Russian rouble and hard currencies, notably the US dollar. He wants to get Russian banks into the peninsula ('they are already quietly buying property') and remove customs borders with Russia. Mr Meshkov and Mr Saburov would have a Russian republic in all but juridical status. It is a plan which could avoid the predicted explosion and let a nervous Europe sleep better. So would it work? Crimea, privileged because the Soviet elite came here to relax in its resorts, has suffered disproportionately from the break-up of the Soviet Union. The inflating currency, the carbovanet, makes transactions a daily horror; the agricultural exports to Russia incur customs and other restrictions; and the Ukraine government demands that the shipyards, which have contracts with Sweden and Greece, change 50 per cent of their hard currency income at a low rate of exchange  - thus confiscating more than their entire profits. Mr Saburov's plan is simple enough. Demolish customs barriers with Russia and revive trade; allow the foreign currency earners to keep their earnings (but pay taxes); and levy taxes on the resorts, which pay none. Add to this foreign businesses and banks: 'I would love them all to come, though I know they take a long time and I am not counting on it soon.' With a revived economy, Mr Meshkov and Mr Saburov believe, will come a contented population. But what of 'ethnic explosions'? Of the peninsula's 2.7m people, about 70 per cent are Russian. Of the rest, some 20-25 per cent are Ukrainian and 200,000 are Crimean Tatars. Ukrainian-Russian relations in Crimea are placid: but the small Ukrainian political class is disturbed. Mr Igor Banakh, leader of the Ukrainian Civil Consensus group, blames Mr Kravchuk for letting Crimea out on too long a leash, and now being unable to pull it back. 'We have to institute the law here, which says that you don't recognise the election of a Crimean president. We see from the example of Yugoslavia that you can't ignore such things.' The Tatars are a different matter. These were the peninsula's natives, their khans displaced from rule in the peninsula (under the Turkish empire) only in the 1780s. During the war, accused of mass betrayal (to the Germans) they were shipped off to central Asia. Ukraine has sanctioned their return. Gratitude to Ukraine and distrust of the Russians led most Tatars to follow the call of their Mejlis, or separate assembly, to vote for the pro-Ukrainian presidential candidate, Nikolai Bagrov. Now on the losing side, they fear they will suffer. Mr Mustafa Jemilev, Mejlis chairman and former dissident, says Mr Meshkov wants to disenfranchise the Tatars by ending the system of 14 protected seats in the Supreme Soviet for them. 'If he does that, of course, there will no more Tatar representatives in the Soviet.' But politics is not the most serious of the Tatars' problems  - poverty is. They are utterly dependent on the state; the returnees are given a small plot of land and some building materials. In one settlement, Molodyezhnoye 5 near Simferopol, 75-year-old Asfore Maileyeva and her daughter-in-law, Zenia, sit in a breeze-block hut the size of a garden shed which houses a family of six. She is a testament to the ability to withstand hardship, but also to her people's desire to return. 'I don't regret coming,' she says. 'Nobody can tell you to move on from here.' The Tatars have neither the numbers nor the will to fuel an ethnic crisis: the more explosive issue is that of ownership of the Black Sea Fleet, based in the old and still, in parts, noble port of Sevastopol. This fleet has been a political tug of war since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and remains so. Captain Andrei Grachev, the fleet's spokesman, does not disguise his contempt for the separate fleet being built up by the Ukrainians ('five admirals and four ships') and is happy to say that Admiral Eduard Baltin, the Russian commander of the fleet, has barred the employment of Ukrainian naval officers because they have taken an oath to a foreign state  - even though the fleet is supposed to be joint Russian-Ukrainian property. For his part, Vice-Admiral Volodomir Bezkorovainiy, commander of the diminutive Ukrainian navy, insists that the accord reached between Presidents Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin of Russia last September, under which Ukraine would return its half of the fleet and lease Sevastopol to Russia, is now null, and that the question of how to divide the fleet still has to be resolved. He bases this view on the failure of experts on both sides to agree on the details of the fleet's transfer to Russia. The Russians, who have so far prevented the build-up of a powerful military force in any of the former Soviet republics, are unlikely to give way: the Ukrainians cannot. What, then, are the chances for a peaceful resolution of the Crimean dilemma? On his recent trip to the US, Mr Kravchuk said privately that he would never allow the circulation of the rouble in Crimea  - but that he knew well how to negotiate with the Russians and he did not expect anything like an explosion. To be sure, this apparently most fissiparous of relationships retains its curious character: logically alarming, but actually placid. The new leaders of the Crimea, perhaps in collusion with Kiev, assume that the logic will remain in limbo.</p>

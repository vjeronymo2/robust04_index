			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT WEEKDAY REPORT;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> MCDANIEL WILL REPLACE INJURED LEWIS AT CORNER  </P> <P> The Raiders placed rookie cornerback Garry Lewis on four-week injured reserve  Monday because of a broken collarbone suffered during Sunday's 20-3 victory  over Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Lewis, who won the starting job from Terry McDaniel, will be replaced on the  roster by safety Vann McElroy, whose two-week roster exemption for signing late  ended Monday at 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Raider Coach Art Shell said McDaniel will replace Lewis at left corner.  </P> <P> Shell said linebacker Aaron Wallace's shoulder bruise is not serious and that  he will probably play against Chicago Sunday. . . . Shell said he planned to  play Greg Bell in the second quarter Sunday but changed his mind because the  Raiders' offense had the ball for only 17 plays in the half. "I was planning on  using both (Bell and Marcus Allen) in the first half," Shell said. "It didn't  work out that way, so we started the second half with Greg. Marcus started the  game."

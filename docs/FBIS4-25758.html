			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Foreign ministers or  their representatives from 41 countries today called on the  world to fully implement all the existing arms control and  disarmament agreements.    In a statement released at the end of the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council (NACC) meeting, the participants agreed that  they will continue their supports to the CFE (Conventional Armed  Forces in Europe) Treaty as a corner-stone of European security  and stability.    They also urged an "early entry into force of the Convention  on Chemical Weapons."    They asked all states to fully implement the "Biological and  Toxin Weapons Convention and to strengthen it."    The statement also called for an early entry into force of  the Treaty on Open Skies and increased transparency on  conventional arms transfers.    The participants called for an early conclusion of a  universal and effectively verifiable comprehensive test ban  treaty.    In the nuclear field, the ministers "welcome the trilateral  statement signed by Presidents Bill Clinton (of the U.S.),  Leonid Kravchuk (of Ukraine) and Boris Yeltsin (of Russia) in  Moscow on 14 January on the transfer of all nuclear warheads in  Ukraine to Russia for dismantlement."    During the one-day meeting the ministers and representatives  of the 41 countries also discussed the regional conflicts which  could lead to unstability in the region.    On the Bosnian conflict, the meeting urged the "parties  concerned to conclude the comprehensive cessation of hostilities  and negotiate an early and durable settlement of the conflict."    The meeting, which was chaired by Sergio Baganzino, deputy  secretary-general of the NATO, decided to hold next NACC meeting  in Brussels in December this year.</p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Arts: Merce Cunningham - an Event for the feet / Dance A foot is what you find at the bottom end of your leg. But a foot is also a metrical unit, as in poetry. The connection between the two, not often apparent, is never more vivid than in the choreography of Merce Cunningham. Here are feet that bring the whole body into life; they rise, fall, flex, point, tap, they brace, anchor, lead and pace. And here are feet that, often audibly, mark out iambs, trochees, dactyls, spondees, anapaests, amphibrachs, a changing, wide range of clear metres. There are no feet in all dance like those of the Cunningham company. To have them briefly back in Britain has been a privilege. Some larger superlatives are also in order. There is no dance company today in which style and technique are more ideally fused. No company of dancers today is composed of more individually attractive (or attractively individual) people. And no company today has such consistently superb choreography. Please note the present tense here. Cunningham is 73, and it is a fact that his dances seldom if ever look their best when he is not around to coach them. Even if some of them survive him, it is obvious that most of his work present future dancers with far greater problems of interpretation than choreography by Martha Graham and George Balanchine - little of which today is in the condition it enjoyed 10 years ago, during their lifetimes. Dance is the art of the present tense, after all. There is nothing in life like catching it, so to speak, hot off the press. This return to Britain, after three years, consisted of performances in Northampton and in London at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Though since 1964 London has seen several seasons of Cunningham's work, these three South Bank performances were the first it has seen of his Events. A Cunningham Event is a one-off anthology, selected from a range of his works, and is usually performed with music and designs that did not originally accompany that choreography. An event changes so much during its duration - generally around 90 minutes - that it becomes complete demonstration of the whole Cunningham experience. Writing after the first two performances, I testify to the rapt attention and instant acclaim that they received from audiences. The present array of Cunningham dancers performed marvel upon marvel this weekend. On Saturday, Robert Swinston and Patricia Lent each performed exacting solos (originally from Signals, 1970) with phenomenal audacity and control. Swinston, always both withdrawn and intense, tossed off unexpected air turns, to right and left, and other jumps, swept across the stage with fervour, and was constantly surprising. Lent, in an already amazingly secure balance high on half-toe, arched back, and then further back, keeping her balance, and then proceeded with inscrutable assurance to further prodigies of equilibrium, leaning way to one side with one leg beaming high into the air on the other. And these are not feats of 'mere' technique; they register on us as acts of spiritual daring do. In a duet (from Trails, 1982), Carol Teitelbaum came bounding on with exhilarating ballon and attack. Already possessed of a breathtaking fixity of purpose on stage, she has now begun to discover the lightness of touch and personal authority to make her a central figure in the company. Such a character is in perfect contrast to the calmly eccentric elegance of Helen Barrow, the witty and luscious Larissa McGoldrick, the lyrical fervour of Emma Diamond or the plush power of Jenifer Weaver. The company's male dancers are maybe even more striking. This weekend, David Kulick's blithe heroism, Alan Good's serene command and Frederic Gafner's vivid involvement all made particularly strong impressions. The structure of an Event varies greatly. Now you see a private game for a small group, now a series of grand-scale duets, now an ensemble moving like wildlife at large, now solos that roam out on to the less known perimeters of the mind. The Cunningham experience is still difficult for some observers. Though its basic nature has probably changed little since the 1950s and 1960s, it remains more profoundly avant garde than any experimental work being created by new dance-makers. Still, at a mysterious level an Event is peculiarly coherent and expressive. Cunningham's choreography never fails to say 'What a piece of work is man'. Great dancing, great theatre, great poetry.

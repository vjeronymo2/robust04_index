			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY LETS ECOLOGICAL HERITAGE ERODE;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: A 1980 PROMISE TO PROTECT 61 UNSPOILED AREAS FROM DEVELOPMENT  HASN'T BEEN KEPT.  </P> <P> With its coastal, desert, and alpine landscapes, Los Angeles County has a  natural diversity almost unequaled in the world. In recognition of this, and  under pressure from the courts, officials a decade ago created a network of  "Significant Ecological Areas" to save remnants of that rich natural heritage.  </P> <P> Ranging from austere desert buttes and ancient oak savannahs to deep canyons,  coastal dunes and wetlands, the areas were selected for their value as habitat  and migration corridors for wildlife, or as strongholds for threatened plants,  animals and birds.  </P> <P> The 61 SEAs were mostly privately owned, but the county's 1980 General Plan  made it official policy to protect them from incompatible development and to  try to acquire those most threatened.  </P> <P> Since then, the SEAs have suffered from obscurity and neglect, an investigation  by The Times has found. SEAs have been nibbled by development, and, with other  open space dwindling, are under enormous pressure from big housing and  commercial projects, proposed roads and even garbage dumps.  </P> <P> One area alone -- the Palo Comado SEA in Agoura -- is targeted by four  residential and commercial projects. A proposed project of 1,900 homes and a  golf course would cover 300 acres of an SEA in Valencia. And at the edge of the  Ballona Creek SEA near Marina del Rey, a proposed city-within-a-city called  Playa Vista is envisioned with 11,750 housing units and parking for 25,000  cars.  </P> <P> "I think the SEAs are struggling to survive," said Tim Thomas, a biologist and  member of a county advisory committee on the SEAs. "We're . . . getting a wave  of requests to develop in SEAs, to use SEAs to . . . put trash in and to put  houses on, and these things are all incompatible with the intent of the  designation of the SEAs."  </P> <P> But Dave Vannatta, an aide to County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, said that the  SEAs have been reasonably protected and that development within them "has been  compatible with the resource."  </P> <P> Don Knabe, an aide to Supervisor Deane Dana, said the supervisors rely on  county planning staff for advice on land-use matters, adding that that he was  not aware of any controversy concerning the SEAs.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County is not solely in charge of the SEAs' fate. Some are within  municipal boundaries, where county land-use regulations do not apply.  </P> <P> Still, had the county made the SEAs a priority, development conflicts would  have been reduced. But management of the SEAs has been a serious failure,  interviews and public records show. Consider:  </P> <P> * The county did not fulfill the commitment made a decade ago to "actively  search for funding mechanisms at all governmental levels" to purchase SEAs. The  proposed county parks bond issue that failed at the polls Nov. 6 would have  provided the first funds to purchase SEAs.  </P> <P> * County planning officials have not monitored development in SEAs and don't  know which areas are intact or degraded. Without such basic data, informed  decisions on new development plans in SEAs are impossible. Yet county  supervisors have turned down requests for funds to study the status of the  SEAs.  </P> <P> * The county itself is a threat to SEAs. For example, county transportation  plans call for eventual extension of Thousand Oaks Boulevard through the Palo  Comado SEA in Agoura, an expanse of grassy hills and stately oaks that supports  deer, bobcats, coyotes, and golden eagles. The county also has declared three  canyons in SEAs in the Santa Susana and Santa Monica mountains to be suitable  sites for future trash dumps.  </P> <P> "If we take a so-what attitude towards the SEAs, we're taking a so-what  attitude toward the . . . ecosystems of the rest of the world, and the  ecosystems are what support our lives," said Dick Friesen, a biologist and  consultant who chairs the Significant Ecological Area Technical Advisory  Committee, or SEATAC, a panel of biologists that advises the county on  development in SEAs.  </P> <P> "If we can't retain the SEAs in Los Angeles County, where there's a big  population base and a big economic base to do it," it will be impossible to do  in poorer parts of the world, he said.  </P> <P> Even when portions of SEAs have been preserved, it has required big concessions  to developers. Consider two recent agreements that have been hailed as  environmental triumphs.  </P> <P> In one case, Los Angeles airport officials agreed to preserve 200 acres of the  El Segundo Dunes SEA west of Los Angeles International Airport, while  developing a golf course on 100 other acres.  </P> <P> In the other case, environmentalists and developers settled years of litigation  over the Ballona Creek SEA, which includes one of Southern California's last  surviving tidal wetlands.  </P> <P> The developers agreed to preserve and help restore about 270 acres of the  wetlands. In return, environmentalists agreed not to fight plans for the huge  Playa Vista development overlooking the preserve, which is to include 11,750  apartment and condominium units, 2,400 hotel rooms and 5.7 million square feet  of office and retail space.  </P> <P> Other SEAs are also threatened.  </P> <P> Above Granada Hills, Browning-Ferris Industries is trying to expand its  Sunshine Canyon landfill into more than 500 acres of the Santa Susana Mountains  SEA, a move that would wipe out thousands of trees and redraw the SEA map to  delete that portion.  </P> <P> Another plan calls for development of two golf courses on more than 600 acres  of the Tonner Canyon SEA near Diamond Bar.  </P> <P> West of Lancaster, the proposed California Springs development -- 5,700 acres  and 21,000 homes -- would encroach on the Joshua Tree Woodland and the Fairmont  and Antelope Buttes SEAs.  </P> <P> Piecemeal development has pecked away at the Kentucky Springs SEA south of  Palmdale, a swath of rugged foothills where a distinct subspecies of Great  Basin sage grows in unusual abundance. The northern part of that SEA has been  damaged by houses and four-wheel-drive traffic, according to Asenath Rasmussen,  a biochemist and research consultant who recently visited the area.  </P> <P> The northern part, she said, has been "altered so dramatically that it's not a  continuously functioning community anymore."  </P> <P> Like the agreement on the Ballona wetlands, the SEA network grew out of a  citizens lawsuit. In 1975, a group calling itself the Coalition for Los Angeles  Planning in the Public Interest won a lawsuit against the county over  deficiencies in the county's General Plan, including lack of adequate  open-space protection.  </P> <P> As a result, the county had to rewrite the General Plan and improve its  open-space policies. The SEAs were designated by consultants whose report  called for preserving the SEAs in "as near a pristine condition as possible."  </P> <P> A few uses -- such as passive recreation and nature study -- should be allowed,  but "residential, agricultural, industrial and commercial developments" would  damage native vegetation and "are clearly incompatible," the report said.  </P> <P> Saving SEAs "would inevitably require acquisition of areas by Los Angeles  County," the report said.  </P> <P> The General Plan diluted these conclusions in substance and tone. It did not  rule out residential development in SEAs, for example.  </P> <P> Still, the plan declared it county policy "to preserve the county's significant  ecological resources and habitat areas in as viable and natural condition as  possible." And an accompanying document pledged that the county would seek  funds to buy SEAs.  </P> <P> But the timing could not have been worse for a costly new environmental  program. In 1978, the tax-slashing Proposition 13 cut deeply into county  budgets.  </P> <P> Moreover, the year the General Plan was adopted, 1980, was also the year Mike  Antonovich and Deane Dana joined incumbent Pete Schabarum on the Board of  Supervisors, forming a conservative, pro-development majority that receives  substantial campaign contributions from development interests.  </P> <P> A 1980s building boom coincided with a steady erosion of county planning staff,  making it more difficult to study the impact of development on open space. The  county Department of Regional Planning saw its staff dwindle from 212 employees  in 1980 to about 150 today, department figures show.  </P> <P> Moreover, the supervisors did not create a fund to buy SEAs. Two other agencies  -- the National Park Service and Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy -- did buy  some tracts in the Santa Monica Mountains that included SEAs. But critics,  including some members of Congress, said the supervisors at times were more  hindrance than help.  </P> <P> By "upzoning" land in scenic areas -- allowing developers to build more homes  than previous zoning provided -- the supervisors made acquisition more  expensive and difficult for other agencies, the critics said.  </P> <P> "The county should be condemned . . . not because they haven't come up with the  money themselves, but because they haven't cooperated with" park agencies that  had funds, said Carlyle W. Hall Jr., the Los Angeles attorney who filed the  1973 suit that voided the General Plan.  </P> <P> Sherry Teresa, a wildlife biologist with the California Department of Fish and  Game and formerly its Los Angeles wildlife unit manager, said high-ranking Fish  and Game officials have essentially written off Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> "The attitude is that, within L.A. County, . . . development was inevitable,  you weren't going to save anything anyway," so Fish and Game "would rather  spend their . . . very limited resources elsewhere," Teresa said.  </P> <P> "You have a board of supervisors that's philosophically opposed to restricting  the use of private property, and I think they're philosophically opposed to the  public ownership of land," said David Brown, an associate professor of history  at Valley College and chairman of the Sierra Club's Santa Monica Mountains task  force.  </P> <P> But Vannatta, the Antonovich aide, said that the county faces critical unmet  needs and that purchasing SEAs "cannot and does not have that kind of  priority." Besides, the idea is to protect the SEAs, not own them, he said.  </P> <P> "Mike's interest is in protecting the resource," Vannatta said of his boss.  "We've been able to protect these lands without taking them off the tax rolls."  </P> <P> Supervisor Ed Edelman said he was concerned the county had not made the SEAs "a  high enough priority."  </P> <P> An Edelman aide noted that the SEAs have not been a big issue for local  environmental groups. "You've got a lot of commitments to honor, and the ones  you pay most attention to are the ones where people hold your feet to the  fire," he said.  </P> <P> As the first line of defense for the SEAs, the county created SEATAC, the panel  of biologists that reviews projects in the SEAs.  </P> <P> SEATAC reviews building plans for their effect on native vegetation and  wildlife, and typically recommends a few changes to reduce damage, such as  clustering of homes. On rare occasions, SEATAC advises that that a project be  rejected as overly destructive. Such a recommendation by SEATAC figured earlier  this year in the rejection of the huge Malibu Terrace development in the Palo  Comado SEA, a project now being redesigned.  </P> <P> But some county planners, and SEATAC members themselves, see serious flaws in  the system. As SEATAC member Frank Hovore put it, "the process still allows for  the slow deterioration of the SEAs."  </P> <P> For example, many SEA encroachments never come to SEATAC's attention.  Subdivisions need county approval, but landowners build single-family homes and  horse corrals or graze cattle in SEAs without SEATAC's knowledge.  </P> <P> In some cases, SEATAC members said, it appears that landowners have graded or  grazed their property before coming before the panel so they can argue that  there are no rare plants to protect.  </P> <P> In other cases, SEATAC recommendations are almost impossible to enforce, such  as requirements to minimize destruction of natural vegetation that must be  cleared near homes under fire safety rules.  </P> <P> SEATAC members also lack detailed information on the condition of SEAs -- data  vital to making sound decisions about the cumulative effects of development.  </P> <P> "They can't give a progress report of how much development has occured in the  area, how much of the SEA has been lost to development since designation of the  SEA," SEATAC member Tim Thomas said. It's a "constraint on our ability to  perform."  </P> <P> For about three years, SEATAC members have pushed for a study of the status of  SEAs -- including field surveys and aerial photographs to assess damage and  determine which SEAs should be expanded or reduced.  </P> <P> But two separate budget requests for between $300,000 and $350,000 have been  rejected. Rather than renew the request this year, planning officials instead  decided to earmark $40,000 in operating funds to launch the SEA study. But the  work has not begun, partly due to the problem of deciding what can be done with  so little money.  </P> <P> "In terms of this whole problem," said Ted Elias, a planning department  administrator, the $40,000 "is just a very, very minimal start."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SIGNIFICANT ECOLOGICAL AREAS  </P> <P> 61 areas* were designated in the county's 1980 General Plan. To be protected  were rare landscapes, wildlife migration corridors, habitats for insects,  plants, birds, and mammals.  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO VALLEY  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.54IN:3.10IN:2.99IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Name &amp; Number  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Location  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Natural Feature  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Simi Hills (14)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> west of Chatsworth  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> wildlife corridor  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Santa Susana Mts.

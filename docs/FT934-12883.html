			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / First Soviet leader suffers the final ignominy AFTER a year of being knocked off pedestals across the former Soviet Union, Lenin has suffered the final Russian humbling. An unnamed German businessman has offered DM1m (Pounds 406,500) for his embalmed body. According to Russian officials, he wants to display it as a tourist attraction in Europe. The proposal will almost certainly be rejected. Although Moscow city officials say they have received other western offers, they stress they have no plans to sell the body. Last week, Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the hard-nosed mayor of Moscow, suggested to President Boris Yeltsin Lenin's body should be removed to be given a 'proper burial' with his mother and sister in St Petersburg. 'The return of Lenin's body would be an act marking the return of national burial traditions, as historically stipulated by the spiritual and cultural influence of the Russian Orthodox church,' he said. Any reburial of either Lenin or Tsar Nicholas II, shot by Bolsheviks in the Urals in 1918, would require the blessing of the Church - a factor that could delay the process and add an extra note of political controversy. Few officials openly admit that they are considering moving Lenin's body specifically in response to recent events, such as this month's revolt by communist hardliners. In public, at least, they argue that Lenin's family themselves requested that his body be buried in St Petersburg. But, with the Lenin Mausoleum on Red Square a key focus for anti-communist demonstrations in recent years, the suggestion of closing it is undoubtedly intended as a symbolic boost to the reformers  - and has already provoked bitter protests. Lenin's niece, Mrs Olga Ulyanova, has denied he asked to be buried in St Petersburg, and insists on being consulted before any reburial. All the same, the mausoleum's warders say they have been besieged by calls from anxious relatives of the deceased, concerned by rumours of a secret removal of the body. For the moment, the reformers have the upper hand - although only 45 per cent of Russians in the summer supported removing Lenin's body, the figure shot to 62 per cent after the failed revolt, according to a recent opinion poll. But Mr Yeltsin's officials say that the reburial is unlikely to occur before the parliamentary elections in December -not least because, in the best Soviet tradition, there is now a queue for reburial. Top of the list, says Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff, is the Tsar's family. Others potentially awaiting reburial include Leonid Brezhnev, Josef Stalin and the American Bolshevik sympathiser John Reed. Meanwhile, across the square from the mausoleum, the official Lenin Museum last week opened an alternative. Tourists can now visit a political waxworks featuring not just Lenin, but also deathly-looking figures of Messrs Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- The Japan-Russia Business  Cooperation Committee decided Tuesday [5 April] to appoint as  its chairman Jiro Kawake, honorary chairman of New Oji Paper  Co., committee officials said.    The decision was made at an extraordinary general meeting of  the committee, which falls under the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren).

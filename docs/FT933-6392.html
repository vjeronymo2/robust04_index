			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Swedbank seeks to avoid calling for state support SWEDBANK, the newly-merged Swedish savings bank group, yesterday reported a sharp contraction in first-half losses and said it was working on a plan that would avoid it having to call on government support, The bank did not disclose details of its proposals, and said further information would not be available until the middle of November at the earliest. Last week's Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, withdrew its request for state aid. Swedbank said its first-half operating deficit fell to SKr1.59bn (Dollars 197m) from SKr5.88bn. This followed an increase in operating income before loan losses to SKr4.20bn from SKr3.38bn plus reduced credit losses of SKr5.80bn against SKr9.25bn. The bank said a 15 per cent reduction in costs helped explain its improved result. The bank's capital adequacy ratio has weakened to 8.8 per cent from 9.3 per cent at the end of last year.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Berber singer released Lounes Mahtoub, the Kabyle Berber singer, kidnapped by Islamic guerrillas two weeks ago, was released on Monday evening, Francis Ghiles writes from Paris. The kidnapping of the popular singer, who strongly identifies with Berber culture, had brought out 100,000 people into the streets of the regional capital of Tizi Ouzou. The kidnapping appears to have been the work of the extremist Islamic Armed Group. The release of the singer appears to have been negotiated through traditional channels of family and clan, Mr Mahtoub's family having threatened retribution on the families of two of the kidnappers, who were also Kabyle Berbers.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRENCH CHINTZ  </P> <P> Even after an expensive cross-Atlantic visit, reporter Edward Dolnick couldn't  come up with the answer as to why the French are more fit than Americans (Oct.  25). I have a theory.  </P> <P> It is the chintziness of the French. Those sauces cover up for the niggardly  amount of food they typically serve. The more generous Americans take in a lot  more food, i.e. calories.  </P> <P> I read somewhere that the French learned about chopping and sauteing anything  handy and covering the invention with camouflaging sauces from an Italian,  Marco Polo, who in turn learned the trick of preparing "cheap cuisine made to  look elegant" from the economy-minded Chinese. I've dined on French food during  two visits to that country, and in this country when I'm forced to. I'm never  sure whether there's a piece of shoe leather under the distracting sauce or an  eighth of an ounce of real beef.  </P> <P> So the answer as to why the French are more fit may be that we hearty Americans  simply eat more, whether it's fried chicken or celery sticks. But at least we  know what we're eating and don't feel the need to bury our food under deceptive  sauces.  </P> <P>  -- CAROL LAW  </P> <P> Leucadia  </P></p>

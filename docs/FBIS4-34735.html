			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aziz Filho] </F>   [Excerpt] Barreiras -- On 19 June, PDT [Democratic Labor  Party] candidate Leonel Brizola warned that politicians' moral  standards, weakened by electoral bonds worth billions of  cruzeiros, can ripen conditions for the military's return to  power. He added: "The people's rejection of and scorn for  politicians will turn into hate."    Brizola said he was "shocked" at the parties' estimated  expenses. "This will cause uneasiness in the barracks because it  amounts to squandering public funds," he said. He criticized the  bill providing for income tax discounts covering part of the  donations. He admitted that the deputies of his own party are  reluctant to approve the bill. Brizola advocated Superior  Electoral Court (TSE) action to strictly limit candidates'  expenses.    According to Brizola, if the TSE president does not take  action, "Brazilian democracy will deteriorate to the benefit of  those in the military who nurture moralistic and power  ambitions." He said a modest budget allocation for parties would  be better than the current law. He suggested that the TSE allow  each candidate to use only two small jet planes and ban  electoral shows, "which are too expensive." If no action is  taken, "what Fernando Collor did will be very small compared  with what will be done during these elections," Brizola said.  [passage omitted]</p>

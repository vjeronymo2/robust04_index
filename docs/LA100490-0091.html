			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> SILBERMAN ORDERED TO PAY $50,000 FINE  </P> <P> Richard T. Silberman, sentenced last week to 46 months in federal prison for  his role in a money-laundering scheme, was ordered to pay a $50,000 fine amid  disclosure that the once-wealthy San Diego financier owes more than $1.5  million in legal fees.  </P> <P> Despite Silberman's whopping debts, which total at least $2.1 million, U.S.  District Judge J. Lawrence Irving imposed the fine because he was not convinced  Silberman was unable to pay a fine required under rigid new federal sentencing  guidelines, according to court documents. "We are satisfied with the judge's  ruling and I think this closes the book on Richard Silberman," said Assistant  U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder.  </P></p>

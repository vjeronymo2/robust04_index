			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Swedish central bank sets target for inflation SWEDEN'S central bank, the Riksbank, said yesterday price stability was its 'over-riding objective' as it set an inflation target of 2 per cent a year for the economy from 1995. This was the first specific policy statement from the bank since Sweden was compelled to float the krona last November. It came a day after the bank intervened in the markets to support the currency for the first time since then. For 1993 and 1994, the bank is aiming to hold underlying inflation to 2 per cent, although actual inflation will rise to some 5 per cent this year, following the depreciation of the krona and an increase in indirect taxes. 'Price increases in excess of 5 per cent cannot be tolerated,' said the central bank. It did not signal any reduction in its key marginal rate, which stands at 10.5 per cent, nor did it suggest any specific exchange rate targets. The bank has set the inflation target to cover the time that the krona continues to float, but wants a return to a fixed exchange rate when conditions allow. Yesterday's policy statement had little impact on the krona, which has fallen victim to a new round of currency speculation since the New Year. The Swedish currency was yesterday trading at around SKr4.45 to the D-Mark in London, little changed from the SKr4.44 level seen on Thursday. Although the currency has been devalued by some 15 per cent against the D-Mark since its link to the Ecu was broken on November 19, there is speculation the krona may have further to fall. Mr Keith Edmonds, international economist at NatWest Markets in London, said that the announcement of an official deficit forecast for the 1993/1994 fiscal year of SKr160bn, or 11 per cent of GDP, had raised concerns. 'There is a possibility of another edge downwards after the sharp rise in government borrowing,' he said.</p>

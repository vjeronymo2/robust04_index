			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OOIDA stated:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Owner-operators frequently purchase tie-down hooks, chains, wire ropes, etc. at truck stops or other similar locations. Drivers need to be assured that the items purchased meet all applicable safety standards. Therefore, the Agency should take steps to require prominent displays on packaging that will ensure that the product meets safety requirements. Specific details on packaging as to working load limit are preferable to general statements that manufacturing standards are met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the FHWA is aware of the need for carriers and enforcement officials to be able to identify the various cargo securement devices and the associated working load limits, the final rule does not include a requirement for marking and labeling of these devices. Such a requirement must take into account manufacturers' practices as well as the need for uniformity. The commenters did not provide any listings of current marking and labeling practices to assist the FHWA in determining appropriate regulatory language. The agency cannot estimate what percentage of tiedown equipment currently in use by motor carriers or stocked by manufacturers and retailers is unmarked or not directly marked with a working load limit. Although a general requirement for the use of marked and labeled equipment could be included in &sect;393.102, the absence of specific and objective guidelines as to what constitutes an acceptable mark or label for each type of tiedown (i.e., chain, synthetic webbing, wire rope, steel strapping, cordage) would create enforcement difficulties. The FHWA encourages tiedown manufacturers to develop uniform systems of marking and labeling their products to assist motor carriers and enforcement officials in determining working load limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicability of Cargo Securement Regulations to Shippers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New York and the OOIDA expressed concern about the applicability of the cargo securement regulations to shippers. Citing the catastrophic results of accidents caused by inadequate securement of steel and aluminum products, New York believed the ``federal regulations should assign responsibility for proper cargo securement of steel and aluminum products to both the shipper and the carrier.'' The OOIDA stated:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A large degree of responsibility for cargo securement lies squarely with the individual shipper. It is the shipper who selects and ultimately contracts with various motor carriers to transport their commodities. Each shipper has an obligation to scrutinize every prospective carrier and engage only those capable of providing the proper equipment and expertise necessary to safely haul their specific product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA acknowledges these concerns. Whatever the merits of these arguments, however, the FHWA has no statutory authority to regulate shippers of steel and aluminum products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Future Rulemakings on Cargo Securement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters discussed the need for amending or clarifying numerous provisions of the cargo securement regulations as well as the need for research. The Illinois Department of Transportation wrote:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Illinois is concerned that application of the proposed aggregate working load limit formula may not provide adequate margins of safety. What may be considered adequate securement for general freight may not be adequate for other loads. The regulations identify unique securement standards for intermodal containers. Coils and metal articles also have special securement requirements. Cargo weight and load configuration both need to be factored into the performance standards expected from tiedown systems *&blank;*&blank;*.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential gravity and actual severity of incidents involving the transportation of metal coils, their frequency of occurrence and the high number of apparent violations of the securement regulations give credibility to the need to reevaluate the securement regulations. These concerns have led Illinois to sponsor a university research project to examine the unique properties of metal coil cargo securement *&blank;*&blank;*.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The project will take 15 months and focus upon five areas: (1) Review and evaluate current systems, (2) examine the volume of coils transported and the types of securement systems in use in Illinois, (3) evaluate the knowledge of persons using or enforcing the securement regulations, (4) perform engineering dynamic studies to evaluate securement systems, and (5) recommend improvements in securement systems and/or educational efforts for persons involved in both the transportation and enforcement areas of the regulations. Upon its completion, the results and conclusion of this project will be made available to FHWA and other parties interested in transportation safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The research project will examine the dynamic forces affecting securement systems during normal driving and during less than ideal transportation conditions such as hard braking, emergency maneuvers or sharp radius turns. Illinois' data indicates loss of cargo commonly occurs during these less than ideal conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA welcomes efforts by academia, tiedown and vehicle manufacturers, motor carriers, and others conducting research or studies directed at reducing the incidence of cargo securement-related accidents. Currently the FHWA is working with the Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators, State and Provincial agencies responsible for motor carrier safety activities, and U.S. and Canadian industry groups to conduct a comprehensive research program on cargo securement. A report identifying certain cargo securement issues needing research and describing a program to address them was published by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation in November 1993. A copy of the report entitled ``A Proposal for Research to Provide a Technical Basis for a Revised National Standard on Load Security for Heavy Trucks'' is included in the docket file. It is expected that this research, along with efforts such as those described by Illinois, will contribute greatly toward evaluating current cargo securement regulations and industry practices and providing recommendations for specific actions needed to improve safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule is not intended to preclude consideration of future rulemakings on cargo securement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Yen drives down Nikkei in volatile region The yen's renewed strength against the dollar discouraged investors, and share prices lost ground for the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index fell 350.07, or 1.7 per cent, to 20,512.70 on arbitrage unwinding, leaving it down 0.7 per cent on the week. The index opened at the day's high of 20,803.36 and hit a low of 20,501.20 just before the close. A sharp rise in the yen against the dollar triggered by the US trade deficit with Japan prompted the sell-off. The dollar fell to a three week low, below the Y98 level. Some domestic financial institutions, including public pension and insurance funds, were seen supporting share prices at lower levels, while overseas investors bought construction, steel and chemical stocks. Volume was 254m shares against 266m. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 19.27 to 1,643.82 and the Nikkei 300 declined 3.82 to 298.94. Declines outnumbered advances 856 to 149, with 147 issues remaining unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.16 to 1,332.20. Export oriented stocks were hit by the yen. Nissan Motor, the day's most active issue, fell Y23 to Y787, while Sharp declined Y60 to Y1,790 and Hitachi Y25 to Y985. Steel makers fell on profit-taking amid active trading - Nippon Steel fell Y6 to Y368 and Sumitomo Metal Industries declined Y1 to Y338. Chemicals, which had been popular among foreign investors recently, were mixed. Sumitomo Chemical rose Y5 to Y580 on afternoon buying, while Mitsubishi Kasei dropped Y11 to Y551 on profit-taking. Some construction companies were supported by overseas investors. Penta-Ocean Construction rose Y9 to Y639 and Obayashi Y4 to Y706. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 209.84 to 22,980.06 in volume of 56.1m shares. Roundup The region was volatile. HONG KONG took profits amid concern over some key earnings reports due next week, and fears of an prime rate rise which were justified by a lift of half a percentage point after the market closed. The Hang Seng index ended down 114.45 at 9,404.44, down 6 per cent over the week. In London trading the indicative index was quoted at 9,407. Dealers said expectations for next week's batch of earnings were still relatively high, but investors were selling on worries that they could leave share prices still lower. BOMBAY's BSE index closed 65.55 lower at 4,468.78 as speculators sold ahead of four days of holidays and investors kept to the sidelines. The BSE fell 0.9 per cent over the week. TAIWAN rose 180.22, or 2.7 per cent to 6,776.38 in heavy turnover of TDollars 109bn, for a week's gain of 2.2 per cent. The market rumour was that major players, overbought in recent bullish sessions, were trying to push up prices before selling; analysts expected heavy profit-taking to emerge in coming sessions. Financials were major gainers, with ICBC soaring TDollars 6, or 6.7 per cent to TDollars 95.50 and China Development Corp up TDollars 6.50 to TDollars 137. MANILA strengthened 26.3 to 3,006.7, flat on the week in volume of 4.99bn shares. Bargain hunters entered the market after the index dipped to 2,980. KUALA LUMPUR shrugged off the overnight fall in Wall Street and returned strongly in the afternoon. The KLSE composite index closed at 1,140.70, up 4.36 to gain 2.8 per cent on the week as analysts suggested that market sentiment remained bullish. Sitt Tatt rose 65 cents to MDollars 6.50 on a massive restructuring exercise. SYDNEY saw a rally in golds as it ended the week 0.5 per cent up, with the All Ordinaries index 5.5 lower at 2,061.3. The golds index rose 52.0 to 2,177.8 after bullion broke out of a two-week slumber to gain more than three cents overnight. Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie, which topped turnover among resource stocks with almost 11m shares exchanged, rose six cents to ADollars 1.17. WELLINGTON saw renewed buying in the afternoon to end lower on moderate turnover. The NZSE-40 index fell 6.65 to 2090.73, a rise of almost one per cent on the week.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Madrid may have to raise taxes as deficits grow THE Spanish government, alarmed at the rapid growth of its budget and current account deficits, has warned it may be forced to raise withholding taxes on incomes just a few months after lowering them. The warnings coincided with the publication yesterday of May inflation figures showing a 0.3 per cent rise in the consumer price index, which held year-on-year inflation to 6.5 per cent for the second month in a row. Although the May figures confirm a slowing in price rises, the government had been hoping for an even lower increase. The Madrid stock market lost ground on the news and the Treasury's 10-year bond, already battered by panic selling following the Danish referendum on June 2, fell again. The bond has shed 4.2 per cent since the referendum and was yielding 11.6 per cent yesterday, sharply up from 10.8 per cent the day before the Danish vote. The falls in the price of the Spanish long bond, analysts fear, may force the government to resort, once again, to issuing short term T-bills to finance its budget deficit, which by the end of April totalled Pta655bn (Pounds 3.6bn), up 53 per cent on the same time last year. This has raised serious doubts about plans to cut the country's public deficit from 4.4 per cent of GDP last year to 1 per cent in 1997 as part of its plans to streamline the economy ahead of European monetary union. A deteriorating trade picture is also undermining the current account of the balance of payments, which was in deficit by Pta554bn in the first quarter of this year, an increase of more than 20 per cent on 1991. The government now admits it will not achieve its economic growth target of 3 per cent this year and many economists doubt it will be able to make 2.5 per cent. In the interbank market, interest rates have begun to stiffen. Analysts say, however, that while the government is desperate not to raise official interest rates, its difficulties make entry into the narrow band of the EMS exchange rate mechanism highly unlikely this year. With the deficits widening and tax revenues falling, Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, has said he would have little option but to increase tax withheld on salaries. This, he says, would bolster the government's coffers in the short term and take money out of circulation. The move, if implemented, would be unpopular and contradicts the spirit of government promises not to increase taxes as part of the convergence process with the EC. It could make it more difficult for the authorities to maintain public support against union demands that it restore unemployment benefit cuts decreed two months ago, also as part of its convergence plans. The unions mounted an unsuccessful general strike in protest at the cuts late last month and are planning another for October.</p>

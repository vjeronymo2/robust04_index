			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 7 TASS -- A Russian State Duma  deputy has called for an objective investigation into the causes  and circumstances of the bomb explosion in Sarajevo on Saturday  [5 February] that killed at least 68 and wounded over 200 people.    Vladimir Lukin, head of the foreign affairs committee of the  State Duma, the lower house of Russia's new parliament, said on  Monday that U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali should  have made his appeal to NATO commanders on air strikes against  Bosnian Serbs only after such an investigation had been  completed.    "It is necessary to find out what actually happened and who  may benefit from this, and only after that can one take steps  through the U.N. Security Council. Only the Security Council  can endow the secretary-general with respective powers," Lukin  said. "I would be extremely surprised if Russia is cut off from  this process."    Lukin stressed that the use of force in any conflict is  fraught with serious consequences. Asked if the State Duma will  make any decisions in connections with the explosion in  Sarajevo, Lukin said "the Duma does not realise the Russian  foreign policy. This is the prerogative of the president and  the government."    He recalled that the State Duma had already expressed its  attitude towards the crisis in former Yugoslavia by urging all  sides concerned to refrain from the use of force and settle all  disputes only by peaceful means.</p>

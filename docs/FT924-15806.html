			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Kleinwort to take advantage of economic reform in China KLEINWORT Benson Investment Management has raised Dollars 60m (Pounds 33.7m) for a closed-end fund investing mainly in unlisted Chinese companies. The London-listed fund will take minority stakes, averaging about Dollars 5m, in existing profitable companies which aim to obtain a stock market listing within a few years. Typically, the companies would be rural or township enterprises set up by local communities. The companies would generally be involved in exports, though the fund was also attracted by the rise in Chinese consumer spending, with foreign investment in retailing recently permitted. Companies which earned domestic currency can swap it into foreign exchange. Mr Robin Fox, chairman of the fund and vice chairman of the Kleinwort Benson group, said the stakes would be of 25 per cent or more because enterprises obtaining this level of foreign investment obtained significant tax advantages - usually a three-year tax holiday and a further period of reduced tax. The fund, to be managed from Hong Kong by Mr Andrew Taylor, aims to take advantage of economic reform in China, which took off again this year and has boosted the types of enterprises in which it plans to invest. Mr Fox said the best value was to be found in unlisted companies rather than on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets, which were showing signs of 'indigestion' after their hectic rise earlier this year. The fund's managers will be advised by CIEC Investment Advisers, a subsidiary of Citic, a leading Chinese financial institution. CIEC is, Mr Fox said, the only Chinese-owned accountancy firm which was allowed to prepare companies for stock market listing. Lack of adequate accounting standards has been a problem for investors in China. The fund expects not to pay a dividend in the first year, but to do so thereafter. Half of the Dollars 60m is to be paid up and the remainder will be called when the first tranche is 75 per cent invested. Up to 25 per cent of the money may be invested in listed stocks in Hong Kong and China and in Chinese companies outside China.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio de  Oliveira today ordered the creation of a control committee to  continue the work of the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigating  Committee] and scrutinize those congressmen the CPI report  recommends be further investigated. This control committee will  have 30 days to conclude its work, and will be made up of seven  congressmen. It will be coordinated by the Chamber of Deputies  vice president, Deputy Fernando Lira, and the rapporteur will be  Deputy Vital do Rego, comptroller of the lower house.    Meanwhile, the final Budget CPI report must be corrected  before it is delivered to the presidents of the Senate and the  Chamber of Deputies. [passage omitted]    Budget CPI President Senator Jarbas Passarinho spent the  morning in his house organizing the documents that arrived at  the last moment at the CPI, and which must be added to the final  report. One of the documents which arrived during the weekend  is a report from Sergipe Governor Joao Alves demonstrating that  his assets are compatible with his income. The document was  processed by rapporteur Deputy Roberto Magalhaes.    Senator Passarinho must hand in the final CPI report to the  Chamber of Deputies president this afternoon. But this will  only take place if the Senate data processing service manages to  print the report with the corrections made by the CPI members  and the improvised commentaries made by the rapporteur as he  read the final report.    Furthermore, Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio de  Oliveira said that the Constitution and Justice Committee, which  must judge the congressmen mentioned in the CPI report, must  have its composition reorganized before the end of the week.  Some of the current members of this committee are mentioned in  the final CPI report, so they must be replaced.    [Begin Oliveira recording] The decisions of the Constitution  and Justice Committee, which is made up of 54 members, are made  through a vote. I believe that the congressmen mentioned in the  CPI report must be removed from their posts by their party  leaders. [end recording]    The government will also intensify the investigations on the  involvement of Executive Branch officials in the budget scandal.  A special investigative committee presided over by Federal  Administration Secretary Romildo Canhim will be installed in the  first week of February.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / No end in sight to Japan's recession THE monetary planners of the Bank of Japan's grey stone fortress in Tokyo's business district now have all the evidence they could need to justify a half-percentage point cut in official lending rates. That was the message drawn yesterday by Tokyo economists from the central bank's latest quarterly survey of corporate confidence, the first since the formation of the coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. It confirms that Japan's powerful economic machine has remained in neutral over the summer and shows no sign of engaging first gear for some time to come. Japanese manufacturers' business confidence ebbed to its lowest in 18 years between May and August this year and service industries' sentiment was at its most pessimistic ever, the survey shows. After stagnating at -49 for two quarters, ending in February and May, the bank's Tankan index of manufacturers' business confidence dropped to -51 by the end of last month, its lowest since 1975. Service industries' sentiment slipped from -38 in May to -41 in August, a record low. The central bank's Tankan survey of business confidence is seen as Japan's most authoritative study of short-term business intentions and is used by the bank in forming monetary policy. The previous Tankan survey forecast a slight recovery, which appears to have been stifled by the continued rise of the yen through August and the wettest summer for years, which has restrained consumer spending. 'There are no signs of recovery,' says Mr Peter Tasker, strategist at Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo. 'It could be quite some time in coming, perhaps a year away. Between now and then we are in for a continuation of a slow, rolling recession.' Mr James Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'It's a little worse than we expected in terms of profits and sales outlook, a weak labour market and an increase in inventories. . . this recession is showing an extended bottom rather than a double dip. I don't think we will see an upturn for at least two quarters.' The manufacturing companies questioned said profits would fall by 10.7 per cent this year, a steeper fall than forecast in the previous survey, while a balance of 32 per cent had excess inventories, up 1 point on May and 26 per cent had excess capacity, up 2 points. On average, manufacturers plan to cut capital investment by 5.9 per cent in the tax year ending next March, having forecast a smaller 4.4 per cent in the last survey. The employment outlook is also weak, with a balance of 19 per cent of all companies believing their workforces are too large. Less pessimistically, Mr Robert Feldman, economist at Salomon Brothers, believes a turnaround could come by the end of the year, as two government spending packages, worth nearly Y24,000bn (Pounds 147bn) over the past 16 months, begin to feed through. He, and others, believe government agencies have been slow to disburse that cash because of bureaucrats' fear, in the wake of the scandals of the past few years, of being arrested if they pass a construction contract to a company with which they have connections. In conditions like these it is no surprise that business lobbies have recently been urging the central bank to cut the official discount rate by a full percentage point or more from the 2.5 per cent at which it has held since February. But analysts believe that the bank, which has always been cautious about changing interest rates, will hesitate to go that far and content itself with a half-point cut some time this month. 'Lower interest rates improve conditions for capital investment, but are not enough by themselves,' warns Mr Kagehide Kaku, director of the bank's research and statistics department. Only when business sentiment improves will falling interest rates work, he says.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA CRAFT SHOP DESTROYED IN SMOKY DOWNTOWN BLAZE  </P> <P> A five-alarm fire Saturday destroyed a craft-supply shop in the city's downtown  shopping district, snarling traffic and spewing a column of black smoke visible  for miles.  </P> <P> No injuries were reported in the midday blaze at Bonnie's, a store that sold  spray paints, lacquers and hobby paraphernalia. The fire threatened shops and  restaurants at the heart of downtown but nearby businesses suffered only smoke  and water damage, Ventura Fire Chief Bob Horne said.  </P> <P> Horne said the cause of the fire was not known. It spread quickly, he said,  because of the "volatile nature" of the materials inside.  </P> <P> The shop's roof and mezzanine collapsed, and its entire inventory was burned.  Fire officials estimated the damage at several hundred thousand dollars.  </P></p>

UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Kris  Janowski told reporters of several cases of rape and murder  since January. He said that despite reports that some of the  attacks were carried out by "uniformed" men, none of the cases  had ever been followed up by the authorities.    "Everybody's wearing pretty much the same kind of uniform.  We understand that they are either part of some sort of militia  or Serb military or whoever," he said of the perpetrators.    He said the authorities told the UNHCR "all the time" that  they had nothing to do with the attacks which were allegedly  being done by criminals. "But none of these cases has ever been  followed and no one has ever been punished so we assume that  this is all done with the knowledge and at least the silent  consent of the authorities. Otherwise they would do something  to stop it."    Janowski said "at least five persons have been murdered  since  the beginning of January in Banja Luka" but he did not give  details.    He added that there were "countless cases of people being  beaten up and intimidated, the Moslem neighborhood raided by  uniformed gangs... trying to give them the message to get out"  and that this had "been going on for quite a while." He cited  the case of 200 Moslems who had fled the village of Bronzani  Majdan, not far from Banja Luka, and asked the UNHCR to get them  out of the country. [passage omitted]    "We are trying to monitor the situation but it is very  difficult," Janowski said.</p>

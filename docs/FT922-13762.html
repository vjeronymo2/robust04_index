			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: IPE nears deal on oil contracts links LONDON'S International Petroleum Exchange is close to agreement with the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) on a cross-margining link for the two exchanges' crude oil contracts. That would make it cheaper for international traders to use both markets and could increase the IPE's turnover. Mr Alastair Harris, IPE's director of marketing and Research, said that although talks had progressed slowly, the exchanges could reach agreement by mid-year. Both exchanges were keen to agree such a link - it was up to the clearing houses for the two markets to work out the technical details. A cross-margining link means that traders taking out positions in London could use them to offset higher margin (collateral) charges for business done in New York. It would make it cheaper for international trading houses to continue trading through the night or early morning once the London or New York market had closed. The IPE got off to a slower start than the Nymex where crude oil futures traded 21.6m contracts last year. However, volume slipped slightly from 1990 when crude oil traded 23.7m contracts. Mr Harris pointed out that trading on the IPE is increasing, with volume rising to about 30 per cent of that seen by Nymex.</p>

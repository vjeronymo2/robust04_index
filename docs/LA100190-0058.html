			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CANDIDATES, BALLOT ISSUE PUT FOCUS ON FINANCES;  </P> <P> ELECTION: WESTMINISTER OFFICIALS SAY THE INFRASTRUCTURE HAS LONG BEEN  NEGLECTED. A PLAN TO RAISE THE BUSINESS TAX COULD HELP REBUILD CITY FACILITIES.  </P> <P> With the city still recovering from near-bankruptcy in 1984, candidates in the  city's Nov. 6 election promise to focus on plans that ensure Westminster's  long-term financial stability.  </P> <P> Related issues are sure to include proposed tax increases and increased funding  for police to fight growing drug- and gang-related activity.  </P> <P> "We're playing catch-up on a lot of infrastructure problems," incumbent Mayor  Charles V. Smith said. "The city's been long neglected because of financial  conditions. We still need to institute long-range fiscal planning so that we  don't get back into the situation we were in 10 years ago."  </P> <P> In November, voters will decide a mayoral race, a council race and two ballot  measures, one of which would almost double the city's business tax if passed.  </P> <P> The mayor's race promises to be a lively one as Smith squares off against  Councilman Frank Fry Jr., a former Westminster mayor with 20 years of  experience on the council, and dark horse candidate Daryl DeGraw, a vocal  29-year-old community activist who would become the youngest council member if  elected.  </P> <P> In the race for a council seat, incumbent Anita Huseth is opposed by Craig  Schweisinger, a city planning commissioner. Schweisinger has received the  endorsement of the Westminster Firefighters' Assn., which is traditionally a  strong force in campaigns, with its members canvassing the community to solicit  support for its candidates.  </P> <P> Ballot Measure LL would raise the city's business tax to offset inflation. The  tax was last adjusted in 1978. Huseth and DeGraw said they are the only  candidates who oppose the business tax increase.  </P> <P> "It's a bad time to put a tax on the ballot, when we have a recession and  people are out of work," Huseth said.  </P> <P> However, Chamber of Commerce President Ken McNicol said the chamber supports  the increase, which would add $30 to the $50 fee for most businesses, plus an  additional $5 fee for each full-time employee and $2.50 for each part-time  employee .  </P> <P> "The chamber feels businesses should pay their way," he said. "It's equitable.  If you have 10 people, you have 10 people using city services. If you have 100  people, you have 100 people using city services."  </P> <P> The other measure on the ballot, Measure KK, would designate one council seat  in the 1992 election as a two-year post, evening out the number of seats open  in each election.  </P> <P> The current system is staggered. This creates three vacancies in the four-seat  council. If the ordinance is passed, a designated seat would become a two-year  term starting in 1992, but revert to a four-year post in 1994, making two seats  open in every election. The ordinance would not affect the mayor's position,  which remains a two-year post.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WESTMINSTER CITY ELECTIONS  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mayoral Candidates  </P> <P> Daryl DeGraw  </P> <P> Age: 29.  </P> <P> Occupation: Postal Service manager.  </P> <P> Background: Activist for the mobile home community in Westminster.  </P> <P> Issues: Opposes all new taxes and tax increases.

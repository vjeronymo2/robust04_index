			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PSYCHIATRIST TEMPORARILY BARRED FROM PRACTICING  </P> <P> An Orange County judge has temporarily suspended the medical practice of Dr.  James Harrington White, the consulting psychiatrist for a Sierra Nevada youth  camp that sponsored the outing on which seven people drowned in Convict Lake  earlier this year.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Eileen Moore issued the temporary restraining order Friday  at the request of the state attorney general's office. The judge made her  decision after viewing sexually explicit videotapes of the Newport Beach  psychiatrist and an adult patient.  </P> <P> The order is in effect until May 1, when the judge will consider extending the  suspension of White's license pending the outcome of a California Medical Board  hearing on whether to suspend or revoke his license.  </P> <P> White, 47, who has a private practice in Newport Beach, was arrested March 15  at his Newport Beach office on charges of sexually abusing a 29-year-old male  patient. The patient alleged to Newport Beach police that White drugged him  with prescription medicine and then performed oral sex on him.  </P> <P> The alleged sexual acts were depicted in a 20-minute videotape that police had  seized from the doctor, according to state officials.  </P> <P> White, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges of sexual abuse, on Monday  deferred comment to his attorney, Timothy J. Stafford of Santa Ana. Stafford  declined comment.  </P> <P> Newport Beach police seized the photographic evidence in simultaneous raids the  day of White's arrest at his Newport Beach clinic, his Corona del Mar home, and  his other residences in Palm Desert and Mammoth Lakes.  </P> <P> Judge Moore said Monday that she viewed two videotapes after ordering her  courtroom doors locked at the request of White's attorney. In her order, she  said the videotapes supported the state's contention that White's continued  practice of medicine "endangered" the public welfare.  </P> <P> White is free on $200,000 bond pending disposition of the criminal case. On  March 20, Harbor Municipal Judge Christopher W. Strople reduced White's bond  from $500,000 but barred him from practicing medicine while the case was being  decided. About a week later, however, Strople lifted the order with the  stipulation that White practice under supervision of another psychiatrist.  </P> <P> After the criminal charges were filed, the California Medical Board opened an  investigation into whether White had violated terms of his medical license by  engaging in sexual misconduct.  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office -- representing the California Medical  Board -- last week took action in Orange County Superior Court to prevent White  from practicing medicine until the board completes its review.  </P> <P> At the time of his arrest, White was consulting psychiatrist and a member of  the faculty's board of directors at Camp O'Neal, a private facility for  delinquent and troubled youngsters. During a Feb. 19 outing at Convict Lake,  three teen-agers and two camp counselors fell through the ice and drowned in  Convict Lake. Two other men who tried to rescue them also fell through the ice  and drowned.  </P> <P> State social services officials suspended the camp's license on March 16,  accusing the operators of repeatedly violating care and treatment regulations  and failing to properly supervise the three youths who drowned.  </P></p>

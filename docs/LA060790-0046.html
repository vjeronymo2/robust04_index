			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 150-YEAR-OLD ADOBES GIVEN PROTECTED STATUS  </P> <P> The decaying remains of two 150-year-old adobe structures in Baldwin Hills were  recently granted historic-monument status by the Los Angeles City Council,  saving them from demolition threatened by plans for condominiums.  </P> <P> The council's recent decision will allow Consolidated Realty Board of Southern  California, owner of the structures, to move forward with plans to build a  52-unit condominium project but requires that the original adobes remain  undisturbed.  </P> <P> "It is about time that communities like Baldwin Hills had their historic  monuments recognized just like other communities, like Hollywood," said  Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose district includes Baldwin Hills. "There is  history in every community, and these are some of the oldest buildings in the  county."  </P> <P> The adobes, with thick walls and high, redwood beam ceilings, were once the  center of the 4,000-acre Rancho La Cienega o Paso de la Tijera owned by Vicente  Sanchez, alcalde -- or mayor -- of Los Angeles in 1830. In the 1920s, an  addition was built linking the structures and the building was converted into a  larger clubhouse by the Sunset Golf Course.  </P> <P> Consolidated bought the building in 1972 and maintains its headquarters there.  About two years ago, Consolidated came up with the condominium plans that  called for the demolition of the 11,000-square-foot building that houses the  firm's offices, a large auditorium, two other large halls for meetings and a  fully equipped kitchen.  </P> <P> Those plans were placed in limbo when the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage  Commission recommended that the entire building be given historic-monument  status. The City Council's arts, health and humanities committee proposed a  compromise that would make only the original adobe structures historic, and the  council agreed.  </P> <P> Consolidated accepted the compromise.  </P> <P> "It turned out OK," said Reginald Ballard, a Consolidated spokesman. "We plan  to build a condominium on the property and incorporate the historical  significance of the site into the design and planning."  </P> <P> Consolidated plans to build its condominium around the two adobes on the  1.3-acre parcel, an area known for its Indian artifacts dating to prehistoric  times.  </P> <P> "Its location on a hill provides a great vantage point to view the rest of the  basin," said Alma Carlisle, a specialist with the city's bureau of engineering.  The first written evidence of a structure on the site appears in maps of Rancho  La Cienega o Paso de la Tijera dating from the early 1850s, she said.  </P> <P> La Cienega means "the marsh" and La Tijera refers to the narrow scissor-shaped  valleys between the hills.  </P> <P> According to the late Virginia French, who wrote a book on the old adobes, Gov.  Manuel Micheltorena granted the property to Vicente Sanchez in 1843 for his  "valiant soldiering and good citizenry." At the time, the rancho extended from  what is now Exposition Boulevard to Slauson Avenue and from La Cienega  Boulevard east to about 4th Avenue.  </P> <P> When Vicente died, the property was taken over by the Sanchez heirs. The  Sanchez descendants remained prominent in the early history of Los Angeles.  Vicente Sanchez's son, Tomas, was elected sheriff of Los Angeles County seven  times.  </P> <P> Eventually, the ownership of the Sanchez ranch was turned over to E. J. (Lucky)  Baldwin, after whom Baldwin Hills was named. Baldwin divided much of the  acreage and sold most of it for development.  </P> <P> As part of the agreement to preserve the structures, Galanter promised to  assist the owners in obtaining the permits needed to complete their project.  </P> <P> Ballard said his group's project will not only provide jobs but result in  housing that the community will be proud of.  </P> <P> "We want to build something that our children and their children can be proud  of," he said, "Those buildings may be 150 years old, but 150 years from now we  want someone to look up at this hill and see what my heritage has done."  </P></p>

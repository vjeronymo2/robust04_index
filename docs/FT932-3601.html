			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Chinese peasants riot over tax rises GROWING dissatisfaction among China's 800m peasants has spilled over into persistent and angry clashes with officials, including riots in Sichuan, the country's most populous province. Provincial officials confirmed that crowds of peasants had earlier this month besieged government headquarters in Renshou county, 80km south of Chengdu, the provincial capital, to protest over increases in taxes and charges to fund a local highway. Peasants are reported to have rampaged around the town, blocking traffic, assaulting officials and attacking vehicles. The disturbances took place between June 3 and 6. Police used teargas to break up angry mobs whose numbers are said to have ranged between a few hundred and as many as 10,000. A provincial government official in Chengdu confirmed that a riot had taken place, but he was reluctant to go into detail. Western officials, who visited Renshou in the past few days, said they had noted evidence of trouble, including slogans daubed on walls denouncing local officials, but felt reports of mass disturbances were exaggerated. The troubles in Sichuan are by no means an isolated incident, however. They demonstrate widespread dissatisfaction among China's peasant farmers who are being left behind in the country's economic boom as the gap widens between city and country. Official statistics show that average per capita peasant annual income stands at Yn770 (Pounds 90) . This represents less than half the average of urban dwellers. Stories abound of clashes between mutinous peasants and the authorities. Among recent episodes are disruptions caused to rail traffic in central Henan province after a dispute over requisition land for rail crossings and protests in southern Guangdong province over compensation for land seized by the state. Hard-pressed peasants have also been assailing tax collectors, sometimes violently. The new militancy among peasants, dismayed at their inability to share the fruits of China's economic boom, may well prove the government's most serious challenge in years. China's leaders have, belatedly, recognised the dangers. Mr Qiao Shi, a member of the politburo's ruling seven-member standing committee, recently visited Sichuan to urge better treatment of peasants by local officials, who are being blamed for corruption and for extorting excessive charges and levies. China's official media has been full of exhortations to officials to be more sensitive to the plight of the peasants. The central authorities have been releasing funds to redeem IOUs to farmers for grain acquired compulsorily by the state. Failure to honor these commitments has proved a principal cause of unrest. The Public Security Ministry has also issued an order to police to stop harassing peasants and imposing arbitrary fines.</p>

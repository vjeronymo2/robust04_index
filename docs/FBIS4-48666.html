			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, 24 May (AFP) -- Thousands of terrified  Rwandans are scrambling out of Kigali before the expected rebel  takeover of the capital which they fear will usher in reprisals  for the massacres of Tutsis, relief officials said Tuesday [24  May].    A special United Nations envoy was meanwhile expected to fly  into Kigali from the Ugandan capital Kampala on Tuesday after a  dispute with the mainly Tutsi rebels about the planned  deployment of 5,500 peacekeepers to staunch ethnic bloodletting  in which up to half a million people have been butchered. The  envoy, Iqbal Riza, postponed his trip to Kigali on Monday  because he said neither rebels nor government forces could  guarantee his security. The Army has since promised not to  shoot down Riza's plane, and rebels who captured Kigali Airport  Sunday have also pledged to hold their fire, UN spokesman Abdul  Kabia said.    The UN has asked the Army and rebels to extend a shaky  two-day truce that began Monday when Riza arrived in northern  Rwanda until Wednesday at six p.m. (1600 GMT). Both sides were  to respond later Tuesday, Kabia said.    Riza held "inconclusive" discussions about the return of UN  troops to Rwanda with leaders of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic  Front (RPF) in their northern stronghold of Mulindi on Monday,  Kabia said. "There was a disagreement over the size of the  force," he said. The rebels want a maximum of 2,500 UN troops  because they fear that 5,500 soldiers could intervene in  fighting between the RPF and the Army though intervention is not  part of its essentially humanitarian mandate, Kabia said.    Relief officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  thousands of people were streaming out of Kigali in a desperate  scramble for safety before the rebels seize control of the  capital. UN military officials expect the rebels to take over  "within a week."</p>

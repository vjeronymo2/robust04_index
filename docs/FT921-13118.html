			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Paris plans new insurance shares limit THE FRENCH cabinet yesterday tabled plans to give state-owned insurance companies greater scope to sell shares to private investors. The proposal, foreshadowed last year, would allow the big three state insurance groups - UAP, AGF and GAN - to sell up to 49 per cent of their shares to the public, up from the 25 per cent fixed by special rules applying at present. If agreed by parliament at its spring session, this would extend to insurers the same freedom accorded to state industrial groups late last year. By bringing insurance group rules in line with the rest, the government hoped to 'encourage the dynamism of the public financial sector', says the draft law. UAP is 75.5 per cent-owned by the government and state interests, while AGF is 72.3 per cent state-owned and the GAN is 77.6 per cent state-held.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROUTE DU VIN  </P> <P> In this region of France known as Alsace, the song of the open road is "Roll  Out The Barrel."  </P> <P> To be sure, spirits are high along the Route du Vin, which is to say the grape  lover's highway between Strasbourg and Colmar, a path strewn with dozens of  little wine-producing villages that appear like sketches culled from a book of  fairy tales.  </P> <P> The journey represents one of life's joys, a time for toasting one's companion  with the wines of Alsace while exploring narrow, cobbled streets and ancient  half-timbered buildings that Alsatians seriously believe inspired the brothers  Grimm.  </P> <P> Barely 75 miles long, the Route du Vin is a slice of history, a glimpse of  medieval Europe. There comes to mind Turckheim, a village on the outskirts of  Colmar that reflects a period when such towns were walled, as indeed is the  case today in Turckheim.  </P> <P> Traffic funnels through 800-year-old gates; the sun reflects off slate roofs,  and Turckheim's cobbled streets are crowded with visitors who take shelter at  Hotel des Deux Clefs, just as they have for nearly 400 years.  </P> <P> At Hotel des Deux Clefs, guests awaken to the tolling of church bells and  gather of an afternoon in the bar, which also serves as the reception, to taste  the wines of Alsace in a setting of timbered walls and leaded windows.  </P> <P> One enters Turckheim down a cobbled street where a fountain flows only steps  from a verdant square facing Hotel des Deux Clefs. Inside the bar/restaurant,  the room is alive with the music of Johann Strauss, and we found the comely  proprietress, Marie-Claire Planel-Arnoux, busily arranging flowers fresh from  her garden.  </P> <P> Classical melodies continued to set the mood throughout the day in this former  coaching stop, with its fine wines and a menu that features sauerkraut,  sausage, pork, guenelles de foie and coq au Riesling.  </P> <P> The stairway leading to guest rooms creaks with one's footsteps, reminding  visitors that generations have passed this way and that others will follow, but  that this particular moment is precious, a split second in Turckheim's history  and that you are part of it, and that it will not be played again. A mere  moment.  </P> <P> In the dining room and outside in the garden, guests spend entire afternoons  over lunch, divorced from fast-paced cities beyond the gates of Turckheim.  </P> <P> The garden is particularly pleasant on a sunny afternoon. Flowers flow from a  bucket suspended above a well, and ivy climbs ancient walls. Later, strings of  colored light add to the magic as the sun disappears and darkness softens the  scene and church bells toll once more.  </P> <P> With darkness, the last town crier remaining in all of France emerges from a  guardhouse, a ghostly figure in a flowing cloak, swinging a lantern whose  yellow glow casts eerie shadows against ancient walls while the crier calls to  a gathering crowd, "All's well!", his words echoing through vacant streets like  the uttering of a spirit braced against the chill wind that whips the folds of  the crier's cloak, nearly snuffing out his lantern.  </P> <P> For another half-hour, the group traces his footsteps until, finally, the crier  returns to the guardhouse, calling out once again, "All's well!" before  disappearing through a darkened doorway.  </P> <P> Stars shine brightly as the group returns to Hotel des Deux Clefs for brandies,  later climbing the creaking stairway to slip beneath thick eiderdowns as church  bells toll the midnight hour.  </P> <P> From Colmar, the Route du Vin skirts other ancient villages and churches with  their baroque steeples and half-timbered homes and hotels that reach across  Alsace. Cattle graze beside the road and vineyards sweep to the Vosges, the  mountain range that forms the western extension of the Black Forest.  </P> <P> Castles rising on wooded hillsides face mile upon mile of gingerbread villages,  and fragrant breezes stir among the narrow streets of Eguisheim and  Kaysersberg, which was the birthplace of Albert Schweitzer, the jungle doctor  whose home functions as a museum, drawing legions of visitors.  </P> <P> During the high season, tour buses crowd the streets, bumper-to-bumper, outside  the gates of Riquewihr, a village that's a flashback to the 16th Century, its  ancient walls surrounding cobbled paths lined with sidewalk cafes and  half-timbered houses that sag with age.  </P> <P> To avoid the tour groups it is best to remain overnight in Riquewihr. Indeed,  Riquewihr is best enjoyed in the late afternoon and particularly in the evening  when lights glow through amber and leaded windows, fires blaze warmly in  restaurants with smoke-stained walls, and the village is at peace again.  </P> <P> One can, of course, avoid crowds during daytime by taking to the side streets  with their topsy-turvy homes and window boxes crowded with geraniums and other  blooms.  </P> <P> Hotel St. Nicholas at 2 Rue St. Nicholas is a pleasant, unpretentious hideaway  facing a quiet path, its inviting lounge and spotless rooms providing peace in  an atmosphere that harkens back to a century when coaches rattled through  Riquewihr and horses' hoofs echoed along its narrow paths.  </P> <P> Other travelers return of an evening to Colmar, the capital of Alsatian wine  whose cobbled streets pass beneath half-timbered houses in a medieval setting  unrivaled along the entire Route du Vin.  </P> <P> While its old town -- the core of Colmar -- is a page out of a child's  storybook, its treasure is the world-renowned Issenheim altarpiece by Mathias  Grunewald in Colmar's Unterlinden Museum. Others are drawn to the museum of  Frederic Bartholdi, who created the Statue of Liberty.  </P> <P> In the tourist season, crowds stroll through the old town with its carved  gables, ancient signs and a hotel that is simply a gem, Le Marechal at 4-6  Place des Six Montagnes Noires -- a wedding together of four former private  residences that face a canal in that section of Colmar known as Petite Venise.  </P> <P> Other canals flow through Colmar's Little Venice, but the mood surrounding  Hostellerie Le Marechal is special, particularly for guests whose tables face  the water with its swans and the amber light of lanterns reflected by its  surface.  </P> <P> The hotel is a glimpse of medieval Europe, a quaint and pleasant choice, with  the stirring of fragrant breezes and the musical background of Bach, Beethoven,  Mozart and Wagner. Candles glow and the wines of Alsace flow -- as do the notes  willed to listeners by those composers.  </P> <P> Guests, especially Europeans, return regularly to Hostellerie Le Marechal,  seeking solace within its ancient walls. In the lobby, which is hardly bigger  than a cloak room, an antique clock strikes the hour. The hotel is filled with  warmth and good cheer, and fortunate is the couple that receives the key to  room No. 12, with its timbered walls and antiques and windows that frame the  canal, which makes for one of those picture-perfect settings -- particularly  for honeymooners.  </P> <P> One should not arrive in Colmar alone, for not to share its magic would be a  pity. In Colmar, poets and painters are inspired by the twisting streets and  half-timbered houses whose balconies face scenes from another century.  </P> <P> Michelin bestowed a star upon the 16th-Century Restaurant Au Fer Rouge at 52  Grand Rue, where couples gather of an evening in three small rooms given over  to romance -- as well as the restaurant's award-winning cuisine.  </P> <P> Proprietor Patrick Fulgraff prepares four small tables on the upper level,  another five on the ground floor and half a dozen in a basement setting that's  a showplace of medieval intrigue.  </P> <P> To get a fix on Au Fer Rouge, this remarkable little restaurant is only steps  from Maison Pfister, which is acclaimed as the most beautiful house in Colmar.  A few doors away, the proprietor of a six-stool bar serves wine as well as  espresso and cappuccino, and passers-by are lured into a bakery whose seductive  fragrances drift through Colmar's cobbled streets like the aromas pouring from  a kitchen on Christmas Day.  </P> <P> In Colmar's old quarter, half-timbered structures rise above the canals, their  balconies blood red with flowers, their shadows fading with dusk. Later, lamps  spread their glow and melodies flow from the doorways of restaurants that bid  couples to step across the threshold to savor the romance inside.  </P> <P> In a small bistro just off Tanner's Square, a boy with a mandolin strummed a  haunting melody for a girl with golden hair who sat alone, eyes focused on the  candle burning at her table. As she looked up, the boy put aside the mandolin  and together they slipped away into the night.  </P> <P> The moon was full and the evening was just beginning.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> The Route du Vin d'Alsace:  </P> <P> The wine route of Alsace climbs hills and slips into valleys, passing through  towns and villages with near-unpronounceable names: Hatmannswiller, Wattwiller,  Wuenheim, Guebwiller, Bergholtz-zell, Gueberschwihr, Voegtlinshoffen,  Wettolsheim, Eguisheim, Niedermorschwihr, Ribeauville, Rorschwihr and  Mittelbergheim. These and dozens more.  </P> <P> Castles face the plains of Alsace and footpaths are cut into vineyards so that  one may stroll as well as drive while doing the Route du Vin. Alsace, bordered  by Switzerland and Germany, is a 120-mile-long province that's famed for its  fare as well as its wine.  </P> <P> A three-star Michelin restaurant, L'Auberge de L'll at Illhausern, is rated one  of France's best. Other one- and two-star restaurants are scattered throughout  Alsace.  </P> <P> Traveling through the province, motorists brake at scores of wine-tasting  cellars and festivals that are held in Colmar during August, Ammerschwihr in  April, Molsheim in May and Ribeauville in July. Later, with autumn's harvest,  the entire province comes alive with celebrations.  </P> <P> In its turbulent past, the province of Alsace was the victim of a succession of  intruders. During the German occupation of World War II, the French language  was banned and Alsatians were forced to fight alongside the Germans. Others hid  Allied prisoners and specialized in sabotage.  </P> <P> The battle to recapture Alsace is recalled as one of the bloodiest of the war,  with entire villages destroyed. At the same time, vineyards fell victim to the  German army as troops cut a swath through fertile valleys, wiping out  competition for their own wines.  </P> <P> When following the Route du Vin, it is best to rent a car rather than ride a  crowded tour bus. Frequently, Colmar is chosen as a base for day-trips to  surrounding villages (Its grandest hotel, the Bristol, at 7 Place de la Gare,  is a third-generation family operation with an excellent restaurant, tastefully  furnished rooms and a caring staff.)  </P> <P> In July, an international music festival attracts artists from nations around  the world to this historic old town with its 15th-Century Customs House, the  14th-Century Pfister House and the Unterlinden Museum.  </P> <P> Transportation: Alsace and the city of Colmar are served by frequent flights,  and there's excellent train service from Paris' Gare de l'Est.  </P> <P> For other details concerning the province of Alsace, contact the French  Government Tourist Office, 9454 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 303, Beverly Hills 90212,  (213) 271-6665.  </P></p>

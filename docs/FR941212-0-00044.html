			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Federal and State Jurisdiction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 27. We modify our assertion in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , of exclusive jurisdiction over all video dialtone services. We hold that we have exclusive jurisdiction over only interstate video dialtone services, which include services involving delivery of video communications that are part of a continuous stream of communication provided at least partially by means of radio waves. We hold that states have jurisdiction over intrastate video dialtone services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28. In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General Telephone of California v. FCC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the court held that channel service provided by a LEC for a cable operator, formerly known as a community antenna television operator, is ``an integral component in an indivisible dissemination system which forms an interstate channel of communication from the broadcaster to the viewer.'' The court held that the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over LEC provision of services that form part of a broadcast transmission. Because broadcasting is inherently interstate, the court held, LEC delivery of signals that have been broadcast over radio waves is interstate, even if the LEC delivers such signals over physically intrastate facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29. Consistent with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General Telephone of California v. FCC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , we conclude that broadcast or other radio-based video signals delivered by a LEC over a video dialtone system constitute an integral part of an interstate radio transmission service. Accordingly, we have exclusive jurisdiction over video dialtone services involving delivery of video communications that are part of a continuous stream of communication provided at least partially by means of radio waves. A determination of whether certain other, non-radio-based video dialtone services are interstate and thus within our exclusive jurisdiction depends upon the nature of the communication, as in the telephone context. For example, we have exclusive jurisdiction over all video dialtone services provided between two or more states because such services are interstate. In contrast, under Section 2(b) of the Communications Act, states retain authority to regulate intrastate video dialtone service to the extent such regulation has not been preempted by the Commission under the standards set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Louisiana Public Service Commission v. FCC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and its progeny. For example, states have jurisdiction over the delivery by wire of video programming between a video library and an end-user located within the same state, as part of a video-on-demand service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30. While we do not in this proceeding preempt any state regulation of intrastate video dialtone services, we note that we have already preempted certain state regulations of BOC provision of enhanced services in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BOC Safeguards Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 57 FR 4373 (February 5, 1992). In that decision, we preempted any state regulation requiring (1) Separation of facilities and personnel to provide the intrastate portion of jurisdictionally mixed enhanced services; or (2) prior authorization for use of Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) whenever such authorization is not required by our rules. Because we have explicitly applied our existing enhanced services safeguards to video dialtone, state regulation in the areas preempted in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BOC Safeguards Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , are also preempted by that decision in the video dialtone context. We reject various parties' requests for broader preemption at this time, but we will consider preempting any state regulation of intrastate video dialtone service that is not severable from interstate service if such regulation would negate federal policy. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

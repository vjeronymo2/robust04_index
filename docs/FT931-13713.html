			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / November output down by 0.5% A POOR performance by the car industry and a drop in metals production were factors in a 0.5 per cent fall in manufacturing output in November compared with the previous month. The drop followed a 0.1 per cent rise in October and altered the flat trend of manufacturing output since the start of last year. The Central Statistical Office estimates that output is falling at an annual rate of about 1.5 per cent. However, energy industry output was sharply higher in November. Production of oil and gas from the North Sea rose 9 per cent in the three months to November compared with the previous three months. Water supply industries' output rose 3.5 per cent. The three-month on three-month trend in manufacturing showed a 0.5 per cent fall in the period to the end of November. Compared with the same period the year before output was 0.1 per cent lower. The CSO said most of the fall in manufacturing output between October and November was due to a 6 per cent month-on-month drop in the production of motor vehicles. There was also a sharp fall in the output of the metals industry. Steel companies in particular responded to weak demand by cutting production. Other industries where output fell included mechanical engineering and minerals and mineral products. The latter reflected sluggishness in the construction industry. The only industry to buck the trend significantly was electrical and instrument engineering. Production in this sector was 2 per cent higher in the three months to November than in the previous three months.</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OLD SCHOOL TIES LED TO THE WELLNESS BENEFIT;  </P> <P> FUND RAISING: COMEDIAN WOLFBERG LINED UP SEINFELD AND OTHERS IN MEMORY OF A PAL  FROM HIGH SCHOOL WHO DIED OF CANCER.  </P> <P> Monday's benefit for the Wellness Community can trace its roots back more than  25 years to Herricks High School in Long Island, where Dennis Wolfberg became  friends with Ron Hoffman -- "the slowest member of the social studies class,"  as Wolfberg joked Monday.  </P> <P> The two stayed in touch after Hoffman moved to Orange County, where he became a  successful real estate developer living in Corona del Mar. Wolfberg eventually  headed West as well, moving to Los Angeles where, a few years ago, he got  disturbing news about his old friend: Hoffman had cancer.  </P> <P> Wolfberg and Hoffman reunited in the winter of '88, when Wolfberg played the  Improv in Irvine. Wolfberg spent the next afternoon with Hoffman, whose cancer  was in remission.  </P> <P> "He looked just great and was feeling great," Wolfberg recalled last week.  </P> <P> Hoffman told Wolfberg about the Wellness Community, a Santa Monica-based  program providing free support and counseling programs to cancer patients (the  same program was touted by the late Gilda Radner in her book "It's Always  Something").  </P> <P> Hoffman and others were trying to bring the program to Orange Count. Wolfberg  offered to do a benefit. Hoffman loved the idea. But his cancer returned, then  he died in July at age 43.  </P> <P> The other Wellness Community supporters, moving ahead with plans to open an  interim center in Santa Ana this summer, decided to take Wolfberg up on his  standing offer. Wolfberg lined up comedian friends Jerry Seinfeld, Steve  Shaefer and Hiram Kasten, while the Improv donated use of the club. The benefit  sold out at $100 a head, raising about $29,000 to help staff the Santa Ana  facility.  </P> <P> "I'm just more thrilled than anything," Wolfberg said. "Ronnie was just a good  buddy. I can only imagine the sense of comfort that a support group like (the  Wellness Community) can offer."  </P> <P> Monday's benefit -- which was videotaped for Hoffman's parents in Florida --  was not Hoffman's only legacy to the Wellness Community. On April 17, it was  learned that the developer gave $100,000 to local efforts to establish a  center.  </P></p>

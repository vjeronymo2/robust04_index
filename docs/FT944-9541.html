			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: UBS holders urged to reject change Union Bank of Switzerland shareholders have been recommended to vote against the board's controversial proposal to convert its registered shares into bearers. The advice, in what is a setback for UBS, comes from a leading US adviser to institutional investors on corporate governance issues. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a proxy advisory service, said the UBS board's proposal, which will be put to an extraordinary meeting of shareholders next Tuesday, violated the principle that basic company structures should not be altered in the midst of a battle over control. The governance of UBS is being challenged by BK Vision, an investment company that is its largest shareholder. BK, controlled by maverick Zurich broker Mr Martin Ebner, is seeking to rally a majority of shareholder votes at the next general shareholders' meeting in April to make substantial changes to the bank's board and strategy. UBS has claimed the challenge had an unfair chance of succeeding because its backers were accumulating large numbers of registered shares. The par value on the registered shares is one fifth that of the bearers. Investors can thus acquire votes more cheaply by buying registered shares than by buying bearers. ISS, founded 10 years ago by Mr Bob Monks, a pioneer of the US corporate governance movement, said the move by the bank to strip the registered shares of their extra voting power without compensation was unacceptable. 'While we agree that allowing any shareholder to influence or control the bank without controlling a majority of its share capital would be improper, allowing the bank to disenfranchise and cause economic damage to a whole class of shareholders because of a dispute about strategy with one individual is also improper,' ISS said. The recommendation from ISS, which provides advice on worldwide proxy voting for some 75 institutional investors, is a setback for UBS. The bank is counting heavily on the support of non-Swiss shareholders, saying as holders of bearer shares they can only benefit if the motion is passed.</p>

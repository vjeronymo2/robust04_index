			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Arts: Trading places - Off The Wall West End audiences might be small and sluggish in the summer heat but there is a brisk trade in West End theatres. At last something is to be done with the derelict Lyceum, acquired by the Apollo Group, best known for its string of provincial theatres, while next week Stoll-Moss, the leading London theatre owner, finally gets rid of its rogue elephant, the Royalty, which it is selling to the London School of Economics for around Pounds 1m. The Lyceum is obviously the trump card in the poker game being played out between the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (due to close for refurbishment in 1997); ENO at the Coliseum, (due to close for refurbishment, probably in 1998); a National Dance House, which now looks like being based in a restored building rather than a new structure; the Arts Council; and the various other guardians of pots of Lottery money. No deals have yet been concluded. The Royal Opera and the Royal Ballet might still temporarily decamp 100 yards down the road to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, if Miss Saigon ever closes and the Arts Council finds the money for the rent. Both companies might spend the 2 1/2 -year interregnum touring. But if the Lyceum, with its splendid theatrical history, is restored, at a cost of Pounds 10m plus, with the potential to take leading opera and dance companies, it must play a role, if only as somewhere to transfer Miss Saigon, or its successor. It all comes down to money, which these days means the Lottery. The Arts Council's Lottery Fund might look with favour on the Lyceum being gilded back to life because it could be the perfect eventual home for a National Dance House, with the dancers moving in, (perhaps with English National Ballet as resident company) after the opera singers and Covent Garden dancers have returned to their restored homes. Lord Gowrie, chairman of the Arts Council, is keen to see the project succeed and he carries weight. By chance, the Royalty cannot be left out of these speculations. It must remain a provider of entertainment and the LSE, which will use it for lectures and conferences during the day, seeks a tenant for the evenings. There are two contenders for the post, and both want to present dance. Sadler's Wells is keen to take it on, as is the UK Foundation for Dance, a new company set up by ex-Sadler's Wells directors. It sees the 1,000-seat theatre as the perfect venue for middle-scale dance companies, both British and foreign, and sees a wonderful synergy with a classically inclined National Dance House based in the nearby 2,000 seat Lyceum. With so much energy being applied it seems inevitable that London will get one, if not two, palaces for dance by the millennium. David Beaird's 900 Oneonta, which opened at the Old Vic this week, is the kind of play that makes Tennessee Williams look restrained. But however melodramatic the events on stage as a Southern family gathers to battle over granddaddy's will, they are nothing to the drama involved in mounting the production. If it is a hit 900 Oneonta could transform West End theatre. For this is the first play put on by the West End Producers Alliance, a group of 17 mainly young, or new, producers who want to make the West End financially accessible to everybody - from angels to audiences. Seats are cheap compared to average West End prices. This attempt to make theatre-going affordable is only possible because the owner of the Old Vic, David Mirvish, has waived his rent for the first 15 weeks of the run at a personal cost of Pounds 50,000 and everyone else involved has accepted minimal rewards. Producer Frank Gero is not mad enough to try and cut Equity fixed salaries but the American star, Jon Cryer, has accepted Pounds 400 a week instead of the thousands he might have anticipated from a London run, and David Beaird is receiving a Pounds 1 advance as against the usual Pounds 5,000 for the writer. Everyone, from director to stage crew, has gone along with the cost-cutting, which has enabled 900 Oneonta to arrive at the Old Vic with up-front production expenses of Pounds 90,000, as against a more typical Pounds 160,000, and weekly running costs of just Pounds 17,000, two thirds of the usual bill. If 60 per cent of the 1,067 seats are sold for each performance the up-front costs will have been recouped in 11 weeks and then everyone can expect a modest pay rise. And if 900 Oneonta is a hit then those theatre owners who are dragging their feet at the idea might see this as the salvation of a West End theatre currently wilting in the heat. Whatever the outcome the West End Producers Alliance has its next play primed for September. Unison, the 1993 merger of the three unions, Nalgo, Cohse, and Nupe, is using the arts to make itself better known. It is putting Pounds 15,000 behind the British premiere of Dario Fo's latest play Abducting Diana which opens during the Edinburgh Festival at the Pleasance on August 13. Nalgo had always been a minor backer of the arts but had to overcome opposition from the more philistine members of the new union. On the surface the play is a sexual comedy but it also shows that 'anarchists are the unwitting tools of the capitalist society' so Unison members can safely attend. In the cast is Susan Penhaligon who might see her own first play produced during the Edinburgh Festival. It could surprise her: she wrote it after being hypnotised by her psychiatrist husband.

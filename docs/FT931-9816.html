			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Japan baffled as US reassesses relationship SUCCESSIVE Japanese governments have operated in the sure knowledge that the connection to Washington was 'the most important bilateral US relationship in the world'. Every US president for the last 30 years has said it, and so, as both candidate and president-elect, has Mr Bill Clinton. But two senior Japanese cabinet members, Mr Michio Watanabe, foreign minister, and Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, are coming to Washington this week apparently unsure this is still the case. The Japanese worries have been well advertised. Uncertainty exists over whether the Clinton administration is free-trade or protectionist and, if the latter, the extent to which Japan, with its Dollars 50bn (Pounds 33.1bn) bilateral trade surplus, will become a target. Every pronouncement by every newly installed US official is scrutinised with minute care by the Japanese. Beyond commerce, there is also concern about the general US commitment to Asia and particular worries about the new US approach to China. Mr Winston Lord, state department under-secretary with regional responsibilities, is a former ambassador to Beijing and a conspicuous recent critic of Chinese external and human rights policies. Yet Tokyo's concerns, which extend beyond concrete policies, are not exactly mirrored in Washington. This may well be the essence of the current problem. Japanese foreign policy tends to be rooted in certain anchors, such as the relationship with the US. For 10 years, from 1977 to 1987, the ultimate assurance of continuity was provided by the comforting presence in the Japanese capital of Ambassador Mike Mansfield, whose understanding of Japan was exceptional and whose political power in Washington (he was a long-standing senator) effectively kept the lid on successive administrations' intermittent inclinations to take a tougher line with Japan. Mr Michael Armacost, his successor, displayed some of the same skills, but with nothing like the political authority. Now Japan wonders who will be the next 'minder' of the relationship in Washington and in Tokyo. Mr Lord is a China hand and is surrounding himself mostly with like-minded people, with Mr Thomas Hubbard, a Japan expert and most recently deputy ambassador in Manila, back on board running the Japan desk. But no sign exists of a decision on the successor to Mr Armacost. Japanese nerves were jangled during the transition by rumours that the post might be offered to Mr Chalmers Johnson, the distinguished Japanologist from the University of California, best known as the 'godfather' of the revisionist school of thinking towards Japan. In a recent New York Times article, Mr Johnson wrote that the US should recognise its 'failure' to open Japanese markets and 'start over'. A new approach was 'justified on grounds that Japan, as it admits, is not the kind of capitalist economy envisioned by the Gatt negotiators.' That is the sort of language that scares Japan to the core. Mr Johnson probably will not get the job, but the absence of a clear candidate concerns the Japanese, due to their addiction to form over substance in foreign policy. Thus, it matters to Tokyo that no meeting has yet been arranged between Mr Clinton and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japanese prime minister, whereas Presidents Reagan and Bush both met Mr Miyazawa's predecessors immediately on assuming office. Not all the blame for this omission is laid at the US door. The truth is that Washington has not yet got round to thinking much about Japan. But two developments this week, the US commitment to seek an extension of the fast-track negotiating authority on trade and Detroit's decision not to go ahead with anti-dumping suits against foreign car makers, offer some generalised reassurance. Equally, the weekend session between Mr Hayashi and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, (the first he has held with a foreign finance minister) seems to indicate the US appreciates Japan's place as an important player in the Group of Seven. Mr Bentsen has talked of the need to revitalise the G7 before the annual summit in Tokyo in July, with a finance ministerial meeting planned for March as the next step in the process. But trade and China top Mr Watanabe's agenda. He will propose replacing the long-running Strategic Impediments Initiative with new institutions to discuss trade and medium-term macro-economic issues, such as the US federal deficit, rather than details about the imbalance in particular industries. Just as Washington's internal politics and personalities are receiving minute attention in Tokyo, much inevitable emphasis is being placed there on the views of Mr Mickey Kantor, trade representative. One official said he could be bad news if led by protectionist sentiment, but he might be good news, if the president were really in charge of trade policy. 'Trade relations could get a lot worse or a lot better. We just don't know yet.' What to the US is a natural reassessment of the relationship appears to Japan as confusion.</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / International Company News: Mitel share price leaps on BT sale speculation THE share price of Mitel, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker, has almost doubled in the past week amid speculation that Britain's BT is about to sell its controlling interest, or that the loss-making Ottawa company is on the verge of a long-awaited earnings turnround. The surge in the share price, from 90 cents to CDollars 1.75, took place in exceptionally heavy trading. Over 5m Mitel shares changed hands last week. The share price touched a peak of CDollars 2.01 on Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Mitel said in a statement that 'there are no developments to report' regarding BT's two-year effort to dispose of its 51 per cent stake. But a company official acknowledged that the management in Canada was 'not totally aware at all times of what negotiations are going on'. BT paid CDollars 320m, or CDollars 8 a share, almost seven years ago for its stake in Mitel, whose specialty is small and medium-sized office PBXs. BT will almost certainly take a sizeable loss if a buyer is found soon. Mitel has been in the red for seven consecutive quarters, but last week reported that its loss fell to CDollars 3.4m (USDollars 2.93m) in the three months to December 27, from CDollars 5.9m a year earlier. The operating loss narrowed to CDollars 4.4m from CDollars 7.2m. The company recently won a contract to supply the US navy.</p>

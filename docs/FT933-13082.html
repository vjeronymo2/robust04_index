			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Arts: The Merry Widow - Opera Lehar's operetta was the last foray this season by the Glyndebourne Festival to the South Bank. Like its earlier Beatrice et Benedict and Fidelio, The Merry Widow last Sunday (two more to come, tonight and Thursday), had no pretence at staging; and like the Berlioz, it has too much dialogue in foreign-speak for a concert. The same hopeful solution was adopted: scrap the speeches, and hire an amusing English narrator to sketch the action between the musical numbers, which will be sung in the original language. For Beatrice John Wells' narration was widely reported to be less amusing than facetious, intrusive and interminable. The Widow had different problems. The narrator's script, commissioned from Tom Stoppard, was built upon the conceit that a marginal character should recount the action whilst smugly imagining himself to be a central figure in it (cf. Stoppard's Travesties). There were a few clever jokes, often about the absurdities of the plot; Dirk Bogarde's arch delivery had its moments. What the narration and the expensive programme-book failed to do, however, was to tell the audience what most of the singing was about. Though each number is founded neatly upon some metaphor - or a histrionic slogan, like 'I am a respectable wife]' - no clues were given us. The net effect was that the verbal convolutions of Stoppard's narrator were interrupted from time to time by tunes sung to obscure foreign words. That said, I must say also that this Lustige Witwe boasted an appealing international cast, and in Franz Welser-Most a conductor thoroughly attuned to Lehar. He milked his muted strings for maximum sentiment, aptly, in the 'Vilja' song and elsewhere; the LPO rose to a creditable Schwung in every waltz, and they and their conductor brought off their pressurised up-tempo reprises with eclat. The Glyndebourne Chorus were crisp and lusty (some of them stepped efficiently into minor roles too). Among the diplomatic personnel, Robert Poulton's Baron Zeta bristled brightly. As the widow Hanna, Felicity Lott visibly enjoyed the whole performance and was coolly ravishing in 'Vilja'. There will be CDs for sure, and on them her soft-grained soprano will carry over the ensembles; live in the Festival Hall, however, she had not the diamond-cut edge to slice through. Her forte is 'silvery', not vocally commandeering in the manner of a seasoned operetta star. The tenor John Aler was properly stylish and wimpish as lovelorn Camille. His adulterous Valencienne, Elzbieta Szmytka, played the soubrette by the classical rule-book, with too little scope to display the lively creative gifts we admired in her recent Wigmore Hall recital. As Hanna's inamorato Count Danilo, the ultra-tall, virile, expansively laid-back American baritone Thomas Hampton might have seemed a raw cartoon; in fact he captured the airs of a classy European spiv to the hilt, lacking only a husky undertone of vulnerable feeling. Without that, we felt no real stab of dismay when he decided to retreat to the decadent swirl at Maxim's. Yet little stabs like that are what earn halos for Lehar settings of silly stories: the plot-mechanics may creak, but he finds occasions - just often enough - to match professionally crafted tunes to honestly felt situations. In the verbose circumstances of this Merry Widow, we could not be struck by that as much as we might have been.</p>

So far, the international prime brokerage business has been the preserve of a handful of US-based securities firms who had been servicing the US hedge fund's expansion into international securities. Mr Simon Luhr, deputy managing director in charge of securities lending and prime brokerage at Nomura International, said the number of European-based hedge funds had grown from fewer than 20 to close to 100 in the past few years. Hedge funds typically operate with minimal support services, contracting out back-office functions in order to control costs. 'When the US hedge funds began to diversify out of domestic assets, demand for international prime brokerage services arose,' Mr Luhr said. A prime broker is a broker/dealer with the capability of providing execution, securities lending, financing, clearance and custody and reporting services to clients. Nomura is already a significant participant in the securities lending business and, since changes in Japanese regulations, has acquired a trust bank so it can begin offering securities custody services as well.

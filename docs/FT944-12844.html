			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Football ticket rules impose a penalty: The application system for the European championship has amazed fans and Jacqueline Shorey Tickets for the 1996 European football championship went on general sale last Thursday. Application forms are available from any Midland Bank. 'Applying for Euro 96 tickets is so easy . . .' it said. A friend and I wanted to see some group games and the final at Wembley. To buy two final tickets I had to buy four for the semi-finals. The cheapest option on current ticket availability for seeing games at Wembley - where England's group will play - was to buy four Pounds 50 semi-final tickets, two of which I did not want. Never mind, I thought. I will get rid of them. However, the same rule applied for the quarter-finals - another four tickets at Pounds 35. Another two spares. The rules also said that I must buy tickets for three group matches in order to qualify to buy tickets for the knock-out games (quarters, semis and the final). Fair enough, I wanted to see some group games. However, the rules said I could not buy more tickets for knock-out games than for group matches. Did I understand correctly? Did I really have to buy four tickets for each of the three group matches? I rang the helpline number. Yes, those were the rules. I had to buy 12 tickets at Pounds 25 each to qualify. That took the grand total - the minimum I could spend - to Pounds 760, which included Pounds 320 for 10 tickets I did not want. I could have bought the best seats at Wembley and spent Pounds 1,820, of which Pounds 780 would have been for 10 unwanted tickets. What to do with the spare tickets? The criminal justice bill will outlaw touting and besides, the Football Association's conditions of sale say: 'A ticket shall become void if it is passed on, with or without payment, to another party without the prior consent of the FA.' I could not even give them away. Mr Steve Beauchampe, international officer of the Football Supporters' Association, offered his opinion: 'Fans will fall into two categories, those who sell the tickets on at face value - who wouldn't dream of ripping off another supporter - and those who think: 'I've spent a lot of money up front  -now's my chance to get a bit more back'.' Mr Mike Parry of the FA said they expected the tournament to sell out and had 'agonised' over the fairest possible ticket system. In order to give priority to real fans tickets went on sale at the end of January to league club season ticket holders and England Travel Club members who have already bought 150,000 of the 1.3m tickets. In order to get tickets for the final, they also had to buy tickets for earlier games, but had not been compelled to buy 'spares' in order to qualify. The 'progressive loyalty' system tried to ensure tickets for the later stages of the competition went to real fans who had attended group games. What about four fans, who had proved their loyalty by going to three group matches, the quarters and semis. Their ticket purchases only qualify for two final tickets. Did the FA have any advice on who should get the final tickets? 'Toss a coin?' said Mr Parry. Mr Beauchampe was not impressed. 'I was aghast when I read the ticket application form,' he said. 'We accept that because of huge demand there have to be restrictions on final tickets, and approved a scheme where people had to go to group games to qualify. But to attend those games and then not get a final ticket is unfair. The system betrays the loyalty of football fans.' What about fans from other countries in the competition? Unlike English fans who are having to pay 20 months in advance, our European rivals will have another year - until December 1995, when the draw is held. At least those fans will know what they are buying - all the English fans can do now is book a seat at a ground, even though fixtures have not been arranged. Total ticket sales should generate about Pounds 60m. That money and the interest it earns before June 1996 will go into a trust fund. After expenses, profits will be split between the FA and Uefa, the European body, and put back into the game. Mr Parry denied that tickets had gone on sale too soon. The competition will be twice the size of the Swedish championship in 1992, when tickets went on sale 10 months in advance. 'This competition is twice as big and needs twice the time,' he said. Mr Rod Cornes of Synchro Systems, the Newcastle-under-Lyme software company which is organising ticket sales on behalf of the FA, said 70 per cent of those who had bought tickets were using direct debit and the average expenditure was Pounds 500. I told Mr Cornes about my surplus tickets and then had a brainwave. I'd read in the small print that 'all tickets will be refundable up until 30 June 1995, subject to a Pounds 3 per ticket administration fee'. I would keep the 12 tickets I wanted and return my 10 spares for a refund. The administration fee was annoying but I would offload the tickets legitimately and get my cash back. 'We've thought of that,' Mr Cornes said. 'Our computer is very sophisticated. If it sees that you're trying to return tickets that qualified you for final tickets, it will invalidate your final tickets.'</p>

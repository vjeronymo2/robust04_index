			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [UK press release from the Department of the Environment: </F> "Taking Rio Forward: Biodiversity Action Plan Published"]    [Text] A plan to make the conservation of wildlife an  integral part of Government programmes, policy and action,  "Biodiversity: The UK Action Plan", was published today by the  Prime Minister, John Major, and Environment Secretary, John  Gummer.    The plan was launched as part of a package of documents  which  represent the UK Government's response to the Rio "Earth  Summit". It outlines the UK's role in conserving biodiversity at  home and abroad.    The plan, drawn up after extensive consultation, provides a  strategy for the next 10 and 20 years and sets out 59 specific  commitments to forward action. It emphasises what can be done at  the local level to raise public awareness and involvement in  conserving local biodiversity and pride in local distinctiveness.    The Government commits itself to conserve, and where  possible  enhance:    -- the overall populations and natural ranges of native  species and the quality and range of wildlife habitats and  ecosystems;    -- internationally important and threatened species,  habitats  and ecosystems;    -- species, habitats and natural and managed ecosystems that  are characteristic of local areas;    -- the biodiversity of natural and semi-natural habitats  where this has been diminished over recent decades.    A "Biodiversity Action Plan Steering Group" will be created  to take forward the commitments outlined in the plan. The Group  will oversee the development of a full range of specific costed  targets for key species and habitats for the years 2000 and  2010, to be published in European Nature Conservation Year 1995.  In addition it will supervise the work proposed in the plan to  improve the accessibility of wildlife data, encourage public  awareness of and involvement in biodiversity, and review the  delivery of the commitments contained in the Plan.    The Steering Group will operate as a partnership between  central and local government, agencies, collections, leading  academic bodies and non-governmental organisations, and all of  these groups are being invited to propose members.    The document also outlines the UK's long history of  scientific and practical involvement in the conservation of  biodiversity overseas and sets out the Government's pledge to  continue this support through the Darwin Initiative, the  Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)  and the Overseas Aid Programme.  <H5>  Notes for Editors </H5>   "Biodiversity: The UK Action Plan" is available from HMSO  [Her Majesty's Stationary Office]; "Biodiversity: The UK Action  Plan" was one of four documents published today. The others are:  "Sustainable Development: The UK Strategy", "Sustainable  Forestry Plan: The UK Programme" and "Climate Change: The UK  Programme".    "Biodiversity The UK Action Plan" is in response to article  6a of the Convention on Biological Diversity which the Prime  Minister signed at the United Nations Conference on Environment  and Development (UNCED) at the Rio Earth Summit last year. The  Convention calls for each Contracting Party to develop national  strategies, plans or programmes for the conservation and  sustainable use of biodiversity.    The Plan follows widespread consultation and contributions  from central government departments, local government, agencies,  academic institutions, businesses, voluntary groups and  individuals. These included:    -- a consultation paper issued in February 1993 to which  more  than 300 responses were received;    -- a seminar held at the Royal Geographical Society in may  1993 with over 100 attendees half of which were from outside  central government;    -- a wide range of meetings between government officials and  representatives of other organisations.

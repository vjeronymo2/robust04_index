			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Seoul uneasy as funeral put off North Korea early today postponed the state funeral of Kim Il-sung - a surprise move that caused some concern among South Korean officials. The North said the former president's funeral, planned for tomorrow, would be put off until Tuesday to allow more mourners to stream past his body, lying in state in Pyongyang. Officials in Seoul fear one result of the postponement may be to fan unrest in the South, where there is increasingly bitter debate about how the Seoul government should respond to the death a week ago of the North's Communist leader. The Seoul authorities have announced a crackdown on left-wing organisations planning mourning ceremonies. This follows the firebombing of six police stations in Seoul on Thursday by radical students protesting at the arrest of student organisers for praising President Kim. Student organisations have said they will send groups with condolences to Pyongyang, after North Korea announced it would let South Koreans wanting to pay homage cross the heavily fortified demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas. North Korea yesterday resumed propaganda attacks against the South. It criticised South Korean President Kim Young-sam for placing troops and police on alert. 'Despite the fact that even the US president and Japanese prime minister expressed their regrets over the death of President Kim Il-sung, only Kim Young-sam. . . is acting recklessly,' declared the state-controlled Radio Pyongyang. South Korean officials have privately criticised President Bill Clinton for offering condolences over Mr Kim's death in a diplomatic gesture to maintain US dialogue with the new North Korean leadership.</p>

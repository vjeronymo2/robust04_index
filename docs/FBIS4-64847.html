			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw (DPA) -- Federal Economics Minister Guenter  Rexrodt called upon the East and Central European countries on 7  May to create clear investment conditions. "We need clear and  reliable investment conditions for the whole investment period.  Those who cannot guarantee this should not be surprised if no  investment is made," he said in Warsaw at the East-West economic  meeting of highly industrialized nations (G-7) with 10 Central  and East European reform states (E-10).    Deviating from his prepared text, Rexrodt listed details:  "In the energy sector, we will need such stability for a period  of between 20 and 30 years. A calculable tax system is  indispensable. Taxes must promote investment and should not  burden investment unreasonably." Other points, according to  Rexrodt, are a functioning banking system allowing the  retransfer of capital invested, the acquisition of real estate,  and the reduction of bureaucracy. In addition, exports must be  possible, and intellectual property must be protected.    Rexrodt thereby referred to concrete complaints of business  people doing business in the East. He said that last year,  approximately 10 percent of German investment abroad went to  Central and East Europe. By the end of 1993, the Federal  Government assumed guarantees for investment totalling 2.9  billion German marks. Four-fifths of this sum went to the  Visegrad countries (Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, and  Slovakia). The minister emphatically advocated greater access  for the East European countries to Western markets.    To clarify practical problems, a business forum of economic  experts having practical experience preceded the meeting. The  participants published a "Warsaw Business Statement" on 6 May,  in which they set the goal for themselves to carry out direct  investment in the E-10 countries of approximately $200 billion  by the year 2000.</p>

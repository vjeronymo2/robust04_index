			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regional Meeting Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In connection with these regulations, one issue was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified during the August meeting for discussion at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regional meetings: The requirement under section 487(c)(1)(C)(i)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the HEA for an audit of a third-party servicer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of an institution's, lender's, or guaranty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's Title IV, HEA program. During the regional meetings,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants were asked for their recommendations on formulating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the compliance standards against which a third-party servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be measured in these proposed regulations. Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the regional meetings varied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants involved in the New York meeting suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the compliance standards for third-party servicers contracting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with institutions should parallel institutional compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants in San Francisco recommended that compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for third-party servicers should be developed by an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent accounting firm but that the Department of Education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should specify servicer activities that would need to be included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the annual compliance audit report. Participants at this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting further suggested separate standards for different types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of third-party servicers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants meeting in Atlanta suggested that compliance audits of third-party servicers be limited to the area of their specific function; for example, with respect to loan servicers, the default rate of Title IV, HEA program loans should be an indicator of compliance with Title IV, HEA program requirements. Participants also recommended that a third-party servicer, and not the institution with which the servicer contracts, should be cited for any violation of an audit standard by that servicer. One participant recommended that the standards developed by the Association of Independent Certified Public Accountants should be used in the Department of Education's audit guide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants attending the Kansas City regional meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that in devising audit standards for third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers, the Secretary first should review the audit check list  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently in use by the Office of Inspector General of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Education for auditing third-party servicers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants did not consider consultants or software providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used by an institution to be included in the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> third-party servicer.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants suggested that the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Education devise a process for grading and validating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> software.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary submitted a draft of the proposed regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language governing third-party servicers along with the issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above for discussion at the negotiated rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sessions. Consensus was reached on all major issues except where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noted below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

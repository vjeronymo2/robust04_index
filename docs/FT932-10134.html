			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Japan to clarify bidding process JAPAN'S Construction Ministry yesterday issued proposals to clarify the bidding process for public contracts in an effort to head off US pressure for reform. The proposals, made by an advisory committee, call for clearer and more specific criteria to assess construction groups bidding for public works contracts. The process has faced mounting criticism following revelations that construction companies made illegal political donations to influence the outcome of bids. On April 30 the US warned Japan it would impose sanctions if alleged discrimination was not eliminated. Under the Japanese system the Construction Ministry pre-selects a company as eligible to bid, rather than making an open invitation. Existing criteria are generally vague references to the bidder's ethics, employment record and financial strength. The revised criteria will stress a contractor's record in comparable projects and its technology. The new system will be tested on about 30 medium-sized public works projects valued at between Y200m-Y500m (Pounds 1.2m-Pounds 2.8m) each. The committee also called for a review of the Construction Ministry's methods for estimating the value of public works projects. The ministry has been criticised for overestimating the value of projects, thereby allowing construction companies to make excess profits which are in turn used for political donations.</p>

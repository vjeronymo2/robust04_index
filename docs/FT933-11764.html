			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour row on Ulster erupts DISAGREEMENT within the Labour party about whether to organise in Northern Ireland erupted into acrimony yesterday. The party's frontbench team published a pamphlet accusing those who supported organisation of tactics 'not dissimilar' to those of the Militant Tendency. The argument came as the Tories - who began organising in Northern Ireland in 1989 - demonstrated the difficulties the mainland parties can experience there. Dr Laurence Kennedy, a Conservative councillor, resigned from North Down Borough Council after attacking his party's policy towards Northern Ireland. Dr Kennedy said Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, seemed to want to 'connive in the perpetuation of the religiously divisive politics which have cost Northern Ireland so dearly'. Both events come within days of the understanding reached last week between the Ulster Unionists and the government, which led the nine Ulster Unionist MPs to support Mr Major in the Commons vote on the social chapter. Labour's pamphlet, 'Oranges or lemons?', argued that organising in the province would undermine the party's policy of actively seeking the unity of Ireland through consent. It said that Northern Ireland was different to the rest of the UK because of competing national allegiances. The paper, published by Mr Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, called Labour-supporting electoral integrationists 'dishonest', and accused them of 'entryism' because they really wanted Labour to become a unionist party. Labour MPs who want the party to organise expressed disappointment that Mr McNamara 'should allow such a mischievous and scurrilous document to be published'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- A social science seminar  took place here on May 31 to mark the 55th anniversary of the  great leader President Kim Il-song's historical advance into the  Musan area.    President Kim Il-song dealt a heavy military and political  blow to the Japanese imperialist aggressors in the operation of  advance into Musan area in May 1939 and advanced into the area  again in June of that year, personally leading members of the  main unit of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army. That was  great events which occasioned an epoch-making turn in bringing  about an uninterrupted upsurge in the Korean revolution as a  whole centering around the anti-Japanese armed struggle and  accelerating the cause of national liberation in reliance upon  the strength of the Korean people.    The speakers said the historic advance of the great leader  was an important occasion in building the area northeast of Mt.  Paektu and the northern frontier of Korea along the Tumen River  into a strategic base for a constant upsurge in the Korean  revolution as a whole and rousing broad segments of the people  in the preparations for an all-people resistance.    The historic advance opened up a new phase in calling the  whole nation to the anti-Japanese national struggle, they noted,  adding that the advance encouraged all the Korean people to turn  out in the great anti-Japanese war, so that the fierce flames of  the anti-Japanese armed struggle might sweep the whole country.</p>

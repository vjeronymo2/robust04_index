			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Economics Notebook: Lamont sets his sights on the inflation target Mr Norman Lamont's decision to add inflation targets to the pot pourri of measures now being used to determine UK monetary policy was given a lukewarm reception last week. Some commentators, pointing out that inflation is a lagging indicator of economic conditions, have likened the chancellor's idea to steering the economy by using the rear view mirror. Others, seeing how retail price inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, fell to within its target range for the rest of this parliament of 1 per cent to 4 per cent within 24 hours of Mr Lamont's announcement, fear a Treasury public relations trick. A third group admit that the chancellor's objective of bringing inflation to '2 per cent or less' by the end of the parliament is ambitious. However, they ask why it should be believed in the light of Britain's persistent failure to defeat inflation and the pound's recent exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. But there are some positive things to be said for the new idea. Two other industrialised nations - New Zealand and Canada - have introduced inflation targets with some success. Moreover, the government's inflation objectives are not a stand-alone policy. They will, if the Treasury sticks to its word, be subject to the discipline of increased accountability to parliament and the public at large. The importance of this promised openness should not be underestimated. Government in Britain is obsessively secretive and the Treasury is one of the most secretive of Whitehall departments. In his statement last Thursday, Mr Lamont said that if the government fails to achieve its inflation targets 'it will have a duty to explain how this had arisen, how quickly it intended to get back within the range, and the means by which it would achieve this'. He also said: 'It will be important to explain clearly to parliament and the markets how we assess the progress being made towards the government's inflation objectives.' Treasury officials understand this reference to assessing progress as giving parliament and the public the opportunity to hold the government to account for how it is achieving its inflation targets. Mr Lamont has conceded more than the principle of obliging the government to explain a missed inflation target long after policy mistakes have been made. Parliament, the press and the public should now expect the government to disclose in a timely manner what it thinks of developments in narrow and broad money supply, house prices and other asset prices, the exchange rate and all the other indicators it will use to guide policy. In turn, the Treasury and the Bank of England should expect pressure to improve the information flow if their account of events is unsatisfactory. Certainly, the Bank seems to welcome such glasnost. Speaking in Cambridge last week, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor, said the best way of restoring confidence in economic policy was to accompany it 'by a willingness to be open in explaining, to parliament and to the public at large, the influences on inflation and our responses to them'. Mr Lamont will have an opportunity to display how he views accountability later today when he testifies to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee. By the end of November - after the chancellor's Mansion House speech, the Autumn Statement and publication of the next Bank of England quarterly bulletin - it should be possible to assess how far the government is meeting its promises. Increased accountability in the UK will have to substitute for institutional disciplines available in other countries to make inflation targets effective. New Zealand gave its central bank independence with effect from February 1990 so that it could pursue price stability as a statutory goal. The salary of Mr Don Brash, the Reserve Bank's governor, has been linked to his ability to deliver stable prices, defined as an annual increase in the consumer price index of zero to 2 per cent by the end of 1993. Mr Brash responsed by aiming to hit the target by the end of this year and - with inflation at around 1 per cent - he is almost certain to succeed. The Bank of Canada does not enjoy such independence. But it has more operational freedom than the Bank of England. The Bank of Canada and the Department of Finance jointly announced in February 1991 that the annual increase in consumer price inflation should fall to 3 per cent by December this year and 2 per cent by December 1995. With core inflation currently around 1.7 per cent, Canada is well ahead of its targets. Canada's experiences are probably more relevant to the UK than those of New Zealand. Britain and Canada are big economies: both import and export a similar proportion of their gross national product. Since Britain's departure from the ERM, both operate floating exchange rates and yet are part of large trading areas. Mr David Dodge, Canada's deputy finance minister, says inflation targets have been a great success. 'They are the bedrock on which Canada bases its monetary policy.' The targets, he says, have helped the government to explain and defend its policy and keep down wage increases. In its recent annual survey of Canada, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said the publication of the targets caused a sharp drop in short-term inflationary expectations, particularly among businesses. But Mr Dodge stresses that inflation targets need to be backed up by other policy instruments. Canada has pursued a tough fiscal policy, including a legislated freeze on civil service salaries, for example. Mr Dodge also insists that floating exchange rates are essential if a country is to meet its inflation goals. This last point should give Mr Lamont and the rest of the cabinet pause for thought, if, as reported, the government is aiming to return sterling to the ERM next year.</p>

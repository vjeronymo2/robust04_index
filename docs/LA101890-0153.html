			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> USC;  </P> <P> BOWL REPRESENTATIVES FLOCK TO USC  </P> <P> Even if USC lost twice in its last six games, it probably would be invited to a  New Year's Day bowl game, Jim Brock, executive director of the Cotton Bowl,  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "USC's always been on our wish list," Brock said.  </P> <P> "With three losses, I don't think they'd be out of our hunt. USC is definitely  on our elite list. They're in the upper echelon. I'd be surprised if USC wasn't  on everybody's list."  </P> <P> Representatives of eight bowl games -- the Cotton, Citrus, Holiday, Freedom,  Sugar, Copper, Peach and John Hancock -- will be at the USC-Arizona game  Saturday at the Coliseum.  </P> <P> "They've got a marquee player in the quarterback (Todd Marinovich)," Brock said  of the Trojans. "They've got other players who are going to be future stars in  the NFL. They've got tradition, a great record since (Coach) Larry Smith has  been there. They're appealing. I could see a potential USC-Texas or USC-Texas  A&amp;M matchup (in the Cotton Bowl) as being a really marquee football game.  </P> <P> "USC's always going to be in the elite bowl-invitation group. Any New Year's  Day bowl would love to have them."  </P> <P> According to research by the Pacific 10 Conference and the NFL, USC had 38  players on opening-day NFL rosters this season, more than any other school.

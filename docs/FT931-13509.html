			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Lambeth lost Pounds 10m through corruption, chief claims CORRUPTION and malpractice, claimed to be on an 'unprecedented' scale, have cost the south London borough of Lambeth upwards of Pounds 10m, according to a confidential report by Mr Herman Ouseley, the council's chief executive. Lambeth council was meeting in emergency session into the early hours this morning to decide what action to take. Mr Ouseley's report is a catalogue of work performed without proper authority, unauthorised redundancy payments, overcharging by the council's direct-labour organisation (DLO) and by former council employees brought in as sub-contractors. Some cases involve double charging. The most serious involve the borough's housing department. The findings of the report by Mr Ouseley, Lambeth's chief executive for nearly three years, may be investigated by the Serious Fraud Squad, whatever action the council itself takes. The report raises the issue of disbanding the DLO and putting its services out to tender. Allegations involve officials, council workers and contractors and go back more than 10 years. Throughout most of the period in question Lambeth was under the control of a leftwing Labour administration. Last night, the ruling Labour administration was calling for an independent inquiry, while opposition councillors were demanding immediate recourse to the Serious Fraud Squad. Lambeth's finances have long been in a critical state. It has the highest poll tax in England - Pounds 425 after capping - and more than Pounds 157m outstanding in uncollected rents, poll tax and rates. Mr Steven Whaley, the council's Labour leader, called for a 'no-holds-barred' inquiry by a leading barrister, conceding that the council had not been sufficiently 'vigorous and vigilant'. Mr Keith Fitchett, Liberal Democrat leader, said the report reflected 'a complete breakdown of managerial control in Lambeth, arising from the . . . debilitating relationship between the Labour party and local government unions.'</p>

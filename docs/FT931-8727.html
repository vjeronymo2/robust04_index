			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Importers fail to beef up consumer demand THE OPENING of the beef market has put more meat on Japanese tables, but an estimated 57 per cent of consumers are concerned about the safety standards of foreign producers, according to a study by the Economic Planning Agency. When a strict quota system was relaxed in April 1991, after several years of difficult negotiations between Washington and Tokyo, there was a presumption in both countries that the lower prices of the imported product would encourage Japanese to eat more beef. But the EPA's survey found that only 23 per cent of Japanese reckon that they consume more imported beef than before liberalisation and 12 per cent now eat less imported beef, even though it is 20 to 30 per cent cheaper than comparable domestic cuts. The reason for the reluctance to buy more imported beef, most of which comes from Australia and the US, appears to be the success of campaigns run by Japanese farmers' groups to discredit the safety of imported meat. From a video showing a family becoming ill after consuming imported meat to a flood of leaflets on food safety, the farmers' groups and affiliated consumer groups have created significant public concern about the use of growth hormones and additives. Only 6 per cent of those surveyed considered that imported beef is tastier than the home grown version, while 48 per cent concluded politely that the foreign meat 'does not compare unfavourably.' However, 15.4 per cent said 'it looks bad' and a mere 1.7 per cent suggested that it is very tasty. There was a striking difference in the place of purchase, which reflects the difficulty foreign products have in penetrating the country's small, specialist stores. About 21 per cent of consumers said they bought their Japanese beef at specialist stores, while only 5.6 per cent used the same stores for imported beef. However, 42 per cent bought the imported meat at large supermarkets, which tend to carry a broader range of products and are less bound by traditional distribution relationships. About 27 per cent of consumers bought their Japanese beef at large supermarkets. The findings also highlight the success of Japanese producers in cornering the top end of the beef market, leaving the US and Australian suppliers to fight it out for market share in hamburger beef and cheaper cuts. About 59 per cent of respondents said Japanese beef costs too much, while only 4 per cent thought foreign beef was overly expensive.</p>

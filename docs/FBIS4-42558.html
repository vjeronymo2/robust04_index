			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K. Kiriakidhis] </F>   [Text] The day before yesterday, Foreign Minister Alekos  Mikhailidhis held a protest meeting with the ambassadors of the  five UN Security Council permanent members. The meeting is  considered to be the first step in a plan to promote the Cypriot  Government's new policy. The policy is being formulated in view  of the prospects and options included in UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report.    According to reliable information I MAKHI has received, the  meeting was considered necessary in order to prevent negative  situations in the future, such as a possible return to the  confidence-building measures [CBM's] scheme. The Cypriot  Government made it clear that it strongly opposes such an  eventuality.    The meeting with the ambassadors was held immediately after  the National Council meeting at which all the members of the  body said they are intensely concerned with the (negative) U.S.  intention to bring back the old set of ideas and CBM's (based on  the Vienna talks and the U.S. promises). They especially  stressed the dangers of this move in view of the expected UN  Security Council resolution. The United States plays an  important role in the resolution.    According to the same information, Mikhailidhis warned the  ambassadors, who represent permanent members of the Security  Council, that if there is no tangible evidence that the Turkish  side has shown signs of goodwill, the Greek side will not  participate in any dialogue. The foreign minister also referred  to two points of the UN secretary general's report:    1) Butrus-Ghali's note that the lack of an agreement on the  Cyprus issue is due to the "lack of political will both by the  Turkish Cypriot leadership and the region outside of Cyprus  (Turkey)."    2) The UN secretary general's position that no discussion on  the CBM's (even if the 21 March document is modified) or the  substance of the Cyprus issue will bear fruit if the lack of  goodwill by the Turkish side is not rectified.    Mikhailidhis stressed to the "five" that any pressure on the  Greek Cypriot side to accept any discussion will be fruitless,  because this is a unanimous decision of the country's political  leadership.    Answering a relevant question after the conclusion of the  National Council meeting, President Glavkos Kliridhis said:  "Some countries may believe that despite what the UN secretary  general says, resuming the procedure might bear fruit. But,  both sides must agree on this, because there can be no  negotiations with just one side. Therefore, it will depend on  us whether the talks will continue or not."    According to other information I MAKHI received, the second  step in implementing the new policy will be taken up today at  the foreign minister's meeting with his Russian counterpart,  Andrey Kozyrev, in Moscow.    Meanwhile, the Turks are trying to stop the Greece-Cyprus  efforts to promote Cyprus' application for membership in the  European Union [EU] and will launch an official campaign in  European capitals on 15 June. [Akyon] Dogan, Turkish minister  in the Prime Minister's Office, will be in charge of the  campaign and will try to avert an EU decision on Cyprus'  application at the Corfu summit.    Serge Abou, the EU observer to the Cyprus issue, will submit  a report to the EU Council of Ministers on 13 June on  developments in Cyprus. The Cyprus issue is expected to be  discussed at the EU summit.</p>

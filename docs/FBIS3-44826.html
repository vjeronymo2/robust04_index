In 1993, China's imports grew by 29 percent over 1992,  amounting to 103.95 billion U.S. dollars; exports increased by 8  percent, reaching 91.77 billion U.S. dollars.    Textiles and garments still topped the exports list,  recording a 7.2 percent lift with a total volume of 27.13  billion U.S. dollars, while machinery and electronics witnessed  a steady rise of 16.1 percent, totalling 22.7 billion U.S.  dollars.    Machinery and electronics also made up a nearly-half share  of  the imports, to the tune of 49.46 billion U.S. dollars, a steep  rise of 41.7 percent and including cars, aircraft, telephone  sets and telephone switchboards as well as machinery for  textiles, construction, mining, metal processing and rubber and  plastics processing.    Imports of raw materials and fuel also witnessed a large  growth, in which steel imports jumped to over 30 million tons,  up 327 percent, processed oil hit 17.48 million tons, up 128  percent.    The import and export of foreign-financed enterprises  continued to rise sharply, with a total export of 25.24 billion  U.S. dollars, representing a 45.4 percent increase and  accounting for 27.5 percent of China's total exports; and an  import of 41.83 billion U.S. dollars, increased by 58.6 percent,  covering 40.2 percent of China's imports.    These foreign-funded enterprises shipped as much as 16.63  billion U.S. dollars of equipment, increased by 107 percent.    In volume, China's biggest trade partners are Japan, Hong  Kong, the United States, the European Community, Taiwan,  Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore, Australia and Canada.    In 1993, Japan imported 15.79 billion U.S. dollars worth  from  China while exporting 23.25 billion U.S. dollars worth to it.  Hong Kong consumed 22.06 billion U.S. dollars worth of China's  exports and provided it with goods worth 10.48 billion U.S.  dollars. The United States imported 16.96 billion U.S. dollars  worth from China, and its exports to China were worth 10.69  billion U.S. dollars.    In 1993, China's export growth rate was the lowest since  1986, while the import growth rate was the highest since 1986.    The reasons for the result included the domestic economy's  high growth rate; large-scale investment; thriving market  demand; lack of some commodities, especially primary products  due to the rising domestic prices; meanwhile, imports of raw  materials and energy which met soaring domestic demand, and  machinery and telecommunications facilities increased by large  amounts.    Equipment imported by China's foreign-funded enterprises  also  contributed to China's rapid increase of imports and huge trade  deficit, as China drew more overseas investment last year.    Besides, the imports increase can also be attributed to  China's bid to lower import tariffs last year.    It is predicted that with the reform of China's trade system  and foreign exchange system this year, China's export volume in  1994 is expected to exceed 100 billion U.S. dollars and its  import growth rate is to slow down.</p>

Mr. Jacques Friedmann was received by Premier Li Peng and  Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, and had talks  with Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu.    The two sides have reached the following conclusions through  these talks:    Both sides believe that China and France should restore  their  traditional friendly relations and cooperation on the basis of  the principles on which the two countries established diplomatic  relations.    The Chinese side has reaffirmed its consistent position on  the question of Taiwan. The French side has confirmed that the  French Government recognizes the Government of the People's  Republic of China as the sole legal government of China and  Taiwan as an integral part of Chinese territory.    The Chinese side reaffirms that arms sale of any type to  Taiwan will bring harm to China's sovereignty, security and  reunification, and that the Chinese Government will be firmly  opposed to that. In view of the concerns of the Chinese side,  the French Government has undertaken not to authorize any French  enterprises to participate in the arming of Taiwan.    The Chinese Government and the French Government wish to  intensify their political consultations, hold regular meetings  and develop economic and trade cooperation between them. The  Chinese side welcomes participation by French enterprises in  competition on the Chinese market on an equal footing.    The two sides have agreed that Mr. Edouard Balladur, prime  minister of France, will pay an official visit to China in the  near future.</p>

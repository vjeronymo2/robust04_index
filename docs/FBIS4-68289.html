			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Major General Vyacheslav Omelchenko, current </F> member of the Academy for Transport and chief of the Military  Transport Institute, under "Interests of Russia" rubric: "A Knot  of Transport Problems: Will the State Program Untie It?"]    [Text] On 8 February, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA published the  article by Col. Yu. Kirsanov, "New Routes, Old Problems," that  touched on the problem of the combining of defense and transport  strategies. It evoked a vigorous response from specialists.  Today we continue the conversation.    Now that our economy is being reformed and the armed forces  are being structurally reorganized and cut back, it is very  important not to permit a lowering of the country's defensive  potential. How can this be accomplished? Back in the middle of  the last century, military minister I. Mordvinov expressed the  idea that if necessary the army can be reduced without harm if  in so doing transport is used for the rapid movement of troops  to the "threatened borders" of the Russian state.    In our time as well, transport communications fulfill not  only economic functions but also military-strategic functions.  It is for this reason, in my view, that the program "Transport  Russia" now being developed is so important. The developers  performed an in-depth analysis of the actual state of the  country's transportation network. Here, for example, is what  railroad transportation looks like, which accounts for 52  percent of conveyances. The overall length of our railroads is  less than one-fourth that of those in the United States and the  density of the network is one-seventh of what they have. But the  freight traffic is almost 10 times that of the United States.    The traffic on the West Siberian, South Urals, East  Siberian,  and Transbaikal railroads is especially intense. In the European  part, major changes in the directions of freight flows may arise  in the direction center-south. Of the four main lines that serve  it, three cross the territory of Ukraine in their southern part.  For this reason, the concentration of freight flows may shift in  the direction of Moscow-Michurinsk-Liski-Rostov. This will  require much work to increase the throughput and carrying  capacity of this line or to establish a new main line with a  terminal in Mineralnyye Vody. In the direction Kuznetsk  Basin-Urals, freight is moved along the Main, Middle, and  Southern Siberian routes. The last two mostly cross the  territory of Kazakhstan. There there can be a shift in freight  flows toward the Main Siberian Route. And this will also require  additional strengthening.    The high intensity of traffic leads to early deterioration  of  the railroads. In 1992, speed was limited on 12,000 km of  railroads. This is equivalent to a railroad like the Moscow  Railroad working at half capacity. The situation may worsen.  More than 18 percent of the cross ties and a significant part of  the rails have finished their service life. Their share is  especially high on the main lines that were built long ago. For  example, 21 percent of the accidents and malfunctions registered  on all railroads can be attributed to the October Railroad, the  first railroad in Russia, which accounts for 12 percent of the  total length of the country's steel lines.    One must also consider the factor that Russian railroads  have  tens of thousands of bridges, tunnels, and other artificial  structures with a total length of 2,262.6 km. About 10 percent  of them have defects but are in use. There is traffic across  bridges built under the standards of 1884-1896, which have been  in service for a time that is twice the norm. A further  strengthening of the spans of such bridges is no longer  possible. They must be replaced with new bridges. But this is an  extraordinarily complex and costly measure, especially when it  is a matter of bridges across such rivers as the Volga, Don,  Oka, Kama, Ob, Yenisey, Zeya, and Amur. Last year the number of  prolonged restrictions of speed doubled because of the  unsatisfactory state of artificial structures.    And there are many such slow-acting "mines" on the  railroads.  They include, for example, the defective road beds in the  eastern areas of Russia in connection with a warming of the  climate. On the Transbaikal Railroad alone, 75 percent of the  earthen base of the road was laid on permafrost. As a result of  the constantly increasing number of deformations, expenditures  for the repair of the railroad have now increased by a factor of  almost seven. If measures are not taken, the Transbaikal  Railroad may become impassable. Overall for all kinds of  transport, the depletion of production capital amounts to 38  percent.    This is by no means a complete listing of the problems with  our transport. But it indicates rather clearly that under these  conditions it is very difficult for transport to satisfy the  needs of the armed forces with respect to military conveyances.  There is a widespread opinion that in the existing situation the  mobility of units and combined units may be increased by taking  the course of the priority development of military transport  aviation. But one should not exaggerate the possibilities of  this aviation, for above all it must provide for the landing of  assault forces, accomplish the most urgent troop maneuvers,  deliver weapons and other freight, and evacuate the wounded.    The share of railroad transport in military conveyances  remains high. Under today's conditions as well, it is seen as  one of the most important forms of transportation that is most  suitable and convenient for large-scale movements of troops and  cargo, especially when it is a matter of heavy and bulky weapons  and equipment. There are also other advantages inherent only in  rail transport: For example, the rapid rehabilitation of the  roads, the low degree of dependence on weather conditions, and  the preservation of the relative integrity and accordingly  combat capability of units and subunits during the time of their  transport by rail. All of this puts rail transport into first  place in military transport movements. Naturally this does not  diminish the role of other kinds of transport in the realization  of the requirements of military doctrine. All of these problems  are now the focus of attention of the scientists of the Military  Transport Institute, who in their research work closely with  other higher institutes of transport learning in the country.    In this respect, what prospects flow from the program  "Transport Russia"? It is intended to overcome crisis phenomena  and to guarantee steady work for the railroads in 1994-1997 and  to achieve a world level of transport by 2005. Overall, the  program shows the prospects for the formation of a transport  network and the coordinated development of every kind of  transport and the management of the transportation system. The  subprograms "Transport Space" and "Transport Technology"  constructed under the branch principle also make it possible to  forecast the military strategic possibilities of new and rebuilt  main lines and from this position to put demands on the  established transport network and produced industrial goods.  Unfortunately, however, overall defensive functions are not  purposefully incorporated into the program.    It is forecast that by 1997 the volume of freight moved in  the trailroad network will decrease by 25 percent and no  increase in its density is foreseen before about 2000. On the  contrary, it is planned to write off up to 20,000 km of lines  that have completed their service life. It appears that under  these conditions the question of the elimination of unprofitable  sections, leading to a reduction of the length of railroads,  must be coordinated with the country's military leadership. A  similar precedent arose in the United States at the beginning of  the 1980's. When there were plans there for the closing and  dismantling of several railroad lines, the leadership of the  armed forces came out against this and took control of the  network of the militarily most important railroads, proving  their strategic necessity.    There is still another problem. It is proposed beginning in  2000 to carry out preparatory work in the building of high-speed  railroad lines. In world practice, this concept is realized  through the reconstruction of existing lines (this is basically  the course taken by the United States and other countries with a  dense network of railroads) or through new construction. My  opinion is that for defensive purposes it is expedient for us to  take the second course.    And now about the economic-mathematic model for the  functioning of our transport. It was worked out with an  orientation toward the transportation system of the United  States and forces a redistribution of investments in favor of an  increase in conveyances by motor vehicles, which does not take  into account our special circumstances in Russia. The model also  does not consider expenditures for the realization of defense  demands on transport.    The primary reason for the indicated shortcomings is the  fact  that the developers of the program "Transport Russia," having  taken the initiative in such an important matter, did not  involve specialists in military transport services in this joint  work, above all the service for military transport  communications that ensures the representation of the Armed  Forces of the Russian Federation in rail, sea, river, and air  transport and that is empowered to raise military-technical  demands on the development of these kinds of transportation. In  our opinion, the existing draft of the program requires detailed  study by military specialists together with interested transport  agencies. Only after this can it be presented to the government  for consideration.    In the development of the defense aspect of the program, one  certainly cannot discard such a purely Russian peculiarity of  ours in which troops actively participate in the resolution of  national economic tasks. Every year motor vehicle units carry  out large volumes of agricultural conveyances and road building  units work intensively to build roads in the Nonchernozem lands.  The railroad troops are performing an especially large volume of  work. Despite being at less than full strength and despite  interruptions in financing and supply, they are continuing to  build and reconstruct railroad lines of different purposes. In  so doing, naturally, the troops are primarily being involved in  the building of transport facilities of paramount significance  for defense. The troops also play a major role in the  elimination of the consequences of accidents and disasters. That  is, the entire military transport structure is being fully  loaded with work and in peacetime, accordingly, it is a great  omission to fail to consider the role of the military in the  country's transportation strategy.    It may be that it even makes sense to include an independent  subprogram in the comprehensive program "Transport Russia." We  will conditionally call it "Military Transport" and it would  reflect defense requirements and ways to carry them out.</p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE FLARES AFTER MAN DIES IN MIAMI POLICE CHASE  </P> <P> A civil disturbance broke out in this city's predominantly black Overtown area  Monday evening, after police shot at two men on a motorcycle during a  high-speed chase.  </P> <P> The motorcycle slammed head-on into an oncoming car and the cycle's driver was  killed, though police did not say whether a gunshot or the accident caused the  death. The motorcycle passenger was critically injured and two people in the  car were hurt.  </P> <P> The incident happened at 5:45 p.m. The street immediately grew tense. A woman,  identified by police as the dead man's mother, began to wail.  </P> <P> As the two men were being removed from the scene, officers and news crews were  attacked with rocks and bottles.  </P> <P> The entire Miami Police Department quickly was mobilized, and state troopers  were put on alert. Officers entered the area in full riot gear.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Everyone Soothed  </P> <P> Mayor Xavier Suarez tried to calm people, walking amid the crowd. "I'm going to  check into it; I guarantee it," the mayor promised.  </P> <P> Not everyone was soothed. Many witnesses claimed that the shooting of the black  men on the motorcycle was unnecessary.  </P> <P> Soon after, sniper fire began and stores were looted. Three cars, including two  belonging to television stations, were burned.  </P> <P> "We've had several officers hit with rocks and bottles, and some incidents have  spread out of the original area," police spokesman Sgt. Michael Mazur said.  </P> <P> A 3-square mile area of the city was cordoned off. Some blocks in Overtown were  evacuated. Expressway exits near the neighborhood were closed.  </P> <P> Toward midnight, blazes were still being set. About 150 people wandered the  streets. Snipers prevented firefighters from putting out the flames at an auto  parts store, police said.  </P> <P> Onlookers cluttered the emergency lanes along major expressways, staring down  from the elevated highways at people setting fires and tossing bottles.  </P> <P> It was a dreary end to a day when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday was  celebrated. And it was a bleak way to begin Super Bowl Week, when Miami is  trying to put on its best face as a sunny resort.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bengals Staying Nearby  </P> <P> Overtown borders downtown Miami and it is only half a mile from the Omni Hotel,  where the Cincinnati Bengals are staying. The upper floors provided clear views  of the fires nearby. Joe Robbie Stadium, the site of Sunday's Super Bowl XXIII,  is about 15 miles away.  </P> <P> The same Overtown neighborhood was the site of burning and looting in 1982,  after a 21-year-old black man was fatally shot in an arcade by a Latino  policeman.  </P> <P> In 1980, racial violence in the city's Liberty City area left 18 people dead.  That riot occurred after an all-white jury acquitted four police officers in  the beating death of a black insurance agent, Arthur McDuffie.  </P> <P> McDuffie too was chased by police while he was riding his motorcycle. Monday's  incident, like more than a dozen in past years, will renew questions about  whether the Miami police are too prone to use force against black suspects.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES BOND, 89; ORNITHOLOGIST'S NAME MADE FAMOUS IN FICTION  </P> <P> A world-famous ornithologist, whose name became synonymous with secret agentry  because of a chance literary encounter with Ian Fleming, has died.  </P> <P> The real James Bond, unlike his fictional counterpart, lived 89 peaceful years  before dying of the complications of age Tuesday at a hospital in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Bond, former curator of ornithology at the Academy of Natural Sciences, was the  leading authority on birds of the West Indies for more than half a century and  is best known for proving that birds of the Caribbean originated in North  America, not South America.  </P> <P> In recognition of this discovery, the geographic line dividing Caribbean birds  of North American ancestry from those of South American origins has been called  "Bond's Line."  </P> <P> But his name was to become a household synonym for intrigue after World War II  because Fleming was reading his book, "Birds of the West Indies," while writing  at his home in Jamaica.  </P> <P> Fleming, an avid bird watcher, adopted the ornithologist's name for the dashing  character since portrayed in movies by Sean Connery, Roger Moore and other  actors.  </P> <P> "It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine  name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born," Fleming  wrote years later to Bond's wife, Mary.  </P> <P> "In return I can only offer you or James Bond unlimited use of the name Ian  Fleming for any purposes you may think fit," he wrote. "Perhaps one day your  husband will discover a particularly horrible species of bird which he would  like to christen in an insulting fashion by calling it Ian Fleming."  </P></p>

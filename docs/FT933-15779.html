			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Colefax &amp; Fowler Pounds 395,000 in red and dividend cut to 1p COLEFAX &amp; Fowler, the wallpaper and furnishings fabrics manufacturing group, finished the year to April 30 with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 395,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 704,000. The result included an exchange gain of Pounds 418,000. Losses per share came to 1.05p (earnings 3.7p), after a tax credit. Following a cut of 0.8p in the interim dividend, the final dividend is similarly reduced to 0.5p for a total of 1p (2.6p). Mr David Green, chairman, said the decorating division's results were affected through the weakness of the dollar, leading to a delaying of projects by American clients, while the current UK economy had a similar effect on UK clients in relation to decorating projects and sales of antiques. He said current trading in the US was slightly improved; in the UK and rest of Europe conditions continued to be difficult.</p>

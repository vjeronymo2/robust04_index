			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DAYTON HUDSON RESTORES PLANNED PARENTHOOD GIFT  </P> <P> The Dayton Hudson Foundation on Thursday reversed an earlier decision and  approved an $18,000 grant for a community education program of Planned  Parenthood of Minnesota.  </P> <P> Planned Parenthood will allocate the foundation's contribution to a restricted  public education fund and, at Dayton Hudson's request, will add a separate line  item sub-category for the program in its audit, the foundation said at a news  conference.  </P> <P> Cynthia Mayeda, Dayton Hudson Foundation chair, said neither the Dayton Hudson  Corp. nor its foundation is taking a position on abortion rights with  Thursday's decision.  </P> <P> "We have not taken and will not take a position on abortion," she said in a  statement. "Our contributions have never been nor will they be used to finance  abortion services. We are satisfied that we can make this grant without taking  a position on this issue."  </P> <P> The foundation decided last month to end 22 years of financial support of  Planned Parenthood for educational programs intended to prevent teen-age  pregnancy. A Dayton Hudson spokeswoman said then that the move was an attempt  to distance the foundation from the abortion issue.  </P> <P> But about two weeks ago, Dayton said it would reconsider the decision.  </P> <P> The earlier developments prompted protests by pro-choice groups. Some customers  tore up their credit cards and protested outside a Dayton Hudson outlet in  Edina. Women's groups announced plans to boycott Dayton's, Target and other  stores owned by the Minneapolis-based retailer during the Christmas season if  the foundation did not restore funding.  </P> <P> The $18,000 grant is the same amount that the foundation contributed last year.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FACTORY USE RATE DROPS TO 84.3%  </P> <P> The operating rate at U.S. factories, mines and utilities eased in February to  84.3% of capacity, the first decline since last September, the government  reported today.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve Board said February's operating rate dropped 0.2 percentage  point from January's 84.5% level, a point that had not been surpassed in nearly  a decade.  </P> <P> The closer factories get to full capacity, the greater the fear they will have  trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price  increases. The Fed for a year has been nudging up interest rates in an effort  to slow economic growth and thus restrain inflation.  </P></p>

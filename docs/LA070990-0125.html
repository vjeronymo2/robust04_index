			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> WEBB RETURNING TO VOLUNTEERS  </P> <P> Tennessee tailback Chuck Webb, who was suspended for the spring semester for  allegedly cheating on an exam, has regained his academic eligibility to play  football for the Volunteers this fall, a university official said today.  </P> <P> "He's in good shape," said Phil Scheurer, university vice chancellor of student  affairs who suspended Webb in January.  </P> <P> Webb, who rushed for 1,236 yards as a redshirt freshman last season and was  most valuable player in Tennessee's Cotton Bowl victory over Arkansas, was  suspended Jan. 8.  </P> <P> NCAA rules stipulate a student-athlete must pass an average of 24 units  annually to be eligible to play football.  </P> <P> Scheurer said Webb received only three units of credit in the fall 1989  semester before his suspension. Scheurer said Webb took correspondence courses  in the spring and summer to fulfill the academic requirement.  </P></p>

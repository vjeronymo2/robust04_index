			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Arts: The season of turkey leftovers - Cinema ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS (PG) Mel Brooks CINEMA PARADISO: THE SPECIAL EDITION (PG) Giuseppe Tornatore KING OF THE HILL (12) Steven Soderbergh DESPERATE REMEDIES (15) Stewart Main and Peter Wells This is a time of year that begins with great questions of life, death and religion and ends with an entire hungover hemisphere clutching onto trivia. By Boxing Day, the Western world's enquiring mind has usually slid from 'What does Christ's birth mean to us?' via 'Is commerce spoiling Christmas?' to that final all-parties SOS: 'What do we do with the turkey leftovers?'. Sprinkle it with metaphor, though, and even that last question can provide food for thought: especially for the world's movie division. What do directors do with all the stuff they cannot find room for in a movie's Version I? Sometimes, as in Cinema Paradiso: The Special Edition, it is used as re-launch material. The studio cellars are swept for missing footage; once-plucked scenes, even whole subplots, are grafted back on; and lo] an arthouse favourite is back in bigger, perhaps better, form. Then again - worst news first - there are films that consist entirely of turkey leftovers: unimproved and unreconstructed. Mel Brooks's Robin Hood: Men in Tights is a scarce-warmed-over spoof on the Sherwood Forest movies that came and went two years ago. This is a long time between source material and mickey-take - two years hence do we get Christopher Columbus: Crackpot in Codpiece? - but it is just one lateness among many. What dismays is that time and fashion continue their erosion of Brooks's talent to surprise and outrage. Yet even after Spaceballs and Life Stinks he is still hitting us with the same old jokes like a jester who has lost control of his bladder. We end on a gag about black sheriffs (see Blazing Saddles). We begin with a whole lot of gags about movie-making (see Blazing Saddles): from the Saxon villagers complaining that their cottages are torched whenever a new Robin Hood film is made to the white-lettered 'England' sign perched 'Hollywood'-style on the cliffs. And in between we feel like starved house-guests being led through a larder full of mouldy offcuts, gnawed bones and corn-fed funny names. There is Will Scarlet O'Hara, Rabbi Tuckman (Brooks), the Sheriff of Rottingham and Marion of Bagel, named to match Robin of Locksley. (Lox? Bagel? Get it?) As for Robin's black friend from the crusades, guess what everyone says whenever the name Ah Choo is pronounced. Let us be quick and merciful. I liked two jokes, maybe three: the horse-lock, the brink-of-battle exchange between Robin and his Merry Men ('Are you with me, yea or nay?'; 'Which one means yes?') and Dom DeLuise's turn as a Brando-style Mafia godfather. And let us pat Cary Elwes's Robin on the back for looking handsome and heroic and seeming gamely unembarrassed by the jokes. If Robin Hood: Men in Tights is a turkey pre-dismembered by its own director, Cinema Paradiso: The Special Edition is a nobler-looking bird, but not without its own odd history of dissection. It seems fresh and all-of-a-piece now; but we know that once-missing bits have been stuck back on while we were not looking. You recall the plot. Young Toto grows up in Southern Italian village; falls in love with movies and befriends old projectionist (Philippe Noiret); gets to be played by three different actors (Salvatore Cascio, Mario Leonardi, Jacques Perrin). The film's first version, we now learn, dumped an entire romantic coda in which greyhaired Perrin re-meets the lost girl of his dreams, now grown into actress Brigitte Fossey. Restored, these scenes plump the film out to 2 3/4 hours, inject some emotion into the hitherto stick-like Perrin (he could do with still more) and makes the story in all senses 'grow up'. If the earlier film was a retarded, runaway charmer that never recovered from the disappearance of Toto 1 - chipmunk-faced scene-stealer Master Cascio - the new film dares to bring in subjects like Sex, Age and Disenchantment. Indeed the restoration of two hitherto excised love-making scenes adds a whopping irony to the whole Cinema Paradiso history. The first movie, you recall, made rude noises about Catholic censorship in the character of a priest who insisted on removing all kissing scenes from the films shown in the village. The film's pay-off was that old Noiret had collected them, spliced them together and saved them as a deathbed gift for the grown-up Toto. Now we learn that Cinema Paradiso 1 was itself 'unsexed': if not through Catholic prudishness, then through a sentimental desire not to let Toto be seen losing his innocence. The new version allows the middle Toto (Leonardi) to wrestle with the agonies/ecstasies of adolescence, from deflowerment on the cinema floor (with the village's ageing goodtime lady) to a touchingly surreal chat session with the image of his beloved, her face caught on his movie-camera and projected on his bedroom wall. An opening title-crawl lists the startling number of prizes this movie has won. It also came top in a British newspaper's recent poll of the Ten Best Films since 1980. But now we have two Cinema Paradisos, so what will future polls make of that? The two movies, far from being pocket- and family-size versions of the same drama, seem like two different creations. Both are good, but Cinema Paradiso 2 looks more like the masterpiece for the history-books. If you wore a blindfold through the credits of King of the Hill (opening next week), you would swear on removing it that you were watching a film directed by Robert Redford. Here is a young Depression kid (Jesse Bradford) growing up in St Louis, amid images washed in radical humanism with a cupful of 'Nostalgia' fabric-softener throw in. One almost hears the director's voice. 'Actors in their places] Insert golden lens-filters] Action]' Actually the director is Steven Soderbergh, whose career took off with the prize-winning sex, lies and videotapes and then nosedived with the unreleased Kafka which almost no one has seen. (I have seen it and can confirm its strange bastard identity: part Gothic thriller, part existential whimsy, part film crew's holiday in Prague.) King of the Hill is clearly Soderbergh's bid to get his career flying again. But it bellyflopped on take-off in America and we see why. Too anxious to please, too cutie-pie-elegiac, it resembles Billy Bathgate without the gangsters, or possibly A River Runs Through It without the river. Drawn from the memoirs of AE Hotchner, quondam Hemingway crony, it provides the peeling boarding house, the feckless inventor Dad (Jeroen Krabbe), the long-suffering asylum-bound Mom (Lisa Eichhorn), the mocking dog-day afternoons of the 1930s, and the boy-hero who scampers about town using his wits to bamboozle and breadwin. No turkey leftovers on screen here; nothing so luxurious. Culinary tips range from stolen hot dogs to tomato soup made from mixing ketchup with hot water. But we never feel all this poverty. Suffering so pretty, sacrifice so gift-wrapped, down-and-out supporting characters so cocky and colourful - with a Depression like this why did that spoilsport Mr Roosevelt come in with a New Deal? Also bowing in British cinemas next week is Desperate Remedies. Order the video now. The big screen is too big for this studio-bound, one-joke mockudrama, in which two New Zealand directors, Stewart Main and Peter Wells, take the cliches of romantic fiction and try to flog them to the finishing post. But just like the joke 'horse' ridden by the streaming-haired heroine - a wooden stand-in nag - the film makes a feint of galloping comically along but never really seems to leave the starting post. There are swirling fog-wreathed sets, a handsome hunk of a hero (Kevin Smith) and much campy dialogue ('We are all strangers in this land called love'). But the wit never keeps up with the invocations. Pity. A lovely target - all that effulgent costume twaddle from Gainsborough movies to Cartland novels - still waits to receive its well-aimed arrows.</p>

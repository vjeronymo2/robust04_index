			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Low oil prices hit N Sea exploration LOW OIL prices forced significant cuts in exploration activity by North Sea oil and gas producers last year, according to a report by Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh brokers. North Sea operators drilled only 116 exploration and appraisal wells last year, compared with over 170 in 1991, as persistently low oil prices and an adverse exchange rate - world oil trade is priced in dollars - forced them to cut capital expenditure. The brokerage group expects low levels of exploration to continue this year and estimates that about 120 wells will be drilled. Exploration budgets are one of the first expenditures to be trimmed when companies experience hard times, and oil prices were at a 20-year low in real terms last year, with an average sterling price of Pounds 11 a barrel. At the same time, development spending on existing fields rose significantly. That will prove positive over the longer term because money spent on developing newly discovered fields will generate more revenue in the next five years as production rises. Producers' cashflow was low in 1992 at Pounds 800m compared with an average of Pounds 2.5bn over the previous five years, largely as a result of the increasing development spending. Cashflow calculated by Wood Mackenzie is an estimate of companies' total revenues in the North Sea minus exploration and development costs and taxation. Oil production reached a three-year high of 1.9m barrels a day (b/d) last year and Wood Mackenzie sees further growth over the next five years. Gas production last year dropped slightly to 4,859bn cu ft a day compared with 5,100bn in 1991. The bulk of new investment in the North Sea will be in developing gas fields, and offshore operators estimate that two thirds of the industry's investment will be spent on gas by the end of the decade. Wood Mackenzie also points out that the level of mergers and acquisitions among North Sea operators dropped sharply last year to Pounds 174m from Pounds 1.8bn in 1991, again reflecting cash constraints.</p>

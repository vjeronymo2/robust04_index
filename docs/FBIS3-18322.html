According to a spokesman of the Development  Ministry, this was made clear by Bonn Development Minister  Carl-Dieter Stranger (Christian Social Union) during a meeting  with Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov in Bonn on  Tuesday [1 March]. Spranger called on the government in Baku to  embark upon a course of democratic reforms.    Hasanov was, however, not able to talk to his host, FRG  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. The negotiations about European  Union membership in Brussels forced Kinkel to cancel all his  foreign policy appointments on Tuesday at short notice.  Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross, who paid a first visit  to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, also had to do without the planned  meeting in the Foreign Ministry.</p>

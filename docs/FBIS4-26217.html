			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 11 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- China's  General Administration of Customs recently promulgated the new  anticorruption regulations for customs, stipulating that customs  personnel are not allowed to claim reimbursements on their  private expenses from their working units; nor to use their  official functions to seek favorable treatment and conveniences  for the businesses run by their spouses, children, relatives,  and friends in the import and export of goods beyond the limits  of the established policies; not to engage in go-between  business activities.    The General Administration of Customs promulgated the  Customs  Anticorruption Regulations in 1990, and the Regulations on  Certain Concrete Issues Concerning Personal Relations Between  Customs Personnel and People With Whom They Have Work  Connections, in 1991. The General Administration of Customs also  recently made certain amendments to these two sets of  regulations.    The revised regulations maintain most of their original  provisions. The new anticorruption requirements laid down last  year also were officially written into the regulations. The  customs are not allowed to run business enterprises, except for  those providing logistics and technological support; nor to seek  patronage from the institutions with which they have work  relations; nor to participate in costly recreational activities  specially arranged for customs personnel by the institutions  with which they have work relations; nor to intervene in the law  enforcement process by interceding for people involved in  customs investigation cases.</p>

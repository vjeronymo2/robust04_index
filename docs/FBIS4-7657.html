He was accompanied by representatives of 15  Bulgarian companies. The delegation negotiated on cooperation  in the extraction of mineral resources, in transport and trade.  They had talks with high-ranking government officials and heads  of leading companies, Mr. Karabashev told reporters. It is  unnatural not to use trade diplomacy to achieve some results in  coutries holding key positions is eastern Asia, he said.    The chairman of the Geology and Mineral Resources Committee,  Mr. Antony Panayotov, discussed the introduction of new  technologies in gold and copper ore mining. He familiarized  Australian companies with the possibilities to participate in  auctions of oil prospecting blocks in the Black Sea shelf.  Australian businessmen were interested in possible cooperation  in the sphere of transport and in leasing planes of the Balkan  air carrier.    This year the largest quantities of imported raw sugar are  likely to come from Australia, said Mr. Valentin Karabashev.    Draft agreements on the avoidance of double taxation and  mutual protection of investments were presented to the  Australian government three months ago. According to the deputy  prime minister, they will be signed in the near future. An  agreement on the avoidance of double taxation has already been  signed with Indonesia, now another step will be made towards  free trade between the two countries. Interest towards the  Bulgarian delegation was unexpectedly lively. "We might  possibly start importing rubber directly from Indonesia, without  the mediation of Singaporean companies," Mr. Karabashev pointed  out.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 18:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Given the high levels of cowbird nest parasitism and habitat loss, it may already be too late to save the vireo even if habitat is preserved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The stability or instability of populations is not one of the criteria used to determine the appropriateness of designating critical habitat. The Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat for a listed species in areas that are essential to the conservation of the species, unless it is not prudent to do so. The Act would require the designation of critical habitat even if little could be done to minimize most threats facing the species. Fortunately, however, the vireo has responded favorably to management in a number of locations throughout its range. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that the designation of critical habitat will provide additional protection to the vireo and increase the likelihood of its recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 19:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain areas should not be designated as critical habitat because they do not ``*&blank;*&blank;* require special management considerations or protections,'' as prescribed by section 3(5)(A)(i)(II) of the Act. This comment was usually followed by a belief about which type of regulations already provide ``special management considerations or protections.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service should not designate critical habitat because other regulations and levels of government already protect the habitat sufficiently. For example, local and/or State governments can manage habitat and prevent private landowners from clearing riparian vegetation. Projects altering a stream course are subject to review under section 1601 or 1603 of the California Fish and Game Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal regulations also protect proposed critical habitat. Designation of critical habitat is not necessary for areas in which activities are planned that will require National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and compliance. Nor is it necessary to designate critical habitat on the Santa Ynez River because this area is already protected under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service. All these regulations and management practices preclude the need for designating critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Local governments have not prevented habitat loss for the least Bell's vireo under existing regulatory mechanisms. Areas under Federal jurisdiction may require special management considerations or protection that would not be afforded without critical habitat designation. For these reasons, the Service believes that inclusion of areas already subject to local, State, or Federal regulations is consistent with the definition of critical habitat cited under section 3(5)(A)(i)(II) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 20:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Critical habitat designation in the Prado Basin of the Santa Ana River would force the Corps of Engineers to release storm water quickly (to minimize the adverse effects of standing water on vireo habitat) and at too great a velocity for the local water district to divert it into their percolation (spreading) basins for water conservation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has been working with the Corps of Engineers, Orange County Water District, and The Nature Conservancy to resolve conflicts between vireo conservation and flood control/water conservation activities in the Prado Basin. Based on the distribution and abundance of the vireo within the Prado Basin relative to the reservoir pool inundation zone, these water management activities may affect a listed species. On that basis, the Corps initiated formal consultation with the Service on October 16, 1992. The Corps has included a thorough compensation package as part of the project description. The proposed compensation measures very likely adequately provide for impacts to the vireo and its habitat. For this reason, the Service believes that a critical habitat designation is not likely to impose any additional costs for avoiding, minimizing, or mitigating impacts to the vireo.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 21:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The cost of mitigation as a result of critical habitat designation would place an unreasonable financial risk on the project proponent. For example, one commenter estimated it would cost about $4&hyph;10 million to create habitat to compensate for the habitat that would be destroyed by raising the height of Gibraltar Dam. Since riparian habitat creation is expensive and the results are unpredictable, the project proponents may spend a great deal of money with no return if the mitigation program should fail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in the response to Issue 12 above, designation of critical habitat could, in a few cases, require prior habitat replacement of applicants for projects in areas that contain suitable, but unoccupied, vireo habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) proposed today to continue  consultations with the United States over the establishment of a  new peace safeguard system on the Korean peninsula.    The new system is intended to prevent the increase of  military forces and a reoccurrence of war in the region so as to  guarantee peace and security.    DPRK's Deputy Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong said at a press  conference here that recently the United States, in defiance of  the armistice agreement of Korea, has continuously increased its  military presence and massed troops on the Korean peninsula and  in surrounding areas.    "This has actually turned the armistice agreement into empty  words that cannot guarantee peace on the peninsula and the  Korean Military Armistice Commission exists in name only," he  said.    Song stressed that in order to eliminate the hostility  between the United States and the DPRK, to realize  reconciliation and guarantee genuine peace and security on the  peninsula, the armistice agreement should be turned into a peace  agreement and a new peace safeguard system be established to  replace the armistice institution.    In reply to questions from reporters, Song said that before  the DPRK and the United States reach agreement on establishing  the new peace safeguard system, the dprk would continue to  faithfully abide by the armistice agreement.    But he said the DPRK would not deal with the United Nations  forces who were a party to signing the armistice agreement, but  would prefer to continue dealing with the United States.    Song appealed to the United States to respond to the DPRK's  proposal and hold consultations with it on establishing the new  peace safeguard system to ease the tension on the Korean  peninsula.</p>

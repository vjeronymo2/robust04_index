			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The post-phaseout procedures for granting destruction and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation credits.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the Fourth Meeting of the Protocol Parties in Copenhagen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1992, in Decision IV/24, the Parties agreed to urge ``all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practicable measures to prevent releases of controlled substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the atmosphere.'' In accordance with this Decision, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wishes to continue encouraging destruction and transformation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances after the phaseout begins January 1, 1996,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially for those controlled substances that were produced or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported for intended emissive uses. EPA believes a system of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentives can be devised to foster destruction or transformation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ozone-depleting substances in order to prevent their emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the atmosphere.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this action, EPA proposes a system of incentives to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourage destruction or transformation after the accelerated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phaseout dates by offering credits for the destruction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation of controlled substances. These credits would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to produce or import an amount of controlled substance. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency believes a system of incentives to encourage destruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or transformation of controlled substances after the phaseout is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an important mechanism to deter individuals from releasing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unneeded controlled substance to the atmosphere.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed below, EPA believes that Decision IV/24 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parties to the Protocol urging measures to prevent the release of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unneeded controlled substances to the atmosphere and the Protocol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of production provide the basis to devise incentives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for destruction or transformation after the accelerated phaseout  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and until the interim and final phaseout dates set forth in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Protocol defines production as the ``amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances produced, minus the amount destroyed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies to be approved by the Parties and minus the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entirely used as feedstock in the manufacture of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals.'' Under the Protocol, Parties may continue to produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances after they are phased out as long as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the controlled substance produced is offset in each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control period by the same amount that is transformed <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroyed by an approved technology. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  The Protocol definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of production indicates that an amount of controlled substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced and the same amount destroyed or transformed would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balance in a calculation of atmospheric loading and result in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net environmental impact of zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the current regulation, transformation is defined as the amount entirely used as feedstock (except for trace quantities) in the manufacture of other chemicals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> To date, Parties have approved five technologies for destruction (Decision IV/11) which are listed in the definition or ``destruction'' under &sect;82.3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the definition of production in the Protocol would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit continued production beyond the phaseout as long as such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production was offset by transformation or destruction, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of production under the Clean Air Act Amendments is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinct and does not permit such offsetting. The CAA defines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``produce,'' ``produced'' and ``production'' as the ``manufacture of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance from any raw material or feedstock chemical,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but such terms do not include (A) the manufacture of a substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is used and entirely consumed (except for trace quantities)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the manufacture of other chemicals, or (B) the reuse or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recycling of a substance.'' Under the CAA definition, once  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production of a controlled substance is phased-out, it may no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer be produced for emissive purposes because there are no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions, as in the Protocol's definition, to permit that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued production be offset by destruction or transformation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to CAA section 614, in the case of conflict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between any provision of the CAA and the Montreal Protocol, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more stringent provision shall govern. Because the CAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of production is more stringent than that of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protocol, the definition of production under the CAA shall apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the phaseout dates under the CAA take effect. Section 604  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the CAA sets interim reductions and final phaseout dates for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed class I substances. The class I substances listed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CAA must be phased out by the year 2000, except for methyl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chloroform which must be phased out by the year 2002. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, under the terms of the CAA, methyl bromide must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phased out by 2001. Section 604 also includes interim reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the listed class I substances as outlined in Table I below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In today's rule, EPA proposes to authorize the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction/transformation credits until the respective dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the terms of the CAA become more stringent than those of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protocol (2000 for most class I controlled substances, 2001 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methyl bromide, and 2002 for methyl chloroform). For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the terms of the Protocol, CFC&hyph;12 must be phased out by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996, but production may be continued as long as it is offset by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either transformation or destruction. However, the CAA requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that in 1996, the maximum allowable production of CFC&hyph;12 be no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than 40 percent of the quantity produced in the baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. From 1995 until 1999, the CAA requires that the maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable production of CFC&hyph;12 be no more than 15 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity produced in the baseline year, and in the year 2000, no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFC&hyph;12 may be produced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposal permits the use of destruction and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation credits, but does not permit continued production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond the maximum allowable limits set forth in the CAA. Thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the example above, for 1996, individuals may use destruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or transformation credits, but in no case may CFC&hyph;12 be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced for emissive purposes beyond 40 percent of the quantity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced in the baseline year. To comply with the 1996 phaseout  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date and definition of production under the Protocol, production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this amount of CFC&hyph;12 must be offset by the amount transformed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or destroyed. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Limits are being proposed in today's action for production after 1996 regarding destruction and transformation credits, essential-use allowances (to be discussed in the next section of the preamble) and Article 5 allowances (discussed in section C.1. ``Changes in Requirements for Export to Article 5 Countries'' of the preamble.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / ICI comes to grips with the tax tangle: UK chemicals group looks set to clear one obstacle to itssuccessful demerger A weighty document lies on the desk of Mr Colin Short, finance director of Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK chemicals group. 'Project Mortar. Legal steps analysis. Company secret', which runs to several hundred pages, details arrangements over the next few months for the demerger of ICI's pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and speciality chemicals businesses. It is the masterplan for untangling the tax implications of the demerger. While the rationale behind unscrambling a group of nearly 500 subsidiaries created over more than 65 years may have been business strategy, the key question determining whether the plans will proceed is if the group can escape substantially higher taxes. 'The tax aspects were the major things we needed to clarify before we could feel comfortable that we could succeed,' says Mr Short. 'After 65 years of history there was clearly a very complex tax structure. The question was whether we could come up with a route to demerge without horrendous tax implications.' That risk has been substantially reduced now that ICI has received 'pre-clearance' from the Inland Revenue in the UK and strong favourable indications from ICI's US legal advisers. At stake were three issues. First, whether the demerger was allowable under demerger tax provisions. Second, whether the planned issue of shares in ICI Bioscience, the drugs and pharmaceuticals side, would give rise to extra Advance Corporation Tax (ACT) - the tax paid on dividends - as the issue is technically a distribution to shareholders. Third, whether the distribution would result in a taxable capital gain for shareholders. Mr Short said the indications from Inland Revenue were 'yes', 'no' and 'no' to the three questions, leaving the demerger broadly tax neutral. Nevertheless, ACT will be an increasing problem for ICI, as a growing proportion - currently more than 80 per cent - of its profits comes from overseas and there are smaller UK profits against which to offset the tax. The IRS does not grant pre-clearance in the same way as the Inland Revenue, but Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, ICI's US legal adviser, has issued a 'strong opinion' suggesting the IRS will approve the scheme. Details of the steps to be followed by the ICI operations in all 150 countries in which it operates, from Angola to Zimbabwe, were circulated at the end of last week. Staff will prepare plans for submission to their tax authorities during September, with the aim of gaining initial approval before Christmas. Meanwhile, ICI has other hurdles to overcome, says Mr Short. The group is negotiating with the pension trustees about splitting the present scheme into two. Legal agreements also have to be concluded to allow the new groups to share 15 sites in the UK. And works councils in Germany and the Netherlands will have to agree the demerger. Once the demerger is completed, ICI Bio will make a rights issue next April or May. Its size will depend on the allocation of debt between the two groups at the time of the demerger, says Mr Short. The allocation itself will partly depend on the timing of the swap of ICI's nylon business for Du Pont's acrylics operations. ICI will receive about Pounds 250m cash if and when the deal is concluded. Mr Short says both ICI Bio and the new ICI will want to use cash to take advantage of growth opportunities. After the issue, ICI Bio would have the freedom to take stakes in biotechnology companies and issue paper to pay for acquisitions or a merger. As for the new ICI, its paints operations need to expand on the continent and Asia, says Mr Short. The group will also want to expand the pure terephthalic acid business in which the company has a commanding position and proprietary technology. Meanwhile Mr Short is setting new targets for return on capital. He sees more disposals in industrial chemicals. 'We need to focus our industrial chemicals in Europe, North America, including Mexico and Canada, and the Far East. That excludes certain parts of the world. South American, India, Pakistan, Australia will have to wash their faces. If they generate cash, fine. If not we will have to consider getting rid of them.'</p>

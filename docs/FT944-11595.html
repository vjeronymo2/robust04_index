			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Nigerian appeal court grants bail to Abiola Nigeria's court of appeal yesterday granted unconditional bail to Mr Moshood Abiola, the winner of last year's annulled presidential election, who has been detained by the military regime on charges of treason for declaring himself president in June. The ruling offers an unexpected release for Mr Abiola until the resumption of a trial which has been stalled since September. 'I am optimistic that he is going to be released and we are expecting him home very soon,' his wife, Mrs Kudirat Abiola, said in Lagos yesterday. 'The ruling shows that we can still have faith in the judiciary.' Mr Abiola's doctor met officials from Gen Sani Abacha's government in Abuja, where he is being held, to discuss his release, which could allow him to travel to Europe for medical treatment, Mrs Abiola said . Although the appeal court ruling appears to be a reverse for the government, the decision may provide a convenient way out of political deadlock for both sides. Since the government saw off a strike by the powerful oil workers' union two months ago, the pro-democracy movement has collapsed, even in Mr Abiola's native south-west, leaving him in jail and without support. A freed Mr Abiola inside Nigeria would be an embarrassment to the military, but they would be less concerned if he were abroad. According to the Nigerian medical association, Mr Abiola suffers from chronic high blood pressure and has suffered a back injury in jail and needs to be released for treatment. 'His health has been deteriorating. The treatment which he needs is not available in Nigeria,' Mrs Abiola said. 'He will have to go abroad. We have a list of hospitals in Europe and I am sure that the government will allow him to travel.' In August Mr Abiola refused bail that was offered on condition that he avoided any political activity. The appeal court did not impose conditions for Mr Abiola's bail but advised him against causing any civil disturbance while out.</p>

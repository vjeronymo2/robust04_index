However a nil tax charge, against Pounds 100,000, left earnings per share at 6.89p, compared with 4.26p. The company is awaiting the outcome of an appeal against a planning decision before making a recommendation on the final dividend for the previous year when a second interim of 0.5p was paid. A nominal interim of 0.5p is being paid for the period under review.</p>

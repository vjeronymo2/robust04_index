"Everything went well," Berlusconi told the press after a  dinner in Clinton's honour this evening. "We have created a  warm human relationship with Clinton and his wife."    Equally pleased at this evening's function was Gianfranco  Fini, secretary of the National Alliance, who said that there  was no echo of foreign press concern over the presence of his  party in the governing coalition. National Alliance was born  out of the Italian Social Movement, the political heir to the  Fascist Party.    According to Fini, Clinton shook hands with the National  Alliance leader and showed no reserve at all, "not even in the  words he spoke when Berlusconi introduced me to him. Of course  he knew perfectly well who all the people present were, and he  was cordial with them all in exactly the same way."    "To me, Clinton seemed perfectly at ease," Fini added. "If I  had to say in a word what did not emerge either this evening or  this afternoon on the Capitoline, I would say it was  embarrassment. There was everything but embarrassment."    Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, who replaced Northern  League leader Umberto Bossi at tonight's dinner, explained  Bossi's absence saying that the party chief had an appointment  with his supporters which took precedence over a formal  engagement.    Also present this evening was Left Democrat Party Secretary  Achille Occhetto who said "I am happy to have met Clinton, who  is one of the most dynamic and human politicians around. He is  a brave man."</p>

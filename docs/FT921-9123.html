			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Leading Article: The bill for Maastricht FIVE-YEAR plans, despite communism's demise, have their uses. In 1988 the European Community agreed its very first five-year deal on overall EC funding and spending, which allowed the Community to get on with its revolutionary plan for a single market. Yesterday, the European Commission came up with its second five-year plan. It has much to commend it. But it cannot be accepted as it stands, even though the need for the Community to settle its financial future over the next few years is self-evident. Brussels is calling for total spending to rise, in real terms, by a third, to Ecu88bn by 1997. Money to the EC's four poorest states would be doubled over the next five years, as it has been over the last five. The Commission wants a further real increase of 100 per cent in resources to meet the EC's growing external responsibilities. Less costly in terms of new money, but more controversial in terms of policy, is Brussels's plan to gear EC research and training funds more to companies' needs. Many member states will object to such a steep increase in the EC budget, especially in difficult economic times. But poorer EC countries are demanding more cash from Brussels to help them converge with the richer in the run-up to economic and monetary union. Spain has more or less threatened not to ratify the Maastricht treaty, unless it gets more. Power ambitions Apart from farm spending, the greatest strain on the EC budget in recent years has come from outside - the Gulf war, the plight of Kurdish refugees, and changes in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Maastricht confirmed the Community's great power ambitions. But power brings responsibilities. If the Twelve are going henceforth to co-ordinate their foreign policies, it is logical that they should also increasingly pool their foreign aid. The proposed increases in spending can be justified, therefore, but only if spending as a whole is brought securely under control. Reform of farm policy is a sine quo non. In its absence, the budget proposal should be rejected. Lop-sided nature At least as important, are changes in the way revenue is raised. Getting member states to agree this package will be made all the harder by the lop-sided nature of contributions. At present, only Germany, the UK, France and (marginally this year) the Netherlands are net contributors. It is a scandal that the two countries with the highest average incomes - Denmark and Luxembourg  - should be net beneficiaries of the budget, and that Belgium should get more than Portugal. The Commission has tinkered with the system of national contributions, to make it less dependent on food and customs duties and on value added tax (VAT), and more dependent on gross national product. But this will only show up gradually over the next five years. In the meantime, Germany, whose average income has been lowered by unification, is by far the biggest net contributor (Ecu9bn), three times the net amount put in by the next largest contributor, the UK, even after the British rebate. The Commission ruled out a more radical move to a GNP-based system as non-negotiable. But the problem cannot be fudged much longer. Alongside an agreement on a new and larger budget, both farm policy reform and a more equitable system of raising revenue need to be in place.</p>

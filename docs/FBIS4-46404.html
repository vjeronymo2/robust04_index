			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eli Bohadana] </F>   [Excerpt] A few hours ago, terrorists opened fire at the  hothouses of Kfar Darom in the Gaza Strip, but nobody was hurt.  An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] unit arrived on the scene and  opened fire at the terrorists, who fled in two Peugeot 404's.    Last night, the IDF set out in hot pursuit of a Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorist squad into the area of  the autonomy. The three terrorists who opened fire at an IDF  patrol fled in the direction of Rafah. Our forces did not  sustain any casualties. During the pursuit, hundreds of local  inhabitants gathered and threw stones at the soldiers in a bid  to prevent them from catching the perpetrators. According to  Palestinian sources, five local Palestinians were injured by IDF  gunfire during this pursuit. [passage omitted]</p>

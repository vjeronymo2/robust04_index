			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- Commenting on the NATO  air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs besieging Gorazde, the  independent MLADA FRONTA DNES writes, "Although in their extent  and effect they cannot bring the Serbian aggressors to their  knees, they have exceeded the dimensions of the region. They  have become not only the first NATO military operation in Europe  led against ground forces, but above all the first intervention  by Americans on the old continent since the Second World War."    It is too late for Bosnia to return to 1992, when it was  still possible to talk about a state based on the civic  principle, the paper says. "The important thing is, however,  that in Belgrade and Pale they should understand that aggression  cannot be repeated in the future," MLADA FRONTA DNES says.    The left-leaning RUDE PRAVO adds that the United Nations had  made it clear to the Serbs that it was time to stop playing  games. There was nothing else the UN could do if it did not  want to create the impression that there was no way out in  Bosnia. "If Sunday and Monday's events are not to be a mere  belated warning to the Serbs, it seems that the West will become  more deeply involved in Bosnia than ever before," the paper  writes, adding that "there is no other way."    The right-leaning TELEGRAF points out that the first armed  NATO operation in Europe came about due to the uncompromising  position of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] leader in Bosnia,  Michael Rose. "Although the situation was not significantly  safer before the UN units than many times previously, Rose did  not hesitate and after several warnings to the Serbs he asked  the allied air forces for help," the paper says.    The UN and NATO now have to show that the events in Gorazde  are the harbinger of a consistent attitude towards any sort of  expansionist nationalism. "Serbian resistance will be all the  stronger, because the leaders there have become used to the idea  of the Greater Serbia," TELEGRAF concludes.    "Not one step forward has been motivated by the unambiguous  will to reach a clearly defined goal, but by the attempt to  avoid a greater evil," the independent LIDOVE NOVINY writes,  adding that the West is trying to avoid steps which would drag  it further into a conflict over which it would have no control.

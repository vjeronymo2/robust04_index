			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Unions seen to be still significant SEVEN out of 10 British employers in companies with more than 200 employees still negotiate with trade unions, according to the latest Cranfield Price Waterhouse survey of European industrial relations. The figure is surprisingly high, given the recent decline in union membership and influence. British trade unions have lost 3.5m members since 1979 and the proportion of employees in unions has fallen to about 40 per cent. A preliminary report on the survey says the figure puts into perspective 'the much vaunted predictions of the terminal decline, or even death, of the trade union movement (which) seem, to say the least, much exaggerated.' The UK level of seven out of 10 larger employers  - covering both private and public sectors  - recognising unions is average for the 12 European countries covered by the survey. In many of the organisations, though, unions represent a relatively small proportion of staff, and in only four of the 12 countries  - Denmark, Spain, Ireland and Portugal  - do more than half of the organisations report union membership above 50 per cent. The survey, which has been running for three years, is based on questionnaires returned by about 5,500 of the 35,000 organisations contacted. A majority of the respondent organisations report no change in union influence. The overall trend is a small reduction in influence, but some countries, including Germany and Spain, report a marked increase. Industrial relations remain relatively centralised, with policy decisions being made at HQ level in more than 40 per cent of organisations in all countries except France and the UK. A high degree of centralisation is especially evident in southern European countries.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> '87), Public Law 100&hyph;203, enacted on December 22, 1987,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended the Act to incorporate specific provisions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nursing home reform. These provisions included specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised requirements for the survey and certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process (section 4202 for Medicare and section 4212 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid) and for the enforcement process (sections 4203 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4213). Sections 4202 and 4212 of OBRA '87 added new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 1819(g) and 1919(g) to the Act to revise and expand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare and Medicaid provisions, respectively, on State and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal responsibilities for survey and certification, types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of and requirements for surveys, survey team composition and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities, requirements for validation surveys,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for investigating complaints and monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance, disclosure of results of inspections and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities, and provisions for penalties imposed on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States for failure to comply with survey process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. Sections 4203 and 4213 of OBRA '87 added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) to the Act to specify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare and Medicaid enforcement process, respectively, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified remedies for noncompliance to be used in lieu of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or in addition to termination of facilities' participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the programs. Section 411 of the Medicare Catastrophic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), Public Law 100&hyph;360, enacted on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 1, 1988, also included a number of technical and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correcting amendments affecting these OBRA '87 provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These changes will be discussed in detail later in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 28, 1992, we published a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 39278) setting forth our proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for altering the requirements for surveying facilities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanding the choice of alternative remedies for HCFA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Medicaid State agency to apply in lieu of or in addition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to termination of facilities that do not comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation requirements. In the proposed rule we said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that our goal is to promote facility compliance by ensuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that all deficient providers are appropriately sanctioned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Termination is still possible any time a facility is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified as having deficiencies, and if a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continues to have deficiencies after a specified period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, the law requires that Federal payments for services in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that facility cease at that time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule we indicated that we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing the Congress' mandate, as indicated in OBRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> '87, to abandon our traditional hierarchical requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system and develop a system capable of detecting and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responding to noncompliance with any requirement. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system we proposed was built on the assumption that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements must be met and enforced and that requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take on greater or lesser significance as a function of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances and resident outcomes in a particular facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the time of survey. The surveyors will determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence or nonexistence of immediate and serious threat to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents as well as the severity and scope of a deficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to arrive at a conclusion as to the seriousness of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency in that facility. The proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated scope and severity surveyor guides for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the remedy or remedies to apply. We also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed that the selection of a particular remedy be based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the nature of the deficiencies and the remedy (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies) that either HCFA or the Medicaid State agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes is most likely to achieve correction of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies. As we stated in the proposed rule, we believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that remedies applied in the manner described within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations will deter violations as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourage immediate response and sustained compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

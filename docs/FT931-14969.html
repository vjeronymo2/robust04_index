			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Consumers cautious on debt A BREAKDOWN of bank lending to UK residents in the three months to the end of November shows that the rise in loans to individuals was the smallest since the figures were first compiled in 1987. Lending to individuals rose by just 0.6 per cent, or Pounds 0.9bn, reflecting the continuing reluctance of consumers to take on debt. Lending in the quarter to end-August rose Pounds 3bn. Bank of England figures show that industry and commerce increased sterling lending by Pounds 1.3bn in the three months to the end of November compared with a fall of Pounds 1.7bn in the previous three months. Within that, lending to hotels and garages jumped to Pounds 0.6bn from a fall of of Pounds 1bn in the previous quarter. Lending to companies in the hotel and catering business was the highest since the beginning of 1991. Wholesale distribution recorded the strongest increase since 1987.</p>

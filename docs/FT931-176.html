			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Letter: Paris not an example Sir, The oft-repeated assertion that public transport in Paris is all sweetness and light ('Too many bodies spoil the broth', March 29) needs to be questioned. While working there on and off for the past six months, I have had to endure repeated strikes on the Metro and RER, suffer attack by ever-widening sprawls of graffiti and feel a general sense of malaise. Urban railways look wonderful when new but quickly need millions in maintenance. Paris now faces such costs on lines built in the 1970s and 1980s and pay huge operating subsidies as well. Prospects are bleak. London has its problems but many stations now look neat and management is making impressive efforts to cover running costs from revenue.

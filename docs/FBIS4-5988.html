			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Invariable Aggressive Design of Japanese Militarism"--KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 17 (KCNA) -- Japan is trying to  become a military power and expand its sphere of influence and  establish domination over Asia and, furthermore, the rest of the  world with the backing of its military strength, says NODONG  SINMUN in a signed article today.    Noting that the Japanese reactionaries are oblivious of the  historical lessons from the defeat which they suffered while  engaging themselves in the aggression and colonial rule in the  past, and are running along the same road, the article says:    This is clearly manifested, first of all, in their attempt  to  justify the aggressive crimes committed by old Japan.    They allege that their past aggression and war were aimed at  "saving" and "protecting" Asian countries from the "danger of  aggression and subjugation" by some others.    Their remarks mean that they would repeat the aggression and  war of old Japan in the future, too, zecause they are not crimes.    It is a stark historic fact that old Japan enforced a  colonial policy toward Korea. The colonial rule of the Japanese  imperialists over Korea was the most heinous one the like of  which could not be seen in the world. The Japanese  reactionaries' attempt to justify it is an outrageous act and a  mockery of the Korean people.    The militarist ambition of the Japanese reactionary circles  finds its manifestation in their talk about "superiority" of the  "Yamato nation". Now, the Japanese reactionaries are preaching  "self- confidence" and "superiority" of the "Yamato nation" to  instill the idea of overseas expansion and domination over other  nations into the Japanese people.    Their militarist ambition also finds its graphic expression  in the fact that they are trying to expand the self-defensive  right of Japan outside its territory, describing preemptive  attack as an "exercise of Japan' right of self-defence".    Their claim to accomplish the "sacred cause" of the "great  empire of Japan" means to realize their wild ambition of  domination today.    Their much-touted "building of a new Asian order" is also  intended to establish an order of Japan's domination over Asia.    The Japanese reactionaries must renounce the militarist mode  of thinking and attitude.</p>

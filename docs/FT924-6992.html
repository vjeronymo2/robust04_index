			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Instrumenting a policy of growth - The strategy that put Bowthorpe back on a rising profits trend WHEN Bowthorpe announced a 5 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits last month the Sussex-based group, with products ranging from cable ties and heat sinks to black box flight recorders, signalled it was back on the growth track. Last year profits fell by 11 per cent to Pounds 40.3m on turnover of Pounds 220.5m, ending a 15-year unbroken growth record and proving that even with 81 per cent of its business outside the UK, the group was not recession proof. After more cost cutting and restructuring, Mr John Wes- thead, the group's notoriously cautious 64-year-old chief executive, felt confident enough last month to forecast a 'modest improvement' in full year profits. Bowthorpe is one of the relatively few successful, medium sized, international electrical and electronics companies in the UK. But in terms of operating assets its manufacturing base is split between the UK (Pounds 23.1m), continental Europe (Pounds 38.9m), the US (Pounds 22.6m), and the rest of the world (Pounds 13.9m). The company, which was founded in 1936 with Pounds 2,000 of borrowed capital by Jack Bowthorpe, a GEC ledger clerk, has had overseas operations since 1957. It now comprises some 70 operating units in more than 20 countries. Bowthorpe has been guided for the last decade by a down-to-earth business strategy set out by Mr Westhead after he became managing director in 1980, having joined the group the previous year. The linchpin of this strategy has been to acquire and build specialised international niche businesses. These small-to-medium sized operations are run globally by managers who have substantial autonomy, understand their businesses, and are subject to the minimum head office interference. 'With small companies you have to be careful you don't strangle them with financial controls - but you also have to keep an eye on them,' says Mr Westhead. He has no time for fancy management theories and fairly bristles at the mention of concepts like 'matrix management.' The group also uses a refreshingly simple check-list approach towards selecting its acquisitions. Among the criteria targets must have significant barriers to entry, like patents or process know-how, be capable of generating significant economies of scale, but must also be in markets where volumes are unlikely to attract the big multinationals. The group also seeks out businesses which have fairly diverse applications. Even its biggest market, construction, accounts for only 13 per cent of turnover and, perhaps surprisingly, the defence sector represents just 7 per cent One consequence of this strategy is that Bowthorpe faces a different set of competitors in each of its specialised international businesses. These include cable care products such as the ties which hold bundles of wires together, electrical terminals and connectors, thermal electronic components, electronic power supplies and a growing portfolio of electronic instrumentation equipment. In most of these Bowthorpe is either the world leader, or among the top three manufacturers. Latest niche market to be targeted by Bowthorpe is the instrumentation business. The group has been steadily building up a portfolio of companies on both sides of the Atlantic manufacturing products for measuring humidity, microwave and radio frequency radiation, equipment for high-speed data acquisition and appliance testers. As part of this push the group has acquired three companies in the fast growing data acquisition field in the past year, Penny &amp; Giles, the UK-based manufacturer of aircraft flight recorders, and B&amp;D Instruments and Odessa, both based in the US. Applications for data acquisition and measurement products include the growing market for environmental monitoring equipment - Odessa makes the equipment which measures and records pollution emissions from industrial chimney stacks. 'The group has identified the data acquisition market as an area where these companies have leading technology,' says Mr James Heal, an analyst with Hoare Govett in London. He believes that profits from instrumentation companies could bolster the group's compound growth rate by 3 per cent over the next 18 months, and that sales in this area could account for almost 20 per cent of turnover within the five years. However, like other analysts, he also believes that if Bowthorpe's strategy has a weakness, it is that one of its niche operations will grow big enough to attract multinational competitors. Environmental monitoring equipment could be just such a business. The market in the US is being driven by Federal legislation which allows companies to discharge a limited amount of toxins into the atmosphere - or trade their quotas with other companies. The US market for environmental monitoring equipment is expected to grow at a compound rate of 35 per cent between now and the mid 1990s. If Europe was to adopt similar legislation some analysts believe the market could become large enough to attract big multinationals and that might force Bowthorpe to reasses its strategy. More immediately Bowthorpe will benefit from the relative strength of the dollar against sterling. With almost 30 per cent of its Pounds 38.5m operating profits last year coming from the US, Mr Heal estimates that the dollar's strength could add Pounds 3m to 1993 pre-tax profits. On this basis he is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 48m next year, producing earnings per share of 16.3p. This prospect, and a strong balance sheet, has helped lift the share price, which has gained more than 50 per cent in the past three years, to about 275p, close to its peak of 283p recorded earlier this year.  ---------------------------------------           BOWTHORPE HOLDINGS  --------------------------------------- 1991 turnover by markets Total: Pounds 220.5m  ---------------------------------------                              Percent  --------------------------------------- Construction                    13  --------------------------------------- Industrial equipment            12  --------------------------------------- Computers                        9  --------------------------------------- Automotive                       9  --------------------------------------- Power                            8  --------------------------------------- Defence                          7  --------------------------------------- Telecom                          7  --------------------------------------- Switch &amp; control gear            7  --------------------------------------- Medical                          4  --------------------------------------- Leisure                          3  --------------------------------------- Source: Company report  ---------------------------------------</p>

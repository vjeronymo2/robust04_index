			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Kohl warns against Europe poverty gap THE German chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, yesterday said Europe's old political divide must not be replaced with a prosperity gap and called for a new and bold effort to help the continent's poorer eastern and central states, Reuter reports from Helsinki. Mr Kohl told the Nordic Council, a 40-year-old consultative parliamentary group for the five Nordic states, that it was time for the EC to prepare a coherent concept for developing relations with central, eastern and south-eastern Europe. He said he had in mind an updated version of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) which co-ordinated the so-called Marshall Plan aid programme in the aftermath of World War Two. 'Adapted to today's challenge, a similar all-European steering instrument could provide a decisive signal for renewal,' Mr Kohl declared. He said Europe could not shoulder the financial burden alone and called on other industrialised countries such as the US and Japan to contribute. Mr Kohl, guest speaker at a meeting of the Council, said the people of the old East Bloc must be helped through their current economic problems. He said crises in Europe and neighbouring regions showed that it was essential for the 12-nation EC to speak with one voice.</p>

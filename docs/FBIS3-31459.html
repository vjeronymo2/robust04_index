			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The newly elected president of the presidential  council of the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna, Kresimir Zubak,  will head the Bosnian Croat delegation in the next round of  Geneva talks early next month. Members of the negotiating  delegation will be elected by the Chamber of Deputies or some  other body in the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna.    The newly elected president of the Presidential Council of  Herzeg-Bosna informed the deputies about the current situation  at the Geneva peace negotiations. He said that certain new  initiatives on the set-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina had been  presented in Geneva, but added that it was too early to discuss  them. However, the new initiatives refer to the involvement of  the United States into the solving of the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and to NATO's decision to bomb Serb positions  around Sarajevo if the Serbs do not withdraw their weapons.</p>

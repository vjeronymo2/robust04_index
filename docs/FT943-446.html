			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / People: Glaxo replaces Sir Paul with Sir Colin Sir Colin Corness, chairman of building group Redland and of the Nationwide Building Society, is to add to his list of chairmanships that of Glaxo, the pharmaceutical company. Sir Colin, 63 next month, replaces Sir Paul Girolami who retires at the agm on November 18. The changeover will take place on May 17 next year when Sir Colin retires from Redland after 30 years there. Born into a wealthy Scots family, Sir Colin (right) has had a stellar commercial career largely in construction and finance. He is now firmly part of the establishment with among other things, directorships of the Bank of England and of SG Warburg, the merchant bank. He trained as a barrister before joining construction company Taylor Woodrow as a director at the age of 30. Within three years he switched to building materials company Redland, moving through the post of managing director of Redland Tiles in 1967, becoming chairman and chief executive of the whole company from 1977. He built a reputation for innovative energetic management and an ability to pick able associates. His appointment ends a long search by Glaxo for a non-executive chairman to work alongside deputy chairman and chief executive Sir Richard Sykes. Sir Colin's salary, of around Pounds 200,000, is a fraction of the Pounds 1.4m package Sir Paul was paid in his last year as executive chairman.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ferrochrome capacity closed SOUTH AFRICA'S second biggest ferrochrome producer, Consolidated Metallurgical Industries, says it has shut down 40 per cent of its installed capacity in what it hopes is a short-term move, reports Reuter from Johannesburg. Mr David Kovarsky, the chairman, said rise in the South African industry's selling price for the last quarter of 1991 and first quarter 1992 - to 52 US cents a lb from 49 cents - was 'devastating to our ability to sell'. The company, part of Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company, has a total production capacity of 330,000 tonnes a year. CMI did not say what actual production was before the cuts.</p>

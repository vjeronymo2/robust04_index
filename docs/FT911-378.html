			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / How To Spend It: A cut below the rest THERE ARE those who claim that the suit is England's greatest cultural offering. I do not think I would go along with that but certainly the suit is here to stay. If you are a high-profile designer, an actor, a gardener or a cook you may well get through your professional life without ever having to don the basic kit, the trousers, jacket and waistcoat that since Beau Brummell's time have provided a safe and sure uniform in which an Englishman may hide. But if the suit and all it has to say about hard work and power will endure, the bespoke suit shows all the signs of being an endangered species - falling numbers, rarely spotted, barely recognised. There is now a generation of men who have no experience of the bespoke suit at all, who buy their suits and jackets off the peg. The moneyed and design-conscious look to the new high-priests of design, to Armani, Yohji Yamamoto, Commes des Garcons or Jean-Paul Gaultier to make their statements while their less well-heeled contemporaries turn to the likes of Marks &amp; Spencer, Austin Reed, Simpson's and Horne Brothers. Few have been taking the route to Savile Row and as the recession deepens the few are becoming fewer. Lawrence Willcocks of Blades of Savile Row decided that he could not just sit and watch the hard times getting harder - something had to be done. 'The bespoke market needed some radical new thinking and if Savile Row couldn't come up with it it didn't deserve to survive.' What he came up with was a range of six classic suits which he would make to measure for any client for just Pounds 395 including VAT. Given that these days the average price for a bespoke suit in Savile Row is about Pounds 1,250, the value is remarkable. How, I hear you ask, can he do it? One of the answers is by eliminating some of the choices and therefore some of the time involved. There are just six fabrics to choose from - grey pinstripe, blue pinstripe, blue, chalkstripe, grey birdseye and Prince of Wales - and length of lapel, number of vents, size of flap on the pocket and all the other details over which a gentleman used to linger for hours with his tailor have been decided in advance. Any of the six fabrics may be used for any of the six suits and you can mix and match the details - single-or double-breasted, vents and pockets - without paying more. Other changes will cost extra. Several of the many layers of handwork that the traditional made-to-measure suit involved can now be done well - although not so sensitively - by machine. In the old days all the hand-taken measurements were transferred to paper patterns by hand - these days the patterns are cut by computer. All this helps reduce costs. Lawrence Willcocks is the first to admit that his made-to-measure suits are not identical to the Pounds 1,250 models, either his own or anybody else's. 'Those are pure and utter luxuries and are in a class by themselves. Every bit of them is made by hand. What our Pounds 395 suits do offer, though, is a properly fitting suit, made entirely to the measurements of the customer.' In deciding on the six classic business suits Lawrence Willcocks and Paul Keers, author of The Gentleman's Wardrobe and former editor of GQ, put their heads together and refined the choice. Paul Keers feels the very real benefit the option offers is to reduce the available choices. 'After all, chaps who haven't grown up man and boy going to a tailor can find all the decisions to be taken somewhat daunting. 'They are used to seeing what a made-up suit looks on, deciding all the numerous details is actually quite difficult and time-consuming. The suits Lawrence Willcocks and I decided on are all very classic - when it came to the double-breasted chalkstripe, for instance, the fashionable option at the moment is to have four-buttons with the bottom button done up but we decided to opt for the more classic, more long-term six-button version.' Anybody wondering what the suits are actually like can send for a leaflet which explains it in detail and comes with the six swatches of fabric (all 13 oz Super 80's 100 per cent wool worsted) which they can actually feel. For Pounds 395 you have to choose one of the designs exactly as it is - you can ask for different details but they will be extra. Normally the suit will be ready four weeks from the order date but a quicker service of two weeks will be on offer for an extra 10 per cent. For the leaflet write to: Blades of Savile Row, 8 Burlington Gardens, Savile Row, London W1X 1 LG. Tel: 071-734-8911. The classic double-breasted chalkstripe, one of the six made-to-measure business suits Blades is offering for just Pounds 395. 'It is,' says Blades, 'the suit of a confident man, for while a fine chalkstripe is subtle, not strident, it still demands a certain panache of its owner.' The Duke of Windsor used to dress down his double-breasted chalkstripes by wearing them with tan suede brogues.</p>

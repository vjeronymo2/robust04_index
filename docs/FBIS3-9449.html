Czaczkowska and Kazimierz Groblewski: </F> "Crises in the Coalition; Pawlak Wins"]    [Text] The prime minister is delaying the decision  concerning Rosati. Politicians of the Democratic Left Alliance  [SLD], who unofficially do not conceal their anger, officially  say: Nothing has happened. "Nothing has happened," they said  when the establishment of the government was being decided, when  the prime minister had accepted Borowski's resignation.    It took the SLD a long time to find a successor to Borowski.  When it finally...  <H5>  Found Dariusz Rosati </H5>   ...it started to demand that the prime minister accept him  immediately.    Why is Pawlak delaying his decision? One reason has been  given officially: He wants to familiarize himself with Rosati's  views on the economy; he wants to be certain that there will be  no conflicts between him and the "economic" ministers of the  Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. Other reasons are mentioned only  unofficially. Pawlak is afraid to employ such a high-ranking  politician, who will be making better impressions in the mass  media, especially on television. Before forwarding the  appointment to the president, the prime minister also wants to  explain the nature of Rosati's connections with the financial  affair of the Foreign Debt Service Fund. He knows that, until  he does that, the president will not take on the responsibility  for this appointment.  <H5>  The Result: One to One </H5>   In the games played so far in the coalition, the SLD won one  point by forcing Pawlak to change the minister candidate lists  when the government was being formed. The PSL scored one point  as well--in the February conflict between Borowski and Pawlak.    The first serious crisis shook the coalition even before the  government was formed. The SLD threatened that, unless the  names on the list of the Cabinet members submitted to the prime  minister were different from earlier joint agreements, it would  leave the coalition. Pawlak had to make a concession and agree  to sign the appendix to the coalition agreement.    The beginning of the next crisis was the issue of the  privatization of Bank Slaski. Deputy Prime Minister Borowski  took on responsibility for it. Despite that, the prime minister  recalled, without Borowski's consent, Finance Deputy Minister  Kawalec, which forced Borowski and the SLD to submit certain  conditions to the prime minister. As a result of their  rejection, Borowski handed in his resignation, which, to the  surprise of SLD politicians, was accepted by Pawlak.    Borowski's issue revealed...  <H5>  Still Other Controversies </H5>   ...different views on the pace of privatization and on the  budget (the prime minister announced on television prosocial  amendments to the budget, but, on the following day, as PSL  leader, he agreed to support the government's version of the  budget).    The government's information policy has become a steady  source of controversy. The SLD has demanded all along that a  government spokesperson be appointed; it has become increasingly  critical of Press Secretary Ewa Wachowicz. Quite recently, SLD  politicians have stated that the decision concerning the  appointment of a spokesperson has already been made, but it is  still not clear who will be appointed to this post.    The recent declaration by Minister Michal Strak that the  replacement of voivodes has already been completed may finally  end the coalition's disagreements concerning the filling of  these posts.    There was no observance of the principle that the post of  the voivode is filled by a candidate of the party that has won  the elections in the given district. In February, out of 30  appointments to the posts of voivodes and deputy voivodes, only  eight candidates were recommended by the SLD (one of them is a  member of the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic), and 22  were proposed by the PSL. As a consequence, the SLD demanded...  <H5>  That the Role of Minister Strak Be Limited </H5>   ...and that their representative be employed in the Office  of  the Council of Ministers, who would exert influence on the  appointment of voivodes.    For several months now, the SLD has been making efforts to  appoint its own people to deputy ministerial posts in the  "presidential" ministries: the Ministry of National Defense  [MON], the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MSW], and the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs [MSZ]. The bits of information that leak  from the meetings between Aleksander Kwasniewski and Waldemar  Pawlak suggest that the prime minister hears out the demands of  the SLD head and then changes the subject of the meeting. He is  said to have promised several times that he would take care of  the issue. Most often his response is silence.    Pawlak is keeping Kwasniewski in suspense, he is delaying  his  decision; he...  <H5>  Never Told Him "No," Though </H5>   ...as far as the issue of deputy ministers was concerned,  this is why it has not turned into an open conflict in the  coalition.    The prime minister put off the decision, waiting for the  Belweder to soften its negative stand. This tactic proved  effective. The MSZ and MSW heads declared that they were ready  to give deputy ministerial posts to the coalition; recently, the  MON head agreed to that, too. Not long ago, he even threatened  to submit his resignation if he was going to have a "party  activist" in his ministry.    The closer the moment of the appointment of SLD Spokesman  Zbigniew Siemiatkowski to be deputy minister of MON, the more  quietly the SLD is protesting Jerzy Milewski's merging his  positions in the National Security Office and in MON. Before  that, National Defense Committee Head Jerzy Szmajdzinski of the  SLD even went so far as to threaten the prime minister: He gave  him several hours to say which function Jerzy Milewski was  supposed to fulfill.    It is to the president's advantage that, in the coalition  conflicts, Prime Minister Pawlak, rather than the SLD head, gain  the upper hand. Walesa sometimes...  <H5>  Discreetly Supports Pawlak... </H5>   which happened, for example, when he immediately signed  Borowski's resignation. However, he does not allow the prime  minister to triumph where he may triumph himself. This is why  he took advantage of Pawlak's visit to Moscow.    All things seem to suggest that, no matter whether Rosati is  appointed to the post of deputy prime minister and finance  minister, Pawlak's position, in relation to the SLD, will be  strengthened. The prime minister wins again because, by  delaying the decision, he again places the SLD in the position  of petitioner. Once again he gives everyone to understand that  coalition agreements are only coalition agreements, appendixes  are merely appendixes, but, in fact, everything is decided by  him. Remaining silent and delaying decisions are the main  methods employed by the prime minister. This is accompanied by  obstinacy.</p>

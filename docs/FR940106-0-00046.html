			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We refer to the performance requirements we use to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate the performance of intermediaries and carriers in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting their contractual obligations to HCFA in our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations and program instructions as criteria and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. When we developed our regulations, criteria were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to be distinguished from standards; we intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure broad categorizations of performance using criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (42 CFR 421.120) and to measure statistical and performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data using standards (&sect;421.122). As planned, a contractor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had to be evaluated by and pass the requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria before we evaluated contractor performance using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statistical standards. However, in practice, the standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been used to measure a contractor's compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the criteria. The separate reliance on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statistical standards diminished and we have developed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CPEP under which standards are used to measure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance of specific activities in a defined criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instead of ``statistical'' standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 3, 1992, we published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (57 FR 57125) a proposed rule describing technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revisions we proposed to make to Medicare regulations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to simplify and improve our system for evaluating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performances of fiscal intermediaries and carriers in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of the Medicare program. These technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revisions are necessary to bring our regulations up to date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with our actual use of criteria and standards in performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the preamble to the proposed rule we described how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reliance on statistical standards diminished and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current ``standards'' are used to measure the performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific activities in a defined criterion. That is,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement and evaluation using criteria and standards have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evolved into a one-step process. In addition, we noted that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain functions that were included in the original planned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation structure have been transferred to more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate review activities. We, therefore, proposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amend &sect;&sect;421.3, 421.112(b), 421.118(b) and 421.122 to delete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to statistical standards and to replace the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general standards for the areas evaluated formerly by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statistical standards with a general explanation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas evaluated by performance standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also mentioned in the proposed rule that our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations do not contain requirements relating to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement of carrier performance that are parallel to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those for intermediaries. For consistency, we proposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish a new &sect;421.201, ``Performance Criteria and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards,'' that would measure and evaluate carrier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance of functional responsibilities, such as,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurate and timely processing of claims, responsiveness to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiaries', physicians' and suppliers' concerns, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proper management of administrative funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We proposed to base performance criteria and standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the experience of carriers nationwide, changes in carrier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations due to fiscal constraints, and our objectives in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieving better performance. Before the beginning of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CPEP evaluation period, we would publish the performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria and standards as a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also announced that we would add a new &sect;421.203,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Carrier's failure to perform efficiently and effectively,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to explain the adverse action that may be taken by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary if the carrier fails to meet criteria and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards specified at &sect;421.201. The content is parallel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to &sect;421.124, which applies to intermediaries. This new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;421.203 does not add or change carrier obligations. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> merely codifies in regulations a provision specific to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carriers that has been in effect since Public Law 98&hyph;369.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Analysis of and Response to Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We received 10 timely items of correspondence in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to the December 3, 1992 proposed rule. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments were from intermediaries, carriers, contractor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advocacy groups, and provider advocacy groups. A summary of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the comments and the Department's responses follow:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters suggested that a process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be developed by HCFA for receiving comments, complaints, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems with carrier performance by physicians or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional organizations and that the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated by this process be included in the overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance evaluation of a carrier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Beginning in Fiscal Year 1994, HCFA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review both intermediaries' and carriers' efforts to enhance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customer satisfaction through the use of customer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfaction surveys, including the National Physician  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Survey. Results of the surveys will be used to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance data on customer satisfaction and to identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas in need of improvement. The results will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summarized for publication in the report of contractor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

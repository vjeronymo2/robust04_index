			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's trade results THE WORLD has been waiting several months to discover Mr Clinton's trade policy. Now, after his meeting with the Japanese prime minister, it knows what it is. Mr Clinton believes in managed trade. Many will try to play the dangers down, noting that US demands are limited to its trade with Japan. They may even feel pleased that Japan is under attack. Such complacency would prove a mistake. 'Results-oriented' trade would not be limited to trade with Japan. Nor would its effects be confined to the relationship between the US and Japan. Its poison would spread far wider. The president's complaints start with Japan's bilateral surplus of Dollars 49bn (Pounds 32bn), which he deems 'unacceptable'. But he is not concerned with that surplus alone. He wants to obtain specific results in specific sectors of the economy as well. But the president is also supposed to believe in free trade. How, one wonders, can someone who believes in free trade fail to see that bilateral imbalances are a natural consequence of multilateral trade? How can he fail to realise that a market economy can only generate government-mandated outcomes after it ceases to be a market economy? If this new approach to trade were indeed restricted to Japan, many might feel it has much to commend it. The Japanese political system needs to be shaken out of its current torpor. The world also needs imaginative Japanese political leadership. For that matter, so does Japan. The Clinton demarche will certainly disturb Japanese politics. Perhaps it will galvanise Japan to a suitably creative response. Unfortunately for those who feel this way, the effects of the envisaged approach are unlikely to be restricted to US-Japanese relations. One reason is that it would impair the integrity of Gatt rules and norms. The figleaf of anti-dumping covered the nakedness of the semiconductor pact. If the US were to act without such cover, why should others take these rules seriously? Yet another reason is that the European Community would seek to follow any precedent set by the US. Sales would then be won by competitive coercion, not by market competition. A final reason is that these 'voluntary import expansions', as Professor Jagdish Bhagwati has called them, would spread to trade with other countries, just as voluntary export restraints started with Japanese exports and spread to the exports of other countries. The ideal of a rules-governed, global market economy - the aim of half a century of trade diplomacy - would be in ruins. Japan should suggest a powerful Gatt mechanism as an alternative to managed trade. If this idea does not divert the US from its course, others must come to Japan's aid. They should do so regardless of what they feel about Japan, because more than its fate is at stake. Japan must say 'no' to import targets. It will need the help of other major trading powers if it is to make its 'no' stick.</p>

The organization will develop programs that serve to familiarize international students with New York City's complex cultural, political, and ethnic structures, and provide a bridge between the campus environment and American communities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USIA anticipates awarding up to $35,000 for the implementation and coordination of these programs. This amount may augment functions currently provided to international students by educational and other institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Deadline for proposals: All copies must be received at the U.S. Information Agency by 5 p.m. Washington, DC time on April 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Faxed documents will not be accepted, nor will documents postmarked on April 15, 1994 but received at a later date.

Overall authority for these programs is contained in the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, as amended, Public Law 87&hyph;256 (Fulbright-Hays Act). The purpose of the Act is ``to enable the Government of the United States to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries; to strengthen the ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating the educational and cultural interests, developments, and achievements of the people of the United States and other nations and thus to assist in the development of friendly, sympathetic and peaceful relations between the United States and the other countries of the world.'' Programs and projects must conform with all Agency requirements and guidelines and are subject to final review by the USIA contracting officer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Overview <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Through a grant to a non-profit organization in the New York city metropolitan area, USIA seeks programs that would enable self-sponsored international students to experience the United States: Its history, culture, values,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  policies and lifestyles. Self-sponsored international students should be provided an opportunity to utilize the city's resources productively; and to take an active role in city life. To understand more fully American life and culture, students must be provided the opportunity to become personally involved with and understand ``typical'' American activities such as volunteerism, observance of national and religious holidays, and cultural and sports events. In addition, self-sponsored international students should be encouraged to share their culture and knowledge with American students at all levels. Also important are programs which introduce foreign students to the U.S. government structure, the electoral process, the U.S. economy, business culture and trade issues, environmental protection, the arts and American cultural heritage. A variety of approaches such as workshops, home hospitability, and community outreach programs may be utilized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enrichment programs should be designed not only to enhance international students' understanding of America's cultural and ethnic diversity, but they should also enable the students to teach Americans their own cultural, ethnic, political, and social diversity, thereby promoting mutual understanding and long-term friendships. This multicultural component can be met by emphasizing interaction_interpersonal, intercultural communication_between students and American citizens. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Local private organizations  have proposed mergers of nearby municipalities in a total of 91  regions in Japan to promote broad administration, a survey said  Monday [4 April]. But in a small number of cases the local  governments have already started merger moves through legal  procedures, leading the government to support them.    The survey conducted by KYODO News Service showed the local  governments concerned with the proposed merger plans totaling  120 cities, 310 towns and 50 villages -- about 15 percent of  Japan's municipalities.    The Home Affairs Ministry is planning to back the proposals  by extending and reinforcing a special law to help merging local  governments, ministry officials said. The law which grants  financial support to local governments after incorporation is  realized will expire in March 1995.    Of the 91 regions, local governments in four regions have  already put their merger plans on track.    The Katsuta city government and the Nakaminato city  government in Ibaraki Prefecture, north of Tokyo, are expected  to merge in October this year.    Also, officials of the local governments in eight regions  have started considering how to administer their future broad  governments after incorporation is achieved, the survey said.    The survey said 60 percent of plans recommended by private  organizations, such as local chambers of commerce, envisage the  incorporation of nearby towns and villages into each core city.  Of these, 14 cities, including the northern Japanese cities of  Morioka and Iwate, are likely to be designated as new core  cities with over 300,000 residents under a new law expected to  be enforced within this year.    Furthermore, municipalities surrounding ordinance-designated  cities such as Sendai, Hiroshima, Kitakyushu and Fukuoka have  visions of their being incorporated into those cities.    In Saitama, Gunma, Niigata and Shizuoka Prefectures, local  governments are aiming at being promoted to ordinance-designated  cities with their prefectural capitals as the center. There are  11 ordinance-designated cities in Japan.    Most of the local governments polled said they are in favor  of mergers because they think broad administration is expected  to bring more efficiency to their jobs and help develop their  regions faster. But some local governments, which have been  proposed for incorporation into core cities nearby, expressed  concerns over the possibility of deterioration in their public  services after mergers.    There are 17 prefectures in which no merger plans have been  proposed by the private sector, the survey said.</p>

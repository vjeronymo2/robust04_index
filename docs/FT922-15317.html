			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Kashmir leaders oppose elections Kashmiri nationalist leaders released from detention yesterday immediately rejected elections in India's northern state and joined hands with militant separatist groups in calling for self-determination, writes David Housego in Srinagar. The five were freed in an effort to revive political activity in the state as a prelude to elections. The opposition leaders criticised the use of force to crush Kashmiri demands for self-determination. They said thousands of Kashmiris, including women and children, had been killed over the last three years by Indian security forces.</p>

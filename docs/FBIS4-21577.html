			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] No doubt our listeners recall that,  after the Chernobyl tragedy, there was an outbreak of  radiation-phobia in the USSR, as it was then. Armenia's nuclear  power station was shut down. Stations that were virtually ready  for commissioning were not handed over. Construction of new  reactors was frozen. Nuclear power stations cannot generate  electricity unless their fuel is regularly replaced -- but  shipment of fuel for reprocessing was suspended. However, the  situation has now begun to change. That is the view of Yevgeniy  (Dzikun), chief engineer of the nuclear reprocessing plant at  the town of Chelyabinsk-65. Journalist Yevgeniy Stankevich  spoke to him. [begin recording] (Dzikun): Signs of  a revival in our industry are visible, for the moment at least.  Why do I say so? There is nowhere else for atomic power  stations to turn to. They are already asking us to accept and  reprocess this fuel. So we have carried out several shipments  and removed fuel from atomic stations. We have similar plans for  the second quarter as well. So we will have some work.    Stankevich: Will Ukraine's nuclear warheads be  handled at your plant?    (Dzikun): Since 1986 our plant has had nothing  whatsoever to do with the production of warheads, although that  was our job from 1948 onward. In fact the works celebrated its  45th anniversary in December 1993. We consider that the removal  and correct use of uranium and plutonium from warheads does  present problems. We see a possibility of our participation in  this work. This is within our capability. But if we are to  play a practical part in the implementation of these plans, a  certain amount of modernization will have to be done to the  installations we have here, because the requirements applicable  to these materials are slightly different from those that  existed when these warheads were manufactured. These materials  will now be used for civilian purposes. If this task is to be  resolved in practical way, financial questions will have to be  settled first.    Stankevich: Bearing in mind that foreign atomic  stations are paying you to reprocess fuel, would you reprocess  fuel for our former neighbors and Russian stations for free, or  will you make them pay something?    (Dzikun): Naturally, our prices are  differentiated. There is one level of prices for the countries  in the East European bloc, as it used to be. There is another  level of prices for CIS countries, and a third level of prices  for atomic stations in Russia. So you cannot say that we are  making a fortune out of this. A large part of the money we make  out of this, especially the hard currency, is spent on tackling  ecological problems in the oblast. The combine receives roughly  35-40 percent of the seemingly large sums that figure in  contracts. That is a level that only just covers our own  overheads. [end recording]    Announcer: In addition to what Yevgeniy Dzikun,  the chief engineer of the nuclear reprocessing plant at the town  of Chelyabinsk-65, said, let me add that the Armenian nuclear  power station has been unfrozen. It is very possible that  Chelyabinsk-65 will reprocess the fuel from Armenia.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Vauxhall plant faces strike on pay MEMBERS of the TGWU general union at the Ellesmere Port plant of Vauxhall, the General Motors subsidiary, have voted overwhelmingly to strike over a pay dispute. With only a small number of postal votes still to be counted, union officials said yesterday that 76 per cent of those who voted favoured a stoppage and 89 per cent for action short of a strike. The TGWU is the largest union at Vauxhall. It is thought that other unions - both at Ellesmere Port and at the company's manufacturing and parts sites at Luton - have also delivered decisive majorities, although the margins in favour may be less. Disclosure of the TGWU result came as management and unions at Rover, the carmaking subsidiary of British Aerospace, edged closer to a deal on working practices and bargaining procedures. The two sides have been negotiating since September on changes which would see the introduction of reforms including single-table bargaining, in which all blue-collar and white-collar unions would negotiate together; 'continuous improvement' working practices for everyone; and increased flexibility by workers. A single-grade structure would eventually be introduced. Talks on the changes continued late into yesterday evening and were adjourned until Monday. The ballots of more than 8,000 members of blue-collar unions at Vauxhall follow the company's refusal to raise the 5 per cent it has offered for the first year of a two-year deal. The offer would provide an increase in line with inflation in the second year and workers would also receive a lump-sum payment equivalent to 0.5 per cent of annual pay. Apart from protesting about the level of the offer, workers are angry about a company proposal to reduce the potential for productivity bonuses to rise and its refusal to meet demands for a shorter working week. There is also dissatisfaction about the time it has taken to negotiate the deal. Talks which began last May have been complicated by the company's linkage of pay increases to changes in working practices and by the unions' refusal, for several months, to accept the linkage. If the deal goes ahead and the changes run to the company's satisfaction, workers at Luton will receive a rise of 5 per cent, on top of the annual pay rise. Ellesmere Port employees benefited by a similar amount last year in a comparable agreement. Mr Steve Broadhead, a TGWU official, said workers were aware of a deal at Ford which provided 5 per cent in the first year and 5 per cent or inflation plus 0.5 per cent, whichever was the greater, in the second. 'There were no strings attached there,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN PLEADS GUILTY IN DEPUTY'S SLAYING  </P> <P> A woman pleaded guilty Thursday to voluntary manslaughter charges in the death  of a sheriff's deputy who was gunned down as he tried to serve a search warrant  at a cocaine rock house allegedly run by her.  </P> <P> Dorothy L. Waters, 42, of South-Central Los Angeles, had been charged with  murder in the January, 1988, death of Deputy Jack Miller, 33, a 12-year veteran  of the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> But in a plea bargain with the district attorney's office, Waters was allowed  to plead guilty in Superior Court to the lesser manslaughter count.  </P> <P> She is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 22 to up to 11 years in state prison.  Had she been convicted of the murder charge, she could have been sentenced to  up to 25 years to life.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said that although Waters' now-deceased son was the person who  actually shot and killed Miller, Waters was charged with his murder because she  set up the drug operation, including the purchase of firearms, that led to the  fatal shoot-out with sheriff's deputies.  </P> <P> Waters' son, Edward Walker, 20, shot and killed himself during that same gun  battle.  </P></p>

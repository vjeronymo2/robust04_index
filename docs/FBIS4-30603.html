			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan] on Tuesday  spurned a call from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for talks  on the joint establishment of a coalition government.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, in a meeting with LDP  President Yohei Kono, said the SDP, the second largest  opposition party, cannot hold such talks with the LDP as it will  open a policy dialogue with the ruling coalition Wednesday, SDP  Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference.    But Kubo later said his party will officially respond to the  LDP request by 6 p.m. Wednesday.    The coalition and the SDP agreed earlier Tuesday to kick off  talks to narrow differences over major policy issues and explore  the possibility of fashioning a fresh coalition government.    The SDP walked out of the latest ruling union in April,  leaving Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata overseeing Japan's first  minority administration since 1955. Hata resigned Saturday with  his entire cabinet.    In his meeting with Murayama, Kono said the LDP, the biggest  opposition force, will back the SDP chief as a candidate for the  premiership if the two parties share in a government, Kubo said.    But Murayama only thanked the LDP for its proposal and  explained that the SDP cannot begin talks on the framework of a  new government with the LDP, citing the scheduled policy  dialogue with the coalition, Kubo said.    Murayama and Kono reportedly agreed that their parties will  do their utmost to sort out the present political confusion  within Wednesday, when the term of the current 150-day ordinary  Diet session expires.    In a separate news conference, LDP Secretary General Yoshiro  Mori said Kono repeatedly urged Murayama to start negotiations  for a possible coalition government with the LDP but failed to  win approval.    The LDP would have to put up Kono as a candidate for the  next  premier if no conclusion is reached by Wednesday evening on  whether the SDP will rejoin the coalition or team up with the  LDP.    The LDP and the SDP, archrivals under the LDP's 38-year  unbroken rule that ended last August, are widely apart on key  policy issues such as diplomacy and national security, raising  doubts about the possibility of a successful alliance.</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEN ACCUSED OF BEATING PHILLIPS ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL FOR ASSAULT  </P> <P> Three men accused of severely beating San Diego Charger nose tackle Joe  Phillips were ordered Monday to stand trial in Superior Court on assault  charges.  </P> <P> Municipal Court Judge E. Mac Amos Jr. bound the three men over for trial after  a 2 1/2-hour preliminary hearing in which two eyewitnesses placed at least one  of the defendants at the site of the beating.  </P> <P> Charged in the attack are Scott Stewart, 24, of Santee; David Hanna, 22, of San  Diego; and Brett Dost, 21, of San Diego. All three men are currently free on  bail.  </P> <P> The three men will be arraigned in Superior Court on Dec. 27 on charges of  assault with a deadly weapon, battery with serious bodily injury and vandalism.  </P> <P> Phillips, 27, suffered severe head injuries when he was attacked on Sept. 26  after leaving Saska's, a Mission Beach restaurant, with a female companion.  </P> <P> The 315-pound nose tackle underwent surgery for some of the injuries, which  will probably cause him to miss the rest of the Chargers' season.  </P></p>

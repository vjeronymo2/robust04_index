			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the  International Committee of Jurists for Democracy and Human  Rights in South Korea decided to form the international liaison  committee for the release and repatriation to the North of the  unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea to build up  broader world opinion on the tragic conditions of the  unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea.    The statement issued by the Secretariat on May 28 says the  international liaison committee will urge the South Korean  authorities to immediately send Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan to the  North and release An Hak-sop, who are old unconverted long-term  prisoners, and conduct worldwide activities for its realization.    The statement says:    "Old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan in South Korea were  subjected to prison life for more than 30 years, but are denied  repatriation to the northern half of the country for the reason  that they refuse `ideological conversion,'" the statement says,  adding:    "An Hak-sop has been kept in prison for over 40 years for  his  refusal of `ideological conversion' after he was taken prisoner  as a soldier of the Korean People's Army in the Korean war.    "This is an undeniable violation of the Geneva Convention  and  a challenge to the resolutions of the International Committee of  the Red Cross and the United Nations General Assembly."</p>

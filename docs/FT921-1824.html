			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / The judgments of conviction: The state of play between Tory and Labour at the end of the first week The Conservative tax onslaught would stop Mr Neil Kinnock in his tracks. The judgment of one of Mr John Major's senior lieutenants was offered with as much confident aggression as anyone could muster after a week without sleep. The clever but incomplete arithmetic of Mr John Smith's shadow Budget had left scope for his party to tap a rich vein of public unease about higher taxes. But, like others with the prime minister at Conservative Central Office yesterday, he did not grasp the admission of weakness implicit in the assessment. It was an acknowledgement that after the first week of campaigning, the Conservatives have found themselves in the role of the opposition. Behind in the polls, it is no longer enough for Mr Major to stop Mr Kinnock. He must drive him back. Labour has to do no more than hold its present standing in the opinion polls to force Mr Major from Downing Street. A share of just over 40 per cent of the vote would not give him an overall majority, but there would be no doubt that Mr Kinnock had won the election. That could change. The polls have been volatile. Labour's lead is at best two points. Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats, sidelined by the cross-fire, might yet emerge as a more serious rival for the votes of disaffected Conservatives. Mr Major's offensive against Mr Smith's tax plans has yet to permeate fully the voters' consciousness. So Labour's strategists in Walworth Road are looking ahead to the clutch of opinion polls tomorrow with as much anxious anticipation as those in Smith Square. But this week's campaign snapshots have been ones for Mr Kinnock to keep. Gloomy output and unemployment figures did nothing to still resentment over the government's handling of the economy. The economic indicators were 'truly awful', one cabinet minister admitted in an unguarded moment. There were pluses, he insisted. On the doorsteps Mr Major won almost universal praise, Mr Kinnock attracted uniform scorn. The voters feared the opposition more than they wanted to punish the government. The minster's Labour counterparts told a different story. After 13 years the voters were saying that they had had enough. Recession, the poll tax and crumbling public services had persuaded them it was time for change. Both judgments carried conviction. But the lines of fatigue which come with 18-hour days concealed puzzled frowns on Conservative faces and cautious confidence on Labour ones. Mr Kinnock has the look of a politician who believes that at last he can win. Mr Major, with no experience of opposition, has the air of one who has realised how hard he must fight not to lose. It was Mr Smith who gave Labour the first round. Described dolefully by one opponent as 'a priceless asset', the shadow chancellor's mock budget was delivered with an articulate gravitas which obscured for several days the questions it failed to answer. Aides insisted that the package - reconciling commitments to spend more on the welfare state with pledges not to raise taxes for the average family - worked superbly. The skilled working classes had been reassured and the confusion and contradictions of 1987 could now be avoided. Mr Major did not have a bad week. A stylish portrayal of the journey from Brixton's Coldharbour Lane to 10 Downing Street in his first election broadcast reinforced the image of a politician close to voters' anxieties and aspirations. The message on the doorsteps - grudgingly admitted by Labour MPs - was that the prime minister is liked and trusted. He attracts little of the blame for his party's mistakes and credit for shaving the rougher edges from Thatcherism. But circumstances have now forced him into a different role. His lengthy election manifesto - designed above all to underpin the message that here was a prime minister seeking a first term rather than a party seeking a fourth term - was put to one side within 24 hours of its launch on Wednesday. The party's strategists decided that Mr Major, until now above the election slanging match, was needed in the front line of the attack on Labour's tax policies. So instead of spending the rest of the week setting out his own agenda, Mr Major took on the less familiar role - and more colourful language - of negative campaigning. It is not a role into which he slips easily. Nor one that will necessary appeal to a public weaned on 'that nice Mr Major'. But after this week's opinion poll wobbles, Conservative election strategy has crystallised behind two central themes: tax and leadership. Those hit by Mr Smith's plan to abolish the earnings ceiling on National Insurance contributions do not, by definition, merit Mr Major's description of 'middle-income' earners. Fewer than 15 per cent of taxpayers earn more than Pounds 22,000. But in the crucial marginals of London and the south-east enough of them to make a difference to the election outcome may earn (or aspire to earn) that amount. So Mr Major, as he promised, will go on, and on, and on about Labour's threat to the incomes of the upwardly mobile. He will intersperse that with thinly veiled attacks on this rival. Mr Michael Heseltine's approach will be less diplomatic in what is being billed as a strategy to 'shred' Labour's tax plans and Mr Kinnock's leadership. The Conservatives insist it will work: that neither Mr Smith's Budget nor Mr Kinnock's character will survive the next two weeks; that Mr Major will become the first prime minister since opinion polls began to lift support during a campaign. Perhaps. But Labour too has an agenda - the recession, health, education and the poll tax - which strikes powerful chords with the voters. For all the sound and fury over tax, these have been the issues scoring the highest marks for 'salience' in the opinion polls. This week it has been Mr Kinnock's 'time for change' rather than Mr Major's 'you can't trust Labour' which has had resonance.</p>

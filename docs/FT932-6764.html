			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / Row over BCCI creditors' election LIQUIDATORS to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International have refused to intervene in an alleged conflict of interest on the part of a candidate for election to the BCCI creditors' committee at Wembley Arena today. The BCCI Isle of Man depositors' protection association wrote to object to the candidature of a member of the island's Financial Supervision Commission. It is concerned that the commission does not fairly represent the individual depositors, and that it would create a conflict of interest if they decided they needed to sue the regulators.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: McAlpine placed The market's most active stock was Alfred McAlpine, the construction group, which slipped 5 to 311p after news that an 11 per cent-plus stake in the group, some 6.37m shares, had been placed in the market. The stake, owned by Dumez, of France, was sold to stockbroker Charterhouse Tilney at 300p a share and passed on to a number of UK institutions at 304p apiece. By the close of business, turnover in McAlpine shares had reached 12m. The strong performance yesterday of builders merchants shares augurs well for this morning's market debut for Graham Group, the UK's fourth-largest builders merchants group being hived off by BTR. Graham shares, offered for sale at 183p, are expected by marketmakers to open around the 195p mark. Graham is seen as a major threat to Wolseley, one of the building materials sector's real successes over the past decade, and Travis Perkins. The latter rose 9 to 335p and Wolseley put on 19 at 899p. Close Brothers, one of the market's lesser known merchant banks, delivered a sparkling performance, the shares spiralling upwards to close 83 higher at 528p after the bank announced more than doubled half-year pre-tax profits, a 56 per cent increase in the interim dividend and a one-for-one scrip issue. Other merchant banks clawed back some of the big losses of recent sessions, with SG Warburg closing 10 firmer at 834p. The high street banks staged a strong rally after the recent heavy setback in the sector. Standard Chartered, due to report preliminary numbers tomorrow, raced up 49 to 1164p after Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker, was said to have forecast a 24p dividend total and pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 440m. Talk of switching out of Barclays and into National Westminster ahead of Barclays' figures, due tomorrow, drove NatWest shares up 13 to 495p but restrained Barclays, which settled only 5 better at 517p. British Petroleum figured prominently in the market's most active issues, with a block of 4m shares traded at 370p and a further 1.1m at the same price. The stock closed a net 4 higher at 367p after turnover of 11m. Cadbury Schweppes declined 4 to 494p ahead of results due tomorrow. Many observers are still convinced that they will be accompanied by a big rights issue in order to mount a full bid for US drinks group Dr Pepper. Hillsdown, which reports results on Thursday, edged up a penny to 178p. Kingfisher bounced, with UBS said to be recommending the stock. The shares put on 5 at 609p. News that Ladbroke was considering returning to the casino business after a 14-year absence helped the shares edge ahead 1 1/2 to 200p. Demand for Stakis following a recent round of presentations to institutional investors saw the stock gain 2 1/2 at 89p as turnover hit 1.5m shares. Manchester United's premier league defeat at the weekend caused the shares to lose 7 at 693p. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo slipped 12 to 695p against the trend as some investors took profits following Friday's sharp rise. Media investment group MAI gained 8 at 273p after it was announced that the offer for Anglia Television had been declared unconditional. Anglia appreciated 5 to 639p. Carlton Communications bounced 22 to 967p after recent sharp falls, as Hoare Govett continued to recommend the shares. Hickson International, the speciality chemicals and timber treatment company, improved 4 to 204p as investors responded to a reiterated buy note from Kleinwort Benson. Engineering concern BBA Group fell 9 to 207p after the company announced higher than expected provisions and indicated a reduced dividend payout for the current year. Confirmation that British Aerospace was in talks with French arms manufacturer Giat over collaboration in munitions sent BAe 8 higher to 510p. Sentiment was further boosted by reports that the ceiling on foreign ownership of BAe shares would soon be raised by the government from its present 29.5 per cent to 49.5 per cent. The same sentiment, together with a squeeze, saw Rolls-Royce move ahead 6 to 180p, with volume reaching 7.2m shares. Reports, confirmed after the market close, that British Airways was planning to suspend further investment in USAir, in which it has a 25 per cent stake, depressed BA shares, which receded 4 1/2 to 430p in trade of 7.8m. Conglomerate Suter was in demand ahead of today's figures, the stock climbing 6 to 205p.</p>

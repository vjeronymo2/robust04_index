			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Arts: In praise of femmes fatales - Cinema THE LAST SEDUCTION (18) John Dahl WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT (PG) Maria Luisa Bemberg ZERO PATIENCE (18) John Greyson THE EMAGINATOR A great many women today are involved in dreadful crimes. We only just recover from knife-wielding Glenn Close when along comes ice-pick murderess Sharon Stone. A little later, Nicole Kidman and Kim Basinger join the roguesses' gallery. And last week a lustful, power-crazed woman known simply as 'Queen' abandoned her step-daughter in a forest, causing the girl to fall prey to mineworking dwarfs. Yes, we know, that last incident actually took place 50 years ago and has been 'revived' for modern filmgoers. But that only makes our point for us. Terrifying women - call them femmes fatales or vindictive queens, call them Joan Crawford or Sharon Stone or Snow White's step-mother - pop up in history whenever men feel nervous about a changing power balance in the sex war. Such films have the label 'noir' attached to them, being sinister, paranoiac and lit with the single flickering flame of the director's misogyny. The style is common to the 1990s and the 1940s, since both eras rejoice(d) in a Hollywood patriarchy living in terror of women taking power. The sole difference is that 'Feminism Strikes]' (1990s) has replaced 'Women Take Over The Workplace]' (1940s) as the anxiety headline. The lovely thing about these phobic films is that they suit both sexes. Take John Dahl's splendid The Last Seduction, from the man who brought us prior noirs, Kill Me Again and Red Rock West. Men can swoon at the dominatrix whip wielded (metaphorically speaking) by sultry, darkhaired Linda Fiorentino, a go-getting wife who gets gone with Dollars 700,000 of her drug-dealing husband's money. And women can cry 'Way to go, Linda]' as she outwits all the men in her life thereafter: from the husband himself (Bill Pullman) to the provincial hick (Peter Berg) with whom she forms a new partnership in crime and carnality. In the little town of Beston our heroine takes an assumed name, an insurance company job and a season ticket to sexual delirium. Very modernly done, this last. No '40s-style censor-dodging innuendo. Straight out with the hard stuff. Girl (Fiorentino) meets boy (Berg) in bar. Girl puts hand inside boy's fly. Girl sniffs withdrawing hand approvingly. Soon they are crawling all over each other in beds and cars and garbage areas. I hear you tut-tutting already. 'No style, no wit, no obliquity]' you tut, thinking back to the days when all Lauren Bacall was allowed to do on screen with Humphrey Bogart was ask him if he knew how to whistle. But The Last Seduction has lashings of style - Dahl knows when to fit a lightning storm into the visual heraldry, or when to close in on a cigarette surreally stubbed out in an apple pie - and not a little wit. When the heroine first comes to Beston, she suffers instant culture shock. Everyone in the street says 'Good morning' to her: and her startled reaction limns at a stroke the contrast between the ships-in-the-night New York she has left and the dotty, convivial Eden she has arrived in. There is high-style obliquity too, only not wasted on the labour of being indirect about sex. When Fiorentino hatches her scheme to get rich as a hit-person - tapping into credit card statements, she tracks down wealthy men who have betrayed their spouses and suggests her services to the wives - the film becomes a delicious black comedy of insinuation. For the great thing about women as prime movers in a plot is that they can draw on decades, or centuries, of supposed gentility in order 'innocently' to moot the unmentionable. Another heroine who knows her mind and mobilises it is the mother in Maria Luisa Bemberg's We Don't Want To Talk About It. This Argentinian film comes from the lady who gave us Miss Mary and I, The Worst Of All: Bunuel-suave tales of sex and gnomic violence. The new movie, drawn from a magical realist novel by Iulio Llinas, tells of dwarf girl Carlotta, her normal-height widowed mother (the formidable Lustina Brando) who hopes to marry her off, and Marcello Mastroianni as a lovestruck charmer who keeps travelling round the world and back again before finally popping the question. The short/tall, May/December, wanderer/homebody romance plot is just one if the film's offbeat charms. Bemberg draws a rich portrait of a determined woman; and a funny-malicious picture of a little town where gossip is the main industry, closely followed by social hypocrisy. When the Mayor dies in the middle of a wedding - that wedding - everyone pretends not to notice; and he is shoved into a bathful of ice-cubes afterwards so as not to spoil the party. Like an impossible wine, at once sweet and dry, the film goes its intoxicating way towards an ending no less startling and funny for being utterly inevitable. John Greyson's Zero Patience is an Aids musical from Canada. Anything that will shake the grip of this disease - even the use of jollity to judder people into a greater awareness of it - is welcome. But then again (donning film critic's cap): just because a movie is brave and well-motivated does not mean it is any good. No problem with the giddy production numbers and their up-yours lyrics - 'I got Kaposi's] I got retinitis]' And all power, in the cause of populist shock therapy, to the chorus of singing sphincters. No, what distresses is the straight-and-stuffy stuff. All that rheumatic 'comedy' involving Victorian explorer Richard Burton (John Robinson), who has been allowed a surreal life-extension as a Toronto taxidermist (sic) assembling a multi-media exhibition on the disease's history. With help from the ghost of Patient Zero (Normand Fauteux), the Air Canada flight attendant said to have brought the disease to America, Robinson-Burton emcees the film in his dreadful 'English' accent and wages his own brave but boring battle with homophobia. The movie would love to be ludic and sometimes it is. More often, though, it resembles an ill-edited varsity revue: full of smirking sophomores who think that a mixture of scholarly allusiveness and knees-up vitality will slay them all in the college prom. Finally, a 'Where did you read it first?' footnote. I now demand my own Richard Burton Award for having been the first into uncharted cine-territory. 'The Emaginator,' newly packing them in at London's Trocadero centre, is a white-knuckle movie-show cum stunt-ride which you really should experience. You roll and pitch in a movement-simulator seat while watching frighteningly realistic footage of speedy mountain roads, corridors in space, dangerous mine tunnels. The reason the film is so vivid is that it was shot at an all-but-flicker-free 60 frames per second, in a system first promoted under the name 'Showscan.' FT readers will have learned of this in March 1988, when I brought the news of techno-breakthrough back from Hollywood. Back then I was asking, Why can they not introduce this system into feature films? Now I ask it again. We know the usual answer: money. But it is time we all spoke up and said to Hollywood, 'Stop. Change direction now]' We would surely rather have millions spent on a serious advance in screen technology than tens of millions spent on otiose production values and ageing, overpaid stars in summer rubbish like The Flintstones and Maverick.</p>

Paul  O'Meara, 29, a San Francisco State University student, died at San Francisco  General Hospital nine hours after the attack, said police.  </P> <P> Two witnesses who shouted at the thugs said at least six other people saw the  attack at a Mission District bank machine, said San Francisco Police Inspector  Art Gerrans. "One fellow grabbed him by the hair and another fellow grabbed him  by the leg and all four proceeded to pull him back into a parking lot area,"  said Gerrans. The suspects fled down a side street and jumped over a fence to  make their escape, Gerrans said.  </P></p>

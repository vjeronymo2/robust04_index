			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (4): The watchword for today - Banking and Finance AFTER years of riding high on the fast lane of economic growth, liberalisation and privatisation, Portuguese banks are having to change gear. While the 1980s were a time of rapid expansion, the watchword now is consolidation. Banks are still building up their branch networks, but the pace of expansion is slowing as margins decline and costs rise. 'Most of the banks have more or less completed their expansion plans,' says Mr Alexandre Vaz Pinto, president of the Portuguese Bankers' Association and executive vice-chairman of Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa, one of Portugal's top three banks. He says the number of bank branches could reach 3,000 by the end of next year compared with around 2,500 now, but that would be a manageable number for the Portuguese market. Some areas of the country may be over-banked, but with one branch for about 4,000 inhabitants, the average ratio of branches per population is half that of Spain. At the same time, growing costs and risks are making expansion more difficult. Rapidly building up networks has not always brought the hoped-for results. 'Some banks didn't get the (additional) clients they expected,' he says. Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, president of Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP), Portugal's most striking banking success story, agrees. '1993 will be the final year for conquering market share, after that it will be possible only through acquisitions,' he says. BCP, a private commercial bank established barely six years ago by a group of entrepreneurs from Portugal's industrial north, has grown spectacularly to become the country's second largest capitalised bank, and fourth largest in terms of assets. It now heads a diversified banking group with insurance, brokerage, fund management, leasing and factoring activities, and it is currently awaiting authorisation to launch a mortgage bank. Mr Jardim Goncalves says BCP will continue to expand - it will have more than 300 branches by the beginning of next year, giving it one of the largest networks in the country - but the emphasis will be on consolidating its position. Some of the smaller banks, especially foreign institutions, are expected to continue to expand at a relatively high rate. Barclays Bank has built up its network to 49 branches, about 30 of which were opened this year, and plans to open up another 16 branches early in 1993. Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) which started with 12 branches when it bought Lloyds Portugal two years ago, now has 38 branches and plans to open another 40 branches next year, with further expansion aimed at raising its market share from 2 per cent now to 5-7 per cent. Barclays and BBV are likely to have the most aggressive strategies among foreign banks in the near future. Two other Spanish banks, Banesto and Banco Santander, are already well established through their partial ownership of Banco Totta &amp; Acores and Banco de Comercio e Industria respectively. 'Size is important,' says Mr Vaz Pinto. 'Below 5 per cent of the total number of branches you cannot be a critical player in the market.' The rush to win market share either through organic growth or by buying one of the institutions being privatised has contributed to a noticeable increase in competition between banks. Publicity campaigns have been more aggressive, and the banks have vamped up their image. As the day approaches for full liberalisation of financial services required by the European single market on January 1 1993, banking in Portugal is no longer quite the cosy cartel it used to be when most banks were in state hands. Mr Artur Santos Silva, president of the group headed by Banco Portugues de Investimento (BPI), a highly successful private investment bank, says a crucial factor to remain competitive in the new single market era will be the ability to finance investments in technology, networks, marketing and new products. Without such investment, banks will find it difficult to survive, especially the smaller ones. 'In three or four years' time there'll be a smaller number of Portuguese banks (on the market),' he says, forecasting further mergers and acquisitions. To meet the challenge, last year BPI bought Banco Fonsecas &amp; Burnay (BFB), a medium-size commercial bank that was privatised, thereby gaining access to a broader source of funds as well as widening its role in the market. It is now looking at the possibility of further acquisitions. The single market comes at a difficult time. Interest rates are falling as the government strives to meet criteria for European economic and monetary union. Bank margins have fallen to their lowest levels for years, though at 4-4.5 per cent they are still high by international standards. Mr Francisco Veloso, president of Banco de Comercio e Industria, says interest rates are not the big issue for banks. 'Interest rates will fall but the banks will cope. Competition is so strong now that the banks have to adapt and become more efficient. If they don't they'll disappear.' The problem is that margins are falling just as the banks need to make substantial increases in provisions to cover bad debt. In the past, this was mainly a concern for the state-owned institutions, but even the best-run private banks now have to increase provisions as the economic climate deteriorates and many companies face bankruptcy. Mr Vaz Pinto says bad credit for all banks stands at around Es430bn, and is rising. Bankers are also concerned by the high compulsory cash reserve which they have to place with the central bank at low interest. Cash reserves are currently set at 17 per cent of deposits, and remunerated at rates ranging from 8 per cent to 13.25 per cent. Mr Vaz Pinto says this discriminates against Portuguese banks. 'Foreign banks don't have the same liquidity problems, and we want a reduction of the reserve co-efficient as an essential step for fair competition.' Banks were also upset by the government's increasing use of highly competitive treasury certificates - freely available through the post office  -to encourage savings. At one point the certificates were paying close to 10 per cent above average bank deposits, but this problem was solved last month and rates for certificates have been brought into line with those offered by the banks. The central bank's sharp cuts in interest rates last August and its announcement that it was accelerating the liberalisation of capital movements are expected to affect bank profitability adversely. The bank decided to abolish the compulsory deposit on foreign credit for Portuguese companies on August 31; end the restriction to non-resident investments in floating rate bonds from October 31; and fully liberalise non-resident investments in the domestic money market by the end of the year. Some analysts predict real operating income for commercial banks will fall off sharply next year as a result. So, after seven years of heady growth, banks that are insufficiently capitalised or which have drawn on their deposit base to finance expansion had better watch out.  -----------------------------------------------------------                    THE COUNTRY'S BANKS               (figures in billions of escudos)  -----------------------------------------------------------                       1992           1991      Change                   (first half)   (first half)   (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------- Assets               15,446         12,859     20.1 Credit extended       6,092          5,233     16.4 Deposits             11,224          9,326     20.4 Own capital           1,668          1,292     29.1 Profits                93.5           91.9      1.7 Number of banks          35             33      6.1  ----------------------------------------------------------- Source: Portuguese Bankers' Association  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

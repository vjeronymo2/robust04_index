			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Arts: Peter Pan - Theatre Tomfool Theatre's engaging, dynamic adaptation of Peter Pan (at BAC, Battersea) is a world away from the usual staging - there are no green tights, no glittery sets and no special effects. This is not the version to attend if you want to spot the flying wire. Instead, this young company relies on the force of the story and simple, but inventive staging to hold your attention. Director Tom Smith has drawn on Barrie's novels and play to put together his own interpretation, but while the mood may be playful, the storytelling is largely direct. This allows many of the unsettling themes at large in the story to emerge clearly without being forced home. The action takes place on an empty set with one piece of furniture: a high hospital bed that features both in the Darling household and Never-Never-Land. When the Darling children fly away with Peter, they simply jump on to the moving bed. This is a neat device, since most children, at some time or other, have jumped off their beds, eyes closed tightly, hoping to fly - and the production is liberally sprinkled with such moments to reinforce the idea that the real world and the land of fantasy are closely intertwined. Objects from the Darlings' neat Edwardian home reappear in Never-Never-Land: the metronome used by Mr Darling to keep time becomes the sound effect for the crocodile with the ingested clock, who pursues Captain Hook. The actors who play Mr and Mrs Darling appear in different guises in the fantasy world, as characters in dreams do, and this underlines the way ideas about abandonment and fear of adolescence echo through the story. The Darling parents are a sweet, earnest couple, scarcely grown up themselves. Though Mr Darling has a moustache and says stern things, he is clearly far less worldly than Peter, played by Max Mackenzie as a streetwise urchin in a tail coat. When Peter and Tinkerbell arrive in the children's bedroom, instead of sprinkling fairy dust over the little Darlings, they tap a little ash from the end of Tinker's cigarette - a nice touch that suggests how Peter sums up all Mrs Darling's protective fears about losing her children to the wrong sort. The production incorporates a nod to the panto tradition with one moment of audience participation, several hat tricks and a fair amount of tomfoolery. It loses impetus in the second half, becoming more muddled, and is much less successful in dealing with the darkest aspects of the story. Jake Nightingale's Captain Hook avoids being the pantomime baddie, but he also avoids being sinister at all, and by the time we reach the walking-the-plank passage on Hook's ship, the production has lost its edge. But overall this is an absorbing thoughtful reworking that encourages you to ruminate on the interesting psychological terrain explored by Barrie.

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Italy leads the European equity retreat Until last Wednesday evening, Italy was the sick man of the week in Europe, but it was joined by a number of its neighbours after Thursday's key interest rate increases in Sweden, and Italy itself. James Capel talks of 'rate contagion' in its latest World Economic Watch. 'The long period of monetary ease must now come to an end,' says the broker, 'and the move by Sweden and Italy signals that rate contagion will spread beyond North America.' The broker expects US interest rates to rise at the FOMC meeting in Washington today. Australia and the UK are next on its list for upward interest rate moves. In Europe, Capel says that the Bundesbank's discount rate is likely to rise by March, around six months earlier than Merrill Lynch was forecasting last week in the US broker's reaction to the Swedish interest rate rise. 'The whole of Europe,' says Capel, 'is now on interest rate watch.' By the end of last week, Europe, excluding the UK, was down by 3.3 per cent in local currency terms over five days. Italy still led the downtrend with a fall of 9.2 per cent in a severe but still partial correction of the outperformance it has seen against other European markets this year. Mr Albert Edwards, global strategist at Kleinwort Benson, sounded a warning note a week ago about recent bourse gains. By early August, he calculated, German and French equity markets had seen rises of 7.9 and 11.4 per cent in the five weeks since June 30. He added last Friday that interest rate jitters would affect the Continent more than the UK. While most commentators (Kleinwort apart) believed that an upward move in UK base rates was imminent, consensus 12-month forecasts for German and French three-month rates were 4.2 and 4.6 per cent, both well down from current rates of 4.9 and 5.6 per cent respectively. 'We may think that tightening is some considerable way off,' remarked Mr Edwards, 'but that will not stop the markets worrying about future developments.' Secondly, he noted, Continental equity valuations were more vulnerable at an earlier stage in recovery and the earnings cycle. Prospective 1994 p/e ratios for non-financials were 36.1 in Germany, 21.6 in France and 13.8 for the UK.</p>

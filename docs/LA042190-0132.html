			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GLENDALE GETS THE DROP ON ARCADIA TO SQUEEZE OUT 9-INNING, 3-2 WIN  </P> <P> In a matter of five very eventful seconds, Glendale High's Rene Rangel went  from hero to goat to hero in his team's 3-2 defeat of first-place Arcadia in a  Pacific League game at Glendale on Friday.  </P> <P> With the bases loaded and nobody out in the bottom of the ninth inning, Rivas  missed a suicide-squeeze sign on an 0-and-1 pitch. Instead of bunting, Rivas  swung away and banged what seemed destined to be the game-winning hit up the  middle.  </P> <P> Yet Arcadia right-hander Randy Martinez stabbed the line drive and turned to  throw to third base to double up Glendale's Marco Rivas. But Martinez dropped  Rangel's line drive in the process, allowing Rivas to score the winning run.  </P> <P> "If he catches it, he turns two and we're in trouble," Glendale Coach Chris  Axelgard said.  </P> <P> Senior right-hander Danny Gray (5-3) threw a six hitter, struck out five and  walked two. Brent Overfelt was three for four for Glendale (10-5-2, 4-3-1 in  league play).  </P> <P> In other baseball games:  </P> <P> Westlake 11, Royal 4 -- Mike Lieberthal hit his 13th home run -- a two-run shot  -- as the host Warriors took an 8-0 lead after an inning and cruised in a  Marmonte League game.  </P> <P> Junior James Clark (3-0), a left-hander who relieved starter Scott Lerner in  the fourth, struck out six in 3 2/3 innings of one-hit, shutout ball. Keith  Hess had two hits for Westlake (20-1, 8-0), including his sixth home run to  give the Warriors 26 this season, breaking the school record set in 1985.  </P> <P> Steve Bernstein, Tim Casagrande and Richard Naranjo each had two hits for Royal  (12-8, 4-4).  </P> <P> Newbury Park 8, Channel Islands 3 -- Newbury Park's Jason Smith pounded a  bases-loaded double to drive in three in a six-run third inning of a Marmonte  League game at Newbury Park.  </P> <P> Shane Gallimore and Brian Smith each had two hits for Newbury Park (6-9-1,  1-6). Jim Davis was two for three with an RBI for Channel Islands (12-10, 2-6).  </P> <P> Sylmar 19, Monroe 6 -- Sylmar had 17 hits and scored 15 runs in the first four  innings of the Valley Pac-8 Conference game at Monroe.  </P> <P> Sylmar's Danny Hernandez was four for six with a triple and four RBIs.

St. Francis  sophomore Jose Cevera allowed two hits and two runs in four innings but was  relieved in the fifth by Manny Fernandez (4-2), who yielded the winning run an  inning later.  </P> <P> Hoover 9, Muir 7 (nine innings) -- Mickey Moreno had two hits and knocked in  one run to lead visiting Hoover (6-9, 4-5) in a Pacific League game. Hoover's  Cesar Covarrubias added two hits.  </P> <P> Saugus 9, Quartz Hill 2 -- Kyle Lonsberry paced host Saugus to a Golden League  victory with a double, a triple, three RBIs and two runs scored.  </P> <P> In six innings, Doug Maggiora (8-1) struck out four and yielded two earned runs  for the Centurions (12-5-1, 8-1).  </P> <P> Palmdale 4, Canyon 1 -- Junior left-hander Chris Tampoya held visiting Canyon  (8-9, 4-5) scoreless for six innings, and Palmdale scored four runs in the  first three innings of the Golden League game.  </P> <P> Tampoya (5-1) struck out seven and walked five.

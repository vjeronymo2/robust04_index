Wei  returned to the Chinese capital late Saturday and "went to sleep  very late" at his brother's house, the relative said by  telephone, but declined to give details of his ordeal.    The dissident, who had been released from prison on  September  14 just six months short of a 15-year term, was picked up by  police early Friday and taken to a state guest house on the  northeastern outskirts of the capital. He telephoned friends at  12:20 p.m. (0800 GMT) Saturday to say his interrogation had  finished and that he would return home later that day. [passage  omitted]</p>

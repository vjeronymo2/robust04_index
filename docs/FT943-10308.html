			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Telecom NZ boosts net earnings by 17% A strongly growing economy and marketing initiatives combined to give Telecom New Zealand a 17.2 per cent increase in net earnings to NZDollars 138.5m (USDollars 83.4m) in the first quarter to end-June. The company, which is controlled by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, was also helped by earnings from its Australian investments. These include its 51 per cent owned subsidiary, Pacific Star Communications which contributed revenue of NZDollars 29.3m. Telecom is targeting Australia as its leading growth market for the provision of facilities such as enhanced facsimile systems. But it does not intend to compete directly with the network companies there such as Telecom Australia, Mr Roderick Deane, chief executive, said yesterday. He said the improved profits performance was largely due to strong revenue growth; previously it had mainly stemmed from cost savings. Excluding Australian earnings, revenue on its New Zealand operations rose by 6.2 per cent to NZDollars 634.5m. To cope with intense competition Telecom had cut average phone call prices by a further 11 per cent, but the negative impact on revenue was more than offset by a robust growth in volumes, Mr Deane said. The numbers of national calls rose by 15.1 per cent, while international calls were up by 17.6 per cent. Cellular connections rose by 46.4 per cent, and revenue from mobile services was up by 22.3 per cent. Dr Deane said the outlook for the company was excellent. There appeared to be considerable potential for growth when New Zealand telecommunications usage was compared with the US, he said.</p>

ROK  President Kim Yong-sam called an emergency cabinet meeting and  declared that the ROK's 600,000-strong armed forces were on war  alert. Immediately responding to the ROK's request, the United  States started deploying Patriot missiles in the ROK and  preparing for the resumption of U.S.-ROK joint military  exercises. U.S. Defense Secretary Perry said that the United  States had delivered 160 Patriot missiles to the ROK, and if the  United Nations adopted a resolution of sanctions against the  DPRK, the United States would deliver more armed forces and  weapons to the ROK.    The escalation of the military situation is mainly due to  man- made factors. Over the past year, the Korean situation  alternated between tense and relaxed situations. Last March,  the DPRK abruptly announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty to oppose the "Team Spirit 93" joint  military exercise held between U.S. and ROK armed forces, thus  causing concern among the international community. The DPRK  also carried out frequent air defense maneuvers and proclaimed  blackouts. As a consequence, both the ROK and the DPRK were  almost on war alert. Later, the United States took the  initiative to negotiate with the DPRK about the differences on  the issue of de-nuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. The dialogue  bore fruit. Last February, the DPRK reached agreement with the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the United States  separately, agreeing to allow personnel dispatched by the IAEA  to "carry out inspections which intend to guarantee continuous  nuclear safety." Meanwhile, the DPRK and the ROK held talks at  Panmunjom from 3 to 16 March to discuss the issue of reciprocal  envoy visits. Originally, the atmosphere of the Korean  peninsula can be gradually improved through dialogue.    In early March, the IAEA dispatched a six-member nuclear  inspection team to the DPRK for investigation. They inspected  seven nuclear facilities, but after returning to Geneva, they  complained that the DPRK obstructed them from taking away a  sample from a chemical research institution. As proved by the  development of events, the fact that the Security Council urged  the DPRK to let the IAEA "complete all the necessary inspection  work" implied that the DPRK had opened its seven nuclear  facilities, but the remaining problem was the DPRK was not  cooperative enough in obstructing the inspection team from  taking away a sample. The DPRK defended itself against the  censure, pointing out that the IAEA had inspected and put a seal  on the facility as well as installed monitoring instruments  there, but the inspection team contradicted themselves and it  was unreasonable for them to insist on tearing off the seal and  taking away a sample again.    It seems that we cannot describe the DPRK as uncooperative  but we can only say that the DPRK objected to tearing off the  seal for reexamination. Originally, such differences could be  settled through talks. However, when the northern and southern  sides of Korea discussed the matter at Panmunjom, they traded  vicious remarks against each other, including those concerning  the issue of U.S.-ROK military exercise. Hence, the situation  took a sudden turn and the issue of U.S.-ROK military exercise  escalated to U.S. deployment of more weapons and more troops in  the ROK.    The United States has openly asserted that the DPRK must  yield to U.S. pressure to accept nuclear inspection, otherwise  the Security Council will impose sanctions on it.    However, the international community does not consent to  using the Security Council's sanctions to settle the problem.  The main reason is that since the DPRK does not trade with most  countries, measures taken by the Security Council to isolate the  DPRK will not affect the latter very much, but will rather make  things worse. East Asian countries always seek stability to  facilitate the peaceful construction of Asia. The United States  can look on indifferently after making a mess of the situation.  However, if a war breaks out in the Korean peninsula, refugees  will flee hither and thither, and Japan, the ROK, China, and  Russia will bear the brunt of it. The Korean Peninsula issue  never endangers the security of Western European countries. If  someone in the Security Council proposes troop deployment,  Western European countries will not be ready to share the  military expenditure, whereas Japan will not be eager to worsen  the situation. At that time, the United States will become more  isolated. Russia has called for an international meeting  attended by various sides related to the situation of the Korean  peninsula, including Russia, China, the United States, Japan,  the ROK, and the DPRK, to settle the problem. Russia maintained  that sanctions should not be made a first priority but rather  political and diplomatic means should be used. Under the  influence of moderates at home, the ROK's foreign minister also  said that it was a "bad idea" to impose sanctions on the DPRK  and that the problem could only be settled with China's  assistance.    Former U.S. President Bush also gave his advice to the  Clinton Administration: "At present, the most important thing  is to preserve the U.S. leading position in the world rather  than to deal with the trade imbalance. If we are worried about  the Korean peninsula issue and Pyongyang's development of  nuclear weapons, we need China's help."    Various countries in the world do not agree with the U.S.  suggestion of taking punitive military actions against the DPRK  because Pyongyang is passively on the defensive and has never  sent troops to attack the south, whereas the United States has  exhibited its strength menacingly, and the ROK Radio even  declared that "Seoul and Washington have drawn up a plan to  overthrow the DPRK Government." Therefore, various countries  are not willing to add fuel to the flames and worsen the  situation, whereas the ROK hopes that China can exert its  influence on the DPRK so that the latter will take more flexible  measures. Clinton probably knew that it would be quite  infeasible to take a hard line on this matter, so he played the  China card, extending his "thanks to China for striving to stop  the DPRK's development of nuclear weapons." However, China has  made its stand very clearly known. China reasserts that the  problem should be settled through dialogue and that, as proven  by past facts, exerting pressure on a country by imposing  sanctions on it can only lead to a tense situation, whereas only  dialogue can make a breakthrough. In implementing its Asia  policy, the United States should respect the aspiration of Asian  countries in seeking peace and stability and make it a basis for  consultation and cooperation with Asia. The problem cannot be  settled by isolating the DPRK. Only when we win over the DPRK  and help it return to the international community, can a more  constructive situation emerge.</p>

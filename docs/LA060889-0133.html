			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUGE CRANE FALLS AT HIGH-RISE SITE BUT NO ONE IS HURT  </P> <P> A massive crane collapsed atop a high-rise building under construction in  Century City Wednesday morning, leaving an 80-foot boom balancing precariously  on the skeleton of the 28th floor and sending the crane's hook plummeted more  than 200 feet to the street below.  </P> <P> Although dozens of construction personnel were working throughout the partially  completed building and on the ground below, there were no reports of injuries.  </P> <P> "I was looking out the window when I noticed that the crane was swinging very  fast," said Brian Campbell, a 34-year-old office broker who works in another  high-rise across the street from the building being erected at 1999 Avenue of  the Stars.  </P> <P> "Suddenly, part of it collapsed, and it came crashing down through the decking  they're putting in on the top," Campbell said. "The workmen up there scattered  like ants as the thing came down. The boom was left hanging. . . ."  </P> <P> Plumber Michael Sennett, 31, who had been installing toilet fixtures on the  seventh floor of the building, said the impact of the falling crane "felt like  an earthquake."  </P> <P> The crane consists of a vertical mast beam, much like the mast of a ship, with  a horizontal boom suspended from it, much like a ship's boom. Officers of  Dinwiddie Construction Co., which is erecting the building, said the crane was  not carrying a load when the boom snapped near the point where it joins the  mast.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Used Moments Earlier  </P> <P> Witnesses said the crane had been used moments earlier to haul half a dozen  20-foot steel beams up to the construction crew, which is building the top  floors of what eventually will be a 38-story structure.  </P> <P> The operator of the crane works from the ground, following the hand signals of  workmen perched at the edge of the top floor.  </P> <P> Fire and police units responded quickly to the accident at 10:53 a.m.,  barricading the streets below while construction crews and firefighters atop  the structure worked to secure the dangling boom.  </P> <P> Neither the Fire Department nor the construction company had a damage estimate.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Paul Feldman contributed to this story .  </P></p>

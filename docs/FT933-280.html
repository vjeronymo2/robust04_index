			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (27): This was no ordinary skeleton . . . - The tomb of the Lord of Sipan is the richest ever found in the Americas IN the wonderland that is Peru, the line is a fine one between the magical and the banal, the magnificent and the absurd. Never more so than on the March day when a 1700- year-old skeleton was received by the president at Lima's military airport with all the honours normally accorded a head of state. This was no ordinary skeleton, of course. Its arrival, together with others, marked the triumphal return of the 'Lord of Sipan' and his entourage, whose tomb, excavated in 1987, is the richest ever discovered in the Americas. After five years of meticulous restoration work at Germany's Mainz museum, the matchless contents of the tomb are now back in Lambayeque, the northern Peruvian province where the pre-Columbian Moche culture flourished between the first and seventh centuries AD. But they will soon be on the move again. From September, the Lord of Sipan and his treasures are scheduled for exhibition in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, with the intention of putting Peru squarely back on the archaeological - and, it is fervently hoped, the tourist - map. Briefly displayed to selected guests in Lima's government palace, the Sipan treasures are breathtaking. They include huge gold earrings inlaid with turquoise; intricately beaded pectorals; head-dresses; a shield of solid gold weighing almost two pounds. Then there is what experts call the finest single item of pre-Columbian jewellery ever unearthed - a tiny warrior-priest wielding a miniature war club, clad in a removable necklace and girded by a belt of tiny bells the size of pinheads, each attached with gold wire. The figure is no larger than a a man's thumb. Small wonder that, down the centuries since the Spanish conquest four hundred years ago, graves such as the Lord of Sipan's, with their exquisite contents, have fallen prey to looters. In recent years the international market has become increasingly avid for pre-Colombian art. Until the discovery of the Sipan tomb, no Moche tomb had been discovered intact by archaeologists. The story of the Sipan discovery, which began in February 1987, is almost as exciting as the treasures it produced. Mr Walter Alva, an archaeologist then working at the Bruning museum in Lambayeque, received a late night telephone call from the local police chief asking him to come urgently to examine certain objects recovered in a raid on a local grave-robber's home. While the telephone call was not a particularly unusual event, the recovered booty certainly was. Some 30 items, including gilded cat-face masks, a golden head with eyes of lapis-lazuli and several other perfectly crafted gold objects, suggested that the looters had stumbled across an important find. Anxiously - but in the gloomy expectation of finding nothing but the looters' rejects - Alva and his police chief ally followed the trail back to Sipan. There they found evidence of extensive tunnelling into a Moche 'platform' built, like the famous pyramids of the Lambayeque valley, of sun-baked adobe bricks. This platform, however, was a mere 33 feet high  - an easy proposition for entire families of looters to plunder under cover of dark. Local resentment boiled over at the arrival of archaeologists and police, who were considered merely a higher class of thief. Ugly clashes followed; one looter was shot dead. During the following year of excavations, the site had to be protected by round-the-clock guards. The early weeks were spent in clearing away rubble left by the tunnellers. Dr Alva recalls: 'It was heart-breaking to find broken fragments of jewellery and pottery, discarded for their lack of commercial saleability but invaluable to the archaeologist.' But, digging deeper, prospects for an important find improved when Dr Alva and his assistant came across a contorted skeleton with its feet cut off. Logic suggested that the remains were those of the 'guardian' of some important personage; the amputation performed to ensure that he could never  -even in death - desert his master. Not far below this skeleton, Alva hit the archaeologist's ultimate jackpot: an untouched wooden sarcophagus, banded with copper straps. 'For several seconds I couldn't breathe,' Dr Alva recalls. 'Then I gasped: 'A coffin] Sealed] And it's never been opened]' The Lord of Sipan was the highest authority of the Moches; his supreme powers encompassed all aspects of religious, civil and military life. Moche tradition demanded that his possessions could be not inherited, but would be buried along with him for use in the afterlife. The wealth of this one man was stunning. Eleven elaborate pectorals accompanied him to the grave, together with several gold headdresses and various sets of ear ornaments. A retinue of eight persons served as tomb companions for the Lord of Sipan. They included two young women (presumed to be his wives or concubines), two warriors and a child. The fragile bones, already half dust and splinters, had to be coated with acrylic preservative before they could be lifted from the tomb. A side chamber revealed more than 1100 ceramic vessels arranged in apparently ritualistic patterns. Some depict iguanas, the creatures which, in Moche belief, ferried mortals to the afterworld. Unlike the Lord's personal accoutrements, Dr Alva says, 'These look as if they were hastily made on the death of the warlord, to meet some criterion of quantity rather than quality.' A recurrent motif in Moche craftsmanship is the 'decapitator god' who combines elements of bird and cat. Although the Moche people were primarily agriculturalists, a farming community, successfully turning the arid Lambayeque valley into a fertile oasis, their rituals were bloodthirsty. Moche art routinely depicts military activity. The prime purpose of forays into neighbouring territory seems to have been to capture enemy warriors. Moche pottery graphically depicts them being taken prisoner, stripped of their weapons and clothing and paraded, ropes around their necks, before their captors. In the final sacrifice, the prisoners' throats are cut, and their blood drained into elegant goblets which are offered to high-priest/warrior figures. Dr Alva and other eminent archaeologists believe that the Lord of Sipan was one such figure. The Sipan tomb and its contents are likely to prove a big attraction both within Peru and abroad. As Dr Alva points out: 'Archaeological finds are often displayed as a collection of separate objects - in this case the tomb gives a context. All the information we have about Moche workmanship, ritual and customs can be effectively presented around that tomb.' And, as the Lord of Sipan prepares to sets out again on his travels as a roving ambassador for the promotion of Peruvian culture, excavation at Sipan continues to reveal more tombs - with the tantalising prospect of unearthing more exquisite treasures belonging to another of equivalent rank to the Lord of Sipan.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: LA VERNE;  </P> <P> INITIATIVE REQUEST DENIED  </P> <P> The City Council has refused a request from the La Verne Small Town  Preservation Committee to put an initiative on the November ballot prohibiting  construction of theaters and auditoriums that can seat more than 1,000 people.  </P> <P> The committee objects to a 12-screen Edwards Cinema complex proposed for the  intersection of B Street and Foothill Boulevard.  </P> <P> Members argued that if the council did not put the measure on the November  ballot, the city would be forced to spend about $25,000 for a special election  after the group collects enough signatures. Committee leader Bob Mastro said  the group has about 1,000 of the 2,500 signatures required to force an  election.  </P> <P> Mayor Pro Tem Thomas Harvey said the special-election argument was an attempt  to blackmail the council into placing the measure on the ballot before the  group obtained sufficient signatures.  </P></p>

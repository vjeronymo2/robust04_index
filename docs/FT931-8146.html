			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / International Company News: Pioneer slides 54% as Akai plunges into loss THE severity of the recession in consumer electronics was underlined yesterday by poor results from two Japanese manufacturers. Pioneer, the specialised audio and video manufacturer known for its karaoke systems, reported a 54 per cent drop in third quarter pre-tax profits as demand for its mainstay products declined sharply in Japan and abroad. Akai Electric, which makes audio products and VCRs, meanwhile, plunged into loss for the year to November 20 1992. Both companies blamed the reversals on the economic slowdown worldwide, particularly in Japan, and on the appreciation of the yen. Pioneer reported a 9.6 per cent fall in sales to Y167.48bn (Dollars 1.38bn) for the three months to December. Pre-tax profits fell to Y11.43bn from Y24.67bn a year earlier. Demand fell for its audio and video products, particularly compact stereo systems, CD players and commercial laser karaoke machines. Sales of car navigation systems, car CD players and software increased, however, while projection TVs sold well in the US. Car navigation systems sales nearly tripled in value. Pioneer said that in spite of continuing weak demand, it was maintaining research and development expenditure while cutting capital spending by about Y2bn. The company has recently been criticised for telling 35 older managers to retire or face dismissal. Pioneer is in talks to restructure Carolco, the loss-making US film production company in which it invested Dollars 100m for a stake of just under 20 per cent. Any deal would involve a further Dollars 40m investment. Akai reported third-quarter pre-tax losses of Y554m, against profits of Y1.73bn last time. Sales fell nearly 10 per cent to Y87.26bn (Y96.83bn), hit particularly hard by the fall in demand for VCRs, one of its main product areas. The company, which has 90 per cent of its sales overseas, was also adversely affected by currency fluctuations.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Promodes to raise up to FFr2bn from bond issue PROMODES, the French retailing group, plans to raise up to FFr2bn (Dollars 367m) from a convertible bond issue to reduce debt and prepare for acquisitions. Mr Jacques Beauchet, finance director, said the issue would be worth between FFr1bn and FFr2bn, 'but closer to FFr2bn'. He said Promodes was finalising plans and expected to launch the issue within the next three months. The issue may involve Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais, two of France's largest banks, taking stakes in Promodes, with BBV, the Spanish bank which is a shareholder, increasing its present 4.1 per cent holding. Both Carrefour and Casino, the chief competitors of Promodes in the hypermarket sector, have recently made major acquisitions.</p>

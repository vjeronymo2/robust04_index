			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL SHARPLY HIKES IMMIGRATION OF SOVIET JEWS  </P> <P> Israel announced Friday that it is using every available plane and even  allowing flights on the Jewish Sabbath to bring in a new wave of Soviet Jews  fearing political turmoil in their homeland.  </P> <P> The daily rate of Soviet Jewish immigration to Israel -- already at its highest  level in decades -- has nearly doubled in the last three days, from about 800  to more than 1,500, officials said. Between Thursday and Sunday, they expect  arrivals to total about 6,000.  </P> <P> "No doubt the growing wave is, in part, a response to the worsening situation  in the Soviet Union and the debilitation of the government," said Simcha  Dinitz, chairman of the Jewish Agency, which oversees immigration.  </P> <P> Apprehensions grew after Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze  resigned Thursday.  </P> <P> Dinitz also cited the continuing economic crisis in the Soviet Union and  improved transportation arrangements as reasons behind the latest rush of  immigrants.  </P> <P> "This wonderful operation is possible because many, almost 50%, are arriving to  the transit points overland by train, by bus, by taxi and also by bicycle,"  Dinitz told Israel television.  </P> <P> Officials said many Soviet Jews have been holding exit visas for two to three  months waiting for plane tickets but chose to come any way they could this week  because of the growing tensions.  </P> <P> Several Soviet Jews arriving Friday at Ben Gurion International Airport said  they fear that the liberal emigration policies of Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev may soon end.  </P> <P> Transportation Minister Moshe Katzav gave special permission to maintain the  airlift over the weekend. Flying violates the Jewish Sabbath, the biblical day  of rest that runs from sundown Friday until sundown Saturday.  </P> <P> Three El Al planes headed Friday night for transit points in Warsaw, Bucharest  and Budapest and were to return early Saturday with 750 Soviet immigrants. Four  more planes are scheduled to fly today to the European points to pick up more  immigrants, El Al spokesman Nachum Kleinman said.  </P> <P> At least 160,000 Soviet Jews have arrived in Israel in 1990.  </P></p>

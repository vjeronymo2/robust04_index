			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. December 31, 1991 Proposed Rule To Rescind subpart T <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the concern over the waiver authority in the Atomic Energy Act, and in order to ensure its exercise does not alter EPA's finding that the NRC regulatory program protects public health with an ample margin of safety, EPA announced in its December 31, 1991, proposal that certain conditions and grounds for reconsideration would be included in any final decision to rescind subpart T. In this way, EPA might base its rescission finding upon its view of the NRC regulatory program contemplated by the MOU at the time of taking final action, while also providing some assurance that EPA would revisit that finding should NRC or the affected Agreement States substantially deviate from that program. Thus, in December 1991, EPA proposed certain conditions and grounds for reconsideration, to provide assurance that any finding by the Agency that the NRC program is sufficient to justify rescission of subpart T under CAA section 112(d)(9) would be revisited if the NRC program is actually implemented in a manner inconsistent with that finding. The specific reconsideration options proposed by EPA were published at 56 FR 67565 (December 31, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Reconsideration Options <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has reviewed the various options for reconsideration proposed in December 1991 in light of the comprehensive details added to the terms of the MOU by the settlement agreement finalized in April 1993. EPA is now proposing an additional reconsideration option that is a combination of the options proposed in December 1991. It is in effect a hybrid of that December 1991 proposal. While EPA is not withdrawing its prior reconsideration proposal and the reconsideration options contained therein, the additional reconsideration option proposed today is currently preferred by EPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes the following reconsideration provisions, which include both programmatic and site-specific bases for reinstatement, represent a comprehensive approach under both the MOU and settlement agreement. EPA requests comment on these proposed reconsideration provisions. The Agency notes that the 20 pCi/m2&hyph;s flux standard must be met by all sites as provided by 40 CFR part 192, subpart D. EPA does not intend to reconsider the decision to rescind subpart T for any site that is in fact meeting the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard, absent other factors that would indicate the need for reinstatement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposal establishes an obligation for the Administrator to reinstate subpart T as applied to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites licensed by NRC or an affected Agreement State provided certain conditions are met. Additionally, today's proposal sets forth the procedures for EPA to act on a petition to reconsider rescission of subpart T which seeks such reinstatement. However, the proposed provisions are not intended to be exclusive. EPA reserves the right to initiate reinstatement of subpart T if appropriate. Pursuant to section 553(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(e) interested persons may petition the EPA to initiate reinstatement of subpart T, in addition to petitions for reinstatement under the procedures proposed today. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed reconsideration provisions establish procedures for persons to petition EPA for reconsideration of the rescission and seek reinstatement of subpart T and EPA's response to such petitions. Provisions for the substantive conditions for reconsideration of the rescission of this subpart and subsequent reinstatement for NRC-licensees are also included. Under the provisions proposed today, a person may petition the Administrator for reconsideration of the rescission and seek reinstatement of subpart T under &sect;61.226(a) which provides for programmatic and site-specific reinstatement. If reconsideration is initiated it must be conducted pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking. It is important that any alleged failures by NRC or an affected Agreement State to implement and enforce the regulations governing uranium mill tailings or the applicable license requirements be addressed in a timely manner. These provisions are intended to ensure that persons may seek recourse from the Administrator if they are adversely affected by the failure of NRC or an affected Agreement State to implement and enforce, in significant part, on a programmatic and a site-specific basis the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC, requirements of the tailings closure plan or operating license requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m2&hyph;s flux standard. Thus, EPA is proposing to establish a non-discretionary duty to take final action granting or denying an authorized petition for reconsideration of the rescission of subpart T within 300 days of receipt of the petition. If EPA grants such petition it would then proceed to initiate rulemaking to reinstate subpart T. This rulemaking, however, is not subject to the 300 day time period. This schedule is intended to provide EPA and NRC adequate time to resolve any potential problems identified by a petition. Failure to meet this deadline may be subject to an action in District Court under CAA section 304 to order that EPA take final action on the petition. Review of that final response would be in the Circuit Court of Appeals under CAA section 307(b). If EPA grants such a petition and initiates rulemaking to reinstate subpart T, then final agency action would not occur until EPA had concluded such rulemaking. Consistent with the settlement agreement, EPA may propose to grant or deny the petition within 120 days of receipt, allow a comment period of at least 60 days, and take final action granting or denying the petition within 120 days of the close of the comment period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SLONE GETS THE JUMP ON MAPPLE;  </P> <P> WATER-SKIING: A 2 1/2-YEAR WINNING STREAK HANGS IN THE BALANCE IN WOMEN'S SKI  JUMPING OF TOUR EVENT ON MISSION BAY. FINALS SCHEDULED FOR TODAY. MEN'S  JUMPING, AND SLALOM EVENTS ALSO SCHEDULED.  </P> <P> It has been 2 1/2 years and more than 30 competitions since Deena Mapple, a  native of Sacramento, has lost a water-ski jumping competition.  </P> <P> But there were signs Saturday that Mapple's streak might fall during  first-round competition of the Michelob Dry Water-Ski Tour at Fiesta Island on  Mission Bay. Mapple came up with a jump four feet shy of Sherri Slone's  138-feet. But Slone, 24, said that's not unusual -- or that meaningful.  </P> <P> "I've been in the lead after the first round four times," said Slone, a  Louisiana State University student. "Unfortunately, today doesn't mean that  much."  </P> <P> Slone, in her second year on tour, said it will probably take a jump into the  high 140s to win the title. Slone said Mapple, who is tied with Lisa Simoneau  for second, will once again be the one to beat.  </P> <P> "She's pretty much set the pace for all of us," Slone said. "She's been doing  it for such a long time. She knows exactly how to do it and when. I look up to  her and just hope to be as good as she is someday."  </P> <P> Simoneau, 29, said: "I think her success is built on her strength and  technique. She's also got tremendous confidence that no one is going to beat  her."  </P> <P> But Simoneau said Mapple's dominance might be ending soon.  </P> <P> "The margin has been narrowing," she said.  </P> <P> Mapple, who also leads the women's slalom event by 2 1/2 buoys over Kristi  Overton, said she is becoming numb to the pressure of keeping her streak alive.  </P> <P> "I feel I've been fortunate to have won for this long -- to stay healthy this  long," said Mapple, 30. "I'm not superhuman. I expect to get beat. In fact, it  would almost be a relief to lose."  </P> <P> Mapple hinted she might soon decide to give up the sport that has been a part  of her life since she was 2 1/2 years old.  </P> <P> "This is the best I've felt in a couple years, but I think maybe it's time to  do something else -- like maybe have kids," she said.  </P> <P> Her husband, Andy Mapple, trails Brett Thurley in the men's slalom competition  by one-half buoy entering today's finals.  </P> <P> Mapple, the men's slalom world-record holder, will be matched with Mike  Kjellander in today's semifinals. Thurley will face Lucky Lowe in the other  semifinal.  </P> <P> In the men's ski jumping preliminaries, Australia's Geoff Carrington and Bruce  Neville are first and second with jumps of 191 and 189 feet. Neville's cousin,  Mick, is third with a jump of 175.  </P> <P> Carrington, who won the world championships in 1986 and 1989, said the  saltwater conditions of Mission Bay are to his liking.  </P> <P> "I think the (salt)water is softer," Carrington said.  </P> <P> Scott Ellis and Kjellander finished fourth and fifth with jumps of 173 and 172  and also qualified for the finals.  </P> <P> In the men's freestyle competition, Mike Tolzman leads Dave Reinhart by 57  points. Dave Dotter and Hank Amos also qualified for the finals.  </P> <P> Today's competition begins at 1 p.m. with the women's jump finals.  </P></p>

That is what  happened to President Nixon, and we all know the consequences he  had to face, ending with his resignation from his post. The  smoke screen, or lies, to use a strong but realistic word, which  the President has created to cover up two events have no  justification.    The first event is that he violated the Constitution by not  consulting the Senate, or if that was not possible, the State  Council, before authorizing the transit, not only the transit,  but the installation of U.S. troops in various parts of our  country. This action, as the State Council members have  unanimously agreed, hurts our national sovereignty.    The second event is the president's stubborn attempt to hide  the truth about the activities carried out by the U.S. soldiers  in our country, which have gradually been disclosed. It has been  learned that they are not here simply to build a school or a  health center at a beach in the Pacific Ocean in Valle del Cauca  Department.    The accusation of indignity, for which President Gaviria  could be judged should the Chamber of Representatives accept the  State Council's request, would be the result of constant  attempts by the government and its officials to try and hide  facts or actions that were finally disclosed or partially  revealed with vague or unclear intentions, or carry out actions  that violate the laws and regulations approved by the  Constituent Assembly.    During the current administration, the permanent violation  of  juridical and constitutional regulations has been almost a  normal practice in implementing various economic and political,  and even judicial measures. In the case of the agreement signed  by the defense minister and the U.S. ambassador supposedly to  obtain assistance from military engineers to build facilities  that could be built by Colombians, the president invoked an old  treaty, from the time of the Cold War, which according to some  people has not been ratified by Congress.    The treaty and the juridical situation are not the most  serious problems he faces. The fact that he took advantage of a  congressional recess to infringe on the Constitution by allowing  the entrance of foreign soldiers who are currently operating in  Juanchaco, in the eastern plains, and the control of some radar  that scan our skies are also serious. He did this without  consulting the State Council, which was his constitutional duty.    Now the State Council has issued an urgent call to the  Attorney General, asking him to initiate a possible disciplinary  action against the president. It also submitted a unanimously  approved statement to the Accusations Commission of the Chamber  of Representatives, asking them to take immediate action to  determine if the president should face a political and penal  trial for his prevarications.    The president's attacks on a high body of the judicial  branch, like the State Council, are unjust and senseless. He has  attributed statements to the State Council which it never made.  During his 9 February news conference, he said the State  Council's declaration would prevent the appointment of military  attaches from other countries. Nowhere in its letter to the  president or in its 9 February declaration did the State Council  make such a statement. It was also absurd, almost irrational, to  describe the members of the State Council or anyone else opposed  to the presence of the U.S. soldiers as accomplices of drug  trafficking.    Are the U.S. soldiers here to implement, using the Vienna  Convention, the policy of repression which the United States has  already announced will not be applicable in that drug-consuming  country, but which is applicable in drug-producing countries  with the bloody results we have seen in Colombia? Why were the  Colombian people not informed that the detachments sent from a  base in Alabama are here for that purpose? Why did the Juridical  Secretariat of the Palace threaten Senator Gomez Hurtado with  removal from Congress if he dared to inspect the area near  Juanchaco? What unspeakable pressure is there behind this drama  which has led the State Council to make such a serious decision  as the one it recently made by categorically affirming that the  head of state broke the oath he made when he assumed the  position his compatriots gave him at the polls and which has  endangered national sovereignty?</p>

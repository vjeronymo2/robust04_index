MLADA  FRONTA DNES asked First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra  how he views the Partnership for Peace project and what the  Czech Republic's attitude toward NATO is.    [Schmarcz] The Czech Republic, unlike Poland, for example,  has very positively accepted the Partnership for Peace project  since the very beginning. Why?    [Vondra] I would correct this statement slightly. We tried  to  influence the form of the Partnership for Peace project before  it was on paper. We wanted the document to be far-reaching  regarding the prospects of our membership in the Alliance and to  allow maximum differentiation. This is what we have strived for  in the past eight months--that is, since the idea was born.  However, it seemed meaningless to us to sound the alarm when it  was fairly clear how the Partnership for Peace would look.  Moreover, it seems to us that the project represents the maximum  of what the 16 NATO countries are able to agree upon. I believe  this gives us sufficient room that we can use to push for our  interests.    [Schmarcz] Did the Czech Republic consider getting something  more from the Alliance after the elections in Russia, as Poland  did?    [Vondra] I believe that this would not be a realistic  policy.  In the final stage, we will want to joint the Washington Treaty  on NATO. For this, we will need the approval of the Czech  Parliament and of the 16 parliaments of the member countries. If  we raise unrealistic demands at this moment, some people might  propose alternatives. We must realize that the Czech Republic  has no other alternative.    [Schmarcz] Can you tell us what the NATO reaction would be  if  the situation in Russia became worse?    [Vondra] It is a positive fact about the Partnership for  Peace program that it opens the possibility of real military  consultations in case of a threat. If the United States has  clearly said, through its President, that the Czech Republic's  security is in U.S. vital interests, then it means that, to a  large extent, they are anticipating our membership. We were  assured during the talks that, if the situation deteriorated,  particularly in the East, the Alliance's open policy would have  to be replaced by "the policy of containment after the Cold  War." This time, we would be on the same side as democracy and  the free market.    [Schmarcz] When will the Czech Republic join NATO, in your  view?    [Vondra] If there is political will on both sides, this does  not have to take much time. In any case, I would like this  country to be firmly anchored to the territory on which the  values of Western civilization prevail and where it is possible  to protect them.    [Schmarcz] Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev said that Russia  could join NATO, but there are other possibilities. What are  they?    [Vondra] Minister Kozyrev spoke very clearly about Russian  endeavors at the most recent CSCE meeting: They want to  radicalize [radikalizovat] the institutions of which Russia is a  member, be it the CSCE or the Council for North Atlantic  Cooperation. The reason is simple: These bodies do not allow the  Alliance to come closer to the individual countries, and Russian  clout is greater there, of course.    [Schmarcz] How do you view Russia's role in the Partnership  for Peace project--in view of the rejective declarations on  NATO's expansion?    [Vondra] Russia will try to push for its interests, of  course, particularly in its immediate neighborhood, as has been  declared not only by the dark forces of Russian politics but  also by Russian democrats. To a certain extent, this is quite  legitimate, and I believe that our task is to keep the Czech  state where it has belonged during all of its existence. I  believe that we are not in the sphere of direct Russian  interest, but that does not mean that we should not cooperate  with Russia, in the commercial sphere, for instance.</p>

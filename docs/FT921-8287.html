			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Union Discount Punting on short-term interest rates is inevitably risky, even for specialists such as the discount houses. But the swing from profits of Pounds 11m to a Pounds 3m loss from this side of Union Discount's business raises questions about what ERM membership has done to the sector as a whole. Union blames the inverted yield curve for its performance. That ought to be worrying because such a curve is likely to become more common given the need to shore up sterling against other European currencies. The evidence, however, suggests that other discount houses were better at reading the market than Union despite the difficult market conditions last year. So the ERM is perhaps less of a threat than meets the eye. Union's other problem is that leasing has singularly failed to produce the high-quality earnings needed to offset the risks inherent in its main business. Yesterday's statement stressed the vigour with which it has tackled its leasing losses, but Union is still stuck with a capital-intensive business rather than one which generates a more appropriate steady cushion of fee income. That will take a long time to correct. Meanwhile the shares are hardly a bargain, even though at 146p they are at a 50 per cent discount to net assets.</p>

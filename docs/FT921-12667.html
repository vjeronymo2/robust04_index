			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Ethiopian leader pledges market economy MR Meles Zenawi, transitional president of Ethiopia, said yesterday his government would sign an agreement with the World Bank next week which would release Dollars 650m of emergency assistance to rebuild the impoverished country emerging from 30 years of civil war. Mr Meles also disclosed, in an interview in Addis Ababa, that the liberal economic policy published recently by his transitional coalition government would become a part of his party's election manifesto. This is the the first statement by the 37-year-old president which specifically abandons the socialist economic polices of the once Marxist Ethiopia People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and commits it to a basically liberal economic agenda. The president also said Ethiopia's first free democratic regional elections would be held no later than March. Nearly eight months after his ragtag rebel army stormed the capital and seized power, Mr Meles said his government had already prepared sweeping revisions of the investment and labour codes, transport policy and was studying how to liberalise trade, restructure the financial system and dismantle state-owned industries. 'We are newcomers to this. How can people expect us to go ahead and correct everything in a few months?' The president said a government delegation would sign its first agreement with the World Bank in Washington next week for an Emergency Recovery and Reconstruction Programme which, with other donors, will be worth Dollars 650m until national elections in January 1994. The government, he said, was already prepared for the next round of talks in February on what would become Ethiopia's first structural adjustment programme. On the thorny issue of devaluation Mr Meles said: 'It is no longer an issue of principle but one of timing.' In a surprising statement which suggests how far the ideological rethinking of the EPRDF has gone the president said: 'We are fully committed to the transitional economic programme not only for the transitional period but also after it - which means if the EPRDF wins the national elections its economic programme will be the same.' The government's economic programme, so far a statement of intent, pledges to roll back state control and give greater opportunities to private local and foreign investors to own and participate in the economy. The only policy not open to debate, he said, was public ownership of land. The president admitted that the political thrust of decentralising power to ethnically defined regions was fraught with 'dangers and irrational fall-outs'. But he said he believed an equilibrium would be found and that Ethiopia could 'be united only under one condition - if the people desire. Any other attempt is a recipe for civil war.' Mr Meles said the most surprising thing he had experienced since taking power was the obstruction of the old bureaucracy. 'It was very easy to trust people in the bush, even with your life. Here it is very difficult to trust anybody.' Dressed in a double breasted pinstripe suit and smoking heavily, Mr Meles appeared as a thoughtful, softly spoken man still struggling to come to terms with dealing with the complex dynamics of a modern economy and the problems of applying a set of principles developed in the bush into a pragmatic mode of governing.</p>

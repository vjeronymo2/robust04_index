			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BEVERLY HILLS TENTATIVELY OKS SCALED-DOWN SMOKING LAW  </P> <P> Nearly two years after it passed one of the toughest smoking ordinances in the  nation, the Beverly Hills City Council has heeded restaurateurs' protests and  adopted a substantially scaled-down law that exempts existing restaurants from  strict ventilation requirements and allows smoking in 40% of dining areas.  </P> <P> Under the revised ordinance, which requires a second reading before becoming  law, only restaurants that open after Jan. 1 must install the ventilation  systems. In addition, new restaurants can avoid the systems if they install  walls separating smoking and nonsmoking areas and if the sections have separate  air sources.  </P> <P> The ordinance does not affect bars, lounges, private banquet rooms or  restaurants in hotels.  </P> <P> The proposed law, which was unanimously passed Tuesday, represents a victory  for restaurant owners who complained that the ventilation systems were  expensive and cumbersome. The old law requiring the systems was passed in July,  1987, after restaurant owners protested a highly publicized ban on all smoking  in restaurants with more than 50 seats.  </P> <P> Walt Bilofsky, president of Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, said he is  disappointed that existing restaurants will not be required to install  ventilation systems, but he added that he is pleased that the minimum space for  nonsmoking sections was increased from 50% to 60% of dining areas.  </P> <P> "Obviously, a complete prohibition on smoking would have been the best thing  for nonsmokers," Bilofsky said, "but all the parties have approached the  negotiations over this 60% separation in a constructive spirit. Of all the  situations where cities and counties in California have enacted smoking laws,  restaurants have been the most difficult because restaurants want to  accommodate smoking customers. People like to smoke after dinner."  </P> <P> Bob Spivak, president of the Beverly Hills Restaurant Assn., said the  ventilation systems would have cost between $7,000 and $25,000 to install. The  city issued ventilation standards in September, 1987, that would have required  "air curtains" to keep smoke from entering nonsmoking sections in large  restaurants that did not have walls separating smoking and nonsmoking areas.  </P> <P> Approved ventilation systems were to have been completed and working by June  15, 1988, but none were installed because the restaurant group persuaded the  City Council to grant a series of extensions.  </P> <P> "I think this is a very fair and equitable (ordinance) and it's been a long  time in coming, but I think it's workable," Councilwoman Vicki Reynolds said.  </P></p>

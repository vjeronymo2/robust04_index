			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / EU steel dumping claim European Union steelmakers are to file an anti-dumping complaint, alleging Czech and Hungarian structural steel suppliers have under-cut EU prices by up to 50 per cent. The east Europeans increased their EU market share almost threefold to 9 per cent last year, and had captured 27 per cent of total German sales by the final quarter, the Dusseldorf-based federal steel association said yesterday. Czech suppliers had been particularly aggressive, it added, raising their share in Germany from an average 5 per cent in the first nine months of 1993 to more than 18 per cent in the final quarter. The complaint regarding structural steel, widely used in construction, will be posted later this week by the EU's Eurofer industry group, which will claim unfair tactics are costing western steel companies DM320m (Pounds 130m) a year.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Recession aids Intrum Justitia INTRUM Justitia, Europe's largest debt collection agency, pushed up pre-tax profits 26 per cent to Pounds 16m in the year ended last December in spite of finding it harder to reclaim money from hard-pressed consumers. 'We get more debtors in recession; but they are less likely to pay back,' said Ms Gunilla Demnert, finance director. The recession had seen a 'big increase' in work related to higher income debtors within its consumer-debt portfolio, which accounts for nearly a third of the company's turnover. 'The AB social classes are much better debtors than the CDs,' Ms Demnert added. Consequently, the group hopes for a significant upturn when recovery gets under way. The Dutch-based but London listed company handled 3m new cases across Europe in 1992, up 20 per cent on 1991; its stock of cases at the year end was 2.6m, an increase of 24 per cent. But the average handling time for consumer collection cases was 9 per cent longer than in 1991 at 10.9 months, and the recovery success rate was down from 23 per cent to 21 per cent. Debts pursued by the company averaged about Pounds 500. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 16m compared with Pounds 12.6m a year earlier under the new FRS 3 accounting rules. Turnover on continuing operations rose by 5.6 per cent to Pounds 80.8m. Including Pounds 4.47m income from a French acquisition made last year, and Pounds 3.64m from a release of provision, total turnover was up 16.2 per cent. Earnings per share rose to 9.2p (from 9.1p). A final dividend of 2p a share is proposed, taking the total for the year to 3p (from 2.4p). With net borrowings of Pounds 16.6m at the year-end, gearing was steady at 27 per cent. Mr Bo Goranson, chief executive, said that after several years of acquisition-led growth, the company intended to consolidate. But with half of Intrum Justitia's turnover generated in Scandinavia, he added that growth potential was 'immense'. The UK, with 29 per cent of turnover, is its next highest earner. The Pounds 3.6m release of provision followed a legal ruling in Sweden confirming the company's full fee entitlement for written-off debt surveillance cases, which reduced the risk of them being withdrawn by clients.</p>

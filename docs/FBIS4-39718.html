			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 10 June TASS -- The leadership of  Tajikistan informed military authorities of the Afghan province  of Kunduz bordering on Tajikistan the Republic's profound  concern of the attempts of extremists from among the Tajik armed  opposition located there to prevent by force the repatriation of  Tajik refugees from Afghanistan.    The refugees willing to return home are subjected to threats  and acts of terror are also threatened against representatives  of international peacekeeping organisations in the Afghan port  of Shirkhan on the border with Tajikistan.    On Wednesday, 8 June, the compound of the mission from the  U.N. supreme commission for refugees and a car were damaged by  the explosion of a mine planted by the militants. Also on  Wednesday, Russian border guards found and defused and explosive  device on board a barge which was bringing 242 Tajik refugees  home from the Afghan port, ITAR-TASS was told by Chairman of the  Tajik Parliament's working group for the repatriation of  refugees from Kunduz Takhir Akhmedov.    Akhmedov stressed that during a meeting with the deputy  security chief of the province, Mr. Majidkhan, Tajik officials  made it clear that they want the local Afghan authorities to  detain and punish those guilty of the acts of terror, and ensure  security of more than 200,000 Tajik refugees who are now in  transit camps near Shirkhan and of employees of international  missions.    Akhmedov said an official representative of the Kunduz  military authorities assured the Tajik authorities that relevant  measures would be taken to suppress acts of provocation.    As concerns the process of repatriation of Tajik refugees  from Afghanistan, Takhir Akhmedov said that despite attempts by  Tajik armed opposition in Afghanistan at preventing the return  by force, the process is becoming irreversible. One thousand  and fifty hundred refugees returned from Afghanistan to  Tajikistan in the past two days alone. The total number of  people who have returned home has exceeded 30,000.</p>

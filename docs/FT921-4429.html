			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Rise to Pounds 3.7m at optimistic Cornwell Cornwell Parker, the upmarket furniture and fabrics company, yesterday announced a marginal increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.6m to Pounds 3.7m for the six months to end January. Mr Martin Jourdan, chairman, said the results reflected cost controls and stronger profits from the furniture division, which includes Parker Knoll. Parker Knoll's furniture is targeted at the 45 year old and upwards market and is relatively insulated from recession. Mr Jourdan also reported the first signs of upturn and was hopeful about consumer spending. 'We are seeing the end of the recession in our market,' he said. Cornwell Parker's fabrics division reported lower profits due to reduced sales. But sales of new ranges, launched since last Autumn, were described as encouraging. Turnover slipped to Pounds 44.1m (Pounds 46.1m). The company has eliminated all borrowings and interest charges fell to Pounds 66,000 (Pounds 315,000). This helped lift earnings to 6.2p (5.9p) and the company is increasing its interim dividend 6.3 per cent to 1.7p.</p>

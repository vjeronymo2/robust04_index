			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / France to send more troops into Sarajevo FRANCE said yesterday it would send 1,200-1,300 more troops to the Sarajevo region in Bosnia to back up the European Community's Copenhagen summit pledge to protect Moslems there. The EC pledge of men and money for United Nations peacekeeping in Bosnia had been made at France's initiative, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, told parliament yesterday, and it was therefore up to France to set an example. 'France believes that a significant (military) presence on the ground, coupled with the maintenance of sanctions, is the only way to reach a settlement of this painful problem,' he said. The statement came as the French Defence Ministry announced that General Philippe Morillon was about to be replaced as commander of UN troops in Bosnia and would be given another prominent post. Another senior French officer, General Jean Cot, would be assuming overall command of UN forces in former Yugoslavia, replacing Sweden's General Lars-Eric Wahlgren, the statement added. France has the largest contingent of soldiers in the area, with some 5,000 serving in the 23,000-strong UN force. The French reinforcements in Sarajevo will consist of 800 more troops to be flown from France, and another 400-500 drawn from Zagreb and the Serb-populated Krajina region in Croatia and from the north-west corner of Bosnia around Bihac. They will join the 2,500 French troops already in Bosnia. Mr Francois Leotard, France's defence minister, said the reinforcements would be in place within two weeks, and would allow the UN to redeploy Ukrainian forces from Sarajevo to other Moslem enclaves like Gorazde. President Francois Mitterrand seems to have taken his ministers and officials slightly aback with his strong intervention in Copenhagen in favour of EC states doing more in Bosnia. But the conservative government has rallied swiftly around the Socialist president, with Mr Balladur saying that 'cohabitation', far from weakening France, had strengthened its international position. French officials said that the Moslem community in Bosnia had to have some military security if it was to be able to negotiate and sign any settlement with the Serbs and Croats. Mr Balladur yesterday again rejected the idea, canvassed by Germany in Copenhagen, of selectively arming the Moslems to defend themselves. 'This would put an end to any hopes of a peaceful settlement,' he told parliament. In recent weeks, France had said it would not send any more troops to ex-Yugoslavia, though it had also said it might redeploy troops from Croatia to Bosnia.</p>

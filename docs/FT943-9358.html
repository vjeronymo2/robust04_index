			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Maize price slump expected Fine weather and favourable rains over the past month are expected to produce a near-record maize harvest in the US which could force prices down by as much as 20 per cent. The US department of agriculture this morning is expected to forecast a maize crop of about 9.3bn bushels (1 bushel=56lb). That figure would come close to equalling the harvest of 1992, when US farmers produced 9.5bn bushels. It would also be well above last year's meagre 6.3bn bushel crop, which was affected by flooding during the growing season. 'We've got a big crop in super condition, and that typically means low prices and big demand,' said Mr Bill Biederman, an analyst with the research firm Allendale, Inc. This is good news for companies which store and handle grain, and for the railroads and barge lines that transport the crop. Grain analysts predict that the price of a bushel of maize traded for December delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade could fall below Dollars 1.89 - nearly 20 per cent lower than today's prices. However the price of maize has fallen steadily since early July, and other analysts are less bearish in their outlook. 'The US supply will be up, but the world supply will be almost unchanged,' said Mr Daniel Basse, a principal with Agresources in Chicago. On the demand side, the USDA report is expected to reflect heavy maize consumption by the US livestock industry. The USDA will also report on US soyabean production data today, and the average trade estimate is a harvest of around 2.3bn bushels. That is also a much larger crop than last year, and producers will face competition from what promises to be a record Canadian Canola harvest.</p>

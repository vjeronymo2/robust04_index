			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / World Trade News: US study defends multinationals THE US's failure to improve its trade position with Japan stems from 'the relative paucity' of its direct investment there, according to a report released yesterday by the Emergency Committee for American Trade. Ecat, comprising leaders of about 60 large US corporations, has produced an updated defence of the contribution US multinationals make to the American economy. It asserts that multinationals, rather than exporting jobs, produce exports which provide the best paid and most secure positions in the US. The higher the share of US investment in manufacturing facilities abroad, the more likely it is the US has a merchandise trade surplus with that country, the Mainstay II report says. Thus, a US worried about imbalances between it and the rest of the world might be better off pushing for an end to foreign investment barriers, rather than pursuing invisible and formal barriers to trade. After the dollar began to weaken in 1985, US exports rose sharply, accounting for 89 per cent of economic growth between 1989 and 1991. US multinationals accounted for about two-thirds of manufactured exports. 'Industries with the highest levels of foreign investment have the highest rate of exports and export growth,' the report says. The home country gets remittances from royalties, profits and fees, which in turn create new jobs. The report rejects the argument that foreign investors produce abroad to take advantage of low wages and re-export cheap products to the US. Excluding Canada, only 7.2 per cent of total sales by US manufacturing affiliates were to the US market in 1990, a percentage largely unchanged in the last two decades. The study says the number of multinational jobs declined only 0.5 per cent from 1982 to 1989 - a quarter of the average decline of the Fortune 500 industrial companies.

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Newman Tonks emerges with Pounds 9.7m Newman Tonks, the biggest manufacturer in Europe of architectural hardware, has emerged from its extensive reorganisation with a 20 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30. Profits grew to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 8.11m) on total turnover of Pounds 135.6m (Pounds 128.7m). The shares eased 1p to 176p. Mr Geoff Gahan, chief executive, said that as much reorganisation as was necessary at the moment had been carried out. In the half year only a further 50 net jobs from a total of 4,500 had been lost. Between 1990 and June 1993 some 18 per cent of the workforce had been shed. Mr Gahan said that although he believed the recession in the construction industry - in which 90 per cent of Tonks' business is involved - had ended, the recovery had not yet begun. However, he conceded that there had been 'a strengthening in the forward order position.' The US turned in the brightest performance, with operating profits up 50 per cent to Pounds 2.96m on turnover 10 per cent ahead at Pounds 29.6m. With the US recession, and the subsequent rationalisation there, pre-dating the European downturn by two to three years, the transatlantic business now had high operational gearing, where higher volumes quickly fed through to the profits line. Mr Gahan hoped the same process would be repeated in the UK and Europe, the group's other main markets. UK profits rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 4.24m on turnover fractionally up at Pounds 81.9m (Pounds 81.4m). Mr Gahan said he wanted profits to grow on the back of new products - the group spends about Pounds 8m a year on research and development. These costs are charged to the UK operation. At June 30, borrowings stood at Pounds 33.6m (Pounds 27.9m at December 31) for gearing of 48 per cent. The increase followed April's Pounds 2.1m redemption of convertible preference shares and a Pounds 3.5m US acquisition. Earnings rose 35 per cent to 5.04p (3.73p) and the interim dividend 9 per cent to 2.75p (2.53p). Mr Gahan said he wanted to lift cover as well as the payment.</p>

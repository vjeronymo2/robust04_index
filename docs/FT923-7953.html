			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Aegis restructuring proposals unpalatable says James Capel RESTRUCTURING proposals announced last week by Aegis, the European media buyer, were yesterday criticised as 'uniformly unpalatable' by James Capel, the broker. Aegis, which last month saw the resignation of Mr Peter Scott as chairman, is planning a refinancing which will further increase the control of its two main shareholders, Mr Gilbert Gross and Warburg Pincus, the US investment bank. Mr Gross is still due deferred payments from Aegis after it bought his Carat business in France in 1988. In a circular, prepared by its media research team, Capel argues that Mr Gross and certain associates are being allowed to lift their stake in Aegis when its share price is weak because of Mr Scott's resignation and uncertainty about a French government inquiry into media buying companies. 'Shareholders are seeing earnings per share sacrificed and their interests generally being unrepresented,' the circular said. Aegis rejected the criticism as unfair. 'We are convinced the package is in the interests of all shareholders,' it said. The proposed refinancing will lift the stake held by Mr Gross and his associates, mainly group managers, from 26.8 per cent to 42.4 per cent, although they will only hold 33.8 per cent of the voting rights. Warburg Pincus will increase its share of voting rights from 14.8 per cent to 16.4 per cent. The proposals need approval from 75 per cent of shareholders at an extraordinary meeting next month, where Mr Gross and his associates will not be able to vote. Some UK institutions are unhappy because the company's share price has collapsed from 129p earlier this year to 39p yesterday. They are also concerned by Aegis's decision to shift its head office to Paris since this will free the company from London's takeover code.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 2 Jun (AFP) -- National Police  Commissioner Alonso Salamanca has admitted that police have  violated human rights. He requested today that one official and  two agents be investigated for torturing a union member.    In the first action he has taken as national police  commissioner--a newly created post--Salamanca asked the local  police commander to file charges against Captain Wilson Laverde  and agents Cesar Cacua and Pedro Tangarife. According to a  preliminary investigation, Laverde, Cacua, and Tangarife  tortured union leader Luis Antonio Tellez physically and  psychologically.    Tellez and his partner Aida Luz Martinez had been arrested  for distributing subversive literature and throwing explosive  devices to disturb public order during a march to commemorate  Labor Day on 1 May.    According to the commissioner, the police tortured Tellez  physically and psychologically to obtain a confession that was  not a true assessment of the activities in which he was involved.    Criticizing the incident, Salamanca said this violation  constitutes a serious attack against the validity of human  rights and the image of the institution. Salamanca added that  his office will follow very closely the progress of the  investigation to be initiated by the local police commander.    The incident was revealed at a time the government is  conducting a thorough review of human rights in order to improve  the country's image before the international community. As part  of this campaign, the government has scheduled a meeting with  its 14 ambassadors in Europe on 9 June.</p>

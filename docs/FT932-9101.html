			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Smith sets block vote deadline MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, insisted yesterday that this autumn's party conference must agree to introduce 'one-member, one-vote' for the selection of parliamentary candidates and for electing party leaders. Speaking to the Fire Brigades Union conference in Bridlington, he said the party had to recognise the need to modernise its democratic processes. His backing for the voting system may upset some union leaders who oppose it because they believe it will weaken the traditional links between the party and the unions. The difficulty of Mr Smith's task in winning agreement for the change was underlined yesterday when Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, argued instead for the introduction of a register of trade unionists who are Labour supporters - an option Mr Smith does not favour. They would participate in the selection of Labour parliamentary candidates and election of the party leader and deputy leader. Mr Smith's stand comes in the face of growing opposition among some of the largest unions. So far, only the AEEU engineering union has backed the proposals. The unions will have 70 per cent of the vote at party conference this year and Mr Smith will need to secure 21 per cent from them as well as all of the constituency parties for the 51 per cent vote needed to make the change. Leaders of six of the biggest unions are due to meet again next week to try to reach agreement on an alternative to one-member, one-vote that might win wider support at the party conference. Mr Smith will address the MSF technical union's conference on Monday when he intends to underline his determination to see the changes through. He will also speak at the TGWU general union's conference in the summer, before the July meeting of Labour's ruling national executive committee which is expected to decide what changes are recommended to the conference. As well as re-stating his commitment to modernising the party's links with the unions, Mr Smith also used yesterday's speech to launch a renewed attack on Mr John Major and his style of government and to call for a new sense of direction. Against a background of a threat of industrial action from the fire service over pay, he also attacked the government's imposition of a 1.5 per cent ceiling on public-sector wages, saying it was 'disgraceful' that public-sector workers should pay the price of the government's mistakes.</p>

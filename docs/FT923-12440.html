			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Sport: How I took my Vitamins - Cricket I HAVE not often served Stilton as a soft cheese. Such was the heat and humidity on a recent Sunday that I managed to do it at the picnic before the Intellectuals' annual cricket match. It was about all I did manage, apart from taking a wicket with my first ball, when it was too late to make a difference. The game was in the tradition of Intellectual ineptitude, on display in a contest as amicable as it was uneven. It really is true to say that it does not matter who won, because the play provided such sparkling oddities that the result could not hope to compete with what had gone before it. Even better, I don't know what the result was. We did not get the 185 we were set at tea by our opponents, the Vitamins, but we had slightly less batting time and we only lost seven wickets. We could not have won, we probably lost, but we may have drawn. The Red Arrows flew past, over and round the ground, just before the game, obviously in our honour. I won the toss. After that, things lost a bit of momentum. We should have batted. It would have been less exhausting. But we bowled. I remembered what Derek Underwood, the Kent and England left-arm bowler, had told me: psychology was the strongest weapon in cricket and I put this year's psychological weapons on to bowl. At one end: Noel, whose accurate bowling had taken six for four last year. At the other: Simon, a 6 ft 6 in researcher into medieval Spain and an unusual bowler. He holds his bowling arm straight out behind him as he runs in to deliver the ball from a prodigious height, with prodigious effect. 'Even if you can't think of a good move, make it look as if you've got one planned,' Underwood had said. 'Look dangerous. Finger the ball. Adjust the field. Worry the batsman.' Simon's high-flying beamers and upwards wides looked dangerous. They must, surely, have worried the batsmen but, alas, only enough to induce one to help the ball on its way for a straight six. Dramatic stuff, fast bowling. With the score at 50 for 0, I moved myself in to field at an extremely silly mid-on, smiling at the batsman, close enough to see the individual hairs in his eyebrows. The Vitamins' volunteer umpire told me, correctly, that I could not field so close in if I distracted the batsman. But I reckoned that was the batsman's problem and sighed, sadly, for our customary umpires, who both away in Devon, leaving the game bereft of their magisterial silence. I caught one opener near his knees when he had made 27. The other retired at 65 not out. Nice, but humiliating. Over 100 scored with only two batsmen gone. The Intellectuals' morale was low and fielding poor as we slipped in streams of our own sweat. At this point Martin, a university don, changed the game with his bowling. It was not bowling to the Underwood prescription, shot through with threats. Rather, it was of the enigmatic school. It mesmerised rather than alarmed. His first ball floated in all directions through the warm, sticky breeze, then drifted softly down towards the stumps. The batsman shouldered arms and left it, only to suffer the double indignity of seeing the ball remove the bails and the bowler burst into incredulous laughter. By the time Martin had removed two more Vitamins for two runs in nine balls, he was almost hysterical with mirth and ended up lying on the grass, crying with laughter. Bowling of inconceivable subtlety. No other Intellectual could hope to compete with it, though I, too, took a wicket with my first ball. The difference was that mine was a loose ball. The batsman swiped, the ball found an edge and the catch was taken. The Vitamins had slid from 121-1 to 145-5. But the heat interfered with the flight of my bowling and it was hit with some force. My penultimate ball was not bad and the umpire told me so with an air of kindly surprise. As I came up to bowl my last ball, I told him cheerfully that he was a patronising, sexist bastard, which the all-rounder lawyer on our team considered bad politics; better to be obsequious to umpires. But it was tea-time; nothing mattered. They were 184-5 declared and we were only too happy to sit down and drink. By the time we strode out to bat, there were fewer of us. One member had left for the hospital, with a daughter injured while watching. Charles limped to the crease at No 6, injured while watching the earlier batting too actively with his daughters. But it is quality, not quantity, that counts. Our brave wicket-keeper opened well with Noel, who ended the day in triumphant exhaustion, 59 not out. He looks well schooled. Noel's father struck a quick series of fiery blows, only one of them not producing a run. Charles, inspired by his painful leg, always yearned for the boundary, exquisitely straight driving for four the first ball he received. Our lawyer batted stoically. I was doing my stint as umpire and could see it all from close at hand. Even so, I am ashamed to admit that extras were our second highest scorer, with 25 out of our total of 170-7. This was partly due to the enterprise of a round-arm Vitamin called Henderson, who bowled six wides in nine balls, using something akin to the old-time slinging action. I must not give the impression that it was a stupid game. It was not. It had some strange moments but it also contained some high-class cricket and was played seriously and light-heartedly throughout.</p>

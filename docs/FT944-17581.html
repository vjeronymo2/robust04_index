			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Arts: Mahler, and too much more - Music in London On Wednesday the Barbican Hall's Mahler cycle reached the Third Symphony (repeated last night). And very impressive it was; but it would have seemed still better had it stood alone, instead of following two extraneous pieces in an over-egged programme. One admired the stamina of Michael Tilson Thomas and the London Symphony, but regretted not having more of it oneself. Nemesis came at the quietest moment of the Adagio finale, when a solo flute asks a tremulous question before the ultimate climax. In the hush, two women decided that they had to leave - doubtless for the last train home: the programme had already overrun its time half an hour - and struggled out, clop clop clop] It was a pity, but it was inevitable. Mahler strove regularly after an ideal, the symphony that would make a whole concert - a whole expressive world - by itself. Here, before the unnecessary interval we had already had two superfluous bonnes bouches. An early Brahms set of Romantic songs, op. 17, for women's voices with pairs of harps and horns, was entirely charming. After an elaborate re-peopling of the stage, we heard George Benjamin's brief Jubilation, an ILEA commission from 1985 for extravagant forces including a steel band. It tickled the ear, but made no jubilant report: some misfire there. For the sake of these 20-odd minutes of music plus interval, we had to wait more than an hour before the Mahler Third began. Can interval-sales at the bar really be so important? But the symphony did begin resplendently, with eight horns flinging out their unison challenge; and in fact Tilson Thomas held our attention in thrall to the end. Along with the Seventh, the Third used to be the Mahler symphony least favoured by performances. Too wild and disparate, it was thought, and the finale too dangerously near to kitsch; and yet it now sounds like a mainstream masterpiece. How much our ears have changed] Tilson Thomas made the long first movement properly overbearing and barbarous, but never strident. The 'minuet' was artfully prinked out, the scherzo brilliantly spring-heeled and varied. As in the Second Symphony last week, Nathalie Stutzmann was the superb contralto soloist, heartfelt and plangent in both the Nietzsche movement and the Wunderhorn one with the London Symphony Chorus and the excellent Southend Boys' Choir. And the Adagio was a tour de force: rigorously sustained and gripping, but interpreted with a wealth of discreet, canny freedoms. Not the most affecting performance I've heard  - but colossal, magnificently thought through. The orchestra deserved unlimited praise. Thursday's concert sponsored by Nikon UK Ltd.</p>

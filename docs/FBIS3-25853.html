			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Lo Feng (5012 2800): "Ding Guangen </F> Relayed Deng Xiaoping's Instructions to Political Bureau at the  End of Last Year--Speed Up Economic Development"]    [Text] Hong Kong 29 Jan (LIEN HO PAO)--A CPC high-ranking  figure disclosed that Deng Xiaoping indirectly aired his views  at the end of last year on the "relationship between being fast  or slow" in economic growth, while demanding that the economic  growth rate not be slowed. He believed that the annual GNP  growth rate should not be under 12 percent. However, the State  Council has stipulated the GNP growth rate for this year to be 9  percent.    Deng Xiaoping had not summoned Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, or Zhu  Rongji since July last year. His remarks were made to Ding  Guangen, his bridge partner, who relayed the message to the  central Political Bureau.    Ding Guangen said that recently, Comrade Xiaoping had aired  his views on economic growth rate being fast or slow; he  believed that should the economic growth be too fast, it would  inevitably bring side effects, such as inflation and an  imbalance between supply and demand.    Deng Xiaoping indicated that economic growth should be  viewed  in a dialectical way; people should not always be scared of  inflation surfacing and an imbalance between supply and demand  whenever a fast growth rate is advocated.    Deng Xiaoping stressed: "Only with a fast growth rate will  it be possible for our economy to possess a solid foundation,  ensure the employment rate, and reduce social contradictions."    It has been learned that earlier last year, Deng Xiaoping  said that we must have an annual 12 percent economic growth  rate; otherwise, China will never reach the level of a  moderately developed country.    The source said that Deng Xiaoping's remarks had an "obvious  target" because some members of the central authorities  vigorously advocated slowing the economic growth rate. At the  economic work conference last year, the GNP was stipulated to be  9 percent. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's target was 9 to 10 percent  and he believed that this index would ensure economic growth  while maintaining social stability.    In recent years, Deng Xiaoping has vigorously advocated  speeding up the growth rate. The precise reason why he made the  southern inspection tour in the spring of 1992 was that he was  unhappy about the dullness and seeming stagnation of the  three-year improvement and consolidation. What he mainly  required was that the economy "mounted a new plane every several  years."    The essence of Deng Xiaoping's current talks did not go  beyond those he delivered during his southern inspection tour in  1992. Although Deng Xiaoping was repeating his own words, they  had a particularly clear target at this specific moment. The  leading members in office were very sensitive about it but they  have not publicly propagated Deng's remarks as of today lest  they should rekindle the just dampened local government craze  for investment, which would then become even more difficult to  control.    It has also been learned that at a recent high-ranking  conference in Beijing, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji declared that the  tasks for macroeconomic regulation and control had not been  completed; currently, it is still necessary to reduce the  momentum of inflation, the trend to widen the capital  construction scope, and the volume of bank loans and money  issued. The main task for 1994 is a soft landing and it is  primarily necessary to do a good job of reform.    Local governments were all drawing up their plans for  dealing  with the central reform measures, especially for banking and tax  reform. It is said that Guangdong and Jiangsu already have  their well thought out plans, whereas other localities are  sending personnel to Guangdong to learn from its experiences by  taking advantage of extending greetings for the Spring Festival.    The source said that Deng Xiaoping does not have any current  plan to conduct a "second inspection tour" down south to  Guangdong; nevertheless, it is thought that he will make an  appearance and say something during the Spring Festival to set  the principle and guidelines for the National People's Congress  and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  upcoming in March.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aslak Bonde: "Majority Yes Opens for New Battle"] </F>   [Text] Norway will not automatically become a member of the  EU [European Union] even if there is a majority in favor in the  referendum.    The EU battle in Norway will not be over with the  referendum.  If the majority say yes to the EU there will be an intense  battle in the Storting around the final decision.    In Norway a referendum is only advisory. The final decision  as to whether to adopt the government's recommendation to become  a member of the EU lies with the Storting. According to Article  93 of the Constitution, it requires a three-quarters majority of  the Storting for Norway to join.    In the election campaign last year the Socialist Left Party  and the Center Party made it clear that they would not vote for  EU membership if the yes side in the referendum won by a slim  margin. Together the two parties have 45 members in the  Storting: more than one-quarter of the seats.    The problem became apparent long before last year's  election,  and the Conservative, Labor, and Progress Parties have as a  result proposed various constitutional amendments that would  make it possible to bypass the three- quarters requirement.    To amend the Constitution only requires two-thirds majority.    The problem the yes parties face is that there are more  opponents to the EU than those in the Center Party and the  Socialist Left Party. In addition the Christian People's Party  had made it clear that they do not wish to "change the rules of  the game in the middle of the game." So far this has been  interpreted as the Christian People's Party's not wanting to  lend support to any of the proposed amendments.    The Christian People's Party, the Socialist Left, and the  Center Party have 58 Storting representatives together: two  representatives more than they need to block a constitutional  amendment.    The EU agreement this week, coupled with the assumption that  there will be a referendum in November, has given new life to  speculations on how the Storting in the final analysis will view  the referendum.    Labor Party leader Thorbjorn Jagland has previously stated  that there will be some in the Center and Socialist Left Parties  who will respect a slim majority in a referendum. The belief is  that the pressure from the public to respect the people's  decision will become so strong that many will yield.    Other EU supporters in the Storting think some in the  Christian People's Party will decide, at the decisive moment, to  vote for a constitutional amendment, thus leaving it up to the  cabinet, not the Storting, to make the final decision about EU  membership.    It will be a while before the issues are fully thrashed out.  For tactical reasons the parties will want to wait as long as  possible before taking a stand. Additionally, there may be  instances where individual representatives break with their own  parliamentary groups.</p>

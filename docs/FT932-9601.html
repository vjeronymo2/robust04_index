			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers defend bus deregulation TRANSPORT ministers yesterday launched a spirited defence of their proposals to deregulate London's bus services - and rejected widespread criticism from local authorities and London transport that the move will lead to road congestion and fare rises in the capital. Mr Steven Norris, minister for transport in London, told the transport committee that plans for deregulation would proceed in spite of the criticism, since this was the only way 'to offer the services people want'. The government intends to introduce the issue into the next parliamentary session, to bring London into line with bus services outside the capital, which were deregulated in the mid 1980s. Nevertheless, responding to criticism that bus deregulation elsewhere had contributed to road congestion and falling numbers of bus passengers, Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister, conceded that some fine-tuning might be necessary in the future. Traffic commissioners and Local Authorities could be given greater powers to prevent over-congestion on profitable routes. At the same time, the level of funding for 'bus priority measures', such as special bus lanes, would be raised. He insisted that 'social reasons', rather than deregulation, had been the main reason for the falling number of bus passengers in the past.</p>

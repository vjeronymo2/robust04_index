			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Surge forecast for car output UK CAR production will begin to rise strongly next year as two new Japanese plants come on stream and the UK market starts a slow recovery after three years of recession, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says in its latest forecast. It adds that UK car production will rise by 12 per cent to 1.4m next year from this year's 1.25m, and will reach 1.5m in 1994. The SMMT suggests that UK demand for new cars will begin to pick up next year from the deep recession of the past three years with sales rising to 1.62m next year and 1.75m in 1994. UK sales of new cars peaked in 1989 at 2.3m but have fallen by about a third in the past three years to 1.59m last year and 1.56m this year. The SMMT also expects demand for new commercial vehicles to begin to recover next year. Sales of trucks above 3.5 tonnes have more than halved in the past three years from 69,234 in 1989 to an expected 30,800 this year, the lowest level since 1954. Demand is forecast by the SMMT to recover to 35,500 next year with a further rise to 41,400 in 1994. UK car output has performed relatively well during the recession with much higher production for export markets largely making up for lower output for the home market. Production fell by only 4.8 per cent from the peak of 1.3m in 1989 to 1.24m in 1991 in spite of a 30.9 per cent fall in UK sales of new cars in the same period. UK car production is now set to rise significantly throughout the 1990s largely as a result of the three new car plants under development by Nissan, Toyota and Honda. The Nissan plant at Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, which began limited volume output in 1986, is expected to increase output next year to 270,000 from 175,000 this year. The plant is developing a capacity to produce 300,000 cars a year. Honda began initial car production at its plant in Swindon, Wilts, last month and Toyota will begin car output next month at its Pounds 700m Burnaston plant near Derby. According to the latest forecast by DRI Europe, the UK-based automotive analysts, UK car output will rise from 1.4m next year to reach a record 2m in 1997. UK car production reached its previous peak in 1972 at 1.92m, but then declined rapidly in the following decade to reach a low point of 888,000 in 1982. The DRI forecast says production by the three Japanese carmakers in the UK will have jumped to 660,000 by 1997 from 125,000 last year and will account for about a third of UK car output by the late 1990s. Rising output by Nissan and by Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, was the driving force behind UK car production in the first nine months this year, figures released by the SMMT showed yesterday. Higher production by these two carmakers compensated for lower output by Rover and Ford. The specialist luxury carmakers continue to be hard hit, however, with Rolls-Royce suffering a 35 per cent drop in output in the first nine months, and Jaguar declining by 25 per cent. Vauxhall has won one of its largest single orders from British Telecommunications for cars and vans worth Pounds 105m at showroom prices, John Griffiths writes. The three-year order is for 10,000 vehicles including 5,000 Cavaliers, 1,500 Astra cars and 2,500 Astra vans. BT runs one of the largest vehicle fleets in Europe and last month placed an order with Ford worth Pounds 220m at showroom prices for 8,300 Transit vans and chassis cabs, as well as 9,000 Escort and 1,500 Fiesta vans. The actual value of the orders to manufacturers is lower because of discounts, which can be 30 per cent or more on large contracts.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       UK VEHICLE PRODUCTION  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       1992        1991      1992/91                                     Jan-Sept    Jan-Sept    % Change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CARS Total                                  962,133     944,382       +1.9 Rover (British Aerospace )             277,722     304,162       -8.7  -cars****                             250,720     277,230       -9.6  -Range Rover/Discovery                 27,002      26,932       +0.3 Ford (excl.

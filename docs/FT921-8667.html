			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / UK Company News: White heir is promised the crown - David Clarke, eventual head of Hanson in the US MR DAVID Clarke, the 50-year-old president of Hanson Industries in the US, yesterday named by Lord White as his eventual successor to the executive chairmanship, said he would never forget the first time the two met. On a freezing winter's day 18 years ago Mr Clarke, backed up by a small army of lawyers and advisers, waited in a New York office to meet the man who wanted to buy his family business, Seacoast Products, for Dollars 32m. Mr Gordon White, as he was then, entered the meeting alone but with a terrible cold. He immediately took him outside for a face-to-face meeting and bluntly asked: 'David, are you sure this company is worth Dollars 32m?' Mr Clarke believed it was. That was enough for Mr White, who bought the company. Lord White, now aged 69, yesterday said he liked Mr Clarke because he reacted well to his direct business approach. Mr Clarke, who had only worked for his family business since he left New York state's Hobart College in 1964, had given it to him straight, so he hired him as his deputy. In 1975, Hanson Industries, which still only consisted of Seacoast, a manufacturer of fish oil, experienced its worst crisis. The price of fish oil crashed. Mr Clarke remembers warning Lord White that operating profits were about to slump from Dollars 17m to Dollars 7m. It was then that Lord White decided that he would focus more on acquisitions, while Mr Clarke would focus on running the business. By the following year Lord White had acquired Carisbrook Industries and Hygrade Food Products, while Mr Clarke squeezed Dollars 3m of costs out of Seacoast, and then Hanson record of increased yearly profits. In 1978 Mr Clarke was appointed president of Hanson Industries, a post he has held ever since. One of Hanson's advisers, who has known the two men for more than a decade, says: 'Gordon and David have built up an extraordinary relationship. David looks to Gordon almost as a father, certainly for his inspiration, while Gordon increasingly relies on David as he begins to take over more of the day-to-day running of the US businesses.' Mr Clarke says that Lord White asked him to create in the US the 'mirror image' of the UK side of Hanson. To that end Mr Clarke built up a loyal team at the centre who would descend on the companies that Lord White had acquired and turn them round by cutting costs and rationalising the businesses. While Mr Clarke is fulsome in his praise of Lord White, describing him as 'the greatest motivator of people', he yesterday made it clear that, as executive chairman of Hanson Industries, he would be different from Lord White. Mr Clarke believes that profit increases in the 1990s will be dependent on organic growth, instead of relying solely on acquisitions. 'This is the first year since 1975 that we are looking through a gun barrel,' he says. 'If people are saying that Hanson needs another mega-bid to grow, they are looking at it the wrong way. Commentators should start to look at Hanson as an operating business. I would guess that the main bulk of our profits this year will come from the running of our own businesses, such as Cavenham Forests, Peabody Coal and Beazer.' Mr Clarke was quick to add that he was not saying Hanson was shifting from acquisition growth to organic growth. 'If there's a mega-deal out there that is reasonably priced we should probably go for it. But it would be a mistake to say that we have to do a deal.' To maximise profits from existing businesses Mr Clarke has earmarked about Dollars 300m (Pounds 165.7m) for capital expenditure, about Dollars 50m more than last year. He is also considering what he calls bolt-on acquisitions to existing companies. If there is a lesson to be learned from the group's decision to take a 2.8 per cent stake in ICI, Mr Clarke says Hanson should be more open about its 'excellent' corporate governance. 'We have a director who has put on weight recently. Lord Hanson warned me at lunch today that he (the director) was putting too much salt on his meal. That is corporate governance at its best'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Reference News" by Kuan Chung (7070 6988): "Disturbance </F> Takes Place in Hefei Prison"]    [Text] At 2100 on 1 May, more than 200 convicts in two  blocks of Hefei Prison collectively refused to sleep in protest  against the prison authorities. According to prison rules,  Sundays and national holidays should be nonworking days. This  year, International Labor Day, that is, 1 May, happened to be on  a Sunday. The following Monday should thus have been a  compensation day for the convicts. However, the prison  authorities announced that routine work would continue on 2 May.  The decision aroused protests from the convicts, who all  refused to sleep. The prisoners sang the song "Unity Is  Strength" and shouted slogans, such as "guaranteeing off days,  opposing forced work" and "we want to meet leaders, oppose  suppression." At 2300 that evening, the convicts opened the  doors of their blocks and staged a sit-in in the prison yard.  Guards fired warning shots and drove the convicts back into  their cells. Then, the two sides fought [as published]. It is  said that there were more than 30 casualties. One prison guard  was killed by rioting convicts with iron bars and three  prisoners were shot dead. After the incident, the prison  authorities were forced to cancel "normal work" on 2 May.</p>

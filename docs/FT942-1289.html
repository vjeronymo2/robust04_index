			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Warsaw equities fall 2.6% Poland's privatisation ministry announced yesterday that it would be lowering the minimum share offer price for Rolimpex, a state-owned farm products trader, as the country's stock market tumble hit privatisation revenues and new share issues. Warsaw's equity market fell a further 2.6 per cent yesterday in heavy volume, bringing its drop on the week to 14 per cent. The government was originally planning to offer half of the shares in Rolimpex at a minimum of 300,000 zlotys per share, which would have valued the company on a price/earnings ratio of 14, a premium to the current multiple of 11 for the bourse. Mr Andrzej Gruszka, a government official, said the minimum price would certainly be lowered by the time the offer opened on July 4. Meanwhile, Elektrim, the power energy and telecommunications equipment specialist which has a rights issue on offer, faces having to turn to the underwriters as the slide on the bourse has left the rights price, of 1.2m zlotys, far above the current share price of 785,000 zlotys. Polifarb Cieszyn, the paint producer, and Okocim, a brewery, which are both listed on the stock exchange, have also been forced to place the majority of their rights issues with underwriters.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (4): The sheen has faded - Japanese Perspective The sheen has faded for executive carmakers in Japan. After six consecutive years of double-digit growth, with sales 69.1 per cent higher in the year ending in March 1991, top-of-the-line vehicle builders are coming to terms with the maturing of the domestic market. The slowdown has come as a shock to Japanese makers who invested in new capacity on the presumption that the hectic growth of the late 1980s would continue through the 1990s. The sluggishness has given these makers all the more incentive to broaden their market share in Europe and the US. European carmakers have also been forced to rethink their strategies in the Japanese executive car market. When imports rose by 35 per cent in 1989, the Japanese market appeared the most lucrative in the world, but that rapid growth now seems more a by-product of the bubble era than a sustainable rate of expansion in an increasingly competitive market. Sales volumes for Japanese cars with engines above 2,000cc - regarded as luxury-class vehicles - for the fiscal year ending March, were down 2.1 per cent, compared to the 7.2 per cent decline of total new car sales, excluding mini-cars. Japan's leading executive car producers, confronted by the realities of economic downturn are now recalculating their longer-term projections. Even an immediate economic recovery will hardly produce the sudden surges in sales that were characteristic of the late 1980s. Mr Ken Sawada, general manager of the international department at the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association, expects sales growth of about 1 per cent over the next few years. Japanese consumers' emphasis in 1993 is on value not luxury. Companies are cutting administrative costs and reducing the number of cars available to executives. Individual buyers are holding onto their cars for longer periods or looking to second-hand vehicles. Last year, second-hand car sales grew 4.2 per cent. That trend is also reflected in the luxury market. While the nation's new car ownership rose 3 per cent last year, sales of used cars with engines bigger than 2,000cc increased by 33.2 per cent, according to the Japan Automobile Dealers Association. Japanese carmakers hope they have already touched bottom, as better figures in March, when sales rose by 5.9 per cent, have generally been hailed as a sign that the economy and the car industry are heading into better times. Toyota was the luxury leader in Japan for 1992 with a 42 per cent share, while Nissan captured second place with 20.7 per cent and Honda acquired third place with 13 per cent. Mitsubishi and Mazda claimed 4.25 and 4.50 per cent of the domestic luxury car business respectively. The Mazda case highlights the changed conditions in Japan. The Hiroshima-based carmaker was hoping that its Amati would be in the big league with Toyota's Lexus, Nissan's Infiniti and Honda's Acura - called the Legend in Europe - the three luxury brands that are making inroads into the international market at the expense of manufacturers such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz of Germany. Mazda cancelled plans in March to produce cars in Europe with Ford and dumped blueprints last October to set up a separate dealer network in the US and Canada to sell high-priced cars under the Amati name. The fifth-ranked Japanese carmaker has been unable to keep pace with the heavy investments needed to compete in the luxury sector. Mazda is expecting pre-tax profits for the fiscal year ended in March to drop 69 per cent to Y6bn yen, and simply does not have the resources or the models to match Nissan and Toyota at present. During the bubble era of the late 1980s, when the Nikkei average rose ever higher, many companies were able to raise funds at almost no cost and they supplemented profits with financial dealings known as zaiteku. But the fall in stock prices and the market's inability to digest new issues has made carmakers more conscious of capital costs and return on investment. In response to the nation's sluggish economy and low demand, co-operative relationships among Japanese vehicle makers are on the rise, where each company serves as the ideal supplier of models or parts for the other. Also, Japanese carmakers strive to trim production costs by standardising parts and reducing personnel. Nissan, for example, plans to cut full-time staff by about 10 per cent by 1995, while Honda has cut one shift at its Saitama factory. Mr Takashi Oka, general manager of passenger car production planning and marketing at Nissan's technical centre in Atsugi City, said that Japan's carmakers were having to come to terms with new a identity. He recalled that 30 years ago, prices were low and quality was poor, yet Japanese still bought vehicles. 'Ten years ago, the quality was good and the prices were low and people bought them; now the quality is good but prices are high', he said, explaining that consumers had their price limits. Awareness of these limits is part of the 1990s atmosphere. The troubles at home have not dampened the enthusiasm of carmakers to build a share in the European and the US executive car markets. Toyota and Honda started producing cars in the UK last year, alongside Nissan, which has been producing in Britain for six years. Mitsubishi is laying the ground work for a 1994-95 joint venture plant with Volvo in the Netherlands. But the recent appreciation of the yen puts extra pressure on Japanese carmakers who had hoped to have a pricing and quality edge over western competition. In the US, the strong yen, coupled with improved consumer perception of American cars, has eroded Japanese carmakers' market share, which in February was 27.2 per cent - the lowest level since 1989. According to Mr Rainer Jahn, president of Mercedes-Benz Japan and chairman of the European Business Council's automotive committee, EC luxury car manufacturers who invested heavily in the Japanese market at a time when the nation's economy was considered invincible in the late 1980s, will eventually benefit from a Japanese economic recovery. The fact that the total Japanese market has been growing over the past 15 years has created space for importers. But whether imports of foreign cars will expand rapidly is open to question, Mr Jahn noted. So far, the downfall of Japan's powerful economy has hurt EC manufacturers, which dominate about 75 per cent of the imported car market in Japan. Sales volumes of EC carmakers fell 14.5 per cent last year, compared to an overall drop of 8.6 per cent for the passenger car sales. Meanwhile Ford, General Motors and Chrysler collectively increased sales by 3 per cent, according to the Japan Automobile Importers Association. The big gains on imported cars are ironically being made by Japanese producers. In March, for the first time, the top-selling manufacturer of imported cars in Japan was Honda, overtaking Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, which have traditionally dominated the market. Honda's success shows that Japanese carmakers are not relaxing. They continue to emphasise quality and reliability, and may emerge when the present downturn ends even better equipped to compete with their European rivals. Mr Oka at Nissan said that while corporate attitudes to cost had changed, the value-orientation of customers was not much different than during the 1980s. He is confident that rapid growth will return by the end of the decade. However, it is not clear how long the downturn in Japan will last. Japanese carmakers have found it difficult to forget the rapid growth of the recent past, and still expect the executive car market to be an engine for profit growth. It is not clear how much room for expansion remains on Japan's already clogged roads.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment and Preliminary Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> APHIS regulations at 7 CFR part 340, which were promulgated pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 150aa&hyph;150jj, 151&hyph;167, and 1622n, and 31 U.S.C. 9701, regulate the introduction (importation, interstate movement, and release into the environment) of certain genetically engineered organisms and products. The regulations at &sect;340.6 provide for a petition process for issuing a determination that certain plants that do not present a plant pest risk no longer need to be regulated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The crookneck squash ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cucurbita pepo  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> L. cultivar YC77E ZW&hyph;20)(ZW&hyph;20), developed by Upjohn, has been considered a regulated article under 7 CFR part 340, in part because it has been engineered with coat protein (CP) from watermelon mosaic virus 2 (WMV2) and zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), and in part because the vector system used to transfer viral CP genes into the recipient squash was derived from the bacterial plant pathogen  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agrobacterium tumefaciens.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, certain noncoding regulatory sequences were derived from plant pathogens, i.e., from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A. tumefaciens  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and from cauliflower mosaic virus and cucumber mosaic virus. Field tests of the ZW&hyph;20 squash have been conducted under APHIS permits each year from 1990 through 1994 under conditions of reproductive confinement. The environmental assessments (EAs) prepared by APHIS in conjunction with the issuance of permits for field tests of ZW&hyph;20 have addressed various attributes of the squash line. The EA to be addressed at the public meeting examines the potential environmental impacts that might be associated with the unconfined cultivation of ZW&hyph;20 squash, as requested in the petition from Upjohn. The effect of a determination favorable to the petition would be that permits under the regulations would no longer be required from APHIS for field testing, importation, or interstate movement of these squash or their progeny. Importation of ZW&hyph;20 squash or seeds capable of propagation would still be subject to restrictions found in the Foreign Quarantine Notices at 7 CFR part 319. The findings that support a preliminary finding of no significant impact on the environment from a determination that the ZW&hyph;20 squash would no longer be a regulated article include the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Growing ZW&hyph;20 squash would present no significant increase in the development of new plant viruses as compared to plants infected with both ZYMV and WMV2; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The ability of ZW&hyph;20 squash to resist infection by WMV2 and ZYMV should not lead to this squash becoming a weed pest; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Pollination of free-living  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cucurbita pepo  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (FLCP) plants by the ZW&hyph;20 squash is not likely to increase the weediness of any resultant progeny; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Introgression and maintenance of the virus resistance trait from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ZW&hyph;20 squash into the gene pool of FLCP is unlikely. Based upon surveys of FLCP, the incidence of pathology or disease resulting from infection by ZYMV or WMV2 is not high enough to result in a selective pressure that would maintain the resistance genes in FLCP populations; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. APHIS cannot identify any impacts on nontarget organisms recognized as beneficial from the unconfined cultivation of ZW&hyph;20 squash; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The release of ZW&hyph;20 squash from regulation would have no identifiable impact on agricultural commodities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The environmental assessment and preliminary finding of no significant impact have been prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381&hyph;50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272&hyph;51274, August 31, 1979). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Done in Washington, DC, this 17th day of May 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William S.

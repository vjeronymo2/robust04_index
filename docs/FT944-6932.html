			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Books: What Popper never said - AC Grayling assesses a misunderstood philosopher THE MYTH OF THE FRAMEWORK by Karl R. Popper Routledge Pounds 25, 229 pages KNOWLEDGE AND THE MIND-BODY PROBLEM by Karl R. Popper Routledge Pounds 20, 158 pages It was characteristic of Karl Popper that when he died two months ago he had just finished another two books. With his death the last of this century's great British philosophical triumvirate - Russell, Wittgenstein and Popper himself - passed away. Comparison-drawers like to say that he was, by quite a margin, less clever than Russell and less imaginative than Wittgenstein. Yet of the three he is easily the most influential outside academic circles. That influence extends in two important directions: science and politics. Surprisingly, many scientists claim that Popper's views benefited their work. An outstanding example is Sir John Eccles, the Nobel-winning physiologist who later collaborated with Popper on a book about the mind-brain link. Like other scientists, he points to Popper's account of scientific method, the famous doctrine of 'falsificationism', as his inspiration. Popper was an intellectually robust and confident thinker. The reasons lie partly in his origins. He was born into a wealthy and cultured Viennese family. He was a distant relative of Freud and in early adult life friendly with, although not a member of, the famous Vienna Circle of philosophers. He left Austria because of Nazism and lived, first in New Zealand and then, for the rest of his long life, in England, where he taught at the London School of Economics. He died aged 92. Success came late, in his forties; but once it had arrived he was feted everywhere. Popper was indefatigable. In his last months he was busy preparing these two books for the press. One of them continues his lifelong dedication to defending science and rational criticism as 'a way of thinking and living'. In it he gives a statement of his 'confession of faith  .. in peace, in humanity, in tolerance, in modesty, in trying to learn from one's own mistakes; and in the possibilities of critical discussion.' The second book consists of lectures defending the highly unfashionable 'dualist' view that mind and body are separate but interacting entities. Both books are characteristically Popperian: argumentative, opinionated, conciliatory, emphatic, outdated, up-to-date, interesting, and full both of holes and very bright ideas. One might not agree with everything in Popper, but he always makes stimulating reading. The judgments about Popper of both scientists and right-wingers - many of whom lay claim to him because of his attack on Marxism and his defence of 'the open society' - are mistaken. Popper did not succeed in formulating a watertight account of scientific method, and he did not hold or promote right-wing views. But it is easy to see why people thought he had done both: he was tireless in explaining his ideas to a wide public, rightly refusing to confine himself to the academic world. But his wider audience has not heard the careful response of academia to his views, and therefore knows only one side of the story. Popper's theories about science are based on a strikingly simple insight. Scientific investigation, he noted, was thought to go as follows: an hypothesis is formulated, and predictions are made about what, if the hypothesis is true, should happen when experiments are conducted. The hypothesis is confirmed if the results are as predicted: the greater the number of positive results, the more securely is it confirmed. But Popper saw that a single negative result can overthrow an hypothesis. Any number of positive results might accumulate in its support while it yet remains vulnerable to a counter-instance. A hypothesis therefore cannot be proved, he argued; the best we can ever say is that it is 'acceptable so far', but that someone may sometime come up with a single piece of evidence that disproves it. Science accordingly progresses by 'conjecture and refutation'. Popper believed his falsificationist theory achieved two things at the same time. First, it provided a test of what counts as a genuinely scientific hypothesis. Second, it solved the thorny old 'problem of induction'. An example of inductive reasoning is: 'Every swan I have seen is white, so all swans must be white.' The problem is: how can one be sure? On the first question, Popper said that if an hypothesis cannot be proved wrong, it is not only unscientific, but worthless: 'a theory which explains everything explains nothing'. Astrology, psychoanalysis and religion all fall into this category, because none of them states what evidence would prove its claims to be false. If astrology, for example, can accommodate any proffered counter-example it is untestable and therefore vacuous. Thus Popper's falsification criterion distinguishes between genuine enquiry and nonsense. Marxism is a different matter. It claims to be scientific, and it makes specific and therefore testable predictions. The problem with Marxism is that it has failed those tests: history has shown it to be false. Yet despite this, Popper points out, its adherents continue to believe it. Popper argued that science does not, as philosophers used to believe, consist in the process of supporting a general proposition by accumulating instances. Such inferences are notoriously upsettable, and there are no watertight means of justifying them. The old view of scientific procedure, confirming hypotheses by positive tests, portrays science as inductive. Popper's claim, by contrast, is that science is deductive. Inductive inference would be all right if we could rely on the 'principle of the uniformity of nature', which states that the world works in regular and patterned ways. Such a principle would allow us to predict that the future will resemble the past. But the principle can itself only be justified inductively ('past futures resembled past pasts'). We cannot be sure that this will always be the case. Popper therefore wished to reject induction. Unfortunately, his view covertly appeals to the principle of nature's uniformity also, for counter-instances can be taken to refute hypotheses only if we can be sure that the world will not change tomorrow in a way that makes the hypotheses suddenly true, thus falsifying the counter-instances themselves. It might seem obvious that a piece of evidence which disproves an hypothesis may be used in exactly the same way to support the opposite hypothesis, namely the original proposition was false; but in the latter case the evidence is obviously being employed in the way Popper contests, that is, inductively. There are many other difficulties with Popper's views. He did not manage to state convincing theses about truth and the nature of reality; he refused to investigate how scientific hypotheses come to be formulated in the first place; and he did not provide an account of scientific reasoning which makes use of models and analogies, investigative tools much discussed by other philosophers of science. Popper's politics have fared better at the hands of his critics. It is clear that those who claim him for the Right have not read his work. He used to say that he would call himself a socialist if socialism would seriously commit itself to individual liberty. For Popper, the 'open society' is one in which rational discussion leads to fair, decent, open and consensual political arrangements and in which quiet assessment of the facts informs every decision. His Open Society and Its Enemies not only attacked Marx, it also attacked Plato. The authoritarian state of Plato's Republic, ruled by an oligarchy, relying on slavery, practising eugenics, disenfranchising women and most classes, has had its closest expression in recent Fascist dictatorships. Popper attacked excesses on both the left and right.</p>

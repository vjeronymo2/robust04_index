			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 6 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic is not  presently exporting any weapons to Iran, Ilja Mazanek, director  of the Foreign Ministry's Middle Eastern and North African  Department told CTK today.    If the ministry ever does grant an export license for  weapons  shipments to Iran, it will only be in accord with international  interests, according to international agreements, and following  a tough licensing process, Mazanek said.    He emphasized that no UN sanctions were currently in place  against Iran as there were against Libya and Iraq, but that Iran  nevertheless was considered a "sensitive" area, and consequently  weapons deliveries that could be "problematic" would not be  condoned. Such deliveries included not only weapons, but  components for nuclear power plants.    Mazanek said that so far no firm had applied for a license  to  export parts to Iran for Warsaw Pact-model tanks which had been  delivered to Iran in the past.</p>

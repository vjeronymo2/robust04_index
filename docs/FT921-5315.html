			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: AT&amp;T and Varity to make job cuts AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T), the US telecommunications company, is to shed between 3,000 to 6,000 non-management and 200 to 400 management jobs with the closure of 31 offices in 21 states by the end of 1994, AP-DJ reports from New Jersey. AT&amp;T said yesterday the job losses and office closures would result from plans to introduce its new voice-recognition technology nationwide, automating many long-distance calls now handled by operators. Developed by AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, this technology recognises and responds to the human voice. The company said it based its decision to eliminate the positions and close the offices on 'a growing trend among callers to place long-distance calls without operator assistance, on other recent improvements in operator-services technology, and on the introduction of voice recognition'. The company currently employs about 18,000 operators. AT&amp;T said it hopes to offer other jobs to affected employees and has identified eight types of job openings likely to occur between 1992 and 1994. Those not placed will receive severance of up to 104 weeks' pay. Meanwhile, Varity, maker of Massey-Ferguson farm machinery and Perkins diesel engines, is to cut another 1,300 jobs and sell five subsidiaries as part of a renewed effort to staunch its losses, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. Varity said the latest round of layoffs would cut its payroll to 16,800 by the end of the year. This level represents a 20 per cent reduction compared with two years ago and only about a quarter of the workforce in the company's heyday in the late 1970s when it was known as Massey-Ferguson. Mr Victor Rice, Varity's chairman, said that the latest measures were a response to 'severe and prolonged recessionary conditions' in leading markets and the company expected no near-term improvement in conditions. Besides farm and industrial machinery, Varity's interests include Kelsey-Hayes, a Michigan-based manufacturer of anti-lock brakes and other vehicle components. Automotive products now contribute more than 40 per cent of revenues. Varity, which moved its head office last year from Toronto to Buffalo, New York state, hoped to return to the black in the middle of last year, but suffered a Dollars 62.7m loss for the nine months to October 31. The restructuring will result in special charges of Dollars 110m, to be included in fourth-quarter results due for release later this month. About Dollars 70m of the total will reflect the writedown of five non-core businesses which are being put up for sale.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (8): A weak export performance - Trade IN COMMON with almost every other African country, Kenya is trying to reduce dependence on a narrow range of commodity exports and develop non-traditional exports, especially of manufacturers. It has made little progress, in spite of the reversal of policies which, until the mid-1980s, ensured that it was more profitable to produce and sell domestically than export. Trade liberalisation and a supportive exchange rate policy are beginning to change that but since 1985 the dollar value of exports has increased less than 10 per cent. The main reason for this sluggish performance was the collapse of coffee prices in 1987. Prices more than doubled between 1982 and 1986 before falling 36 per cent in 1987. After a strong recovery in 1988, they reverted to their depressed 1987 levels last year, and have since fallen still further. This has been partially offset by the rise in tea prices, which have more than doubled over the past 10 years. The blame for the country's weak export performance cannot be laid at the door of volatile commodity prices alone. At the end of the 1980s, the share of exports in GDP was averaging 12 per cent, compared with 19 per cent 10 years earlier. The most exciting development has been the growth of horticulture. The value of horticultural exports has doubled since the mid-1980s to Dollars 140m and they are the fourth largest foreign currency earner after tourism, tea and coffee. The lacklustre performance of manufactured exports, which at Dollars 94m in 1990 were worth less than in 1980 (Dollars 109m), continues to disappoint. Trade figures must be interpreted cautiously, since there the informal exports are not reflected in the official data. One industrialist estimates that up to 30 per cent of his company's products are sold in neighbouring territories, but only 5 per cent is officially recorded as exports. In spite of this disappointing performance, Kenyan businessmen are confident they can develop non-traditional exports. The key prerequisites for a much-improved export performance are a marked reduction in inflation, liberal import policies, greater efficiency on the part of the transport parastatals, and an active exchange rate policy. Experience in the early 1980s demonstrated that the wrong conditions - expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, trade controls and an over-valued exchange rate - will bias production towards the domestic market. That is now accepted, and the establishment of export processing zones and the manufacturing under bond scheme are evidence of an aggressive export strategy. An important element has been exchange rate policy, with the real effective rate for the Kenya shilling depreciating more than 40 per cent since 1985. This, in combination with falling real wages, has improved the country's international competitiveness - though there is little evidence as yet of an upsurge in non-traditional export volumes. Kenyan optimism over its ability to penetrate neighbouring markets is tempered by recognition that South Africa - and Zimbabwe, following its recent sharp devaluation - will become increasingly aggressive competitors in regional markets. Furthermore, even where Kenya has a cost-leadership edge, quality, product design and packaging standards do not measure up to international standards, nor is there much evidence of a dynamic export culture, especially in manufacturing. The impact of trade reform is apparent in the changed and changing structure of exports. Horticulture, in which Kenya has a clear comparative advantage, is benefiting; while two exports in which Kenya does not have competitive advantage - cement and transport equipment - have declined. Imports are dominated by capital equipment - 37 per cent of the total, manufactures (18 per cent), intermediate goods (16 per cent) and fuel (15 per cent). The import substitution strategy that dominated foreign trade policy before structural adjustment was launched has been progressively abandoned, first with the abolition of direct controls, and second with the reform of the tariff structure - reducing the average rate of protection and simplifying the tariff book. In theory, imports are freely available, but in practice there is a queueing system for licences caused by the foreign currency shortage. The EC dominates the direction of trade accounting for 45 per cent of both exports and imports. Britain is the main trading partner with an 18 per cent share of the Kenyan market and purchasing 17.5 per cent of exports in 1990. Japan has a 9 per cent market share, while the United Arab Emirates, with 13 per cent of the market in 1990 (during a period of high oil prices), is the main supplier of oil. Japan's imports from Kenya are negligible (Dollars 13m in 1990), and there is obvious scope for broadening regional trade. Kenya has a Dollars 170m recorded trade surplus with the rest of Africa, with exports of Dollars 235m and imports of only Dollars 65m. The actual trade surplus is significantly higher, given substantial unrecorded exports with neighbouring countries, especially Uganda and Tanzania. In 1990, these two countries accounted for 8 per cent of total exports and more than half Kenya's African business. For adjustment to succeed, trade patterns must change, since the obvious market opportunities for manufactured exports are in Africa, and especially within the 19-member Preferential Trade Area (PTA), where Kenya, Zimbabwe and Mauritius are the big players. South African imports are bound to grow rapidly over the next few years, and other African suppliers, the UK and some Asian exporters will lose market share.</p>

Defending the might of our single-hearted unity around the  party and the leader like the apples of our eyes and further  displaying it are decisive factors guaranteeing triumphs for  this year's march.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: We should  defend the revolutionary ranks' single-hearted unity, which has  been consolidated under the leadership of our party, like the  apples of our eyes, and further develop and consolidate it.    Single-hearted unity is a immortal tradition of glory and a  immortal banner of victory. Our people have strived heroically  by closely rallying around the party and the leader. As a  result, they have triumphantly overcome countless difficulties  and trials lying in the way of the revolution and set up a  strong socialist country of self-dependence, self-support, and  self-reliant defense on this land.    Last year, in which the fatherland and revolution were faced  with a stern trial, our people proudly defended sovereignty and  security of the socialist fatherland and achieved a big success  in socialist economic construction thanks to the might of  single-hearted unity.    We should ardently adhere to the tradition of glorious  single- hearted unity and further bring full play to the might  of it so as to fully display the superiority of the socialism of  our own style and complete the socialist cause of chuche to the  end in any storm. Firmly consolidating single-hearted unity  among our revolutionary ranks is an important requirement for  the environment of our revolution and enormous tasks arising  before us.    The imperialists and reactionaries are intensifying an  unprecedented offensive in political, economic, military,  diplomatic, and all other spheres to isolate, stifle, and crush  [korip, chilsik, apsal] the Republic which is advancing under  the banner of socialism. Due to the enemies' anti-Republic and  antisocialist maneuvers, the situation in our country became  extremely tense and complicated, and countless obstacles were  laid before us. Under such conditions, we should uphold the  banner of single-hearted unity higher in order to effect a  revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction by waging a  movement to carry out the revolutionary economic strategy of our  party.    Our single-hearted unity is unity of ideology and action of  the whole party and the entire people who follow the great  leader [suryong] and the illustrious leader [yongdoja] with  unquestioned worship.    There are no obstacles nor fortresses that we cannot  overcome  or occupy when we march by upholding the might of great  single-hearted unity that is unprecedented in history. The road  to smashing every step of vicious anti-Republic and  antisocialist maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries  and bringing full play to the spirit of the chuche Korea lie in  displaying the might of single-hearted unity. In addition, the  road to consolidating the foundations of the nation's  independent economy rock-solid by vigorously accelerating the  general onward march of socialism lies in the fact that all the  people unite single-heartedly around the party.    The ideology on all the more strengthening the single-  hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks which was elucidated in  the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address, is a  precious guideline which provided a decisive guarantee in the  victory of this year's battle. Here lies the great leader's  lofty will of trying to bring about a historical turning point  in our country's revolution and construction this year by all  the more highly manifesting the might of our single-hearted  unity of the entire party, all the people, and the entire Army  solidly uniting around the great leader [yongdoja].    All the party members and workers must all the more  consolidate and develop our single-hearted unity in accordance  with the prevailing situation and the demand of the  revolutionary development to brilliantly realize the militant  task presented in the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New  Year address and achieve greater victories in the struggle to  advance the cause of socialism of our own style.    Most of all, all the party members and workers must have a  deep understanding of the leader's [yongdoja] greatness. Also,  it is important for them to have a clear faith of absolutely  having faith in and following their leader [suryong] and their  leader [yongdoja] in whatever kind of environment.    The might of unity of the revolutionary ranks is the firm  might of faith of all the people toward the leader [yongdoja].  Our dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a peerless great man  who is combined with both literary and military accomplishments  as well as loyalty and filial piety. He is also the fate and  future of our fatherland, nation, and socialism of our own style.    All the party members and workers must experience in their  hearts of how we are upholding such a great leader [yongdoja] at  the head of the party, the revolutionary ranks, and the people's  Armed Forces through our revolutionary's proud reality which is  advancing without the slightest wavering amid the world's  disturbances.    We must always deeply bear in our hearts the rock-firm faith  that the fatherland exists because of the leader [yongdoja] and  that our happiness and the prosperity of the posterity is  guaranteed, and uphold the dear comrade leader with  single-hearted loyalty and filial piety.    Comrade Yi In-mo is a magnificent example in absolutely  admiring and following the dear comrade leader who is the center  of unity of our revolution and the center of leadership. As  concentratedly reflected in the poem dedicated to the dear  comrade leader filled with the single-hearted unity of loyalty,  Comrade Yi In-mo's ideological and spiritual world is truly a  lofty spiritual world which can be possessed only by a true  revolutionary who shares the fate with the leader [yongdoja] to  the end in whatever hardships.    All the party members and workers must reflect themselves in  the spiritual world of Comrade Yi In-mo and must endlessly  cultivate themselves to become genuine loyalists.    The great chuche idea is the ideological basis of our  single-  hearted unity. All the people are firmly guaranteeing the  consistency of ideology and behavior according to the demand of  the chuche idea. Here lies the invincible might of our  single-hearted unity.    The party members and workers must deeply bear in their  minds  that the chuche idea is the life of socialism of our own style  and must all the more firmly arm themselves with the chuche  idea. In particular, the work to deeply study the great  leader's classic works and the dear comrade leader's documents  which completely compiles the chuche idea, theory, and method  must be carried out steadily.    We must deeply study the great leader's New Year address of  this year by analyzing it in detail and firmly arm ourselves  with its profound ideology. Along with this, we must continue  to energetically study the dear comrade leader's immortal works  including, "Interference in Socialism Cannot Be Tolerated," and  "The Historical Lesson in Socialist Construction and Our Party's  General Line," so that we can all the more firmly consolidate  the faith that we will always win as long as the great leader  [yongdoja] exists who is leading our revolution toward the one  road of chuche.    Our single-hearted unity is a strong driving force of the  socialist construction and its might must be wholly manifested  in the practical struggle to accelerate socialist economic  construction. In accordance with the changing environment and  the actual demand of our country's socialist construction, our  party today presented the method on moving toward the road of  agriculture first, light industry first, and trade first and is  calling the whole party and all the people to fulfill it.    We must consolidate like bedrock the country's independent  economic basis, all the more enhance the people's living  standard, and wholly display the might of unity of our people  which is firmly united around the party and the leader in  today's worthwhile struggle to occupy a new offensive camp for  the domination of a higher ground in socialism.    All the party members and workers must highly manifest  endless devotion and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance  and fortitude toward the party and the revolution so that the  plan of the people's economy which they are entrusted with can  be accomplished at an appropriate time and without fail.    When the party members and workers of all sectors of the  people's economy exert strenuous efforts by highly upholding the  party's intention to help and lead each other and highly  manifest the popular heroism, we can magnificently fulfill any  kind of task we are faced with this year.    To elucidate socialism of our own style through the might of  single-hearted unity, the communist virtue which is overflowing  in all of the society must all the more be fully blossomed. Our  people's revolutionary trait which is single-heartedly united  around the party and the leader must be vigorously displayed in  highly manifesting the communist virtue of all the members of  society helping and leading each other according to the  collective principle of one for all and all for one.    We must substantially carry out the work to establish a  revolutionary outlook on life, and persistently carry out the  work well to learn the beautiful ideological, spiritual, and  moral traits of the pioneers of the communist virtue so that  laudable communist acts can be highly manifested. In  particular, we must all the more fully blossom the virtue of  Army-people unity which has been highly manifested traditionally.    All the party members and workers must not forget even a  second that we are living and struggling with the strong  willpower and optimism because of the People's Army led by our  comrade supreme commander. Therefore, they must assist the  People's Army from the bottom of their hearts and love the  People's Army as if it is their own flesh and blood. By doing  so, work must be carried out to all the more loudly resound the  shouts of hurrah of the ideology of Army-people unity anywhere.    The party organizations and functionaries are possessed of  an  important duty in further firmly consolidating our  single-hearted unity and highly manifesting its might. The  party organizations must adhere to and elucidate the tradition  of single-hearted unity. This must be put forth as a [words  indistinct] work related to the fate of socialism of our own  style and must yield everything to it.    The party organizations must consistently carry out all work  so that it can all the more firmly consolidate our  single-hearted unity. In particular, priority must be put into  thoroughly embodying the politics of benevolence presented by  the dear comrade leader who endlessly loves the people.    Our functionaries are the core force of the party and  faithful servants of the people. The role of the functionaries  is importantly dependent on how great our party's politics of  love and politics of faith toward the people is actually brought  about. All the functionaries must uphold the party's slogan of,  "Serving the People," and must sincerely work as a messenger of  the people and take pains so that the party's benefits and  considerations can be all the more extended to the people well.    All the guiding functionaries must substantially and  persistently carry out the revolutionization and working  classification work of themselves so that the revolutionary and  people-oriented work method and work style can be all the more  embodied. This is to make all the guiding functionaries into  genuine functionaries and true messenger of the people in which  the masses truly respect and follow.    The single-hearted unity is our most mighty weapon and  strength to advocate, adhere to, and complete socialism of our  own style to the end. As long as there is the wise leadership  of the party and the leader, and the single-hearted unity united  like bedrock around the great leader [suryong] and the great  leader [yongdoja], there is nothing to be afraid of in this  world.    Let us all the more move forward by highly upholding the  banner of single-hearted unity with redoubled courage and  unshakable confidence so that the resolute spirit of the heroic  Korea can once again be displayed in this year's socialist  general onward march.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency </F> President Alija Izetbegovic in Sarajevo by Mehmet Ali Birand in  the studio; from the "32d Day" program -- live, in English with  simultaneous translation into Turkish; transcribed from the  English]    [Text] [Birand] Mr. President, I would like to express  the heartfelt sympathy of the Turkish public. We share your  horror and your sorrow. Would you now please tell me what is  the actual situation in Sarajevo? Is the bombing still going on?    [Izetbegovic] The bombing continues, but with less intensity  than before. But the Serbian snipers from the neighboring  fields are very active today. They roam the streets, and it is  very dangerous.    [Birand] Now, sir, do you feel that this time the West will  really move and take military action?    [Izetbegovic] Just an initiative by Butrus Butrus-Ghali, as  you know, maybe, and today from the European Union also. In my  opinion, a military action is probable. If I have to assess the  possibility, I could say that it is 50-50.    [Birand] You are not 100-percent sure. It is still 50-50?    [Izetbegovic] Yes.    [Birand] Do you believe that the bombing of the surrounding  hills of Sarajevo will deter the Serbs, or do you think that  only a very strong military action with ground forces will stop  the Serbs?    [Izetbegovic] In my opinion, an air strike, an action from  the air, would be enough, would be sufficient. We do not expect  any ground operation. This ground operation is not necessary,  because we have enough of our boys to fight.    [Birand] I see. How much longer can you hold if the West  does not take any military action and restricts its power to  just lip service?    [Izetbegovic] Now it is a matter of survival. We will never  surrender. We cannot surrender. It is a question of to be or  not to be, to live or to die. We will never surrender, and the  Serbs can never enter Sarajevo.    [Birand] Mr. President, why is the West not moving? Do you  have an explanation?    [Izetbegovic] What can you say? The West is at the same  time rich and poor. It is at the same time strong and weak. It  is a matter of moral weakness in the Western world. They are  not ready to fight.    [Birand] Mr. President, now you are speaking directly to  millions of Turkish citizens. Now tell us what we can do to  help you.    [Izetbegovic] I am very happy to greet your listeners and  the Turkish people. I would like to convey my cordial greetings  to your listeners. I would like to first congratulate the  coming Ramadan and to thank for all your support and help. We  have many friends and brothers in the world, all over the world.  We know that you are our brothers and our friends. Thank you  for all that. We do not feel alone in the world. Thank you.    [Birand] Mr. President, thank you very much indeed.    [Izetbegovic] Thank you.</p>

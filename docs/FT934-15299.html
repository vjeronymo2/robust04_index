			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Eurotunnel tremor Shares in Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel closed 6 off at 488p, having been lower, after it cut revenue forecasts and disclosed that it would need further funding before the Tunnel's official opening next May. The revenue forecast for 1994 was cut by Pounds 44.5m to Pounds 224.1m and the group plans to raise at least Pounds 500m in fresh equity next year. UBS was said to have reiterated its 'sell' advise to investors, while other brokers also remain cautious. However, much of the dealing in the stock takes place in Paris where it is also quoted and volume in London remained light.</p>

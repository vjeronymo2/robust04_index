			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Eagle Trust charges dropped CHARGES BROUGHT against two businessmen in connection with Eagle Trust, the Midlands mini-conglomerate, were dropped by the Serious Fraud Office yesterday, John Mason writes. Mr Richard Smith, a former Eagle Trust managing director, was due for trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court on four charges of theft involving Pounds 11.5m allegedly stolen from the company and one of deception. Mr Leslie Goodwin, a former chairman of Connect Parcels, the delivery company, faced two theft charges involving Pounds 11.5m and one of providing false information. Not guilty verdicts on all counts were returned at the direction of the judge. The trial of Mr Martin Baker, a former Eagle Trust finance director, will go ahead on September 6. He is charged with four counts of theft involving Pounds 12.25m. All three had stood trial with Mr John Ferriday, former Eagle Trust chairman and chief executive, but proceedings were postponed after the judge ruled they should be tried separately.</p>

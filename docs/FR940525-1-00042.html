			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Items With a 100 Percent Conversion Factor.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A 100 percent conversion factor applies to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> direct credit substitutes, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  which include  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> guarantees,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> or equivalent instruments, backing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> financial <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  claims, such as outstanding securities, loans, and other financial obligations, or backing off-balance sheet items that require capital under the risk-based capital framework. These direct credit substitutes include, for example,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> financial standby letters of credit, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  or other equivalent irrevocable undertakings or surety arrangements, that effectively guarantee repayment of financial obligations such as: commercial paper, tax-exempt securities, commercial or individual loans or other debt obligations, or standby or commercial letters of credit. As described in section II.B.6 of this appendix A, purchases of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> subordinated securities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  or of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> servicing rights  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> may give rise to a direct credit substitute. The full amount of a bank's exposure under a direct credit substitute is converted at 100 percent and the resulting credit equivalent amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, the distinguishing characteristics of a financial standby letter of credit for risk-based capital purposes is the combination of irrevocability with the notion that funding is triggered by some failure to repay or perform on a financial obligation. Thus, any commitment (by whatever name) that involves an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> irrevocable <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  obligation to make a payment to the customer or to a third party in the event the customer  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> fails to repay <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  an outstanding debt obligation will be treated, for risk-based capital purposes, as a financial standby letter of credit and the full amount of the bank's exposure under the letter of credit will be assigned a 100 percent conversion factor. (Performance-related standby letters of credit are assigned a conversion factor of 50 percent.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A bank that has conveyed a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> risk participation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>  in a direct credit substitute to a third party should convert the full amount of its exposure under the direct credit substitute at a 100 percent conversion factor without deducting the risk participations conveyed. However, portions of direct credit substitutes that have been conveyed as risk participations to U.S. depository institutions and OECD banks may then be assigned to the 20 percent risk category that is appropriate for claims guaranteed by U.S. depository institutions and OECD banks, rather than to the risk category appropriate to the account party obligor. <FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>  A bank acquiring a risk participation in a direct credit substitute or bankers acceptance should convert the full amount of its exposure under the participation at 100 percent and then assign the credit equivalent amount to the risk category that is appropriate to the account party obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> That is, participations in which the originating bank remains liable to the beneficiary for the full amount of the direct credit substitute if the party that has acquired the participation fails to pay when the instrument is drawn upon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Risk participations with a remaining maturity of one year or less that are conveyed to non-OECD banks are also assigned to the 20 percent risk weight category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In the case of direct credit substitutes that are structured in the form of a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> syndication <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  as defined in the instructions for the preparation of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (that is, where each bank is obligated only for its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> share of the risk and there is no recourse to the originating bank), each bank will only include its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  share of its exposure under the direct credit substitute in its risk-based capital calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Sale and repurchase agreements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> asset sales with recourse, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  if not already included on the balance sheet, and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> forward agreements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  are also converted at 100 percent. Accordingly, the entire amount of any assets transferred with recourse that are not already included on the balance sheet, including pools of one-to-four family residential mortgages, is to be converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. In certain recourse transactions (including those that are reported as financings on a bank's balance sheet) the amount of the bank's contractual liability may be limited to an amount less than the full effective risk-based capital requirement for the assets being transferred with recourse. In such cases, the amount of capital that must be maintained against the transaction is limited to the maximum amount of possible loss under the recourse provision. So-called ``loan strips'' and similar arrangements involving short-term loans sold by a bank without direct recourse but subject to long-term loan commitments by the bank are accorded the same treatment for risk-based capital purposes as assets sold with recourse. The definition of the term ``recourse'' is set forth in section II.B.6 of this appendix A. Forward agreements are legally binding contractual obligations to purchase assets with drawdown which is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> certain <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  at a specified future date. These obligations include forward purchases, forward deposits placed, and partly paid shares and securities but do not include forward foreign exchange rate contracts or commitments to make residential mortgage loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Office of Thrift Supervision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12 CFR Chapter V  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] There is a natural gas problem in Kyrgyzstan again.  RIA was told by the government's press service that debt for  gas to neighboring Uzbekistan currently amounts to approximately  10 million U.S. dollars. The lion's share of that sum consists  of the debts of the Republic's industrial sector due to its  insolvency. The government and local administrations are also  unable to subsidize gas consumption for the private sector.  Kyrgyz authorities have been instructed to review gas charges  with a view toward raising them, as a solution to a situation in  which Uzbekistan may, at any moment, turn off the tap of natural  gas supplies.</p>

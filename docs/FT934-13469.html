			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Gartmore forecasts advance to Pounds 24.5m  -Pathfinder for placing and public offer indicates market capitalisation of Pounds 300m GARTMORE, the investment fund manager owned by Banque Indosuez of France, yesterday forecast a 64 per cent rise in pro-forma profits to Pounds 24.5m before tax for the 1993 year in its pathfinder prospectus. Banque Indosuez, which acquired Gartmore from British and Commonwealth, the failed financial services group, in 1990 for about Pounds 130m, is to float 25 per cent of its wholly owned subsidiary next month. Gartmore itself will not be issuing any new shares. The shares to be sold will be divided between a placing, primarily with institutions, and a public offer. Gartmore is expected to have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 300m. Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, Banque Indosuez chairman, yesterday described Gartmore as 'an outstanding success' over the past three years. He said a London listing would give Gartmore a higher profile both in the UK and internationally, as well as providing opportunities for further growth. Mr Paul Myners, executive chairman of Gartmore, said that its investment record was an important and continuing asset. While Gartmore had grown to be the fourth biggest investment fund manager in the UK pension fund sector, he could see no restraints on further growth in market share. Mr Myners believed the group, which employs just over 400 people, could attack international markets using existing resources. At the end of last year Gartmore had funds of Pounds 12.8bn under management. This had grown to Pounds 16.1bn at the end of the first half and Pounds 18bn at the end of September. Pension funds accounted for 77 per cent of the business at end-June, with unit trusts and offshore funds taking 7 per cent, investment trusts 5 per cent, and others 11 per cent. Pro-forma pre-tax profits were struck after non-recurring items, including interest on a loan to Banque Indosuez, now repaid. Mr Andrew Brown, finance director, said the company would come to the market with no debt and no goodwill. Pro forma earnings per share for 1993 were put at 8.1p, and the notional net dividend at 4p. The directors and some employees of Gartmore will be acquiring shares worth some Pounds 8m at the offer price through the conversion of a share option scheme put in place by Banque Indosuez, which has guaranteed not to sell any further shares for 12 months.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 23 Feb (TANJUG) -- Srpska republic vice  president Biljana Plavsic told SRNA [Bosnian Serb news agency]  that if the Serbs succumbed to NATO's ultimatum-like demands for  the opening of Tuzla airport, such pressure would turn into a  common practice of snatching the remaining Serb territories in  former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    According to her, the Serbs should condition the opening of  Tuzla airport for humanitarian needs on the closure of land  corridors bound for that town, which are now functioning  perfectly well.    She added that the Serbs have aready paid a high price for  conceding Sarajevo airport to the United Nations; this  particularly refers to the transport of wounded Serbs, who now  need three and a half hours to reach hospital instead of 30  minutes as was the case before.</p>

Dee Hill: "Oil Pipeline Shutdown Serves as a </F> Warning"]    [Text] When the crude oil flowing through the pipeline from  Russia to the Czech Republic was cut off for five days last  month, it gave government and industrial users cause for alarm  and served as a dire warning of what the future might hold for  countries that rely on Russia for energy.    No oil flowed through the Druzba--or "Friendship"--pipeline  from Jan. 17 to 22, after several major exporters of oil from  Russia apparently failed to receive the proper licenses for  export from the Russian government.    According to Jana Hejskova, a senior manager at Chemapol,  which is the main Czech buyer and supplier of Russian crude,  halts in the oil flow from Russia have become a common  occurrence in the last two months.    "It's the red tape and the generally unpredictable situation  [in Russia]," she said. "If you ask the Russian ministry [that  manages oil exports], they will tell you that everything is  working normally, so they won't do anything about it."    Chemapol buys about 500,000 tons of oil monthly--90 percent  of the Druzba pipeline's supply to the Czech Republic. Hejskova  said it took the company more than a week to return to normal  after the shortage.    An official with Synthesia, a large Czech chemical concern,  said that while its production had not fallen behind during the  shortage, it is now trying to strike its own deal with Polish  and Western European suppliers.    "We have no other supply," said spokesman Gregor Vavruska.    By the time the oil flow resumed, the Czech Republic's three  refineries in Litvinov, Kralupy and Vltavou and Pardubice had  exhausted the reserves of Chemapol oil and were forced to buy  oil from the reserves of Transpetrol in Slovakia, whose supplies  would have lasted only four days.    A crisis was in the making. Fortunately, however, the flow  resumed and there were no reports of problems or panic at the  refineries. On the other hand, it is quite possible that the  situation could be repeated.    The threat of a crisis highlighted the Czech Republic's  precarious position as a country with a single-source oil  supply. Chemapol would like to reopen a pipeline leading from  Rijeka in the former Yugoslavia up through Croatia, Hungary and  Slovakia. That pipeline has been inoperative since September  1991. The proposed Ingolstadt pipeline, leading from Bavaria to  the Czech Republic, still faces many obstacles.    Dusan Strauch of the Czech Material Reserves office said the  government is building more reserve capacity for crude oil,  which currently only exists with the refineries themselves.    "I know very well the Western system, with 90-day reserves,"  Strauch said. "But when we were cooperating with the Soviet  Union some years ago, they told our leaders that it was not  necessary."    Strauch declined to say exactly how long Czech industry  could  function with a cut in the Druzba supply, but he did not contest  the report by Czech newspapers that the country can function  without the pipeline for 30 days. New reserve construction, he  said, will take several years, and the first storage facility  will hold 500,000 tons.</p>

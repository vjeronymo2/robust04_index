			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Bundesbank spurns threat of recession THE Bundesbank rejected warnings of an imminent recession in the German economy and defended its decision to raise interest rates in December. It remains concerned by the possibility of excessive wage rises in the pay round and the lack of spending restraint in the public sector. Its latest monthly report spells out the continuing acceleration in German money supply last November, which reached 5.1 per cent for the M3 measure (including non-bank savings and deposit accounts). This is outside the 3-5 per cent target for the year. The bank cites concern over the ongoing growth in money supply as a decisive factor behind the interest rate rise. At the same time the Bundesbank, clearly stung by international criticism of the increase, insisted on its role in preserving the value of the D-Mark as the 'anchor' of the European monetary system. 'The increase in the discount and Lombard rates presents no untenable risks for economic growth and employment in Germany,' the monthly report concludes. Economic growth in the west of the country has slowed after the 'stormy growth' up until early 1991. However, 'from today's viewpoint there is no fear that the economic calming down will slip into lasting economic weakness, or into a recession, provided there are no false developments in the current wage negotiations, and the world economy does not bring new risks.' Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, said in a simultaneous report that the German economy was facing a turning point in the coming months, which would decide 'whether the overall economic activity of west Germany will find its dynamism after a short pause for breath, or whether we will have a longer lasting economic downturn'. The deciding factors would be a strong wage-cost push from current negotiations, or the failure of negotiations in the Uruguay Round of trade talks, he said. The Bundesbank report cites the most recent development of demand, running at higher levels than early 1991 in such areas as exports, and the investment plans of enterprises. The Treuhand, Germany's privatisation agency, is adjusting its marketing strategy in an attempt to sell the remaining companies in its portfolio by the end of the year. The 6,000 former East German enterprises still held by the agency will be sold in sectors starting this week with the wood and furniture industry.</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORD TIGHTENS ITS POLICY ON SMOKING  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co. on Friday announced new restrictions on smoking in its U.S.  facilities.  </P> <P> Effective June 1, smoking will be prohibited in conference rooms, training  rooms, classrooms and auditoriums. The ban will be expanded Jan. 1, 1990, to  include all enclosed offices and open office areas, the No. 2 auto maker said  in a statement.  </P> <P> The restrictions will not apply to smoking in open factory and garage areas  within certain guidelines, the statement said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Bold Step'  </P> <P> Ford also said it would expand services and programs for both salaried and  hourly employees interested in quitting smoking.  </P> <P> Ford previously had designated smoking and non-smoking areas in cafeterias  while smoking was prohibited in some work areas because of safety, Ford  spokesman Dick Routh said.  </P> <P> "It's a bold step forward but reflects a growing feeling among employees that  they want a healthier work environment," Routh said.  </P></p>

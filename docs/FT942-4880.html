			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Green putscase for staying on outside: Questions on Europe Madeleine Petrovic, leader of the Green Club in Austria, is a law graduate and former official in the Austrian social affairs ministry. She was elected president of the Green Alternative in Vienna in 1987 and to the national parliament in 1990. Q: Austrians vote in a referendum on June 12 on whether to join the European Union. Why do you oppose Austrian membership of the EU? A: We are not fundamentally against it. We want to change the EU, especially the Maastricht treaty. There are differing views among Greens about how best to do this. Some think we should join and then try to change it from the inside. We have evidence that it is possible to change the EU from outside. Accession by Austria would be a good thing only if the Austrian government were willing to push for change in the EU. The EU is like a big ship that has sailed into dangerous waters. It needs a mobile little tug boat to get it out. We would like Austria to play that role. But the present government will not push for change. Q: What do you think needs to be changed? A: EU environmental policy is not strong enough to stop the negative actions of member states. Q: Hasn't the EU shown sensitivity to Austrian concerns by agreeing to help finance a rail tunnel through the Brenner pass? A: You cannot solve the transit problem with tunnels and bridges. Up to now, all the technical improvements that have been made have not been enough to prevent the growth of traffic. We get the impression that the EU does not see the real issue. The people want traffic to decrease. Q: The government says the EU has also offered Austrian farmers a reasonable transition arrangement. A: EU agricultural policy is completely contrary to the notion of sustainable development. It is wrong to transfer the multinational industrial model to agriculture. We should produce locally as much as possible. Q: Do you fear economic damage if Austria does not join? A: The economic effect would be marginal. We are already in the European Economic Area. Q: What do you think will be the result in the referendum? A: People do not trust the government. They know it is impossible for the EU to have only good points. Austrians have a strong tendency to decide in the day or so before a vote. Of course, we are going to respect the result, but the government will not if it loses. It will stage a second referendum. Q: What would be the impact in the EU of a rejection? A: The EU is in a very fragile state. Its leaders do not see what young people expect the Union to do. If they took a single step in the right direction, then young people would be enthusiastic. Now, instead, we have disaffection and indifference.</p>

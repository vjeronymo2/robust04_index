			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> W.VA. OFFICIAL QUITS TO HALT CRIME PROBE  </P> <P> West Virginia Atty. Gen. Charlie Brown resigned as part of an agreement to halt  the second criminal case against him since he took office, a prosecutor said.  Kanawha County Prosecutor Bill Forbes said he agreed to drop a grand jury  investigation into Brown's campaign finances and reports that he lied under  oath during a child custody hearing. Brown, a Democrat, was elected in 1984 and  reelected without opposition in 1988. In 1986, Brown, 39, was acquitted on  charges that he shook down his staff for campaign contributions. He contended  that because he had solicited the contributions after the 1984 election to help  pay off campaign debts, the actions did not fall under a state law prohibiting  state officials from soliciting campaign funds from their staffs.  </P></p>

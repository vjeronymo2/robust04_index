			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / CBI urges more Bank autonomy The Confederation of British Industry yesterday urged the government to take further steps towards giving the Bank of England more independence. The day after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced that the Bank would in future decide the precise timing of changes in borrowing rates, the CBI's ruling council unanimously approved a policy paper arguing the case for greater independence of the central bank. It also expressed the hope that a further cut in interest rates of around half a point might be considered in the near future. The chancellor hinted at the recent CBI conference that he was lukewarm about the idea of more independence for the Bank, even though two of his predecessors - Lord Lawson and Mr Norman Lamont - supported the idea. Mr Andrew Sentance, CBI director of economic affairs, said the UK had the opportunity to break out of its historic pattern of high inflation and high interest rates. He added: 'Now is the time to make the institutional changes which will safeguard against a future resurgence of inflation by developing the more independent role that the Bank of England has begun to assume.' The CBI has already welcomed the steps taken last autumn to make economic policy-making and the conduct of monetary policy more open to outside scrutiny. But the organisation is arguing that the changes implemented so far are not extensive enough. It said yesterday that countries with independent central banks had a generally better record of combining growth with low inflation.</p>

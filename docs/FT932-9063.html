			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Lonrho signs contract for Pounds 27m sale of The Observer LONRHO yesterday said it had signed a contract to sell The Observer newspaper for Pounds 27m to the Guardian and Manchester Evening News. The payment will be spread over two years. The international trading group has also undertaken to indemnify the purchaser of up to Pounds 5m in respect of redundancy costs incurred as a result of the sale. The Observer made a net loss of Pounds 8.7m in the year to September 30 1992 compared to a deficit of Pounds 14.9m. Mr Jonathan Fenby, The Guardian's deputy editor, is to replace Mr Donald Trelford as editor of Britain's oldest Sunday newspaper. He and Mr Peter Preston, editor of The Guardian, plan to address The Observer's journalists on Tuesday when they will be questioned about redundancies. A Guardian executive yesterday said the Pounds 5m indemnity did not mean that it planned big redundancies but would not comment further. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said he was considering an application for consent to the transfer of The Observer newspaper without a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry. He invited comments from interested parties by May 21. A transfer of ownership to GMEN requires the permission of the DTI under the provisions of the Fair Trading Act relating to newspaper mergers. Lonrho said the proceeds of the sale would be used to fund the redundancy indemnity, the residual net liabilities of The Observer Limited and subsidiaries and to further reduce overall borrowings of the group. The deal represents a compromise between Lonrho's two joint chief executives, Mr Dieter Bock, who was determined to sell The Observer, and Mr Tiny Rowland, who has twice blocked attempts to sell it in the past year. Since the sale was announced Lonrho's share price has risen by 29 1/2 p to 117 1/2 p, mainly reflecting the fact that the group has sold its biggest loss-making asset.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Rocard takes control of Socialists: Aspiring French presidential candidate ousts Fabius as leader of party FRANCE'S Socialist party, shattered by losing more than 200 seats in last month's general election, has been further shaken by a weekend political coup in which Mr Michel Rocard has toppled Mr Laurent Fabius as party leader. The speed and manner with which Mr Fabius was ousted by Mr Rocard, who still claims to be the party's presidential candidate in 1995 despite losing his parliamentary seat, has led to bitter recriminations. A number of younger Socialists are now looking to Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president who is a French Socialist, to salvage their party. After a long debate within the party's executive board on Saturday, Mr Rocard was voted the head of a provisional committee to steer the party until it holds its congress in July, effectively dissolving the post of first secretary which Mr Fabius has held for 18 months. As so often in French socialism, personality rather than policy was the determining factor. Mr Fabius has long been President Francois Mitterrand's proxy in trying to block the rise of Mr Rocard, a relative late-comer to the Socialist party whom the president considers a dangerous opportunist. The upshot of Saturday's battle is to leave Mr Mitterrand more politically isolated than ever as he faces the new conservative government of prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur. Mr Fabius managed to keep his own parliamentary seat, and the new leader of the much-diminished parliamentary Socialist party is a Fabius supporter. But the party leadership, at least until July, has passed into hands hostile to Mr Mitterrand. Mr Rocard said yesterday he would give 'priority to the reconstruction of the left' rather than to 'personal adventures'. But the 62-year-old former prime minister evidently calculated he could not afford to delay preparation of his presidential bid by letting Mr Fabius continue in his post even for four more months. Few of Mr Rocard's declared supporters kept their seats last month. But he capitalised on Mr Fabius's nominal responsibility as party leader for the election debacle, and won backing from supporters of Mr Lionel Jospin, a departing party heavyweight. Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, a left-wing former defence minister, resigned from the party yesterday, condemning what he called 'a petty palace revolt.' A group of younger Socialists, known as the quadras (for quadragenarians) because they are all in their forties, has become increasingly fed up with the Rocard-Fabius-Mitterrand internecine warfare in the party. The quadras' leader, Mr Francois Hollande, who also runs Mr Delors's official political fan club in France, yesterday said Mr Rocard had behaved like a machine politician 'of the worst kind', and called on him to resign from his new post. Mr Delors should intervene, Mr Hollande said, to 'insist that everyone rally round the party, and that all those involved in such operations (as Saturday's manoeuvring) should step down for a time'.</p>

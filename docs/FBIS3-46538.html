			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has been learned that if the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea reach an agreement in  nuclear inspection negotiations, the government will announce  its plan to suspend this year's Team Spirit exercise.    A government official pointed out that the reason the ROK  Government will announce the suspension of the Team Spirit  exercise is to make North Korea aware of the fact that its  efforts to exclude the ROK Government's role in the negotiations  to resolve North Korea's nuclear issue is a very unrealistic  measure.    This official said that even after the suspension of the  Team  Spirit exercise is announced, if the result of the IAEA's  inspection is not satisfactory and the exchange of special  envoys of the South and North is not realized, the ROK  Government will decide to resume the Team Spirit exercise and  will make the announcement.    This official added that the reason it was decided that the  ROK Government will announce the suspension of the Team Spirit  exercise and its resumption, if the result of the IAEA's  inspection is not satisfactory and the exchange of special  envoys of the South and North is not realized, is to show that  the ROK Government is playing a clear role in the process of  nuclear negotiations between the United States and North Korea,  and to point out that it is very unrealistic for North Korea to  insist only on direct negotiations between the United States and  North Korea.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Permanent Secretary for Public Health  Chamrun Mikhanon says he accepts that Thailand has made mistakes  in handling AIDS projects in the past.    He was speaking at the closing ceremony of the four-day  Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries (TCDC)  International Symposium for Capacity Enhancement in Primary  Health Care and HIV/AIDS Management, attended by 24 countries.    "We are confident we will not repeat those mistakes," Dr  Chamrun said.    Dr Chamrun was referring to a lack of know-how and proper  methods for handling the spread of the deadly disease.    He agreed that developing countries must share technical  know-how and resources.    "We are looking forward to convincing government and  non-government organisations to take necessary action to  strengthen management, technical cooperation internally and  internationally and mobilise experts," he said.    The meeting focused on four main issues, distribution of  condoms, integration of HIV/AIDS care with primary health care,  monitoring and evaluation and behavioural change.    The participants also noted that funding from overseas for  HIV/AIDS programmes is usually short-term and it was difficult  for a country to sustain after the end of outside assistance.    For evaluation and implementation purposes, additional  funding is necessary.</p>

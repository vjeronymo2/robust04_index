			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Alberto Venturini commentary: "Warrior's Haste"] </F>   [Text] If [French 19th century politician] Talleyrand too  could witness the tragic situation in Bosnia, he would perhaps  repeat that war is too serious a thing to be left to the  military. It should be added right away, however, that the  military was simply doing its job in the skies above Banja Luka  yesterday: The intercepted aircraft were returning from an  offensive mission in violation of the UN resolutions; air  patrols had been in operation above Bosnia for many months  within the context of Operation Deny Flight; before firing their  missiles the American pilots observed all the rules of  engagement, including a double warning.    But precisely because the attack did faithfully follow  established procedures, precisely because its official  legitimacy is beyond question, this sudden baptism of fire for  NATO 45 years after its foundation raises an issue which it is  not for the military to resolve: Is it right, is it opportune,  at this time of a delicate search for peace in Bosnia, for the  alliance's air forces to open fire on the basis of an automatic  decision entirely independent of any ratification in terms of  political will?    According to news reports, NATO's decisionmaking chain  worked  well. But Bill Clinton heard about the incident after the  event, it does not seem that any of the allied governments were  consulted before the patrolling "top guns" were given the  go-ahead, and even the blue helmets' commander, General Rose,  was informed after the event.    In normal operational conditions, all this would be  obligatory: When the military is backed up by a political  decision (in our case the UN resolution), its duty is solely to  be rapid and effective in implementing it. But the point is  that in Bosnia today the operational conditions are not normal.    For the past few days a precarious truce achieved by means  of  the deterrent force of the allied ultimatum has been in force in  Sarajevo. An attempt is being made to extend the same  peace-making formula to other tormented cities. There is an  approximate date for the reopening of Tuzla airport, which is  indispensable for the distribution of aid. Crucial negotiations  are under way in Washington between Muslims and Croats. Despite  the controversies, it is hoped that the Russians will bring  sufficient pressure to bear on the Serbian side, and Boris  Yeltsin's difficult domestic situation must not be forgotten.    After two years of failures, the past few weeks have offered  the peace-makers some timid grounds for hope, leaving a weak  glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. So is this really  the most suitable time to give free rein to the automatic  intransigence of a military force? Should priority not be  given, rather, to political assessment, especially in the  Balkans, which have always been a source of provocation, and  especially at a stage of the war that grants scope for the  strategy of sabotage and that threatens to drag the Atlantic  Alliance into an escalation with no way out?    It may be replied -- as the Western governments, and to some  extent even Russia, did yesterday -- that in order to avert the  punishment it would have been enough to observe the rules.  That, sooner or later, after hundreds of unpunished violations,  Deny Flight had to bang its fist on the table. That yesterday's  attack is the result of the weakness of the past two years, that  it stems from the need for NATO to enhance its credibility  precisely in order to increase the effectiveness of the pressure  to negotiate begun with the 21 February ultimatum.    It would certainly be disastrous -- and not only for peace  in  Bosnia -- if NATO were to return to the policy of empty threats,  of words not matched by deeds. This cannot be the way to go.  But in a situation of absolute military predominance, who could  prevent the alliance from taking time to analyze and assess the  situation and then if necessary from issuing a strike virtually  with no threat of response? Faced with the incursion by the  Serbs' jalopies, would it not have been possible yesterday to  await a political ratification and then perhaps to destroy all  the fighter bombers on the ground at Banja Luka as a punishment?  NATO's credibility would certainly not have been diminished.    In Bosnia there are already the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims  who live permanently with their fingers on the trigger. We must  not imitate them if we want to escape their logic of death.</p>

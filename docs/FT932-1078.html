			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Small tour operators welcome OFT holiday inquiry: Travel agents favour large companies over independents INDEPENDENT tour operators were delighted yesterday at news that the Office of Fair Trading has launched an inquiry into the links between large holiday companies and travel agents. Many say their brochures are increasingly kept off the racks of the large travel agents. Approval, however, was not universal. Mr Nicholas Leche, managing director of Continental Villas, which sells luxury holidays in the West Indies, the Mediterranean and other destinations, said the large groups' behaviour caused him no difficulties. 'It's a lot of whingeing,' he said. Continental Villas sells most of its holidays through independent travel agents, although it does also use Hogg Robinson and American Express. Mr Leche says he would not want to use the other large retail outlets anyway. 'By and large, they've got idiots on the counter,' he says. Others feel they cannot afford to take such a relaxed attitude. Mr Peter Kerkar, chief executive of Cox &amp; Kings Travel, says Lunn Poly, the largest retailer, will not carry brochures for his company's holidays to India, Latin America and Russia. He says: 'They say we don't have enough sales volume through them. The irony is if they don't rack us we'll never have enough sales volume through them.' Over the past year, links have tightened between the three largest operators  -Thomson, Airtours and Owners Abroad - and the largest retail outlets. Thomson has owned Lunn Poly for 20 years. The travel industry had long accepted that the Thomson-Lunn Poly link was an arm's-length one, allowing other operators to sell their holidays through the retailer's shops. Last September, though, Airtours, the fast growing tour operator run by Mr David Crossland, bought the 333 Pickfords branches. It failed in its attempt earlier this year to buy Owners Abroad, after Mr Michael Heseltine rejected the OFT's advice that the bid be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Earlier this month, Airtours bought the 214 Hogg Robinson branches and is rumoured to be buying Aspro, another operator. Unlike Thomson, Airtours did not hide its intention of using its travel agents to push its own holidays. Pickfords would not stop selling other companies' products, Mr Crossland said, but if each branch made just one more Airtours booking each week, it would add Pounds 2m to pre-tax profits. Independent operators say Pickfords staff are given extra incentives to sell Airtours holidays and that that has resulted in other travel agents doing the same. Airtours refused to comment, but Lunn Poly and Thomas Cook, which is linked to Owners Abroad, admitted that they had recently introduced staff incentives. Lunn Poly said that staff would, for the first time, be offered incentives to sell the holidays of four operators: Thomson, Virgin Holidays, Sunworld and Cosmos. Lunn Poly would not say how much the incentive was or whether it was paid in cash or in operators' holidays. Thomas Cook said that for the past two years, staff have been offered incentives to sell the holidays of 45 companies, including all the large operators. The incentive was in the form of points that staff collect towards a trip offered by one of the operators. Thomas Cook said, given the number of operators involved, it did not think the programme restricted consumer choice. Mr Christopher Kirker, managing director of Kirker Europe Holidays, a small company selling short breaks to European cities, said travel agents should be made to tell consumers about such incentives. He said: 'The basic issue is whether it's right from the public's point of view that they should be hoodwinked . . . I'm not particularly against incentives . . . I'm against the public not being told what's going on.'</p>

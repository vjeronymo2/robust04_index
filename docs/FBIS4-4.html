			<p>INTRODUCTION                                 While two government news agencies--Moscow-base- TASS and APN-  -had an official monopoly on news under the communist regime, new  independent news agencies have arisen in Ukraine since the end of  communist rule and may overshadow the government's present news  agency.  By mid-1993 the Ukrainian Government's Ukrinform,  successor to the Ukrainian TASS, came up against stiff  competition from three independent agencies--UNIAN, UNIAR, and  Post-Postup--and from an agency affiliated with the nationalist  political movement Rukh, Rukh-Pres.  The latter three had their  roots in dissident organizations begun under the communist  regime.     Of the new agencies, UNIAN seems the most important, distributing  numerous news items and important analytical pieces.  Rukh-Pres  is both a news agency and a propaganda organ for Rukh and  sometimes stirs controversy by publishing reports and articles  with partisan overtones.  Some papers have become very dependent  on the new agencies for news reporting.  For example, the Kiev  paper Khreshchatyk carries whole pages of UNIAN and UNIAR items.  FBIS subscribes directly to Ukrinform, UNIAN, UNIAR, and Post-  Postup.                        END INTRODUCTION     Ukrinform (Ukrainske Natsionalne Informatsiyne Ahentstvo)     Ukrinform is the government information agency, successor to the  Ukrainian TASS affiliate, RATAU (Radio-Telegraph Agency of  Ukraine), which was the main supplier of news to the Ukrainian  press until mid-1990.  Benefiting from being the heir to RATAU,  Ukrinform appears to have the biggest staff and best facilities  of all Ukrainian news agencies.  It has, for example, an  analytical-information center, which gathers material from  Ukrinform's local correspondents and also from the local press  (Molod Ukrainy, 31 August 1993).     RATAU was renamed Ukrinform in May 1990, because, as its director  explained in a 22 May 1990 Radyanska Ukraina article, it no  longer sent its items to local papers by telegraph or by  dictation over the radio and therefore its name needed to be  changed.  It was further reorganized after Ukrainian  independence, when a 27 November 1991 Cabinet of Ministers  decree, "proceeding from the Act of Proclamation of Ukrainian  Independence," changed the "Ukrainian Information Agency  Ukrinform" into the "Ukrainian National Information Agency  Ukrinform" (Uryadovyy Kuryer, No. 38-39, December 1991).  It is  now independent of Moscow's TASS, which was renamed ITAR-TASS and  became a Russian news agency after the dissolution of the USSR.  ITAR-TASS still disseminates items from Ukrinform, some of which  are labeled "TASS-Ukrinform" in Moscow papers.     UNIAN (Ukrainske Nezalezhne Informatsiyne Ahentstvo Novyn)     UNIAN, which appears to be the strongest of the new agencies, is  the successor in Ukraine to APN (Novosti Press Agency), the  second main Soviet-era news agency.  Although its name (Ukrainian  Independent Information News Agency) labels it independent, it  was formed by the government and works in APN's former  government-owned facilities.  At the end of August 1991 the  Ukrainian Supreme Soviet Presidium created UNIAN "on the basis of  the disbanded APN" and later gave it APN's building (Holos  Ukrainy, 9 February 1993).  The founders of UNIAN do not include  any government agency, however: they are listed as the  Journalists Union of Ukraine, the Prosvita (Enlightenment)  Society, the Ukraina Society, the National Press Club, and the  Union of Lawyers (Holos Ukrainy, 9 February 1993; Khreshchatyk,  16 February 1993).  The former correspondent of the independent  Moscow paper Moskovskiye Novosti, Volodymyr Ruban, is chief  editor of the agency, and Supreme Soviet deputy Mykhaylo Batih is  the general director of UNIAN (Holos Ukrainy, 9 February 1993).  Batih was editor of the Lviv Oblast paper Leninska Molod and a  communist party member (Radyanska Ukraina, 24 March 1990), but  later became a member of Rukh (Narodna Hazeta, No. 38, October  1992).  Despite inheriting APN's facilities, it took some time  for UNIAN to start operating after its formation.  According to  the 16 February 1993 Khreshchatyk, "for a year and a half the  former 'APN-ers' were not able to organize the work of the  agency" and it started work only early in 1993.  It had 10  journalists by early 1993 (Holos Ukrainy, 9 February 1993) drawn  from the government papers Holos Ukrainy and Uryadovyy Kuryer,  Ukrinform, UT-1 (Ukrainian TV channel one), and the weekly paper  for foreigners Visti z Ukrainy (Khreshchatyk, 16 February 1993).     In an August 1993 advertisement, UNIAN offered three services:     -- An "Express-News" service on political, economic, social, and  cultural developments, issued twice daily (1500-1600 and 2100-  2200 Kiev time) except Saturday and Sunday, in 8-10 pages in  Ukrainian.     -- A weekly "Visnyk UNIAN: (UNIAN Herald) Observations,  Commentaries, Forecasts" including analytical pieces on  political, economic, social and cultural subjects, in 25-30  pages, available in Ukrainian or Russian.     -- A weekly Ukrainian-language "advertising-information bulletin"  "Tyzhden" (Week) on the most important recent events.     UNIAN's advertisement also announced plans to start a weekly  "  analytical-forecasting" bulletin of economic information "UNIAN-  Biznes" in September 1993.     UNIAN's television service has also been producing and  distributing programs, films, and commercials, according to the  16 February 1993 Khreshchatyk.     Examples of the analytical items UNIAN provides include the  following:     -- Staffers Aleksandr Kharchenko and Anatoliy Drobyazko wrote an  article blaming massive credits for agriculture for the fall in  the value of the karbovanets in mid-1993 ("Waterloo of the  Ukrainian Karbovanets").  The article was carried in the 28 July  Holos Ukrainy, 29 July Pravda Ukrainy, and 29 July Rada.     -- Mykhaylo Pashkov and Leonid Tupchiyenko wrote an analysis of  potential party coalitions that was carried in the 23 July 1993  Khreshchatyk and Nezavisimost.     -- Vasiliy Zorya analyzed the August currency exchange crisis for  Izvestiya (21 August 1993).     The agency also commissions public opinion polls, which its  staffers write up.  Aleksandr Vishnyak wrote about a poll of  Kievites that showed negative attitudes toward the soviets and  political parties (Pravda Ukrainy, 30 July 1993).  Vishnyak  reported on a poll on attitudes toward an economic union with CIS  (Nezavisimost, 22 September 1993).  Volodymyr Hubenko reported on  a poll on selling the Black Sea Fleet (Vecherniy Kiev, 15  September 1993).     A wide range of papers have subscribed to UNIAN's services and  are using its material.  Both the main government paper Holos  Ukrainy and the main anti-government paper Nezavisimost sometimes  carry UNIAN items, as do Molod Ukrainy, Pravda Ukrainy, Ukraina  Moloda, Kievskiye Novosti, Rada, and Kiev city papers  Khreshchatyk, Kyivska Pravda, and Vecherniy Kiev--suggesting that  UNIAN's material is objective enough to be used by all sides.  Moscow's Izvestiya has also used UNIAN, for example, on 21 August  carrying an article on the fall of the karbovanets on the  Ukrainian currency exchange written "specially for Izvestiya" by  UNIAN correspondent Vasiliy Zorya.     UNIAR (Ukrainska Nezalezhna Informahentsiya "Respublika")     UNIAR, a completely non-government agency, originated in the  dissident movement under the communist regime.  It was set up in  1988 in Kiev as an underground news operation linked to the  dissident Ukrainian Helsinki Union led by present Rukh Chairman  Vyacheslav Chornovil, and it initially focused on sending  information on internal events to Radio Liberty in Munich,  according to an interview by its chief editor Serhiy Naboka in  the 3 October 1993 emigre newspaper Ukrainian Weekly.  When the  Ukrainian Helsinki Union became the Ukrainian Republican Party in  early 1990, the news agency remained linked to the party,  becoming the URP press service, according to Naboka.  Later it  became independent and changed its name to the "Respublika  Information Agency."     Respublika's items appeared in the Ukrainian Weekly and were used  by Radio Liberty, and later, after the communist regime fell, its  items began appearing in the Ukrainian press.  Items labeled  "Respublika" appeared in Molod Ukrainy in July 1992, and starting  31 July 1992 Molod Ukrainy began carrying items from UNIAR--the  new name for Respublika.  A newspaper named Respublika was set up  in early 1992, but, according to information UNIAR provided to  subscribers in October 1993, the "Respublika Information Agency"  was not associated with the newspaper Respublika.     According to Naboka, UNIAR now has 60 employees in Kiev and about  40 elsewhere and is organized into four branches: the press  agency, video-TV productions, an analytical research department,  and a press monitoring section.  In describing its services to  potential subscribers, UNIAR in October 1993 said it had 58  correspondents, publishes analyses, commentaries, and reviews by  independent experts, as well as news, and also produces a daily  television program "UNIAR News" on channel 37 (UTaR Television  Company) and a weekly half-hour analytical program "Desyatka."     UNIAR items are not carried by as many newspapers as UNIAN's but  have appeared in the Kiev city paper Khreshchatyk (which carries  whole pages of UNIAR material), the Ukrainian Republican Party's  paper Samostiyna Ukraina, and the youth papers Molod Ukrainy and  Ukraina Moloda.  In addition to news reports, a few UNIAR  analytical pieces have appeared in the press, such as an article  on Ukraine's political situation published in the 19 May  Samostiyna Ukraina.  UNIAR lists among its subscribers Radio  Liberty, Voice of America, Radio Australia, Polish Television,  Moscow's Ekho Moskvy radio, the Moscow papers Segodnya,  Izvestiya, and Argumenty i Fakty, the St. Petersburg paper Sankt-  Peterburgskiye Vedomosti, and Ukrainian papers Respublika,  Khreshchatyk, Molod Ukrainy, Narodna Armiya, Samostiyna Ukraina,  and Post-Postup.     Naboka said in his 3 October interview that UNIAR is the only  Ukrainian news agency that is not financially supported by any  governmental, party, business, or other organization.  In another  sign of UNIAR's independence of the government, Naboka was  elected chief editor of the "Elections 94" press center set up  for the March 1994 parliamentary election to collect and provide  information independent of the government (Ukrainian Weekly, 20  February).     Post-Postup     The newest of the news agencies, Post-Postup was set up in  September 1991, at the time the Lviv paper of the same name,  Post-Postup, was officially registered, according to information  provided by the Post-Postup news agency in October 1993.  The  statement explained that the paper Post-Postup is the successor  to an earlier underground Lviv paper called Postup (Progress),  which started publication in early 1989.  After the August 1991  attempted coup and end of the communist regime, the paper was  registered officially and renamed Post-Postup (i.e., "after  Postup") and the news agency, which appears to use the same  correspondents, was also established.  The news agency sometimes  refers to itself as "Post-Inform."     Post-Postup is smaller than the other main news agencies and,  unlike the others, is based in Lviv rather than Kiev.  Post-  Postup is still issuing items only twice a week instead of daily  as other agencies do, and relatively few Post-Postup items have  been showing up in the press.  Vecherniy Kiev on 11 August  carried an article from the paper Post-Postup describing a  struggle for control of the mass-circulation Kiev weekly  Kievskiye Vedomosti, and Kievskiye Novosti on 7 May 1993 carried  a Post-Postup newspaper interview with reform economist Volodymyr  Lanovyy.  The agency also disseminates items over Ukrainian  government radio, according to the 12 February 1993 Kyivska  Pravda.  It has 40 correspondents covering oblasts around the  republic, according to Post-Postup's October 1993 statement, and  the agency-paper is apparently growing.  The paper Post-Postup  announced on 15-21 June 1993 that "Post-Postup is expanding" and  recruiting journalists and listed rates it will pay journalists  for written material and photographs.     Rukh-Pres     The nationalist organization Rukh created its own organization  that serves both as a press office to disseminate information  from Rukh and as a news agency that gathers information.  Chairman of Rukh's Secretariat Viktor Burlakov, in a report to  the 1992 Rukh congress on the work of Rukh's Information  Department which he supervises, mentioned that Rukh-Pres, which  comes under his department, prepares daily "press-releases" about  events in Rukh and in the republic in general, including comments  by Rukh leaders and other leaders of the democratic bloc.  Rukh-  Pres, he said, sends its material by fax to radio, television,  Radio Liberty, VOA, the papers Holos Ukrainy, Vechirniy Kyiv, and  Za Vilnu Ukrainu, and also has published items in the paper  Narodna Hazeta (at that time Rukh's paper) and the Kiev paper  Rada.  It also issues an English-language bulletin on Ukrainian  events, Rukh-Faks, which it sends to the Toronto Star, Japan's  Yomiuri Simbun, London's Daily Telegraph, France Press, and the  American, German, Canadian, and Swedish embassies, he said  (Narodna Hazeta, No. 9, March 1992).  Other parties--the  Ukrainian Republican Party, the Liberal Party, the Party of  Greens, and the Congress of National Democratic Forces--have  press services also, but these sources are not as active as Rukh-  Pres and appear to publicize only information on their own  parties.     In contrast, Rukh-Pres also acts as a news agency and many Rukh-  Pres items have appeared in the press--in the government papers  Holos Ukrainy and Uryadovyy Kuryer, the anti-government paper  Nezavisimost, the former Rukh paper Narodna Hazeta, the URP's  paper Samostiyna Ukraina, Lviv's Vysokyy Zamok, Demokratychna  Ukraina, Khreshchatyk, and Ukraina Moloda--and have been picked  up on the radio and in the rival news agency UNIAR.     Rukh-Pres also turns out analyses and even openly polemical  stories aimed at foes of Rukh or of Rukh Chairman Chornovil.  Opponents have accused it of spreading false information about  Chornovil's political rivals and foes:     -- From local sources Rukh-Pres picked up controversial remarks  by Kravchuk adviser and former First Deputy Premier Valentyn  Symonenko attacking Premier Leonid Kuchma at a 20 March 1993  Odessa conference and sent this material to various papers.  Carried by Kiev city papers Khreshchatyk, Vecherniy Kiev, and  Kyivskyy Visnyk, Lviv's Vysokyy Zamok, and the URP paper  Samostiyna Ukraina, the reports embarrassed Symonenko.  Later  Rukh-Pres reported from circles close to Kravchuk that the president  had rebuked Symonenko for making these remarks and  ordered him to retract them or resign as his adviser.  Symonenko  attacked Rukh-Pres's reports (Vecherniy Kiev, 1 April 1993),  threatened a law suit, and claimed that Rukh-Pres was spreading  these reports because of Chornovil's hostility to him  (Demokratychna Ukraina, 30 March 1993).  Symonenko had been  bypassed for premier in favor of Kuchma in late 1992 partly  because of the opposition of Rukh and other reformers.     -- Rukh-Pres spread reports that Levko Lukyanenko (a bitter  personal rival of Chornovil) was misusing his post as ambassador  to Canada.  Narodna Hazeta (No. 17, May 1993), however, disputed  the Rukh-Pres report and carried a Congress of National  Democratic Forces item attributing Rukh-Pres's action to  Chornovil's longtime dislike for Lukyanenko (who like Chornovil  was a candidate in Ukraine's December 1991 presidential election  and whom Chornovil has often accused of undermining his chances  by splitting Rukh's vote).     -- A Rukh-Pres item carried in the 8 May 1993 Nezavisimost (the  most anti-establishment national paper) accused former Rukh  leader Dmytro Pavlychko (a bitter rival of Chornovil) of misusing  his power as chairman of the Supreme Soviet's International  Affairs Commission during a visit to South Africa.     Perhaps because of its polemical slant, Rukh-Pres is apparently  viewed with hostility by the Kravchuk administration.  Rukh-Pres  on 29 September assailed President Kravchuk's press service for  consistently refusing contacts with Rukh-Pres, treating it as  non-existent, and insisting it "register as an information  agency."  Rukh-Pres insisted that as the "information department  of Rukh's Secretariat" it is a press service, not an information  agency (Rada, 30 September 1993).     Joint Agencies/Newspapers     Some newspapers--in addition to Post-Postup--also act as news  agencies, disseminating to other media information gathered by  their own correspondents, which may be more than the paper can  publish.  The shortage of newsprint and the high cost of  newsprint and mail delivery have forced many papers to change  from dailies to publishing two-three times a week or weekly, so  they have less space to publish material.  Selling material to  other papers and organizations can also help financially.     For example, the newspaper Nezavisimost created its own  information agency "Nezavisimost" in January 1992 (Nezavisimost,  17 January 1992).  The head of the new agency, Boris Zaporozhets,  told an interviewer that the agency planned to sell items to all  republic papers and to city, oblast, and rayon papers, to Moscow  and St. Petersburg publications, foreign information agencies,  and agencies of other CIS states (Nezavisimost, 17 January 1992).     Other News Agencies     Moscow's ITAR-TASS also has its own correspondents in Ukraine who  file items to Moscow on Ukrainian events, and Russia's Interfax  News Agency also operates in Ukraine and turns out many news  items on Ukraine.  A 27 September 1993 Interfax item even  referred to "Interfax-Ukraine" as an entity.     Other news agencies are occasionally mentioned in the press, but  there is little information on them and they appear unimportant.  A "UPresA" interview of economist Volodymyr Lanovyy was published  in the 6 August 1993 Nezavisimost.  Nezavisimost on 3 November  1993 carried an article on coming elections by a "Ukrainian  Independent Center for Political Research" of UPresA.  Items from  Informahentsiya "Visnyk" appeared in Molod Ukrainy on 2 April, 1  May, and 30 June 1992, and items from the Informatsiyne Ahentstvo  Yevro appeared in Molod Ukrainy on 21 May and 19 June 1992.  Some  may be more or less one-man operations.  For example, Sergey  Zarya, identifying himself as a representative from the "Zarya  Information Agency," asked a question at a 6 September Kravchuk  news conference (Kiev radio, 6 September 1993).

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Russian PM calls off visit to Poland The Russian prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, last night called off a two-day visit to Poland due to start tomorrow because of an 'unsatisfactory response' from the Polish authorities to complaints that Polish police had beaten Russians in Warsaw over a week ago. A statement from Mr Chernomyrdin's office said that 'a new date for the visit will depend on the position taken by the Polish authorities'. The visit has been put off in spite of the planned signing of a multi-billion dollar deal to construct a gas pipeline which would allow Russia to escape from its dependence on Ukraine for the transport of one of its most valuable exports to the west. The row, which has worsened in the past two days, concerns an incident in Warsaw's eastern railway station on October 23. According to the Russian side, several Russian passengers were beaten by Polish police and jailed. Polish press reports quoted the police as saying they had had to use force after the Russians, who had been robbed by Russian gangsters, locked themselves in their train compartment and used emergency brakes to prevent their international train to Berlin from departing. Mr Artur Michalski, a senior diplomat at Warsaw's embassy in Moscow, said last night that the Polish note, sent yesterday to the Russian foreign ministry, had expressed 'regret' at the incident. However, it had underlined that the Polish government could not comment further while an investigation was proceeding. Mr Michalski stressed that the Russian consul in Warsaw had been informed immediately about the incident on the day it happened. Because it had not been a working day, however, a representative of the Russian consulate had not contacted the police or the Russians detained by them until the next day. The incident has become a cause celebre in the Russian press and in political circles, with a range of public figures calling on Mr Chernomyrdin to cancel his trip. Mr Chernomyrdin had been due to sign an agreement on the inauguration of parallel gas pipelines from Poland through Belarus to the Yamal peninsula in northern Siberia, where there is a huge natural gas field. The project is said to be worth Dollars 40bn (Dollars 2.5bn of it in Poland) and to be capable of handling 67bn cubic metres of gas worth Dollars 5.5bn a year. The line will allow Russia to bypass Ukraine, through which the only pipeline carrying Russian gas to the markets of central and western Europe now passes - and which, in the past, has proved vulnerable to Ukrainian pressure when Moscow has tried to cut supplies to Ukraine because of its failure to repay debts. According to today's issue of the Sevodnya daily newspaper, the Russian company Gasprom and the Polish company Europol have already reached agreement on the construction of 665km of parallel pipes in Poland. A separate accord has been reached with Belarus to build 575km of pipelines. The incident illustrates the vulnerability of the Russian government to growing nationalist pressure - and to the increasing number of incidents involving Russians and Poles, especially in the street markets in Warsaw and other cities.</p>

At the same time, police  patrol cars continually pass through the city.    Although the cities are apparently calm, they are full of  disorder. The roads between the cities are reported restless.  Reports show that armed Baluchis attack automobiles carrying  armed forces. In attacks that took place between 11 and 16  Bahman [31 January-5 February], a number of revolutionary guards  were killed and wounded. Likewise, three police personnel were  taken hostage by the Baluchis and there is not yet any  information about what became of them. One of the attacks,  during which tens of people were killed and wounded, took place  on the Nikshahr-Iranshahr Road.    The National Security Council, meeting in continuous  session,  issued a statement attributing the "revolts" in Zahedan to the  work of "elements" who have "lost their interests during  security operations by the Islamic Republic's security forces,"  and in this statement, in contradiction to previous statements,  it called those "elements" "brigands and smugglers."    According to a report from Radio Tehran, 'Ali Khamene'i, the  leader of the Islamic Republic who is also commander in -chief  of the armed forces, designated minister of the interior 'Ali  Mohammad Basharati-Jahromi to take his place for three years in  the police forces.    In the relevant order, Khamene'i gave Basharati "full  authority" to establish order and security in the country. On  the other hand 'Ali Sham'khani, commander of the Islamic  Republic's Naval Forces, went to Pakistan last Saturday. On this  trip he will meet with various Pakistani officials. Political  observers connect Sham'khani's trip with the ongoing disturbance  and unrest in Baluchestan. Officials of the Islamic Republic  believe that the Baluchi rebels get most of the weapons they use  to fight the armed forces from Pakistan.    It is worth noting that the Islamic regime's officials spoke  of uprisings months ago and studied ways to fight it in the  Supreme Council for National Security. Observers say that  despite the government's willingness to fight the uprisings,  because thinking has been done only from the technical and  military standpoint, there are likely to be larger and greater  uprisings in other Iranian cities. The same observers believe  that if there is an uprising in Tehran, the police will have  very little luck putting it down.</p>

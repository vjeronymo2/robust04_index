			<p>BFN     [Text] The U.S. deputy secretary of state, Mr. Strobe  Talbott, said that his visit to Pakistan was most productive and  useful. The United States shares with Pakistan the objective of  nuclear nonproliferation in South Asian region. Talking to  newsmen at Chaklala base before his departure for Europe, Mr.  Talbott said Pakistan and the United States would pursue their  approach toward nonproliferation in South Asian region and on a  variety of subjects. He made it clear that the U.S. approach to  nonproliferation was multidimensional. He said he has a great  degree of optimism for achieving concrete results in the future  that will serve the security and political interests of Pakistan.    The foreign secretary, Mr. Najmuddin Sheikh, said there was  no question of an agreement on nuclear nonproliferation, but  discussions will continue in order to arrive at a mutually  agreed approach. He said the two sides agreed that there should  be capping, reduction, and elimination of nuclear weapons from  South Asia as well as weapons of mass destruction. The foreign  secretary said Pakistan explained its stand and position on the  nuclear issue and Mr. Talbott certainly has a much clearer  understanding of Pakistan's position.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Arts: Brecht's 'Edward II' - Theatre 'It's more important,' said Brecht, 'for the set to tell the spectator he's in a theatre than to tell him he's in, say, Aulis . . . the best thing is to show the machinery.' This has been followed to the letter in Brecht's Das Leben Edwards II von England (adapted from Marlowe's Edward II) at the Glasgow Citizens Theatre. Philip Prowse's design and direction delivers an exciting play, politically apt and dramatically rigorous. The first production in Munich (1924) used titles preceding the scenes and announcing the contents. The life of Edward II (1284-1327) became a pattern of linked events: his infatuation with Gaveston; the consequent civil unrest of 1311-23 and subsequent battles at Scarborough and Warwick; Edward's years in an oubliette at Berkeley Castle; and his murder. The play's Chorus - named Smith  - plays the part of history, binding up the past, changing with the times. Prowse rightly makes this a mechanical production; the design and style inform the play. Each scene opens simply, without taking account of its predecessor or successor but working together as components of an an ending which resolves everything. The set is a functional tripartite black dais which allows the actors to pop up from trench-like interstices. Brecht thought every design should have its own climax, and this coup takes the form of a stage drenched with water - from suspended buckets - representing the castle sewer at Berkeley. Stark lighting and apt costumes, sumptuous cloaks for the peers and rags for the commoners, clinch the integrated effect. The actors follow the difficult path cleared by Brecht's verse. Unlike Marlowe's original, Brecht's Edward keeps itself public, leaving no room for the comforts of intimacy. The overall style is stark, direct and pared-down, notwithstanding Brecht's lyrical attempts at Marlovian rhetoric. The cast's unromantic acting supports the production's minimalism. Laurance Rudic's testy, flighty Edward becomes a neurotic ready for the worst. His adversary, Mortimer (played by the limber Tristram Jellinek) is a mirror of realpolitik, all strategy and purpose. Edward's wife, the Queen (tetchily played by Julia Blalock) finds herself caught up by events beyond her control, complaining of 'the smell of too much history.' And Edward's lover, Gaveston (Patrick O'Kane) maintains a resolute ordinariness in face of others' hostility. The production's strength lies in its ability - consistent with Brecht's ideals - to make matters of political authority bear on every relationship. Marlowe's play dealt with power, but was also about love; Brecht's is solely about power. The murder of Edward with the red-hot poker was excised by Brecht; instead, Edward is suffocated, ending not with a bang but a whimper. Citizens Theatre, Glasgow until May 23 (041 429 0022)</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Iraq arms move defended A government decision to adopt a more liberal policy on arms sales to Iraq without announcing it to parliament was a 'correct political decision', former trade and defence minister Lord Trefgarne told the Scott inquiry yesterday. Lord Trefgarne was one of three ministers who, in early 1989, decided on a form of words to be used in parliamentary answers that would not indicate that the government had secretly relaxed military-related exports to Iraq. The others were former trade minister Mr Alan Clark, and Mr William Waldegrave, the then foreign minister who is now the minister for open government. Yesterday Lord Trefgarne stuck by what has emerged in the Scott inquiry as the government position. 'It is true that Mr Waldegrave, Mr Clark and I authorised officials to apply (the guidelines) more flexibly. But guidelines, as the word implies, are not hard and fast laws anyway so that was entirely proper,' he said in a prepared statement to the inquiry. Lord Trefgarne, the last minister to appear before the inquiry, said it was the duty of ministers not to lie or mislead members of parliament, but said:'You don't have to tell them everything.' Any announcement should be made 'in circumstances and terms that suit the government of the day best'. Lord Trefgarne was one of several ministers whose answers to parliamentary questions in 1989 conveyed the impression that the guidelines restricting arms exports to Iraq had remained unchanged since first announced in 1985. Yesterday he conceded that ministers had agreed on a new form of wording which allowed officials to approve the export to Iraq of machine tools and other equipment with a potential military application. These included air defence radars which were later used against US and European fighter aircraft after the invasion of Kuwait. He was pressed by Lord Justice Scott on whether adoption of a more flexible policy did not amount to a change of policy which should have been announced to parliament, given MPs' concerns about Iraq's chemical attacks on the Kurds at the time. Lord Trefgarne replied: 'I am concerned to ensure that you understand that the policy was not changed. If there are words in the documents that lead you to think otherwise, then you should disregard them.' Lord Trefgarne had at first resisted appearing at the inquiry, expressing doubts about the procedures being followed by the judge. Yesterday he gave evidence flanked by his counsel, Sir Patrick Neill QC, whose costs are being borne by the Department of Trade and Industry. The hearing was adjourned until today after Lord Trefgarne, under legal advice, refused to answer further questions without being given more time to consider them.</p>

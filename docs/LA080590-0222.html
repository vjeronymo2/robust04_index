			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SLEEPY WEST ANSWERS ALARM JUST IN TIME;  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEGION: WOODLAND HILLS TEAM WAKES UP IN SEVENTH TO WIN, 8-6, AFTER  SPOTTING LAKEWOOD A 5-0 LEAD.  </P> <P> The headline in the local morning newspaper screamed, "The Best in America."  Under the headline was a large photo of Woodland Hills West Coach Don Hornback  and third baseman Del Marine, smiles all around.  </P> <P> For most of West's first-round game Saturday in the American Legion state  tournament, this could have qualified as the ultimate in editorial license.  </P> <P> In a game that started at a yawn past 9 a. m., the defending World Series  champions managed just one hit over the first six innings and kicked the ball  around often enough to hand Lakewood a five-run lead. Marine struck out his  first three times up.  </P> <P> "I don't know what it was," West right-hander Pat Treend said. "We went to bed  early last night. We didn't ransack any restaurants or throw ice out of any  windows."  </P> <P> Or maybe Lakewood merely got hold of a better cup of coffee -- on its roster  was a reserve named Juan Valdez.  </P> <P> "It was early in the morning," West catcher Bobby Kim said. "I was nervous,  real nervous, and it seemed like my whole body was tired."  </P> <P> Kim and crew's lumber finally snapped out of its slumber, however, scoring  eight runs in the seventh to defeat Lakewood, 8-6, at Cleve Borman Field. West  (32-6) will play Union City in the second round at noon today.  </P> <P> West, which lost its opener here last year -- another morning start -- seemed  about ready to nod off for good before getting things rolling against Lakewood  left-hander David Reeser.  </P> <P> Through six innings, West had one single, a third-inning grounder to center by  outfielder Chris Castillo. Reeser, who will be a senior in the fall at Lakewood  High, retired 18 of the first 22 batters he faced, which was enough to finally  send West first baseman Jason Cohen into a Friday the 13th-style tizzy.  </P> <P> "Jason went crazy in the dugout in the seventh," Castillo said. "I've never  seen him like that. He was screaming his head off, going nuts."  </P> <P> Kim led off the seventh with a line single to left. Reeser, who had fanned  seven and walked three over the first six innings, then faded. He walked Sean  Boldt and Gregg Sheren on eight pitches to load the bases for Castillo, who  sent a liner into left to make it 5-1.  </P> <P> One out later, Paul Geller doubled to left-center, driving in Boldt and Sheren  to cut the Lakewood lead to 5-3. Reeser then hit Jeff Marks in the back to  reload the bases and was relieved by his younger brother, Dan, another  left-hander.  </P> <P> Marine, who didn't have many good swings against Dave, didn't look too dapper  against Dan, either. Marine topped one down the third-base line, where Richard  Alvarez stepped on the bag for a forceout and gunned to first for what could  have been an inning-ending double play. But the throw was in the dirt and  skipped down the line into foul territory. Two runs scored and a slightly  confused Marine wheeled all the way over to third.  </P> <P> "I didn't see what happened," Marine said. "I stopped running. I thought it was  a foul ball."  </P> <P> Cohen's single drove in Marine to give West a 6-5 lead and Kim -- whose single  started the outburst -- then slammed a 400-plus-foot bomb over the scoreboard  in left for an 8-5 lead. It was the sixth home run of the summer for the  red-hot Kim, who is 15 for 28 with 14 runs batted over the past seven games.  </P> <P> Kim figured that West was tired early. Lakewood napped later on.  </P> <P> "It started getting scary," Kim said. "Luckily, (David Reeser) started getting  tired around the sixth."  </P> <P> Lakewood (25-5) scored three runs in the second and two in the third to take a  5-0 lead off Treend. West errors -- the defending World Series champion  committed eight -- led to all five runs.  </P> <P> Boldt dropped a fly ball in right to open the second and Lakewood banged out  three consecutive two-out, run-scoring singles for a 3-0 lead.  </P> <P> In the third, Geller booted a routine grounder at second with two out and  Treend surrendered back-to-back, run-scoring doubles by Shawn Clodfelder and  Alvarez as Lakewood took a 5-0 lead.  </P> <P> And you thought Cohen was upset?  </P> <P> "(Treend) was getting really . . . off," Kim said. "He was throwing his glove  in the dugout. He kept yelling, 'Play some defense and get me some hits off  this . . . 11th-grader.' "  </P> <P> Treend (7-3) had a legitimate gripe. He did not allow an earned run, struck out  10 and walked four. He allowed nine hits, but only three over the final six  innings.  </P> <P> "That was typical of us," Kim said. "We get our butts kicked for a while and  then we come back later."  </P> <P> And later, as in today's noon start, had better not come any sooner.  </P></p>

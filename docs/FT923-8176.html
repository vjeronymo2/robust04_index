			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Jets pound rebel positions outside Afghan capital GOVERNMENT jet fighters yesterday bombed rebel positions east of the battle-scarred capital Kabul, according to Afghan and western sources, AP reports from Kabul. For the past week, guerrillas loyal to Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and his hardline Hezb-e-Islami group have rained thousands of rockets on Kabul, which is controlled by other factions. Government officials said more than 1,000 people were killed or wounded. Since ousting a Communist regime in April after a 14-year civil war, rebel factions have engaged in an internal power struggle and are divided along religious, ethnic and tribal lines. Defence ministry officials yesterday claimed they had forced Mr Hekmatyar's rebels out of the city. Mr Hekmatyar has promised to continue his war with Afghanistan's new Islamic government until a powerful Uzbek militia, which controls Kabul's combined military and civilian airport, is evicted from the capital. Western diplomats said reinforcements for the Uzbek militia troops led by Gen Rashid Dostam, arrived in Kabul yesterday from his headquarters in northern Afghanistan.</p>

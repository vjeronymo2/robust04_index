			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Pechiney hit by aluminium price fall PECHINEY, the world's largest packaging company and leading aluminium producer, yesterday announced a 23 per cent decline in operating profits due mainly to a sharp fall in aluminium prices. The state-controlled group also announced details of an asset reorganisation, which will leave its separately quoted 75 per cent subsidiary, Pechiney International, as a packaging company and put the aluminium business in the hands of the Pechiney parent. Pechiney is to pay FFr3.84bn (Dollars 684m) net to take over Pechiney International's aluminium and trading businesses, representing FFr6.05bn of assets minus FFr2.2bn of liabilities. Operating profits at the Pechiney parent fell from FFr6.68bn in 1990 to FFr5.12bn last year, on sales down by 3 per cent to FFr74.42bn. Net earnings fell to FFr820m from FFr2.22bn in 1990, excluding extraordinary gains. In packaging, operating profits rose by 13 per cent, but aluminium earnings collapsed, from FFr2.5bn to FFr1.48bn. Mr Jean Gandois, the chairman, said prices were weakened by a sudden influx of cheap exports from the former Soviet Union, which represented 22 per cent of the western European market last year. Pechiney is supporting European Commission moves to negotiate a voluntary restraint accord with the Russian republic, he said. Mr Gandois expected Russian exports to diminish this year because stocks there were low and local demand was increasing. However, worldwide aluminium stocks were still higher than normal, he said. The outlook for packaging was good, but overall, the group expected first-half earnings to fall, with a possible improvement in the second six months of this year. Pechiney International also recorded a sharp drop in operating earnings, down 9 per cent to FFr3.29bn on sales up from FFr43.02bn to FFr45.12bn. Net profits fell by 26.8 per cent to FFr842m. The assets transfer means the share of Pechiney International's sales in packaging will rise from 70 per cent to 85 per cent. The purpose of the asset sale is to make Pechiney International more attractive to investors and so help it raise capital, in line with the French government's decree last year that state industry could sell up to 49 per cent of its shares to the public.</p>

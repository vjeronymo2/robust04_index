			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Gerd Zitzelsberger: "Weakness Toward the Yen </F> Welcome"]    [Text] Munich, 15 February -- Two men's quarrel is the  third man's joy: The Germans are not to blame for the trade  dispute between the United States and Japan, but rather they  benefit from it -- at least at the moment. After all, the first  reaction to the failure of the trade talks was a significant  revaluation of the yen toward the dollar. At the same time, the  yen also became much more expensive toward the mark and  currently rates close to its highest historic level of August  1993.    Last Friday [11 February], a few hours before the talks were  suspended, 100 yen only cost 1.62 German marks [DM], while on  Tuesday it was DM1.68; this corresponds to a revaluation of the  Japanese currency -- or a devaluation of the mark -- by almost 4  percent. On the basis of the rate at the beginning of the year,  the changes even amount to 9 percent.    The expensive yen first of all means that German companies  will get more money for their exports to Japan -- calculated on  the basis of German marks. BMW or Wella can be happy about a  little extra money; yet, in terms of the national economy, it  does not make a big difference, since German exports to Japan  are still a mere trifle. What is important for the economy is  the effect on imports: Many Japanese products, ranging from  stereo systems to computer printers and automobiles, are very  popular here because they simply offer good value for one's  money. The stronger yen will not force the producers in the Far  East to increase prices in Germany to get the same money back in  yen as before. This will make German producers at home more  competitive.    Unlike a strong dollar, an expensive yen hardly creates any  dangers of inflation, but leads to shifts in market shares --  this benefited domestic industry even last year. In addition,  it improves the competitive position of German companies on  third markets over contenders from Japan.    The high rates of the yen toward the greenback,  incidentally,  also has a side effect: It has made the dollar slightly weaker  toward the mark. This development should actually make it  easier for the Bundesbank to resume its policy of small steps  and to cut interests, which are still much too high for the  current economic developments.    One thing that is open, of course, is how long the yen will  stay so high: Based on the strong economic growth in the United  States and the rather upward moving interest rates there,  experts expect the dollar to regain in strength. The price of  the yen is currently rather a political one than based on  economic output.    Yet, what is also open is how the agreement between the  United States and Japan, which is bound to come one day, will  look like: Will the two superpowers reach purely bilateral  agreements -- in violation of GATT rules -- then Germany and  Europe will be the losers. Yet, if Japan were to decide to tear  down some of the many invisible import hurdles, then Clinton  would have given the Europeans a present.</p>

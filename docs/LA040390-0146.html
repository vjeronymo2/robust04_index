			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: FERRANTE HASN'T AN ANSWER, JUST AN AVERAGE  </P> <P> Rose Ferrante talks about her hitting as if it's no big deal.  </P> <P> She shuns compliments and tries to act as if her talent is nothing special.  </P> <P> Ferrante, a sophomore catcher at Cypress College, is hitting .481, with eight  triples, two home runs and 19 runs batted in for the Chargers (25-3 overall,  9-0 in conference). She has struck out only twice in 104 at-bats.  </P> <P> But don't bother to ask her for any explanations.  </P> <P> "I don't even know why I'm a good hitter," she said. "I don't practice any more  than anyone else. I just have always been able to hit since I was 8, which was  when I started playing."  </P> <P> Cypress Coach Brad Pickler doesn't have any answers, either, but he has a few  ideas.  </P> <P> "I don't know why for sure," he said, "but she is pretty strong and has more of  a baseball-type swing. Some hitters turn their heads, but she stays right there  with her eyes wide open."  </P> <P> Ferrante first played for Pickler as a freshman at Savanna High School, but her  hitting talent was still developing. She was trying too hard to pull the ball,  Pickler said.  </P> <P> After working for a year to use the entire field, Ferrante's batting average  improved greatly.  </P> <P> She was an all-Orange League player for three years and was recruited by  Chapman College, but elected to attend Cypress.  </P> <P> "I wasn't a school person," Ferrante said. "I figured I would have more fun  here (Cypress). And I have."  </P> <P> Ferrante had lots of fun last season, when she bashed pitchers for a .389  average in 50 games.  </P> <P> Her hits (70), RBIs (40), doubles (eight), triples (nine), home runs (five) and  at-bats (180) were Cypress single-season records.  </P> <P> Ferrante was selected Orange Empire Conference player of the year, and Cypress  finished second to Fullerton.  </P> <P> The Chargers finished fourth in the state tournament, and Ferrante was voted to  the all-state team.  </P> <P> Ferrante took the summer off from fast-pitch softball for the first time since  she was 8. She also played some slow-pitch softball, but for the most part  relaxed.  </P> <P> Small package: Vincent Smalls, a former basketball standout at Saddleback  College, is trying a new sport at Hawaii.  </P> <P> Smalls, a 6-foot-4, 210-pound forward who was a first-team all-defensive  selection in the Western Athletic Conference this season, hopes to use his  defensive skills as a linebacker.  </P> <P> "I'm just going to go out and see what I can do," Smalls said.  </P> <P> Coach Bob Wagner projects Smalls, a senior who will have freshman eligibility  in football, as a pass-rushing outside linebacker and a special teams player.  </P> <P> "He's certainly a good athlete," Wagner said. "He showed some toughness on the  basketball court. Right now, we're trying to see if he can become proficient as  a pass rusher."  </P> <P> Wagner said he's not concerned with Smalls' size, saying football savvy and  technique are more important.  </P> <P> Smalls will be given a one-year scholarship.  </P> <P> When Saddleback Coach Bill Otta says this season's men's tennis team might be  one of his best, it's time to take notice.  </P> <P> Otta has coached Saddleback to three state titles (1984, '88 and '89).  Saddleback has also won 11 consecutive conference championships since he took  over in 1979.  </P> <P> The Gauchos also own eight Southern California championships.  </P> <P> This season's team is 16-0 overall, 8-0 in the Orange Empire Conference.  Saddleback is 278-57 in duel matches under Otta.  </P> <P> Hot bats: Rancho Santiago's Conrad Colby and Cypress' Doug McConathy and Troy  Babbitt were impressive at the plate last week.  </P> <P> Colby was six for 10 with a double and seven RBIs. He had six walks, scored  four runs and raised his batting average from .404 to .428.  </P> <P> Babbitt was seven for nine with two doubles, three RBIs and raised his average  from .307 to .345.  </P> <P> McConathy was six for 10, scored four runs, had two RBIs and raised his average  from .368 to .388.  </P> <P> Colby's torrid pace could be slowed by an ankle injury he suffered rounding  second base in Saturday's 15-5 victory over Riverside.  </P> <P> "We'll have to wait and see how well he responds to treatment," Rancho Santiago  Coach Don Sneddon said. "I'm being optimistic, but his ankle isn't right now."  </P> <P> Community College Notes  </P> <P> Orange Coast's Joe Fumi-Fiamawle, a defensive back, and Scott Sullivan, a  linebacker, have signed to play at four-year colleges in the fall.  Fumi-Fiamawle will attend Marshall University, and Sullivan will attend Drake.  </P></p>

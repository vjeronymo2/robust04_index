			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Management: Taxman on the move - A look at changes in UK staff relocation prompted by new tax rules Not every company necessarily followed the notorious example of a chemicals multinational that once picked up the vet and tranquiliser fees for a traumatised pet. But at least the important things in life - golf club entrance fees near the new place of work, for example - were routinely reimbursed. The golden age of staff relocation, however, came to an end in Britain with dramatic suddenness 15 months ago. The reason was not so much the adverse economic climate - though that has certainly played its part - as the impact of tough new tax measures announced in the March 1993 Budget, which became effective on April 6 last year. Described by Sue Shortland, manager of the Confederation of British Industry's Employee Relocation Council, as 'the greatest change in the tax treatment of relocation expenses for over 40 years', the new regime imposes a cap of Pounds 8,000 on items deemed eligible for relief and a time limit by which costs have to be incurred to qualify. It also lays down stringent Inland Revenue reporting rules requiring companies to keep track of their payments. Eligible expenses include the cost of transporting the belongings of employees and their families to a new residence, the normal costs of buying and selling a home, and house hunting and familiarisation trips for employee and family. Expenses and benefits that could be claimed tax-free under the old rules but which are debarred for tax-relief under the new rules include any loss on the sale of an old residence, the initial cleaning costs of a new property, and help with the additional costs of moving to a more expensive area. Almost overnight, employers found themselves with tax inefficient relocation packages and an unpalatable range of choices: meet their employees' new tax liabilities in full by 'grossing up' any expenses over the Pounds 8,000 ceiling - an option that could mean a 50 per cent increase in the cost of a typical relocation package; ensure that no tax problem arose by cutting the benefits offered - easier said than done when a domestic move typically costs Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 25,000; or force employees to meet the new liability themselves in part or in full - hardly the most popular or enlightened approach. First indications of the strategies being adopted by British companies were disclosed on Tuesday when the CBI and the accounting firm Ernst and Young published the results of an exhaustive survey* of almost 600 businesses. The message from the research is that while employers are not cutting back on relocation activity as such, a growing number are seeking - and finding - ways to contain and offset the additional expenses. The main trends identified by the survey were: A preference for grossing up. Before the 1993 Finance Act most companies operated policies within the Inland Revenue's then generous guidelines. Of the 152 respondents who indicated a change in their thinking, a majority (57 per cent) were planning to pay tax on their employees' behalf, a tenth were making employees meet their own tax liability, a tenth were introducing a selective policy, and another 10 per cent were capping relocation expenses at Pounds 8,000. Some employers have evidently adopted a compromise by grossing up direct costs and items that they genuinely feel should be tax-refundable (such as school uniforms) but leaving the tax on other items such as golf club subscriptions and carpets to the employees themselves. Others are keeping their cards close to their chests. The subsidiary of a UK food and drink company said it will 'probably' gross up - but it has no plans to tell employees this. 'We do not want people to spend money knowing that the company will bear all the costs,' said a respondent to the survey. A new enthusiasm for outright house purchase schemes, as distinct from schemes where employers guarantee a minimum price for the property. Under the new tax rules the acquisition and disposal costs of employees' properties purchased outright by the employer (or a relocation company) fall outside the Pounds 8,000 limit. The tax position regarding gains returned to the employee had been unclear, but in April it was confirmed that these can now be handed back without penalty provided the house contract is worded correctly. A tendency to withdraw or reduce the so-called 'additional housing allowance'. This allowance no longer attracts tax relief but has traditionally been paid to employees moving from low housing cost areas to areas where prices are high. The survey highlighted ways in which companies are now restricting the allowance - cutting back the number of years it is paid, setting minimum house price differentials (for example, 10 per cent) which have to be triggered before employees qualify for the extra money. More temporary accommodation reviews. Costs have been controlled by the introduction of overall spending and time limits. 'Employees do not need the smartest hotel in town - they can make do with something that is clean and comfortable,' was one comment made in the survey. A greater use by companies of external advisers (particularly in areas connected with property), though a degree of scepticism remains. The introduction of more efficient purchaser indices for UK expatriates going abroad. The number of companies indicating changes in their international relocation policies was very small, but the survey revealed that one-third of companies pay for transportation of pets. A widespread lack of sound reporting procedures. Almost half the respondents either had no system or had an inadequate method for tracking and reporting their relocation expenses as required by the 1993 Finance Act. According to Michael Kaltz, partner at Ernst &amp; Young, employers face a penalty of Pounds 3,000 for each incorrect submission. Many companies, it seems, are still reviewing their policies, as presentations this week at a CBI conference by an international oil company and an international pharmaceuticals company underlined. Both are awaiting board approval for proposed changes designed to address the new tax rules and - in one case at least - likely to reduce costs substantially. *Copies of the survey summary, Business on the Move, are available from the CBI Employee Relocation Council, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London WC1.

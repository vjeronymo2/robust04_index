			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and  others]    [Text] The visit to Russia by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin,  which begins on Sunday [24 April], will be the first in the  history of bilateral relations. "We have enough things to  discuss," a senior Foreign Minister official, Viktor Gogitidze,  told Interfax on Friday.    According to him, two big packages of issues will be  discussed in the course of talks Rabin will have with President  Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev. "This will include primarily  Russian-Israeli relations. Solid legal foundations will be built  for them for the first time ever. Several bilateral agreements,  accords on cooperation in such areas, as culture, science and  agriculture among them, are expected to be signed in Moscow,"  the diplomat said.    The other package includes issues connected with a  settlement  in the Middle East, he said. "Rabin's visit to Moscow is  particularly important, since it will take place at the  conclusion of negotiations on Gaza and Jericho. We intend to  discuss the possible ways out of the complicated situation the  negotiating process has reached, so that agreements on Gaza and  Jericho could be signed in the next few days. This would be  conducive to lowering tensions in the occupied territories,"  Gogitidze said.    According to him, "participants in the talks will focus on  the Syrian direction." "Much in the efforts to gain peace and  stability in the Middle East will depend on how the things will  move in that direction. Unfortunately, movement in the Syrian  direction slowed down of late," the diplomat said. "Therefore  we intend to discuss separately the Israeli vision of  settlement, what is needed to break the stalemate in the  negotiating process, what Russia can do as a cosponsor of the  peace process and a country that maintains close ties with both  Syria and Israel."    Interfax's interviewee also mentioned Russia's intention to  get "first-hand information" as to what Rabin meant concretely  when he proclaimed willingness to remove Israeli settlers from  the Golan Heights in exchange for peace with Syria. "This is a  totally new development of events," he said.    When asked whether Moscow intends to exert "pressure" on  Rabin, as the PLO leader, Yasir 'Arafat, who visited Moscow  recently, wanted, Gogitidze said: "As a cosponsor of the peace  process Russia refrains from exerting pressure on anyone. What  is needed is a compromise that would suit both sides. Nothing  should be pressed on any side. What has been pressed on someone  will never be carried out."</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES : TAKING THE A TRAIN TO SANTA BARBARA FESTIVAL WHALUM BENEFIT DUE  SUNDAY IN PASADENA  </P> <P> For the first time in more than five years, Santa Barbara has a jazz festival.  </P> <P> Headlined by saxophonist Stan Getz, the Santa Barbara International Jazz  Festival kicks off tonight and runs through Saturday, with performances -- by  such name artists as Getz, pianist David Benoit and conga drummer Poncho  Sanchez, and such Santa Barbara-area musicians as pianist Debbie Denke and  flutist Bob Ledner -- in venues all over town.  </P> <P> "A lot of people think I'm totally crazy to try and pull off a festival here,  but I thought it could be done if it emphasized that Santa Barbara is a  beautiful place to go," said Jack Butefish, festival director.  </P> <P> "I wanted to create an atmosphere where jazz is happening all over town,  including bands in the streets Friday and Saturday, on a big stage in front of  City Hall, in the nightclubs and the concert halls," said Butefish.  </P> <P> Among the special events will be the Amtrak Jazz Train, which will carry  festival-goers -- entertained by a jazz trio en route -- from Los Angeles'  Union Station to Santa Barbara Friday (a return trip is scheduled for Sunday),  and a jazz club crawl, led by noted KKGO-FM disc jockey Chuck Niles, which will  take place after Getz's Saturday evening concert.  </P> <P> Information: (800) 321-3378 or (805) 962-0800.  </P> <P> The Boys Club of Pasadena and the MacKenzie-Scott Branch Women's Assn. will  share the proceeds from the Kirk Whalum Benefit Jazz Concert, scheduled to  begin at 8 p.m. Sunday at Pasadena City College's Sexton Auditorium. In  addition to jazz/funk saxophonist Whalum, the bill includes singer Diane  Reeves, saxmen Gerald Albright and George Howard and an all-star band.  Information: (213) 480-3232 or (714) 740-2000.  </P> <P> Though Corky Hale is perhaps best known as a jazz harpist, talk to her for a  few minutes and she will let you know she wears a few other musical hats as  well. "When I worked at the Cocoanut Grove in the '50s, I played harp with the  orchestra, flute on the Latin numbers, intermission piano and sang with the big  band," she said.  </P> <P> Some of her biggest thrills have been as a pianist. "I've played piano for  everybody," she quipped. Among the singers she has accompanied are Barbra  Streisand and Billie Holiday, the latter in a two-week stint at Jazz City, the  popular room at Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue that spotlighted jazz  greats from Art Blakey to Shelly Manne and Conte Candoli in the '50s.  </P> <P> Hale can be heard Thursdays in October at Tom Rolla's Gardenia Club in  Hollywood, backing some of her favorite songwriters -- Hal David (tonight),  Johnny Mandel, Alan Bergman and the team of Lieber and Stoller. (Mike Stoller  also happens to be Hale's husband.)  </P> <P> "I'll have each of the writers do a couple of their songs, and then I'll do  one," she said. Bassist Herb Mickman and drummer Gene Estes will also be on  hand.  </P> <P> Another facet of the show will find Hale doing tunes that she worked on with  such stars as Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole. "I'll talk about the tunes, and  about how I got to do them. I've done a lot crazy things, and I hope to put  some of these happenings in my show," she joked.  </P> <P> ***** "Messages" (Prestige), from the marvelous-yet-underrecognized saxophonist  Hank Mobley, is the epitome of a hard-bop recording. This superb 1956  two-record set (on a single CD) offers a blend of bop classics -- "Bouncing  With Bud," "52nd Street Theme" -- along with torchy ballads and crackling  medium and up-tempos, all infused with the bluesy tinge that marked the  hard-bop genre. Mobley, a master improviser who could weave art and funk into  sumptuous, melodic cloths, is assisted by trumpet greats Kenny Dorham (who was  seen a bit in the recently re-released "Dangerous Liaisons 1960"), pianists  Barry Harris and Walter Bishop, bassist Doug Watkins and drummer Art Taylor.  This is music that never stops cooking.  </P> <P>  Records are rated from one to five stars: ***** means a swinging must-have for  the jazz lover; * means save your pennies, Benny.  </P> <P> </P></p>

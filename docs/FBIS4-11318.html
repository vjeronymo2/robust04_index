			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 24 Apr (PL) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro  will hold a reception for the Cubans living abroad who are  participating here in The Nation and the Emigrants Conference,  Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for the meeting, confirmed today.    The Cuban president invited the 215 emigrants from 29  countries to a reception following the closing session of the  meeting that began on 22 April on an initiative by the Cuban  Foreign Ministry.    Alfonso confirmed the invitation during a meeting with the  press, during which he reported on the participation of Vice  President Carlos Lage, who spoke about the current economic  situation and the country's outlook, which has worsened with the  disappearance of the European socialist bloc and the tightening  of the U.S. economic blockade.    According to Alfonso, Lage said the Cuban emigrants will not  be kept from investing in the island, but said that future  meetings will determine the mechanisms that will be applied in  that regard.</p>

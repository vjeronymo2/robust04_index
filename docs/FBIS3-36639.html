This will serve as a background for work in other areas, he  noted in an interview to a RIA correspondent, commenting on the  results of the Russian-Georgian summit.    Speaking about the prospects of Russian-Georgian cooperation  in the military domain, Ryurikov stressed that unless the  conflicts in Abkhazia and South Osetia are settled, cooperation  will be impossible.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Vicente Ululu, secretary general of the  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], said that Renamo leader  Afonso Dhlakama is expected to visit Portugal during the second  half of this month. Ululu told NOTICIAS that he received the  information from a Renamo branch in Lisbon, which said that the  Portuguese Foreign Ministry had sent an invitation for a  Dhlakama visit to the Renamo Office in Maputo. He said that "so  far, we (Renamo) have not received an official invitation from  the Portuguese Government. We shall reply as soon as we receive  the invitation."    Asked to comment on the objectives of Dhlakama's visit to  Portugal, Vicente Ululu said his movement was interested in  briefing European countries about the steps being taken in the  process of pacification and democratization of the country.    Ululu said: As you are aware, the peace process is  progressing satisfactorily. At the moment we are sending our  guerrilla forces to assembly points throughout the country.  Some of these troops will join the Mozambique Defense Armed  Forces, while others will be demobilized. All these steps show  that the process is progressing smoothly. [passage omitted]    The Renamo leader is also expected to visit Spain and the  United States, although senior Renamo officials declined to  comment on that report.    The Renamo secretary general also told NOTICIAS that he does  not exclude the possibility of his leader "visiting Tanzania,  Zambia, and Namibia, in the coming days." [passage omitted]</p>

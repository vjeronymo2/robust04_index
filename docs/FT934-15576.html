			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: Philips confirms deal with Rabobank PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, has confirmed that it recently arranged a sale and lease-back transaction with Rabobank, the big Dutch co-operative bank, but declined to give any further details of the deal. The company refused to comment on a Dutch radio programme which reported that Rabobank had purchased certain intangible assets, such as patents and technology licences, and then leased them back to Philips. The programme said the transaction was arranged in the summer and was worth several hundred million guilders. Philips, which is redoubling efforts at asset management under its finance director, Mr Dudley Eustace, would say only that the transaction had taken place 'recently' but it refused to say what kind of assets were involved or how much they were worth. The deal received indirect blessings from the Dutch government. It emerged on Friday that the Dutch cabinet approved the tax implications of the deal in the summer after the country's tax authorities had initially balked at Rabobank's plans to purchase the assets. The deal means Rabobank is likely to pay less corporate tax this year than would otherwise have been the case. The Amsterdam stock exchange said it had not yet decided whether the transaction was price-sensitive information which should have been reported to investors. Philips' shares did not react to news of the lease-back arrangement, closing unchanged on Friday at Fl 36.20. The transaction has received wide attention in the Netherlands, where it has been interpreted as a gesture of government support for one of the country's most important companies. Philips, which is plagued by recession in the consumer electronics industry, has been making a concerted drive to cut its working capital and boost its cashflow. Until now, however, it has not publicly reported a lease-back arrangement. Earlier this year, Philips bolstered its balance sheet by selling its minority stake in a semi-conductor joint venture to Matsushita of Japan, generating a gain of Fl 1.1bn.</p>

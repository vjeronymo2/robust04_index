			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Esselte to divide in restructuring move THE board of Esselte, the Swedish office products group, confirmed yesterday that it proposes to divide the company into two independent groups as part of its restructuring programme. Esselte AB will be the company's international business arm concentrating on the production and marketing of office products while there is to be small Nordic business - Information Systems - dealing with the company's wholesale and retail operations related to office electronics and office products. The aim of Esselte's division is to streamline the business and create a more clearly defined and efficient structure. Yesterday the group acknowledged its present organisation was chaotic and hinders overall development. While Esselte's international manufacturing segment is 'currently in a more expansive phase,' its Nordic operations are 'experiencing a phase of consolidation and restructuring'. The group said yesterday this created problems for the focus of its activities and resource allocation. The shareholders will be asked to approve of Esselte's division at their annual meeting on June 12 and the company said the share distribution would take place no later than November 30. Under the proposal the Swedish company Getinge Intressenter, owned by Mr Rune Andersson, Esselte chairman, will become the largest shareholder in the new Nordic group with 34.8 per cent of its equity and 47.7 per cent of its voting rights after buying the shares in Esselte owned by the two large Swedish banks Nordbanken and Gota. Esselte has gone through a prolonged period of upheaval caused by competitive cost pressures and falling demand for its products. Two years ago it began to concentrate on a core business strategy.</p>

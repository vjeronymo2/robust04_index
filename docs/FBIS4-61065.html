			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Kozlov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 3 May -- The official visit of Greek Foreign  Minister Karolos Papoulias to Russia, which was planned for 3-5  May, has been postponed to a later date at the request of the  Russian side. The date of the visit has not yet been  determined, Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Press and  Information Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told  ITAR-TASS today.    The main reason for the postponement is linked to the  signing  of the agreement "Gaza-Jericho -- First" between the PLO and  Israel, which will take place in Cairo tomorrow and which will  be attended by Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev, who left for  the Egyptian capital today.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Slimmer Unigroup Pounds 4.41m in the black Unigroup, the building materials group, yesterday reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.41m for the 15-month period to September 30. The outcome included interest payable of Pounds 1.38m, offset by interest receivable and similar income of Pounds 918,000. A further Pounds 361,000 was written off.

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Labour condemns publicity spending Labour yesterday attacked the amount being spent on publicity by the Department for Education and called for an inquiry by the Commons public accounts committee. According to parliamentary answers given by the government, education department spending on publicity has increased from Pounds 103,000 in 1979-80 to Pounds 8.77m in the current financial year. It rose from Pounds 4.52m in 1990-91 to Pounds 8.88m in 1991-92. Spending dipped to Pounds 6.88m in the following year, to rise again in 1993-94. Television advertising started in 1990-91 at Pounds 1.1m with Pounds 800,000 spent the next year. Both the Parent's Charter - part of the Citizen's Charter initiative - and grant-maintained schools have been heavily publicised. Mrs Ann Taylor, who speaks for Labour on education, said the advertising was often 'factually incorrect, designed simply to prop up failing Conservative education policies'. The department's expenditure was 'a national scandal at a time when schools are crumbling and cannot afford to buy books'.</p>

Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. This proposal would enable most small banks to avoid the data collection requirements in 12 CFR Part 25 and will encourage greater small business lending by banks of all sizes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Board: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For all the reasons discussed in the joint preamble, it is hereby certified that this proposed rule, if adopted as a final rule, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small banks. This proposal would enable most small banks to avoid the data collection requirements in 12 CFR Part 228 and will encourage greater small business lending by financial institutions of all sizes. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. The Board invites comment on this matter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDIC: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is hereby certified that this proposed rule, if adopted as a final rule, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small banks. This proposal would enable most small banks to avoid the data collection requirements in 12 CFR Part 345 and will encourage greater small business lending by financial institutions of all sizes.

This proposal provides an alternative means of evaluating a small savings association's CRA requirements that would enable most such savings associations to avoid the data collection requirements in 12 CFR Part 563e and will encourage greater small business lending by savings associations of all sizes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OCC: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It has been determined that this document is a significant regulatory action.

			<p>BFN     [Text] More and more countries are joining in a possible  evacuation. A Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman has advised that  Dutch nationals wanting to leave Rwanda can join the evacuation  of the Belgians. So the Dutch are talking about a real  evacuation operation involving the collection of foreigners from  Rwanda, whereas our government is speaking of a mission to  protect our compatriots. Some 100 Dutch nationals live in  Rwanda with 30 of them residing in Kigali.    The Dutch Air Force sent a 230 plane [not further  identified]  to Rwanda this morning to help with the evacuation. This  happened in consultation with the Belgian Government. The  transport plane took off from Melsbroek with a mixed  Dutch-Belgian crew.    Germany, too, is preparing an evacuation operation. The  German Foreign Ministry says that this will happen in  cooperation with the Belgians and the French.</p>

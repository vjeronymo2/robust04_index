			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Respecting International Regulations"] </F>   [Text] The comprehensive news reports on the approval of  the Social Emergency Fund (FSE) and the creation of the Real  Value Unit (URV) overshadowed the announcement of the decision  last week by U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor to not  recommend imposing sanctions against Brazil for still not having  a law on the protection of industrial property satisfactory to  Washington's demands. It would not, however, be an exaggeration  to say that this decision is very important to the Brazilian  economy because it eliminates a threat that could strain our  relationship with the United States.    The much-talked-about lack of international credibility  Brazil enjoys for not fulfilling its promises was denied in a  note issued by Kantor, who not only recognized but also praised  the Brazilian Government's efforts to modernize its patents law.  Contrary to what many believed -- this daily among them --  President Bill Clinton's administration showed signs of  understanding the reform process Brazil is experiencing, within  a democratic framework, to be able to regain its place in the  world market. In fact, it would not only be unfair but also  politically inadvisable to impose retaliatory measures against  Brazil precisely when it is trying, in the midst of all sorts of  obstacles, to open its economy.    As is obvious, the U.S. decision is the result of an  intensive nine-month negotiation. There were times when it  seemed impossible that the United States would not resort to the  so-called Super 301 trade law to force Brazil to adjust to the  patterns considered correct for the protection of industrial or  intellectual property. As was even reported, Kantor is tired of  Brazilian explanations that the approval of the specific draft  bill was in Congress' hands, which led U.S. officials to believe  the Brazilian Government had no political will to change the  country's previous stance regarding patents. Even at the worst  moments, Brazilian diplomacy did not become discouraged and kept  open the direct as well as the indirect communication channels  with Washington through the Foreign Ministry and the embassy.  Brazil's position was clearly stated: If, after almost seven  years of the Uruguay Round of talks, guidelines regarding  intellectual property were established and the government  officially promised to sign them during the April meeting in  Marrakesh, there should be no controversy with the United States  on the subject. All that needs to be done is adopt the  regulations negotiated at the international level, which is what  Brazil intends to do.    Kantor's note significantly asserts that "Brazil has  demonstrated its leadership role by promptly implementing  Uruguay Round measures regarding intellectual property." This  represents an undoubtable step forward because it clearly means  that the United States accepts that international economic  relations be established according to GATT regulations -- or  those of the World Trade Organization (OMC) that will replace  the GATT, without intending to impose its own regulations.  Consequently, it is assumed that Washington will accept that  international organization's ruling in case of controversies.    Those who eternally uphold conspiracy theories will say that  the United States will reach "secret agreements" with Brazil.  In addition to being offensive to our two democracies, the  argument sounds ridiculous. Is a secret agreement necessary for  sovereign countries to promise to abide by international  regulations and procedures?    We must mention the contribution Kantor's decision has made  to the success of the conference scheduled to be held in May in  Washington where President Clinton will meet the democratically  elected Latin American and Caribbean chiefs of state. Solving  conflicts through negotiations is essential for the proposal of  the economic integration of the continent's countries to make  progress.</p>

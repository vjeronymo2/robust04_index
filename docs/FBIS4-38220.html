			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan arrived in  Tehran this morning at the head of a high-ranking political,  economic, social, and cultural delegation. He was formally  welcomed by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani.    After arriving in Tehran Mr. Aliyev, in an interview with  our  correspondent, referred to the Islamic Republic of Iran [IRI]  and our country's revolutionary people as the friends and  sincere brothers of the Azerbaijan Republic. Referring to the  two countries' common historical, national, and religious  background, he said: We attach great importance to the IRI as an  influential and powerful neighbor and we would like the two  countries to expand ties in all fields. The president of  Azerbaijan added that during his stay in our country he will  hold talks with President Hashemi-Rafsanjani and other IRI  officials on the most significant regional and international  issues and the expansion of the two countries' relations.    On the axes of talks with Azerbaijan's president and the two  countries' ties, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said:    [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] In the name of God, the  compassionate, the merciful. We are very close to Azerbaijan in  every respect. Our people feel solidarity [yeganegi] in both  countries. At present the level of our ties is very good too.  During my visit to Baku -- frankly -- among the authorities,  with Mr. Aliyev himself, and among the people I felt as if they  were like our own people. Fortunately many of the decisions we  took during that visit are currently being implemented. Of  course some of the important decisions require time for  implementation. We have had some memoranda of understanding,  which we will pursue during this visit.    To us the problem of military conflict in Caucasia is highly  significant. One of the subjects of our talks, therefore, will  be the same issues of Karabakh and the problems of Caucasia in  general.    Among our important issues are cooperation in the Caspian  Sea  and greater utilization of the joint river of Aras. There are  the issues of transit, trade and exchange visits by our people.  Almost all the issues that the two countries are interested in  and eager to discuss will be discussed during this visit. We  hope that just like my trip to Baku, the visit of his excellency  the president of Azerbaijan to Tehran will also be a great  stride in the expansion of cooperation.

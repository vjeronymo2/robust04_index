			<p>BFN     [Text] After a stormy meeting behind closed doors, the  parliamentary faction of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS]  rejected by a large majority, with four abstentions, the draft  decision proposed by Edvin Sugarev on the self-dissolution of  the National Assembly if Professor Berov's cabinet remains in  power. This draft decision does not conform to the Bulgarian  Constitution and would deceive the country. This was stated by  Stefan Savov, chairman of the SDS parliamentary faction, after  the meeting.    The proposal of Aleksandur Yordanov was not discussed  because  he withdrew it. Edvin Sugarev described that proposal as a joke.</p>

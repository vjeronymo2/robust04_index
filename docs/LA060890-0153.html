			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON;  </P> <P> BEHIND THE PLAIN EXTERIOR IS A FAMILY THAT COOKS GREAT MEXICAN SEAFOOD  </P> <P> When 1st Street is finished being Little Saigon, it turns into Little  Sonora-Durango-Jalisco-Chihuahua. There are more Mexican restaurants on 1st in  Santa Ana than you could shake a chopstick at.  </P> <P> Perhaps there is even an embarrassment of riches. The seafood restaurant called  Colima, at the corner of Fairview Street, ought to be busy but nobody seems  able to find it in the crowd. The other night the only other people in the  place were a lonely looking couple sitting silently on opposite sides of a  giant fried fish.  </P> <P> I couldn't help but notice them, and maybe this is another problem for Colima.  The place is so bright, due to highly reflective chandeliers stuck in every  corner of the room, that you may wish you had sunglasses. Perhaps the owners,  who hail from the city of Colima in Mexico, are homesick for sun-soaked Colima.  </P> <P> Maybe you could call that atmosphere, if you have a generous spirit. Basically,  though, Colima is your elemental storefront restaurant, perhaps a little  roomier than most but with no embellishments. We are talking plain. Not even  one bullfight poster.  </P> <P> But who cares? These people can really cook; the whole family, it seems, can  cook. Lupe Valencia, the mother, makes wonderful corn tortillas by hand, and  also some of the appetizers and several of the desserts. Her sons, who wait the  tables, also prepare the seafood.  </P> <P> Wonderful tortillas make for wonderful tortilla chips and you get a basket of  hot, fresh ones the minute you are seated. The chips come with an equally  irresistible salsa, the dark, smoky kind, and pico de gallo, a condiment of  finely minced onion, tomato, chiles and cilantro. Eat all you want, as the  commercial says. They'll make more.  </P> <P> Don't make the mistake of starting with nachos unless you come with a large  group. "Nachitos," said the waiter, which literally means "little nachos." But  he put down a monstrous platter of them, a mountain of corn chips with beans  and two kinds of Mexican cheese, topped with sour cream and green chili.  </P> <P> I admired his sly sense of humor, but I was barely able to eat a corner of the  dish. Six people, conservatively, would have a hard time with it.  </P> <P> There are several caldos (soups), such as siete mares (seven seas), a briny  broth with a combination of seafoods (shrimp, snapper, and octopus), and a  couple of seafood cocteles based on shrimp, oyster or abalone. These dishes are  perfectly fine but not what the restaurant does best.  </P> <P> What you want to come here for is fish, which the restaurant buys fresh several  times a week.  </P> <P> Snapper offers the largest number of cooking options: a la plancha (grilled),  empanizado (breaded), al mojo (fried with garlic), a la diabla (smothered in  chili sauce), a la Veracruzana (with tomato sauce) and ranchera (baked with a  spicy sauce containing tomatoes and onions). I had the snapper empanizado, and  it was nearly perfect, firm-fleshed with crusty breading.  </P> <P> The restaurant also has fresh mojarra (perch) and vagre (catfish), but for some  reason never cooks them any way but by deep-frying. You can have them sauced al  mojo, a la diabla, or ranchera, but that only makes for different toppings.  When fish are fresh, I'd say frying is the last way they should be cooked. Why  couldn't they be grilled?  </P> <P> But I must admit that as fried fish they are terrific. The catfish is huge,  bigger than the vaunted catfish at Laguna Beach's Five Feet restaurant (and  about one-third the price), and as sweet-fleshed as can be. We had ours a la  diabla, and it came standing up straight on the dish, looking crisp and ready  for action. There were three of us, and when the smoke cleared away, plenty of  the fish remained.  </P> <P> The perch is not as big or sweet, but it fries up so crunchy you can actually  eat the smaller bones, which is exactly what they do in Mexico. This fish makes  for great tacos with mama Lupe's handmade tortillas. Smear them with salsa and  you have a world-class treat, to be washed down with a Bohemia or a Dos Equis,  perhaps, or another of the imported beers the restaurant carries.  </P> <P> There are also some shrimp and lobster dishes, grilled and given the same  sauces as the fried fish.  </P> <P> Should you hanker for non-seafood items, there is no shortage of them on this  menu. Tacos are made from tongue as well as chicken. There is a fine chile  verde made with chunked pork. The chiles rellenos, pan-fried breaded chiles  stuffed with cheese and topped with sour cream sauce, are the richest I've ever  had.  </P> <P> All main dishes come with good beans, dry but tasty rice and a bizarre salad  made from shredded carrot and chunks of pineapple. (How'd that get in there?)  </P> <P> For dessert, you could have a dense, semi-sweet flan, but the one that knocked  me out was the Mexican eggnog called rompope. Mama Lupe uses 100-proof rum, egg  yolk, heavy cream and spices to make one of the most devastating eggnogs  anywhere. It is served in a four-ounce glass and I'll bet you can't finish  half. I couldn't. In fact, there is usually far too much to eat at Colima.  </P> <P> Colima is inexpensive. Appetizers are $1.50 to $3.95. Seafood cocktails are $6  to $8.75. Filets (snapper) are $8.50. Vagre (catfish) is $9.50. Mojarra (perch)  is $8.95. Shrimp dishes are $8.95. Lobster is $16.50.  </P> <P> * COLIMA  </P> <P> 130 N. Fairview St., Santa Ana.  </P> <P> (714) 836-1254.  </P> <P> Open daily for breakfast, lunch and dinner, 7:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.  </P> <P> Cash only.  </P></p>

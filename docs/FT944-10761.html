			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Business class lifts BA to record: Warning of heavy write-downs on USAir investment if talks with union collapse British Airways yesterday announced record second-quarter profits and an 'encouraging' outlook for the full year, as it reaped the rewards of a campaign to win business travellers and tight cost controls. However, BA said it would make provisions against its Dollars 400m (Pounds 244m) investment in USAir, if negotiations with the troubled airline's Pilots' Union are not 'successfully resolved'. A full write-down would add 3 percentage points to its current net debt/capital ratio of 53 per cent. Pre-tax profits for the six months to September rose 45 per cent to Pounds 341m, with Pounds 253m coming from the second quarter, which covers the key summer period. The figures were above expectations, and the shares closed 8p higher at 365p. Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive, said the company was on target to achieve its previously-stated aim of Pounds 150m of cost savings for the full year. Operating costs rose 7.7 per cent to Pounds 3.18m during the period, compared with a 9.8 per cent increase in group turnover to Pounds 3.62m. The cost base was helped by a 5.4 per cent fall in fuel and oil costs. The airline carried 16.4m passengers during the period, an increase of 6.8 per cent. Its performance was improved by the fact that revenues from the more profitable first and business-class passengers grew at almost double the rate of economy class. In addition, cargo revenues increased by 14.6 per cent. Qantas, the Australian flagship carrier in which BA has a 25 per cent stake, announced profits of ADollars 301.8m (Pounds 141m) for the year to June, up from ADollars 32.9m, and it is operating in what IATA expects to be the fastest growing market in the world over the next four years. However, TAT and Deutsche BA, BA's European affiliates, reported losses similar to 1993. Analysts estimate that the two companies will lose more than Pounds 50m this year as they have been hampered by the competitive impact of the French government's Pounds 2.4bn subsidy to Air France. Overall, associates contributed Pounds 2m, compared with a Pounds 13m loss in 1993. BA was adamant that its relationship with USAir has been positive, arguing that the tie-up would bring in incremental profits of Pounds 70m in the current year, due to their joint frequent-flyer programmes and cost sharing arrangements. Sir Colin said it was impossible to predict when negotiations with USAir's unionised employees would be resolved. Earnings per share increased by 17.2 per cent (fully diluted) to 23.9p (20.4p), reflecting a return to a more normal tax charge of 25 per cent. BA is to pay an interim dividend of 3.5p (3.18p).

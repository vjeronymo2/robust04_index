			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Letter: Support for the TUC's national economic assessment Sir, John Gapper's report on the Usdaw conference ('Usdaw votes for and against pay restraint policy', May 1) stated, with reference to the national economic assessment, that 'opposition to the idea in the TUC has been led by the AEU engineering union'. Your readers should be aware that, while the AEU sought changes to the first draft of the document, in the course of a debate at the TUC general council on April 26 unanimity was reached on the content of a TUC statement on collective bargaining, including a section clearly setting out the role of the national economic assessment. The only amendment to the draft being considered by the general council was moved by Bill Jordan, president of the AEU, and seconded by Rodney Bickerstaffe, chairman of the economic committee and general secretary of the National Union of Public Employees. This was incorporated in the text and the statement was then adopted unanimously. David Lea, assistant general secretary, Trades Union Congress, Congress House, Great Russell Street WC1B 3LS</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KINGS GET 4TH WIN IN ROW;  </P> <P> HOCKEY: GRETZKY SCORES GOAL IN 5-2 VICTORY OVER WHALERS, BUT FALLS SHORT OF  2,000 MARK.  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky failed to reach the 2,000-point mark Friday night, settling for  one goal to push his career point total to 1,997.  </P> <P> No complaints from the Kings, however, who gained the two points in the  standings they were seeking by beating the Hartford Whalers, 5-2, before a  Forum crowd of 14,499. It gave the Kings a five-point edge in the Smythe  Division over runners-up Vancouver and Calgary.  </P> <P> The Kings' victory, sparked by Tomas Sandstrom's two goals, was their fourth in  a row, equaling their best winning streak from last season and improving their  record to 6-1-1, best in the NHL. Their unbeaten string increased to six.  </P> <P> "We're surprising a lot of people," Gretzky said. "Some people thought we'd be  in last. It's not just that we're winning, but our goals-against is strong.  When we're winning and holding the other guys to two goals or one goal, you  know these guys are for real."  </P> <P> The Kings have given up six goals in their last four games.  </P> <P> Gretzky's goal, his seventh, went into an open net after the game was out of  the Whalers' reach. Hartford dropped to 4-3-2, still good enough to lead the  Adams Division.  </P> <P> For the fifth consecutive game, the opposition came out on top in the  shots-on-goal department, outshooting the Kings, 29-28.  </P> <P> "Our goal was to keep it under 30," said a happy Coach Tom Webster, who had  stormed out of the clubhouse Wednesday night, after the Kings had given up more  than 40 shots on goal for the third game in a row.  </P> <P> Those who had been hoping to see Gretzky break the 2,000 mark thought for a  moment he might have broken something a lot more near and dear -- his right  hand.  </P> <P> Late in the scoreless first period, Gretzky and Hartford defenseman Brad Shaw  collided.  </P> <P> Gretzky went up in the air and came crashing to the ice, flopping like a puppet  on a string, his right hand smacking the ice.  </P> <P> Gretzky grimaced, obviously in pain. He had sliced his pinkieon his right hand.  But after a quick trip to the bench for a bandage, he was back on the ice. No  stitches were required, and Gretzky was able to continue playing.  </P> <P> "I had tried to spin off him," said Gretzky of the collision with Shaw. "My  hand hit the ice. My stick came down on it. And my knee came down on my stick.  </P> <P> "My hand was pretty numb in the second period. It didn't seem like a serious  injury and it's not, but it's a pain."  </P> <P> Gretzky's injury was about the only moment worth mentioning in a quiet first  period, but the pace picked up considerably after the intermission.  </P> <P> The Kings started the puck rolling with a goal 4:44 into the period by Steve  Duchesne, his second of the season.  </P> <P> The Kings increased their lead at 6:41 with Sandstrom's first goal of the  night.  </P> <P> Hartford got that back 55 seconds later on Scott Young's second goal of the  season on a power play.  </P> <P> The Kings moved out to a 3-1 lead at 4:45 of the third period on Todd Elik's  fourth goal.  </P> <P> But again the Whalers responded, this time answering 23 seconds later on Bob  Holik's third goal of the season. Sandstrom added his second goal and fifth of  the season at 9:25 on a power play.  </P> <P> When it was over, Gretzky seemed more relieved at avoiding a serious injury  than disappointed at falling short of 2,000.  </P> <P> "I can't go on too long," he said, "without my hands."  </P> <P> Nor could the Kings, red hot or not.  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> Despite their quick start, the Kings began play Friday averaging about 1,100  fewer fans per game than at this point last season, perhaps the result of  higher ticket prices. In seven dates, the club has had only two sellouts. Last  season, the Kings had four sellouts in their first seven dates en route to a  club-record 31 full houses.  </P> <P> King defenseman Tom Laidlaw, who hasn't played since March 17 because of back  problems, hoped to return early next month. Cortisone shots had alleviated the  pain in his back, but once Laidlaw got on the ice to practice, the pain  returned. So his comeback is on hold again. In the meantime, Laidlaw will  continue his new career, as color commentator for play-by-play announcer Nick  Nickson on King radio broadcasts. . . . Defenseman Tim Watters, cleared to play  for the first time since bruising ribs on Oct. 6, was scratched by Coach Tom  Webster.  </P></p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Belgian PM rules out social pact BELGIAN Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene yesterday ruled out a new social pact with unions, political parties and employers and said the government would go it alone with its own package of austerity measures, Reuter reports from Brussels. Mr Dehaene's decision to go ahead with his own plan could place the shaky four-party coalition government in conflict with the country's powerful trade unions. Talks on a new social pact, aimed mainly at boosting flagging competitiveness and shaving the social security budget, foundered last week after the socialist trade unions pulled out, saying the pact favoured employers. The socialist FGTB union, which had threatened to launch a strike on Friday over the social pact, said it would meet today to decide what action to take over Mr Dehaene's latest plan. The prime minister said in a statement that he had abandoned the idea of a social pact after weekend consultations with those involved in drawing up a pact had failed. 'It is impossible to continue with all the social partners. . . the prime minister and the vice-prime ministers have decided that the government itself will establish its own global plan,' the statement said. Mr Dehaene said the gravity of the international economic crisis had forced the government into the decision. 'This has affected Belgium by a dramatic increase in unemployment, a loss of competitiveness and a growing deficit in social security, necessitating immediate action.' Political analysts had thought Mr Dehaene would be unlikely to win over his socialist ministers in the coalition, which is made up of socialists and Christian Democrats from the French- and Dutch-speaking regions. Mr Dehaene is a Christian Democrat. However, a spokeswoman for Mr Dehaene said yesterday the socialist parties had agreed with the premier's decision to draw up his own plan. The main components of the social pact had been a three-year wage freeze; cuts in social security, healthcare and child benefits; higher excise duties; and new taxes on property and investment income. Mr Dehaene did not indicate whether his new plan would include all these measures. He indicated the measures should be in force by the year's end.</p>

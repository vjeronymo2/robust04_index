			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (2): Private sector development stalls - Conflicting signals in the economy Three years ago, when Egypt agreed to undertake its present drastic and comprehensive programme of economic reforms, many observers in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which designed the present adjustment plan, doubted the country could ever come as far as it has. In 1991 the country was in a parlous state. Hard currency reserves sufficed to cover only two weeks of imports. Mr Atef Sidki, the prime minister, was speaking alarmingly of Egypt having to default on some of its Dollars 40bn worth of foreign debt. Given the urgency of Egypt's economic crisis and the political goodwill of its creditor nations for the country's firmly pro-western stand during the Gulf war, the Paris Club struck a deal with the government to make a staggered write-off of no less than half of the outstanding debt, conditional on the country undertaking a complete IMF and World Bank programme. Egypt's remarkable macro-economic progress so far has already triggered two tranches of debt write-off, each of 15 per cent of the country's debt as of December 31 1990. The third and final tranche of 20 per cent, worth between Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn, is due to follow in July, if the IMF approves Egypt's progress with the reforms under the three-year Extended Fund Facility agreed last year. Some ministers are already trumpeting their confidence that the approval will be granted without much problem. But it is in fact not clear that the IMF's approval will be such plain sailing. While the Fund can be only delighted with the continued success of Egypt's macro-economic stabilisation programme, the course of structural adjustments designed to foster private sector-led growth looks increasingly troubled. In particular, the privatisation programme monitored by the World Bank - considered by the Bank and most investors to be the most important signal of the government's will to sustain and deepen its liberalising overhaul of the economy - is badly stalled. The government's apparent reluctance to move beyond a snail's pace with privatisation is, however, already sending the wrong signals. In the wake of the macro-economic reforms, among the chief reasons for the lack of investment is a continued lack of confidence among local investors in the government's real will to remove itself from its continued dominance of most of the economy. There is a widely-voiced view among bankers and businessmen that the government is essentially intent on achieving the remaining debt write- off under the Paris Club agreement - and that once this is won, neither the IMF nor the Bank will retain their present leverage to push through the further reforms necessary to create real growth. The risk for the government is that such doubts about its will to reform without this kind of pressure is already creating jitters which could eventually jeopardise the already fragile stabilisation policies. For now, however, the macro-economic achievements continue. The budget deficit, which topped 20 per cent before the IMF programme, is down to 4.7 per cent and due to fall further - to 2.6 per cent this year. Inflation is down from over 10 per cent last year to 7.4 per cent. The balance of payments remains in surplus. In large part this is thanks to an improved flow of remittances, averaging about Dollars 5bn a year, partly attracted by the real domestic interest rates, which themselves have helped keep the exchange rate largely stable at about EPounds 3.37 to the dollar. Hard currency reserves are stable at about Dollars 16bn - a year and a half's import cover. To these successes can be added improvements in banking supervision and legislation; improved capital markets laws; price de-controls; tariff cuts; introduction of a proto-value added sales tax; a new unified income tax law and an overall easing of investment regulations. There remain points of issue with the IMF and the Bank. For example, both would like to see energy prices rise closer to world levels - something the government is resisting, as politically unsustainable. Both are also irritated that while Egypt agreed to cut maximum tariff rates this year to 70 from 80 per cent (as part of a cascade of cuts towards a 40 per cent maximum), the government simultaneously added a new 'user fee' of 5 per cent. But the biggest bone of contention remains privatisation. The last visiting World Bank mission to monitor the programme, in March, left apparently deeply unimpressed with movement towards its ostensible targets. Its members suggested that they may not feel themselves able to advise the IMF as early as July that Egypt is making sufficient progress. From a list of more than 80 publicly-owned assets or companies slated for sale as far back as the end of 1992, only a handful of assets have been sold. Only one company, a bottling group, has yet been sold, although the sales of two others are apparently agreed and waiting only to be finalised. Moreover, there are signs that the government is backing away from its earlier definition of what constitutes privatisation. From having declared its intention eventually to sell off some 314 state companies - with an official book value of EPounds 70-EPounds 80bn - ministers are now saying that they are 'assessing the extent to which the private sector can buy into these companies' - which is not quite the same thing. This week the government announced plans to turn 11 state companies, including real estate, irrigation, public works and land reclamation firms, as well as two engineering consultancies, into what amount to workers' cooperatives, transferring 75 per cent of the shares to employee shareholder associations (ESAs). The World Bank welcomed the scheme, but foreign economists said it did not look like privatisation in the usual sense, because the shares would not be available to outside investors. Political fears in the National Assembly that privatisation would lead to the sale of Egypt's 'family silver' to foreigners forced Mr Atef Obeid, the minister responsible for the programme, to state that sales to foreigners would take place only in 'very limited cases'. But it is political sentiment within the cabinet which appears to be most to blame for the stalled programme. Partly it is the real fear for the political consequence of the likely unemployment which would follow more thoroughgoing sales of largely inefficient state enterprises. This is understandable in a country where unemployment is already estimated by independent economists at about 20 per cent. But partly, too, it seems to reflect the fact that the convinced liberalisers and privatisers within the cabinet do not constitute an over-riding majority. The departure, in last year's cabinet reshuffle, of Mr Fouad Sultan, the former tourism minister and then the government's most ardent champion of the private sector, has only helped fuel the belief that the government is not ideologically committed to removing itself from the economy's commanding heights. The upshot is exasperation among bankers, foreign investors and local businessmen who had been positioning themselves to take advantage of privatisation. Several US and other foreign banks which had doggedly, and expensively, been pursuing opportunities have thrown in the towel in the last few months. 'It's a complete sham,' says one. 'I was given all sorts of false promises and in the end have nothing to show for it.' Privatisation alone was never likely to create the kind of real growth the IMF and World Bank-guided reforms were designed to achieve. But while the stalled programme continues to undermine business confidence (as discussed elsewhere in this survey), such growth rates look increasingly remote. According to Mr Youssef Boutros Ghali, minister of state for international co-operation, Egypt needs to raise growth rates to 5 or 6 per cent; rates which might then help absorb the estimated 400,000-500,000 new entrants to the workforce each year. But by the best available estimates, Egypt's economy is growing modestly if at all. Some economists estimate GDP to be declining by perhaps 1 per cent. Others, however, suggest the there is evidence to indicates the economy may be growing by 2 per cent. Aside from private sector gloom, there have been other notable depressants on growth, not all of which are susceptible to economic management. One of these is low crude prices, which helped cap the increase in oil export revenues last year at just over Dollars 2.1bn. More serious is the continuing negative effects of militant attacks on tourist targets. The tourism industry, which earned Egypt (the government rather optimistically claims) a record Dollars 3.2bn in 1992 before the attacks began, suffered sharp declines in 1993. According to one official European study, tourism's overall contribution to GDP is expected to fall to 3.3 per cent of GDP in 1993 from 8.6 per cent in 1992. The economy is therefore hovering in what one foreign banker calls a 'discomfiting status quo'.</p>

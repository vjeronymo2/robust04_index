			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Rabin faces MPs' vote of confidence MR Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, yesterday turned a parliamentary debate on the historic Israeli-Palestinian peace accord into a vote of confidence in his government. Facing desertion by a ultra-orthodox religious coalition partner which is demanding a referendum on the peace accord, he sought to rally parliamentary support at the opening of a stormy two-day debate. A vote on the agreement is due tonight and is expected to give Mr Rabin a wafer-thin majority. 'After 100 years of violence and terror, after wars and suffering there is today a great prospect for a new chapter in the history of the state of Israel,' Mr Rabin told MPs in a speech constantly interrupted by heckling. 'I call on you to give us a chance to exploit this great opportunity. Let the sun rise.' Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud party, said the prime minister had thrown away the security of Israelis and called for new elections. Demonstrators opposed to the peace agreement gathered outside the Knesset (parliament). Mr Rabin can count on at least a 61-59 majority for the peace agreement but such a narrow victory might force the government to accept popular demands for a referendum. However, this was rejected by Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, who said: 'I feel more comfortable with 61 and having peace than with 59 and losing peace.' Frances Williams adds: Between Dollars 7bn and Dollars 12bn will be needed in external resources over the next 10 years to rehabilitate the economies of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, according to preliminary estimates by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Unctad's estimates of the cost of reviving the Palestinian economy, in a report yesterday to its executive board, range from Dollars 3bn to Dollars 7bn for Gaza alone, depending on how many Palestinians might return to the area, and another Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn for the West Bank. This is far more than World Bank estimates of at least Dollars 3bn over 10 years for both areas combined.</p>

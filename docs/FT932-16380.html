			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Caradon rises 18% and seeks acquisitions MB-CARADON, the building products and security printing company, yesterday announced an 18 per cent profits increase helped by lower interest costs and improved US productivity. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 106.4m to Pounds 125.7m in the year to December 31 on turnover 2 per cent lower at Pounds 664.4m. At the interim stage, profits were 28 per cent higher at Pounds 60.6m. Following last week's sale of its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox (CMB) for Pounds 473m, Caradon has net cash of Pounds 428m and is looking for acquisitions. Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, said the company would favour buying a UK or German-based building products company: 'We want to broaden our base.' The company's UK building products division, which includes Everest double glazing and Mira showers, saw operating profits fall 27 per cent to Pounds 35.2m because of squeezed margins and teething problems at the company's upgraded radiator factories. Mr Jansen said there were signs of improvement in the UK, and Everest's first quarter sales were up 30 per cent over the weak start last year. In the US, security printing lifted operating profits 23 per cent to Pounds 39m thanks to improved efficiencies. Overseas building products, which mainly covers European radiator manufacturing, reported a 26 per cent increase in operating profits mainly due to improved volumes. Sales to Germany, the company's most important market, remained buoyant but the company is cautious about this year. Interest costs fell from Pounds 20m to Pounds 5.1m after the proceeds of the Pounds 149m rights issue in November 1991 reduced borrowings. Year-end net borrowings stood at Pounds 44.9m compared with Pounds 40.6 a year ago, and Pounds 202m at the start of 1991. The contribution from the CMB stake increased 19 per cent to Pounds 37.7m. The year-end book value of the stake increased to Pounds 363.1m. The gain on disposal of the holding, equal to more than Pounds 100m, will be treated as an exceptional item this year. Fully-diluted earnings increased 5.3 per cent to 15.8p. The directors recommended a final dividend of 5.9p to make a total of 8.65p, a 2.6 per cent increase.</p>

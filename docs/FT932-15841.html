			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The only auction test of wool values this week was in New Zealand and most of the wool sold there went at prices up to 2.5% lower than at the previous sale. Only two-thirds of the offering was sold, the rest being held back by growers at reserves of their own. The Easter recess in the selling season started wilth international wool markets generally easier and with little to indicate that demand would be sufficient to absorb auction offerings. This has a depressing effect on trade and prices throughout the industry.</p>

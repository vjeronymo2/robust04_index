How can two sides be left, one of which  is Israel with all the power, capabilities, and resources it  possesses, and the other, the unarmed Palestinian people?    [Abu-Sharif] The Declaration of Principles, which was signed  in Washington, was signed at the White House in the presence of  the United States, represented by its President and secretary of  state, and other representatives of the world states,  particularly the cosponsor of the peace conference that began in  Madrid. Therefore, the U.S. and Russian responsibility here is  clear. Undoubtedly, what the U.S. President had earlier said,  to the effect that the United States is a full partner, gives  the United States a moral, political, and practical  responsibility to implement the Declaration of Principles and  the plan to achieve peace in the region. We can explain the  issue clearly as follows: If the Israeli Government really  intends to achieve peace, then I see no logical reason for the  Israeli Government to make out of the Jericho area or the  crossings an obstacle to implementing the Gaza-Jericho First  Plan. Based on this, I wish that the Israeli Government would  take this into consideration, especially since confidence  between the two sides is not entrenched, and because the plan to  implement the Declaration of Principles is in itself a plan to  bridge the gap of mistrust. I hope that the Israeli Government  will not turn these points into obstacles because this is  demoralizing and makes the Palestinians and Israelis lose hope  in the possibility of achieving peace. However, if you want my  personal opinion about what will happen afterwards, I say that  the peace process will continue and all the current obstacles  can be surmounted through calm negotiations free of tension and  mistrust.</p>

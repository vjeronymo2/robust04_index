That is why I would like to clarify for our public the  conclusion reached at the meeting. We concluded that a  cease-fire should go into effect on the Sarajevo front tomorrow  [10 February] at 1200 [1100 GMT]. At 1200, UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR] patrols should proceed to the following locations:  Zuc, Golo Brdo, Borije, Vidikovac, Grbavica, that is, the  Brotherhood and Unity Bridge, and Dobrinja to establish whether  the cease-fire is being observed, so that we can proceed to the  next phase, which is collecting heavy Serbian weaponry.    We will collect all the heavy weaponry -- that is, all of  the  Serbian weaponry over a 12.7-mm caliber. According to our  estimate, this phase would, according to today's agreement, last  some five days, after which the weapons would be immobilized;  therefore, demobilized, rendered useless, ammunition and  artillery pieces would be sorted out into separate groups and  would be placed in a row of barracks where it could be  efficiently controlled by UNPROFOR, or rather where efficient  control would be possible. The enemy has accepted these  conditions and, therefore, they came; I think that their  delegation was headed by their chief of staff, General  Milovanovic. [sentence as heard] Prior to beginning the talks,  they announced that they had been fully authorized for this  meeting pertaining to the withdrawal of heavy weaponry. If this  agreement is not implemented, we will consider today's agreement  invalid.    [Babic] Generals Jovan Divjak and Mustafa Hajrulahovic  contributed additional clarifications.    [Divjak] We exclusively discussed the cease-fire and decided  that UNPROFOR should set up control posts in order to establish  if the cease-fire is being violated. What is important is the  fact that the Serb army must withdraw its artillery in the next  five days and place it in those areas where UNPROFOR forces will  be able to control it. General Rose implied that during the  next phase -- since this agreement will be carried out in phases  -- we will discuss other provisions of Resolution 824. However,  this is conditioned by the withdrawal of the artillery and its  being placed under control as requested by our delegation.    [Hajrulahovic] I believe that we should stress that we know  in detail the number of chetnik weapons and artillery pieces  around Sarajevo; we know all the coordinates of these weapons --  artillery pieces, that is -- so, in order to avoid a regrouping  of the forces, we proposed submitting a complete map with all  the [word indistinct] weapons and artillery pieces. This would  serve to prevent the aggressor's side from regrouping the  weapons on some other part of the front in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Babic] One of the questions for President Izetbegovic  pertained to what the Bosnian side intended to undertake if the  Serbs should violate the cease-fire.    [Izetbegovic] We believe that as of 1200 tomorrow, and in  the course of the next five days, the withdrawal of heavy  weapons and the establishment of the locations to which it  should be withdrawn should begin. Therefore, we shall consider  that the agreement has been violated if the Serb side refuses to  withdraw the heavy weaponry, if in the meantime an attack, a  bombardment of the city should occur, and if the snipers do not  refrain from their activities. We will then consider the  agreement invalid.    [Babic] In response to what would happen to the Bosnian  weapons, Izetbegovic said:    [Izetbegovic] All this is being done in accordance with  Resolutions 824 and 836, according to which we are not under any  obligation to put any type of weaponry under [UNPROFOR] control.  This does not mean that we are not ready to place our heavy  weaponry under control. However, we are under no obligation to  do so, but this does not exclude our readiness to do so. We  will probably do so, providing the Serbs place their weapons  under control. However, this is the first task that needs to be  accomplished.</p>

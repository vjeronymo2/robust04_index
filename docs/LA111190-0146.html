			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GORDON WINS GTO DIVISION  </P> <P> Robby Gordon knows all about a long day's journey into night -- and day. He  also knows all about Victory Lane.  </P> <P> The 21-year-old driver from Orange had a day to dream about after completing  about 500 miles of the Baja 1,000 at 5:30 a.m. Saturday, then winning the  Chevron International Motor Sports Assn. GTO/GTU Challenge in the afternoon at  the Del Mar Fairgrounds.  </P> <P> Gordon's Whistler Radar Mercury Cougar RX7 passed Pete Halsmer's Mazda RX-7 at  the beginning of the final lap, then Gordon twice held off Halsmer on the  10-turn, 1.62-mile course to win his second consecutive GTO race and fifth of  the year.  </P> <P> "I think (Halsmer) had a better car at the end, but our car was wider," Gordon  said, jokingly after edging Halsmer by .338 seconds. Gordon, who won $10,000,  covered the 73.6 miles of racing in 1 hour 49.6 seconds.  </P> <P> Gordon's weekend began Friday at 6 a.m. in Ensenada, Mexico. He raced a Ford  off-road truck to fourth place through the Mexican desert, overcoming five  wrecks and six flat tires, to clinch the 1990 HDRA/SCORE Class 8 title. At 5:30  a.m. Saturday, he left Ensenada and reached the U.S.-Mexican border at 7:30  a.m., where he waited in line until 8:30 a.m. to pass. He finally arrived at  Del Mar at 9:30 a.m. and was able to drive his Cougar for the final 15 minutes  of warm-ups. Max Jones had qualified the car third on Friday.  </P> <P> Jeremy Dale was third in a Nissan 300ZX for the sixth consecutive race.  </P> <P> Don Knowles, in an Infinity Dodge Daytona, was sixth overall but winner of the  GTU race. John Finger, in a Mazda MX-6, was second. Mark Porcaro won the  All-American Challenge in a Chevrolet Beretta, which finished 11th in the  32-car field.  </P></p>

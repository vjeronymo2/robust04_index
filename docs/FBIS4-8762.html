			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [from the "Picture versus Picture" program] </F>   [Excerpts] Radovan Karadzic appeared on the news bulletin  of Pale Television late this evening. He already had an answer  for the continued fighting in Gorazde this evening. He also  said something interesting about future cooperation between the  UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] and the so-called Srpska  republic.    [Begin recording] [Karadzic] Unfortunately, we have not  managed to establish a cease-fire. Every time we stop firing,  the Muslim side thinks that is due to our weakness, and launches  a heavy attack which, of course, takes a toll in life. That is  very bad tactics.    For example, we withdrew our artillery and tanks toward  Ustipraca and Kopaci, 3 km away from the bridge leading to the  hospital in Gorazde. However, when we withdrew, the Muslims  again attacked us on that part of our line, trying to take  advantage of our withdrawal. Consequently, our tanks returned.  They are being pulled out now, under the condition that the  Muslim side does not launch any more attacks. Akashi's warning  applies to them too. [passage omitted]    UNPROFOR cannot deploy forces on the territory of the Srpska  republic, except where the leadership allows them to, along the  frontlines, as in Sarajevo. This is a decision passed by our  people's assembly, and only the assembly can change it.    [Pale TV announcer] And what if someone comes upon UNPROFOR  representatives, for example, somewhere on [Mount] Romanija,  which has nothing to do with the frontline?    [Karadzic] They should not be there because, if they cross  through the Srpska republic -- we gave them permission to move  freely through our territory, which is now suspended, but we  will review that decision -- they have to stick to the route  granted to them. If they leave the agreed route, we will provide  UNPROFOR with a military escort, and they will not be allowed to  go off the agreed route. We have now decided that UNCHR and Red  Cross convoys are not to be escorted by UNPROFOR, but by our  army. The UNHCR and the Red Cross have accepted that. Foreign  military forces will therefore have their movement scaled down  in our territory. If we allow a convoy to pass through, it will  have to stick to the route. [end recording]</p>

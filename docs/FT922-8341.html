			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips on trade comments THE DOLLAR suffered signif-icant losses against the Japanese yen and other currencies in the foreign exchange markets yesterday after Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, expressed concern about Japan's rising trade surplus, writes James Blitz. The move, described as the biggest change in yen/dollar trading for three months, came after Mr Mulford had said the US was 'very, very concerned' that Japan's trade surplus with the United States would grow soon as the US economy recovers. He told a Senate Banking subcommittee that the US was pressing Japan to take action in the form of a supplementary budget. There was furious yen buying immediately after the statement, as traders anticipated that the Group of Seven leading industrial countries would be prepared to intervene in the currencies markets to keep the yen high. The dollar quickly fell through what was seen as the important support level of Y131.70 to finish at Y130.45 in London. In New York it closed steadier at Y130.65. A forex analyst said yesterday: 'People have been bullish about the dollar, but Mulford's comments about the trade surplus have made people think again.' Another felt that the market was over-reacting, bearing in mind that there has been little real intervention to keep the yen high since the idea was first mooted at the G7's Garden City summit in January. Either way, traders in Europe and North America were expecting the yen to strengthen substantially after Tokyo's opening, perhaps reaching Y128.00 to the dollar. Mr Mulford's comments, combined with speculation about an imminent cut in US interest rates, weakened the dollar against other currencies. It closed at DM1.6215, down nearly two pfennigs on the day. It also lost ground to sterling, which closed at Dollars 1.8125, up nearly two cents from its previous close. The dollar finished at DM1.6241 in New York and the pound at Dollars 1.8118. In contrast to the dollar, the D-Mark was well supported by comments yesterday from a senior official. The president of the State Central Bank of Bavaria was reported as saying that interest rates would not be reduced before the end of the year. Analysts said this was the first time a Bundesbank official had produced a definite comment on the outlook for rates. The statement helped the D-Mark against sterling, which ended at DM2.9400 in London, down  1/4 pfennig. But the German unit lost further ground to the French franc, which has surged following the appointment of Mr Pierre Beregovoy as prime minister, and the easing of credit conditions last week. It was at FFr3.3565 to the D-Mark by the close of European trading, from a previous FFr3.3626.</p>

Laser implantation employs a laser  to diffuse substances on the surface of a material into its  interior. Calcium is one component of bone, and because it is  highly compatible with the human body, this achievement brings  us one step closer to the development of a material that can be  used as artificial bone.    Human bone is mainly composed of a substance called  hydroxyapatite, which contains calcium and phosphorous. By using  laser implantation to diffuse calcium, one of the major  components of bone, throughout the substrate, the group has  created a material that will not be rejected by the body. It is  expected that laser implantation will be a simpler method of  modifying materials than ion implantation. In laser  implantation, a substance is deposited onto the surface of a  substrate by vapor deposition. It is then irradiated by a laser  from above, which causes it to diffuse into the substrate.    Professor Kubo's group applied this technique with calcium.  They placed a vessel containing a substrate of alumina, an oxide  ceramic, in a vacuum and deposited calcium onto its surface by  vapor deposition. Then they irradiated the surface from above  with a high-energy excimer laser, which caused the calcium and  alumina to melt and flow together. When they analyzed the  substrate, they found that the calcium and alumina had formed a  mixed layer within the substrate, thus confirming successful  surface modification.    At this point no experiments have been performed to  determine  the effects on the body of ceramics formed by this method.  However, both calcium and alumina have highly biocompatible  properties, so it is expected that there will be no problem in  using this ceramic material as artificial bone to replace  damaged areas, as teeth, etc.    Professor Kubo's group believes that surface modification  using hydroxyapatite is also possible, which would form a  material even more compatible with the body. However, it will be  difficult to get phosphorous to diffuse using the present  technique, so in the future this group will search for a  phosphate compound that can be used in this procedure and try to  form hydroxyapatite.</p>

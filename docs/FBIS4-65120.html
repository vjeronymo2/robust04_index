			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Cesare Previti by Barbara </F> Palombelli in Rome on 10 May: "Previti: I Became Minister in  100 Days"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Palombelli] So you  lost: You wanted the Justice Ministry and they gave you Defense.    [Previti] No. It is a change for the better. This is a  wonderful moment for me: It is enough to consider that I  entered politics on 3 February, and now, 10 May, I am a  minister. It is incredible.    [Palombelli] Do you have a program yet?    [Previti] I will be one of the few defense ministers to have  done my military service. I was an Air Force officer in  Florence; that was a wonderful experience.    [Palombelli] It is not much.    [Previti] Actually, apart from my half serious reference to  my military service, I do have real experience of defense  matters, acquired during my nine years as deputy chairman first  of Selenia, then of the new Alenia, the state electronics and  aeronautics concern. Not everybody knows that our military  industry is in the vanguard. Right now I can make a pledge to  increase the annual budget and investment in the Armed Forces,  which I consider our country's boast, a great human and  professional asset. Furthermore, it will be necessary to examine  the role of women .    [Palombelli] End of commercial. Who decided to shift you --  [President] Scalfaro or [Prime Minister-designate] Berlusconi?    [Previti] Neither. Scalfaro did not raise any objections in  my regard; he did not even mention me in the letter in which he  set out his anxieties. And Berlusconi insisted that I be made  justice minister. It was I who decided to stand aside, in view  of the hail of opposition. I did not want to constitute a  problem. I did not want Silvio [Berlusconi] to have to fight a  battle over me. I must say that [Northern League Secretary]  Bossi and [National Alliance leader] Fini too encouraged me to  stand firm. I am sure that [Justice Minister] Alfredo Biondi  will do very well; in particular, he has much more political  experience than me.    [Palombelli] This is a victory for the Democratic Party of  the Left, which said: Berlusconi's lawyer cannot become justice  minister.    [Previti] Those people are professional detractors. I have  left my job, relinquished all my posts within Fininvest, have  been elected to the Senate by the people; as of this morning my  legal practice has passed to my son, Stefano, and I will resign  immediately from the lawyers' association. Of course, I am come  from a modest background, and from a profession that has given  me both satisfaction and money: Forza Italia won the elections  precisely on this basis, because it set its sights on the entry  of professionals into positions of power. But perhaps they  preferred the previous relationship that existed between the  caucus leaders and the colonels, a relationship that was often  murky.    [Palombelli] Luigi Berlinguer, the progressive forces'  leader  in the lower house, pointed out that you are "a company lawyer  and a senior manager of Fininvest, a firm into which the  judiciary have initiated criminal inquiries."    [Previti] I can confidently reply with an example that will  please the progressive forces: U.S. President John Fitzgerald  Kennedy appointed his brother, Bobby, attorney general. I  became a friend of John and Bobby in September 1963 when I  organized an international conference on forensic medicine in  New York and Washington. A thousand academics, Italians and  Americans, took part; it was a great success.    [Palombelli] A friend of the Kennedys but a member of the  MSI  [Italian Social Movement].    [Previti] The time has come to clarify this matter. True, I  was an MSI member as a boy. Like many others at Rome's Mamiani  High School, we felt the shame of having lost the war and were  motivated by our love of our country, the desire to regain  Trieste. At university I was elected to the "Caravella" list,  which comprised the Social Movement, monarchists, Liberals, the  Everyman Movement. Then, at the age of 20, I graduated and  abandoned all that. In the sixties I was a member of Malagodi's  PLI [Italian Liberal Party] and joined the leadership; I was  convinced that if we opted for a right-wing line we would win  back all our votes from the MSI. My faction was defeated and I  left. Now, 30 years later, here we have Forza Italia.    [Palombelli] You often appear in photographs with a giant  flame [MSI symbol] behind you. Are you happy about that?    [Previti] That business of the photographs with the tricolor  flame is a petty one. There is no mystery. I was a joint  candidate for Forza Italia and the MSI, so I was very glad to  take part in the final rally with Gianfranco Fini. He is a  politician whom I highly esteem, but recently I have discovered  that Bossi too is much better than he appears at first glance.    [Palombelli] What about the international alarm about a  Berlusconi government full of MSI ministers?    [Previti] The National Alliance is something different from  the old MSI, which in turn was something different from Fascism.  Be that as it may, I think it is right that the government team  that has been chosen is as remote as possible from that distant  past. And yet people abroad accepted the Communists.    [Palombelli] In fact the old PCI [Italian Communist Party]  has split in two. Within the National Alliance we seem to see  the coexistence of both tendencies -- the regressive and the  moderate.    [Previti] Perhaps some day there will be a separation on the  Right, too.    [Palombelli] In view of your past, if you had become justice  minister, would you have demanded the extradition [from  Argentina] of the executioner of the Fosse Ardeatine [Erich  Priebke]?    [Previti] Of course. Except that, unlike some former  ministers, I would also have succeeded in securing it quickly.</p>

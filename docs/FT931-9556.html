			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Inflation rate falls to 1.7%: Lamont rules out interest rate cut; Union anger at public pay limit MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, yesterday ruled out a further cut in interest rates to spur Britain's economic growth, despite a fall in the annual inflation rate to 1.7 per cent - its lowest level for 25 years. His efforts to bolster sterling came as the government reinforced its determination to continue the fight against inflation and crack down on public spending. Speaking in the Commons, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said pay rises for hundreds of thousands of public sector workers would be limited to 1.5 per cent. The announcement provoked outrage from public sector union leaders, who described it as a wage cut. Health union negotiators refused to accept the award for Britain's 600,000 nurses, midwives and health visitors. In a further attempt to boost sterling, Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England who takes over as governor in July, warned that interest rates would be raised if the pound were to weaken 'substantially' from its current level. Speaking to journalists in Frankfurt yesterday, Mr George also said the pound would be helped if the government and parliament were to declare that the Bank should be made independent of government. Despite the efforts of Mr Lamont and Mr George to lift sterling, many in the City believe the need to spur UK growth will push the government into cutting interest rates from 6 per cent around Budget day on March 16. The pound closed last night up half a pfennig on the day against the D-Mark at DM2.3575. Before the European markets opened, it had dipped to a new all-time trading low of DM2.3245. Against the dollar, sterling closed little changed at Dollars 1.418. In New York, sterling closed at DM2.357 and Dollars 1.4205. Buoyed by inflation news, the gilt market had one of its best days in recent months, with long-dated securities gaining nearly 2 points. The 0.9 per cent fall in the retail prices index, from 2.6 per cent in December to 1.7 per cent in January, was the biggest monthly drop for nearly 35 years. The year-on-year rise in the RPI last month was the lowest since September 1967. Britain now has the lowest headline inflation rate in the European Community apart from Denmark. In a statement, Mr Lamont said: 'The task now is to consolidate this progress and maintain downward pressure on underlying inflation. Interest rates will be set to achieve that objective. On the basis of all the available evidence I do not believe that there is any scope for a further reduction in interest rates.' The inflation figures did not impress Mr Gordon Brown, the Labour shadow chancellor. He said they reflected the fact that people were 'not buying anything or producing anything', with the economy still stuck in recession. News of the reduction in inflationary pressures, which the government hopes will ultimately provide a platform for steady economic expansion, came even allowing for the 15 per cent depreciation in sterling since it dropped out of the European exchange rate mechanism last September. The Central Statistical Office said there was as yet no sign that rising import prices resulting from the devaluation had fed through to increased prices at the retail level. Further good news for Mr Lamont was that the RPI excluding mortgage payments  -the Treasury's favoured measure for underlying inflation - dropped by 0.5 per cent in the month to January, the biggest fall since the CSO started records in 1975.

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Arts: La Ronde - Ballet The new Royal Ballet triple bill is an ungainly affair, over-long at three hours and twenty minutes, and unbalanced in its components. The return of Checkmate is important, and welcome as a tribute to mark the 95th birthday of Dame Ninette de Valois. It reminds us that not only do we owe her everything as founder of our national ballet, but that her choreographies - the company should have brought back Rake's Progress, too, for this celebration - are enduringly sure in the theatre. The restoration of Prodigal Son to the repertory is valuable in that it offers Irek Mukhamedov a role which he dances with marvellous intensity. The revival was rather less happy, though, as an account of Balanchine's text: it lacked that Art Deco clarity of outline which must make the piece seem rite quite as much as drama. Reasons to justify the arrival of Glen Tetley's La Ronde at Covent Garden are hard to find. The piece was made for the National Ballet of Canada six years ago. It is set to Erich Korngold's Sinfonietta, a boyhood piece - he was fifteen when he wrote it - which at best sounds like fake Richard Strauss, and at worst (and most often so) like Korngold. To its over-blown and blatant measures (a boy who could write stuff like this was fore-doomed to Hollywood), we see the sequence of linked erotic encounters - A makes love to B who makes love to C - which bring us, after ten industriously mimed intimacies, back to the first member of the daisy-chain. Only ten dancers, but as many orgasms: it is a ballet of under-population but over-copulation. La Ronde lasts - was that all? - fifty minutes. Fifty very similar minutes, since unless the participants were to hang from the chandelier, there is little possible choreographic variety. Tetley's dances are sinuous but superficial, and the characters are cyphers. There is a great deal of scenery by John Macfarlane which whistles in and out and looks costly as a substitute for choreographic vitality, and Alt Wien costuming which soon lands on the ground as the wearers enjoy their few minutes of fun. Even after the last couple has, as it were, been screwed down, there is a tedious reprise of relationships as the remaining glutinous pages of the score have to be used up. The cast work hard. Fiona Chadwick, playing an actress, suggests that there might be feelings under the cardboard of her character; and I thought an Italian newcomer, Maria Galeazzi, moved with a beautifully open style as a young wife. La Ronde is a bore, and an odd repertory choice when one considers the treasures by Fokine, Massine, Ashton, MacMillan, which lie unregarded in the company's store. Yet if these are to be restored to the stage, as they should be, they must be respected. I do not feel that this is true of Prodigal Son which, apart from Mukhamedov's bold incarnation of the young man, was unfocussed. The Rouault designs were miserbly lit - no luminosity to their colours - and the general scenes had a too-improvisatory air. Mukhamedov dug deep into the choreography and brought out the role vivid and true. The first scene, where the youth sets out on his journey, blazed with physical and emotional energy. The orgy was dominated by Mukhamedov's ability to show innocence destroyed: he needs, though, an icier Siren that Genesia Rosato proposed.( Balanchine said she should be 'cool, strict, calculating'). The Prodigal's return home would benefit from slight under-playing, but was nonetheless heart-rending. The restoration of Checkmate found its colours strong - the McKnight Kauffer set is still magnificent - and its score, under Barry Wordsworth, more dramatically taut than it has sounded since the golden days of Constant Lambert. This is a good revival. Adam Cooper is a welcome new Red Knight, the role securely on the music; Darcey Bussell's Black Queen is not as menacing as the role demands; David Bintley is a fine Red King. We owe Dame Ninette our gratitude for this ballet - and for everything else. The triple bill is repeated on June 9 and 10.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> EL DORADO TRIES TO TURN IT AROUND  </P> <P> A year of expectation has turned into frustration for El Dorado High School, a  team that limps into the Southern Section 5-A division baseball playoffs as the  No. 2 entry from the Empire League after being ranked No. 1 in Orange County in  the preseason polls.  </P> <P> Last year, the Golden Hawks were seeded first in the division and were named  the county's mythical champion after finishing the regular season with a 22-3  record. This year, El Dorado is 18-8 despite returning the county's best  pitching staff and several other key players.  </P> <P> Despite the disappointing season, Coach Steve Gullotti is looking forward to  the playoffs, where the Golden Hawks play host to Nogales (19-6) Friday in the  first round.  </P> <P> Lakewood (22-3) is seeded first in the division with Riverside Poly (23-3)  second, Simi Valley (21-3) third and Mater Dei (20-5) fourth. For the third  consecutive year, an Empire League team will play in the wild-card game with  Los Alamitos (13-13) traveling to Bishop Montgomery (13-7) today.  </P> <P> In the 4-A, Anaheim (17-9) is riding a 13-game winning streak and gained its  first league championship since 1981, but the Colonists drew one of the  toughest No. 2 entries in the division by playing host to Capistrano Valley  (16-9).  </P> <P> Three county schools -- El Modena (11-11), Irvine (13-12) and La Habra (13-8)  -- drew wild-card games today with Irvine playing host to La Habra. Buena  (18-2-2) is top-seeded and plays host to Valencia (11-10) Friday.  </P> <P> In an interesting move by the pairings committee, Upland (21-5) was seeded  fourth but is the No. 2 entry from the Baseline League. Upland lost a coin  flip, so the school travels to Western (15-10) Friday.  </P> <P> In the 3-A, Laguna Hills (22-4) is the fourth-seeded team and will play host to  Saddleback (13-12) Friday. Laguna Hills has won 19 of its past 20 games and  finished the regular season as the top-ranked team in the county.  </P></p>

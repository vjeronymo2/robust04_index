			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Carmakers focus on Barclay twins - AFGH deal unites three secretive entrepreneurs The sale of Automotive Financial Group Holdings, one of the biggest motor retailer groups in Britain, has brought together three of the most secretive entrepreneurs operating in the UK. The buyers, the Barclay brothers, the reclusive identical twins David and Frederick, take secrecy to extremes. Shying away from all publicity, they operate their business empire from Monaco. A year ago they added a new hideaway, the Channel Island of Brecqhou situated between Guernsey and Sark, which they are busy converting into their own island fortress. The seller is Mr Octav Botnar, the 81-year-old entrepreneur, who has made a villa in the mountains near Geneva the base for his dwindling business operations, ever since a warrant was issued for his arrest by the Inland Revenue in January, 1992. The Barclay twins' strategy for AFGH, their first foray into the UK retail motor industry, is still to be revealed. Their progress will be watched carefully, however, by some of the world's leading carmakers - most notably Fiat, Renault, Peugeot and Citroen - which are suddenly discovering this week, that several of the dealerships operating their franchise in the UK are under new and mysterious owership. The UK's motor retail sector is already undergoing a far-reaching restructuring with a spate of takeovers in the last two years, as the leading groups led by Lex Service and Inchcape have swallowed up smaller operators. Few of the shockwaves reverberating through the sector have been bigger, however, than those created by the businesses controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, namely Automotive Financial Group Holdings, now owned by the Barclay brothers, and its sister company, Nissan UK Holdings. Only four years ago the Automotive and Financial Group dealer network totalled about 180 outlets, selling exclusively new Nissan vehicles. Today, it has no Nissan dealerships - Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker, has established its own UK dealer network starting from scratch in 1992 - while AFG has been transformed into a multifranchise group with about 70 outlets. In these four years, Mr Botnar's business empire has been rocked first by the upheaval of a tumultuous legal battle with Nissan, Japan's second largest carmaker, which stripped Nissan UK of its franchise with effect from the end of 1991, and secondly by the corporation tax fraud investigation by the Inland Revenue. With the sale of AFGH Mr Botnar appears to have decided to throw in the towel and to cease trying to exercise remote control of one of the UK's biggest dealer groups by telephone from Switzerland. He faces a battle with the Inland Revenue, however, over the other company he controls, Nissan UK Holdings, about a Pounds 238m tax claim at its wholly-owned subsidiary Nissan UK. NUKH's latest annual report says the company will 'contest the assessments in the strongest possible manner as being without foundation'. Mr Botnar has controlled as chairman and managing director both NUKH and AFGH, but their ultimate ownership has remained unclear. Immediate majority ownership of NUKH is held by European Motor Vehicles Corporation, registered in Panama, which has a 71.5 per cent stake, while a stake of the same size in AFGH has been held by GF International Investments and Finance, registered in the Bahamas. Both companies are controlled by the same group of trustees of a settlement made by Mr Botnar with his shares in 1974. The identity of the trustees has never been revealed, although a condition of Mr Botnar's transfer of his shares to the trust, according to NUK, was that he should remain chairman and chief executive 'for life with full powers'.</p>

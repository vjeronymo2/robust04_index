Vladimir Kumachev, of Russia's Institute of National  Security  and Strategic Research, told AFP that "according to information  we have received, North Korea has nuclear warheads."    Pyongyang also had launch vehicles "which had been perfected  by the North Koreans themselves to give a longer range" to their  missiles, added Kumachev, who is an adviser to the director of  the institute, which was set up in 1991 with the backing of the  defence and foreign ministries.    "We know they have carried out tests in certain African  countries under totalitarian regimes," he said.    Kumachev said the then Soviet Union learned as early as 1985  that North Korea was starting to develop nuclear weapons,  prompting Moscow to recall most of its specialists stationed in  the country.    Kumachev added: "We established that the Koreans were  enriching their uranium more than was necessary for non-military  purposes, and we learned that secret underground bases had been  set up in the mountains."    At the end of the 1970's the Soviet Union sent about 10  conventional missiles to North Korea "to protect its frontiers  with South Korea," while further missile deliveries were made  via third countries, including Iraq, he said.    "We still retain around 15 experts in North Korea to keep us  up to date with and to monitor its nuclear programme," Kumachev  said, adding that all now worked exclusively in the civil  nuclear industry sector.    "Our specialists obviously do not have access to all the  essential information, but they file regular reports on their  activities to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)."    Kumachev's comments followed a report earlier Monday by  Japan's JIJI PRESS that Pyongyang has developed a nuclear bomb  with the help of Russian nuclear experts.    Russian researchers told JIJI that the former Soviet Union  was engaged in a joint plan with North Korea to build a nuclear  bomb until 1985, and that Russian scientists continued to  provide clandestine assistance to Pyongyang.    If confirmed, the reports would provide the first proof that  North Korea has nuclear weapons. [passage omitted]</p>

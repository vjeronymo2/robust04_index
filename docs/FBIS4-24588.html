			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 29 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and a team of the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have failed to reach a  final agreement on the replacement of fuel rods at a nuclear  power station in the DPRK.    A DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said Saturday [28 May]  that  the DPRK will go ahead on its own with the replacement of the  fuel rods at its 5-megawatt experimental atomic power station.    He said the DPRK Government will continue to work for the  transparency of nuclear development and for the settlement of  the nuclear issue through DPRK-U.S. dialogue.    The DPRK and IAEA teams held working consultations between  May 25 and 27 over technical matters concerning the replacement  of the spent fuel rods at the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor.    During the consultations, the DPRK side suggested that the  DPRK keep the spent fuel rods under the supervision of the IAEA.  In case it undergoes routine and ad hoc inspections with a  package solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the  U.S. in the future, DPRK would let the IAEA check the spent fuel  rods.    The DPRK and IAEA delegations also discussed the method of  preserving the technical possibilities of measuring the spent  fuel rods by the IAEA, the spokesman said.    He said the IAEA demanded that the DPRK submit a written  report on the matter and the IAEA will study the theoretical  feasibility and security of the method proposed by the DPRK side.    At the negotiation, the agency raised the method of selected  and separated preservation of fuel rods, the spokesman said.    But the DPRK believed it is not acceptable in principle  because it is essentially an inspection falling under the  category of ad hoc inspection and going beyond the unique status  of the DPRK following its temporary suspension of withdrawal  from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, he stressed.    Although no final agreement has been reached, he said, the  DPRK promised to respond any time to negotiation that might be  proposed by the IAEA side in future.</p>

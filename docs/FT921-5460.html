			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Admiral edges ahead to Pounds 3.5m ADMIRAL, the Surrey-based computing company specialising in the government sector and financial services, maintained its reputation for careful management and cost containment last year. Profits before tax rose 6 per cent to Pounds 3.47m (Pounds 3.28m) on sales 23 per cent higher at Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 21.2m). The failure of growth in pre-tax profits to match sales was attributed by Mr Clay Brendish, chairman, to fierce competition and the decision to continue to recruit staff in anticipation of an upturn in the market. Earnings per share were up 13 per cent at 21.9p (19.4p) and the recommended final dividend is 3.3p making a total for the year of 4.8p, up 14 per cent. Staff numbers grew 20 per cent to 509 during the year and Mr Brendish said the new people were now beginning to make a contribution to group profitability. Defence slipped from 47 per cent of the group's activities to 37 per cent, but the decline has been more than made up by an increase from 23 per cent to 31 per cent in financial services work. COMMENT Admiral, named after the red butterfly, seems to flutter over many of the problems of computing services and is one of the few rising stars in a troubled sector. It combines a close watch on costs with a cautious recruitment policy and seems to command the loyalty of its customers who return with repeat business. Its forward order book, worth Pounds 16m last year, has now stretched to Pounds 20m. Mr Brendish says he detects signs of an upturn and is beginning to ramp up recruitment to take advantage of new opportunities. Analysts are taking a cautious view, partly because of the known difficulties in the sector and also the uncertainties caused by the election. But for next year a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.8m, giving a modest prospective p/e of about 14, looks perfectly achievable; profits could touch Pounds 4m if the economic situation lightens.</p>

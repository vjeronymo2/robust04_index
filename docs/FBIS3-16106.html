Kozyrev: NATO Membership Card Is Not a Credit Card"]    [Text] It is essential not so much to enhance the military  and political partnership of European countries, but rather to  improve the mechanisms that have already been tested lest Europe  be split by "a new Yalta." The thesis about setting NATO  against the CSCE will, at Russia's prodding, apparently top the  agenda of the December European summit. These ideas were also  heard yesterday in Andrey Kozyrev's address before the Foreign  Policy Council. The meeting discussed the NATO "Partnership for  Peace" program (Pavel Grachev also spoke about it in Germany).  After the minister's address the journalists were asked to  leave, but your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, Sergey  Tsekhmistrenko, managed to learn interesting details about the  meeting in the lobby.    Kozyrev's speech has left the impression that Moscow is  concerned by how the "Partnership" initiative is being put into  practice. It is not a coincidence that the minister focused on  the subject of counterbalances to NATO, pointing out that it is  the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the CSCE that should  become the core of Europe's future security system. To  substantiate his stance, Kozyrev cited the following argument:  "It is not NATO, but the CSCE that won the Cold War." But for  the time being, in his words, "millions of misgivings" by the  East Europeans and NATO members prevent a joint strategy from  being devised. Moscow's former allies are flocking to NATO's  doorstep, driven "by primitive calculations as they mix up a  NATO membership card with a Western bank credit card." Making  the reservation that he meant only "certain circles," Kozyrev  still cautioned East European leaders, too, against mistakes for  which they will have to pay "at the highest political rates."  The Atlantists were also given a raw deal for their  "NATO-centrism," being established "in a pretty simple and trite  fashion" -- by expanding the bloc in numeric terms.    Most addresses by council members that followed had a fairly  radical idea for a leitmotif: the "Partnership" is not as  advantageous for Russia as might be seen from the Kremlin or  Smolenskaya Square [Foreign Ministry]. The speakers said that  Russia should not expect equality in its cooperation with the  West. Moreover, many people saw the concept as a desire to  isolate Russia. This point of view was summed up by Konstantin  Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma committee for CIS affairs.  He said that Russia's participation in the "Partnership" would  dash its hopes in the near abroad, because even at present CIS  countries are trying to blackmail Russia by appealing to the  West. Given that, the parliamentarian has gotten the impression  that "even Kazakhstani shores" were washed by the Atlantic  Ocean. Vitaliy Churkin (who disagreed with Zatulin's view in  general) conceded that the "little brothers," once they have  grown up a bit, sometimes become, indeed, Moscow's main  opponents in international organizations. The very question of  "isolation" as raised by Mr. Zatulin, however, was somewhat  strange, all the more so because the latter did not specify how  Moscow could avoid it outside the "Partnership" once all former  USSR republics join it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- Japan's motor vehicle  exports in fiscal 1993 ended March 31 decreased 18.3 percent  from the previous year to 4.62 million vehicles, marking the  second consecutive yearly fall, an industry group said Wednesday  [27 April].    The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said the  yearly fall is the biggest since it began compiling statistics  of the kind in fiscal 1972, and the total was the smallest since  fiscal 1978.    Exports of passenger cars totaled 3.57 million vehicles,  down  19.2 percent from the year before and the lowest level since  fiscal 1979. Exports were particularly slow in subcompact cars  with engine displacement of 661-2000 cc, down 24.4 percent, the  association said.    Trucks fell 14.9 percent to 988,480, for the eighth straight  year of decline.    The value of exports amounted to 57.2 billion U.S. dollars  in  completed vehicles and 22.89 billion dollars in parts, totaling  80.09 billion dollars, down 2.4 percent from fiscal 1992. The  fall in the total amount was the first in four years.    The ratio of the exports to Japan's total vehicle output for  the year declined to 42.6 percent from 45.9 percent the year  before.    Exports to the United States -- the biggest market for  Japanese automobiles -- declined 10.7 percent from the year  before to 1.55 million vehicles. It was the seventh consecutive  yearly fall, the association said.    Exports to Europe dropped for the third straight year -- by  31.2 percent to 1.10 million vehicles.    Shipments to Asian countries fell by 1.0 percent for the  first decline in two years to about 686,000 vehicles.    Meanwhile, exports in March alone registered a sharp 24.5  percent fall from a year earlier to 424,901 vehicles, the  association said.    The value of exports in March totaled 7.85 billion dollars,  down 7.3 percent from a year earlier.</p>

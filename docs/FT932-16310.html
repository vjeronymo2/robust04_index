			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Disposals help Fermenta reduce losses to SKr115m FERMENTA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, reaped the benefits of a large-scale disposal programme when it announced sharply-reduced losses for 1992 yest-erday. The group also said it was selling its remaining property activities for SKr396m (Dollars 51.4m), which leaves it with just two main divisions, Fermenta Animal Health and Fermenta Pharmaceuticals. The company's loss after financial items fell to SKr115m in 1992, from SKr1.2bn a year earlier, when its deficit was aggravated by losses from its troubled financial subsidiary, Independent. Independent was sold in March 1992, which explains why turnover also fell heavily last year, to SKr469m from SKr1.76bn. The group said there would be no dividend. A total of SKr105m of last year's losses related to Afisa, the group's Spanish property operation, which is being sold. The purchaser is a bankruptcy unit linked to Independent. Fermenta's loss after extraordinary items amounted to SKr418m, against a SKr1.2bn deficit in 1991, after including SKr423m in one-off costs linked to real estate write-downs and reserves. The group's financial position strengthened last year, with interest bearing debt falling to SKr734m from SKr4.53bn.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Money supply hits rate hopes PROSPECTS for further cuts in interest rates before the end of the year retreated yesterday with the news that growth in the narrow measure of the money supply has risen to its highest level for almost a year. Strong annual growth of M0 - mainly notes and coins in circulation - has added weight to signs that an upturn in retail sales is under way. The seasonally adjusted figures from the Bank of England confirmed that in the year to November M0 expanded by 3 per cent, the strongest year-on-year rate of growth since December last year. Compared with the previous month, it grew by 0.8 per cent. The rise backs up a small, but unexpected, increase in retail sales in October. The two sets of figures indicate that a further sharp fall in retail spending is unlikely. Mr Leo Doyle, economist at Kleinwort Benson, the London merchant bank and investment house, said: 'The figures suggest that we are past the worst. We are not going to double-dip back down to where we were.' However, economists also point out that M0 is a coincident indicator of retail sales and gives little indication of future trends. Mr Doyle said that although the latest figure was promising, it did not change his view that retail sales would slow down in the fourth quarter as further news of big job losses affected confidence. The strong growth in M0 will hearten the government amid predominantly bad economic news. A recent Confederation of British Industry survey of the retail sector painted a gloomier picture than that reflected in official figures, while most other Central Statistical Office data show the economy still in recession. The rise means that the authorities will be less willing to ease monetary policy. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has targeted a growth rate for M0 of between 0 and 4 per cent as part of his anti-inflation strategy and will be anxious not to let the figure jump too rapidly towards 4 per cent. The latest monthly survey of UK purchasing managers continues to show a decline in manufacturing industry activity levels. In November, the purchasing managers' index - a weighted average of movements in variables such as new orders, output and employment - was below 50 per cent. However, at 49.5 per cent it was higher than in October when it was 47.7 per cent. Lex, Page 18</p>

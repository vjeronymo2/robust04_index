			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: IPMA urges EC to revise proposals for new rules LEADING Eurobond firms yesterday struck out at proposed European Community securities regulations, claiming that the new rules would drive securities business from the EC. The International Primary Markets Association, which represents new issue underwriters, called for substantial amendments to two proposed directives - the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) and Large Exposures Directive (LED). These lay down rules governing the amount of capital which must be set aside by firms against securities holdings, including underwriting positions. IPMA commissioned Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy practice, to study the effects of the proposed directives on Eurobond underwriting. The study examined the underwriting business of seven firms over the course of last year. It concluded that the proposed EC rules 'would require levels of capital greatly in excess of amounts currently committed' by new issue firms. This would increase the cost of new issue underwriting. The report said that the proposed rules: Do not allow a long enough 'window' in which new issues can be sold to investors by underwriting firms before full capital adequacy requirements start to bite. A survey of seven leading underwriting firms found that in most Eurobond issues 'a material balance' of securities remained unsold even 10 days after the deal was launched. The CAD allows only a five-day underwriting window in which concessionary capital rules apply. Do not take account of hedging strategies which allow securities firms to limit interest rate risk. For example, a firm can hedge a long position of securities by taking an equal short position in the futures market. Such hedging activity is not recognised by the draft CAD. Are too harsh on firms which take a very large underwriting position, by acting as sole underwriter in a 'block trade' of securities, for example. The LED was drafted to control large loans made by banks and imposes a limit on loans over 25 per cent of the institutions' capital backing. The Coopers' study argued that securities positions are less risky than loans exposure since the securities can usually be sold if the issuer runs into trouble. Hence the 25 per cent 'hard limit' on securities exposures should not apply. The latest drafts of the two directives were circulated in April and are currently under consideration by EC governments. Meanwhile, Mr Geoffrey Fitchew, director general of the EC division preparing the regulations, said that a significant breakthrough had been made in negotiations in recent days over the capital adequacy directive. Member states, which had pushed for strict limits on the underwriting risks investment firms could take on, have indicated that they are prepared to accepted less stringent rules, he said. This is considered one of the main sticking points in the development of the directive, and is one of the main concerns of the bond market. Mr Fitchew added that the directive, under discussion for the past four years, was entering a critical phase and could be agreed within the next six weeks.</p>

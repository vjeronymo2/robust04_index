			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Finns swing in favour of EC entry FINLAND comes closer to joining the European Community today when President Mauno Koivisto is expected to announce support for entry. In doing so, he will join most of Finland's political and industrial leaders who have swung in favour of membership in recent months. This month Prime Minister Esko Aho and his cabinet will decide on an EC application, and parliament will vote on the issue. The formal application will be made by mid-March, ensuring that Finland can join Sweden and Austria in parallel entry negotiations. These could begin late this year during the British EC presidency. The only remaining doubts lie in the attitude of Mr Aho's ruling Centre Party, which is divided over EC entry. Many rural supporters fear EC membership will devastate Finland's highly-protected agriculture. Others worry about the loss of sovereignty for a country that became independent only 75 years ago. Mr Aho only came out publicly in support of EC entry last weekend and may still have trouble with his rank-and-file although most policy-makers believe the country has little choice. The swing towards EC entry follows the realisation that a 19-nation European Economic Area (EEA) would only be a transitional arrangement, particularly after Sweden opted in 1990 to seek EC entry. In addition the collapse of the Soviet Union effectively ended 43 years of being constrained by Moscow and gave Finnish policy-makers freedom to chart a new course towards western Europe. Since last summer virtually all Finnish industrialists have backed EC membership. With nearly half Finland's trade with the EC, exporters realise their prosperity is bound up with western Europe. Negotiations with Brussels could prove difficult over agriculture, where the Finnish government wants special treatment for its farmers. Once terms are negotiated Finland plans a referendum on entry terms. After that parliament must vote by a two-thirds majority under the constitution twice, both before and after the 1995 election, if the country is to join the EC. Such a high hurdle is giving the anti-EC campaign some hope, particularly as a recent opinion poll revealed only 51 per cent in favour of joining and 38 per cent against.</p>

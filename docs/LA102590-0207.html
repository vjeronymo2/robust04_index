			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRESH FROM THE GARDEN;  </P> <P> EGGPLANT: FOOD INDIGO  </P> <P> Eggplant is the food sponge of the vegetable world; its greatest asset is its  ability to absorb flavors. In addition, its own natural sweet, bland flavor  acts as the perfect foil for an endless combination of seasonings.  </P> <P> Because of its unique spongy flesh, the taste and texture of eggplant changes  dramatically depending on the cooking method used. Grilling lends a meaty  succulence to the vegetable, especially when followed by a savory marinade of  good-quality vinegar, olive oil and herbs; frying brings out the sweetness; and  roasting results in a creamy, nutty flesh.  </P> <P> Although all varieties, regardless of shape or color, have the same taste,  different types of eggplant lend themselves to different preparations. The  small white egg-shaped fruits and the Japanese types are perfect for stuffing  and baking; we also like to roast them whole with heads of garlic. Standard  large purple eggplant yield slices suitable for grilling or frying. In  addition, standard eggplants are perfect when roasted whole so that you can  scoop out the creamy flesh for dips and cold salads.  </P> <P> Of the standard eggplant varieties, Black Beauty, Beauty Hybrid and Burpee  Hybrid are the most commonly grown. Some Japanese-type eggplants are Ichiban,  Early Long Purple and Long Tom Hybrid. For lovely small white fruits, try  planting Easter Egg. Rosa Blanca yields a large, round violet-  and-white-streaked fruit. All varieties of eggplant are perfectly suitable for  growing in containers, which should be a minimum of 5 gallons in size. Japanese  eggplants grown in containers are particularly beautiful on a sunny porch.  </P> <P> A few words about salting. Many recipes suggest salting sliced eggplant before  cooking to extract bitterness. The source of the vegetable's potential  bitterness are its seeds, which have a high water content. Salting draws out  the water and -- with it -- the eggplant's bitterness. When the eggplant is  young, as it usually is when picked from the home garden, its seeds are pale.  Older fruits have darker, sometimes even black seeds. We feel that it is  necessary to salt only older eggplants with darker seeds. Whether in the garden  or the supermarket, always look for eggplants with taut, glossy skin; these  qualities are good indicators of youth.  </P> <P>  A highly seasoned mixture of ground lamb and spices is stuffed into the shell  of the eggplant and baked. For the right portion size, pick eggplant when they  are about 6 inches long and 4 inches in diameter.  </P> <P> MOUSSAKA  </P> <P> 3 medium eggplants  </P> <P> 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil  </P> <P> 1 large onion, chopped  </P> <P> 1 pound ground lamb  </P> <P> 3 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped parsley  </P> <P> 1/3 cup red wine  </P> <P> 1/4 cup canned tomato puree  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Freshly ground pepper  </P> <P> 1 cup grated mozzarella or casseri cheese  </P> <P> 2 cups Bechamel Sauce  </P> <P> Cut eggplants in halves lengthwise.

Pour Bechamel Sauce over meat, until it reaches  top of shell. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.  </P> <P> Place stuffed eggplants in large baking dish with 1 inch warm water. Bake at  350 degrees 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until eggplant shells are tender to touch  and tops are browned and bubbly.

Place 1  mozzarella cheese slice along with salt and pepper to taste between 2 slices  eggplant. Press together firmly to make sandwich.  </P> <P> Dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in beaten eggs, then bread crumbs.  Repeat with remaining eggplant and cheese slices.  </P> <P> Heat oil to 350 degrees in deep fryer. Fry sandwiches, turning once, until  golden brown on both sides. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper  towels. Serve immediately. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> PLANTING ALERT:  </P> <P> Fall can be an incredibly rewarding time in the garden. It's when we realize  that, in Southern California, we can plant year round.  </P> <P> Now is the time to plant onions, garlic, shallots from sets. Greens such as  chard, spinach, collards and all types of lettuce can be started from seed, as  can beets and turnips.  </P></p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: AB disappoints Disappointment at the lack of news at Associated British Foods was said to be behind the 15 pence fall in the shares to 583p, despite profit figures in line with market expectations. Turnover was an unusually heavy 1.1m. Many analysts had been hopeful that the acquisitive and cash rich company might use yesterday's profits statement to announce another deal, following the rumours of a bid for the cake business of Allied Lyons mooted recently in the market. Allied Lyons shares slipped 3 to 587p. Enterprise Oil came under moderate pressure, closing 3 off at 445p as bid stories, and suggestions that a rights issue would be needed to fund such a move, continued to circulate. British Gas shares dropped 9 to 297p in unspectacular turnover of 6.1m as the market prepared itself for the consultative paper expected from Ofgas, the industry regulator, on competition, rate of return and the new price cap formula on transport tariffs. The latest improvement in crude oil prices gave the majors a strong boost. BP touched 392p early in the session before slipping back to close a net 2 1/2 ahead at 388p on heavy turnover of 14m. There was widespread gloom in the bank sector where dealers reported persistent profit-taking following last week's surge of interest in the wake of the Lloyds Bank bid for the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society. Standard Chartered dipped 14 to 995p as the market remained unconvinced that Lloyds would hold on to its near 5 per cent stake. Lloyds shares lost 8 to 589p on profit-taking. Abbey National, hit last week by worries that the Lloyds move would trigger a war in the mortgage market, rallied 5 to 437p. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo suffered the biggest fall among the FT-SE 100 stocks, the shares tumbling 3.6 per cent as the market focused on weekend press coverage of a lengthy review of the company's prospects by leading US brokerage Salomon Brothers. Salomon's Mr Peter Laing has argued that Glaxo will have to include Pounds 500m of provisions in its 1996 figures as a result of redundancies from the decline of Zantac, the anti-ulcer treatment which accounts for the largest proportion of sales. Mr Laing has also reduced his 1996 forecast excluding provisions by Pounds 305m to Pounds 2.075bn. The shares slid 21 to 554p. SmithKline Beecham's last annual meeting hosted by Mr Bob Bauman failed to inspire and the shares shed 6 to 376p. However Wellcome held steady to close only 2 weaker at 513p as analysts anticipated US approval for the company's anti-epileptic drug Lamictal. London International eased a further 2 to 103p ahead of an announcement that Powerstock, an investment arm of Malaysian Genting, had increased its stake to 4.4 per cent. The electricity distribution companies, known in the market as 'recs', suffered from another flurry of heavy selling by institutions and private investors increasingly worried by the electricity industry regulator's much tougher than expected opening stance on pricing proposals for next year. Hints of the regulator's severe stance leaked into the market last Friday, triggering big falls across the sector. Among the worst casualties yesterday were the two FT-SE constituents, Eastern, 16 off at 600p and Southern, 21 lower at 580p. Manweb lost 20 to 672p and Seeboard 17 to 308p. In a lacklustre stores sector, Sears were strong ahead of results today. The shares put on 3 to 131 1/2 p. Analysts have pencilled in around Pounds 127m for this morning's full-year figures. News and information group Reuters Holdings lifted 13 to 518p after the company announced a 15 per cent jump in first quarter revenues.</p>

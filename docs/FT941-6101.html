			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / People: Large quits Bupa Bupa, Britain's biggest private medical insurer and healthcare group, yesterday announced the resignation of Arthur Large, managing director of its UK membership division, after management disagreements. A Bupa statement said Large's departure had 'arisen from differences about the strategic direction of the insurance business', but the company declined to be more specific about the nature of the differences. Large was one of the central figures in a new Bupa management team built up by Peter Jacobs, chief executive, when he joined the healthcare group from British Sugar. Large, who was with the RAC before Bupa, worked with Jacobs to inject stronger commercial attitudes into the management of the previously genteel group. Private healthcare has become far more competitive in recent years and Bupa, although still dominant, no longer enjoys the market share it once did. According to last month's Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on private medical services, Bupa's share of the insurance market - although not its turnover - fell from 59 per cent in 1985 to 44 per cent in 1992. Large will be succeeded by Roger Hymas, 47, who joined Bupa in 1992 as group marketing director. His previous employment history includes posts at American Express and Burton group.</p>

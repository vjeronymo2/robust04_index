			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: RTZ to spend Dollars 500m at Utah copper complex RTZ CORPORATION, the world's biggest mining company, is to spend USDollars 500m over five years to expand and upgrade tailings (waste) facilities at its Bingham Canyon copper complex in Utah. This takes RTZ's financial commitment at Bingham to Dollars 1.4bn as it has already started a Dollars 880m project to build a new smelter that will take annual copper output from 155,000 to 272,000 tonnes and use up all production of concentrate (an intermediate material). At present Bingham sells 50 to 60 per cent of its concentrate. Also, Kennecott, the RTZ subsidiary that operates Bingham, recently finished an expansion of the concentrator costing Dollars 219m. Kennecott is the third-largest copper producer in the US, with about 15 per cent of the nation's supply. The tailings expansion will eventually cover 4,100 acres and is designed to provide waste storage for Bingham for the next 25 to 30 years. Kennecott hopes permits will be awarded in time for construction to start early next year, which will enable the project to be completed in 1998. Newmont Mining, North America's biggest gold producer, has reached agreement for a group of international banks to provide USDollars 105m for its heap leach joint venture near the Muruntau mine in Uzbekistan, the biggest open pit gold mine in the world. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will provide half the money and a group of 13 commercial banks are putting up the rest. EBRD said this was the first mining project finance it had provided, it was the first syndicated financing for the former Soviet Union and the first limited recourse private sector loan for Uzbekistan in any of the capital markets. Newmont estimates the cost of the project, where its heap-leach technology will be used to extract at least 5m troy ounces of gold from old waste dumps at Muruntau over 16 years, will be Dollars 150m. Production at the so-called Zarafshan-Newmont joint venture is scheduled to start in early 1995 at the rate of 450,000 ounces a year. Annual output over the life of the project is forecast to average 310,000 ounces. Newmont's joint venture partners are Uzbekistan's state committee of geology and mineral resources and the Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Combinat, each with 25 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING IT IN THE INNER CITY  </P> <P> Big, modern supermarkets are scarce in South-Central Los Angeles. Most major  grocery chains have written off a large territory of nearly 50 square miles  between the Santa Monica and Artesia freeways from Crenshaw to Alameda  boulevards, according to Times staff writer Jube Shiver. As the largest grocery  chains -- with the lonely exception of Boys Market -- abandon the area, the  poorest people end up paying the highest prices for food.  </P> <P> It is as difficult to place blame as it is to find answers to the problem that  do not themselves suggest new questions.  </P> <P> The grocers say that supermarkets are not charities and that grocery stores are  money-making businesses with thin profit margins. In high-crime areas, profits  are greatly reduced by security problems and high insurance rates; shoppers and  employees face constant danger. In older urban areas, profits are further  reduced by limited floor and shelf space in the older, outmoded, inefficient  and small stores.  </P> <P> The absence of large, competitive supermarkets is common in the nation's  inner-city neighborhoods, according to a report, "Obtaining Food: Shopping  Constraints on the Poor," prepared two years ago for a House select committee  on hunger. The government can't force stores into every neighborhood, but local  leaders can coax them. Zoning and tax incentives are under consideration by the  city council in Washington. Local incentives are a logical approach, but it  will take more than tax breaks to make shoppers and employees feel safe in  high-crime areas.  </P> <P> To decrease crime, Boys Market is using fences and guards at two fairly new  high-security supermarkets in South-Central Los Angeles. The stores, which  opened at Vermont and Slauson in 1981 and in Watts in 1985, have proved that  the inner city can be profitable. But not every market chain will go to that  trouble, and, without competition, there is no way to ensure moderate prices.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter is discussing the problem with a  number of supermarket representatives. More council members must involve  themselves, as must the mayor and community leaders.  </P> <P> In any city or neighborhood, markets are more than places to shop. They define  neighborhoods, add to a sense of vitality, serve as anchors where little else  seems permanent. In South-Central Los Angeles those contributions may not seem  as dramatic as other projects in which politicians invest time and energy, but  they are badly needed.  </P></p>

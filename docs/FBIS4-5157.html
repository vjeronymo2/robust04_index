			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the  Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland  [CPRF] published its Information No. 647 Wednesday, in which it  accused the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique of more frantically  intensifying fascist crackdown upon patriotic students who rise  in the struggle for independence against the United States and  for national reunification.    According to the information, the South Korean fascist  clique, some time ago, arrested about 450 students affiliated  with Hanchongnyon (the South Korean Federation of General  Student Councils), who had staged a demonstration urging a  peaceful solution to the "nuclear issue" and protesting the  deployment of U.S. Patriot missiles in South Korea. And they  walked away students affiliated with the Pusan and South  Kyongsang Provincial Federation of General Student Councils, who  had protested against the rice market opening and shipment of  Patriot in South Korea and urged a total dismantlement of the  U.S. military bases.    They also imposed heavy penalties upon students, who had  exchanged messages with students of Kim Il-song University in  the North and taken the lead in demonstrations calling for  anti-U.S. independence and national reunification, on "charges"  of violation of the "National Security Law".    The puppet clique's brutal suppression and harsh punishment  are an open challenge to the patriotic students of South Korea  who aspire after independence, democracy and reunification, the  information says, adding:    "We strongly hold that such anti-reunification,  anti-democracy fascist laws as the `National Security Law'  should be abrogated in South Korea and all the patriotic  students arrested on unwarrantable charges be released without  delay."</p>

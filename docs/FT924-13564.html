			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Italy rallies to Gorbachev ITALY yesterday protested to Russia after Mr Mikhail Gorbachev was forced to cancel an Italian trip, Reuter reports. The former Soviet president, barred from travelling abroad after refusing to testify about the ex-Soviet Communist party, said he cancelled the 10-day trip to avoid a confrontation with Russian authorities. Mr Gorbachev was granted a passport on Tuesday but only allowed to use it to travel to Germany for the funeral of former chancellor Willy Brandt.</p>

Another half hour on the horrors of homelessness? Try World In Action on ITV at 8.30. Or how about the chronic pain experienced by broiler chickens, the bone joint problems of intensively farmed pigs, or the exhaustion and emaciation of dairy cows? Horizon will oblige you with 50 detailed minutes (8.10 BBC2). All a bit sissy? Fancy another helping on the agonies of child abuse? Little Girl Lost gives you a movie-length American television drama on the subject, and we are promised it is 'based on actual events'. What more could you want? Radio 4 starts a six-part series of 10-minute programmes called Spin] in which enthusiasts introduce Dylan Winter (he of the long pony treks) to some vehicle which they love. Today Henry Labouchere shows off his Tiger Moth (7.50, FM only). At 9.15, also on Radio 4, comes Famous For 15 Minutes: when the soloist at a Prom concert collapsed Patrick McCarthy stepped in from the audience and took his place.</p>

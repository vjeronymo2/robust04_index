			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLING FEEBLY AT THE TOES OF A GIANT;  </P> <P> BUDGET: THERE'S A HUGE GAP BETWEEN PRESIDENT BUSH'S RHETORIC AND THE TINY IDEAS  IN HIS NEW FISCAL PLAN. BASIC NEEDS WILL REMAIN UNFULFILLED.  </P> <P> The budget that President Bush sent to Congress Monday fulfills the motto of  his Administration: When you see great challenges facing you, don't quibble.  Nibble.  </P> <P> When Ronald Reagan was President, you always had the feeling that he believed  his own cliche: "Government isn't the answer to our problems; government is the  problem." Bush knows better. He knows that there are problems no entrepreneur  is going to solve at a profit and there are needs that no church bake-sale  proceeds will meet. But after identifying these problems, he is content to  nibble at the edges of them rather than grapple with both hands, as our great  Presidents have done with the tests of their times.  </P> <P> Under the guise of summoning the American public and members of both parties in  the Democratic-controlled Congress to meet the demands of a new decade and a  radically changing world, Bush once again has chosen to throw his immense  popularity into the most minuscule of fights. The gap between Bush's own  rhetoric and his resolve is awesome.  </P> <P> That is the case on education, on transportation, on science, on research and  development, on drugs and on crime. It is also notably the case when it comes  to the basic obligation of any executive: financing the programs he proposes.  The first budget for which Bush has full responsibility continues the pattern  of systematic prevarication that has made people so cynical about Washington  and its ways.  </P> <P> If you accept Bush's golden economic-growth assumptions, and if you ignore the  $200-billion-plus cost of the savings-and-loan bailout, and if you count the  Social Security Trust Fund surplus against the unfunded annual operating  budget, then you can get the deficit down to a "mere" $63 billion.  </P> <P> But the reality is different. The gross federal debt -- which includes  obligations to Social Security and similar trust funds -- will actually rise by  $1 trillion between 1989 and 1995 under the Bush blueprint.  </P> <P> So much for discipline.  </P> <P> As for needed public investment, the reality -- hidden in a back-of-the book  table -- is this: In constant dollars, Bush is proposing only to keep federal  spending on non-defense physical capital at the level of the 1980s. If you  offset depreciation of aging equipment and facilities against investment, as  any businessman would do, the net non-defense investment being proposed is just  over half what it was in 1980 and less than two-thirds what Reagan thought  adequate in 1985.  </P> <P> The sad thing is that Bush's nibbling approach sets the outer limits on what  can be expected from Washington this year, barring some sort of external  political or financial crisis. It is rarely the case that Congress, even when  controlled by the opposition party, pushes a President much further than he is  prepared to go. And this year is not likely to be the exception.  </P> <P> This being an election year, the Democratic majority is preoccupied with  getting its return ticket punched by the electorate. For most of them, that  means staying away from fights with a President who enjoys favorable notices  from almost 80% of the voters.  </P> <P> Bush has already demonstrated in the most convincing manner possible that he is  ready and eager to confront Congress when it challenges the policy he prefers.  Last week's White House victory in sustaining Bush's veto of the Chinese  student-residency relief bill showed that he could marshal Republican senators  even in an unpopular and ignoble cause. Coming at the start of the session, it  significantly strengthens Bush's chances of dominating the year's agenda.  </P> <P> That is a marked change from last year. Except for the S&amp;L bill at the  start of the year, Bush in 1989 was rarely able to compel Congress to put his  agenda to the fore. As a result, he had to use his veto pen more often than did  other new Presidents. And even with the successful vetoes, he experienced more  defeats in Congress, according to Congressional Quarterly, than any newly  elected President in the postwar era.  </P> <P> But Kirk O'Donnell, a top House Democratic leadership aide when Thomas P. (Tip)  O'Neill was Speaker, expects that Bush may be far more dominant in 1990 than he  was in 1989. "He's approaching the second session of Congress the way most  Presidents approach their first session," O'Donnell said. "His election did not  give him a mandate vis-a-vis Congress, because he had no coattails. But now  he'll use a year of steadily rising popularity . . . to prod and poke Congress  to act on his agenda."  </P> <P> Sadly, that agenda is so limited that Bush's influence becomes more of a  barrier to meeting the nation's challenges than a catalyst for action. In the  world of toothless politicians, the nibbler is king.  </P></p>

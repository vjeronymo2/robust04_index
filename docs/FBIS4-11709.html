A  committee is to be set up to work out trans-regional  arrangements for promotion of trade finances and transfer of  technology among member nations. The private sector and G-15  business forum will be closely associated with this. At the end  of the summit yesterday, the leaders also directed that viable  projects of cooperation should be implemented with more vigor.  The foreign ministers of India, Argentina and Zimbabwe, who  will now form the troika or the steering committee of the group,  have been asked review the projects and examine their source of  financing. India offered to share its technology in harnessing  wind energy with other member nations.    AIR [All India Radio] correspondent reports that the heads  of  government and state expressed concern over attempts by  developed countries to bring in new issues like labor standards  in the talks on the GATT deal. This, they said, will adversely  affect the export of developing nations.    The summit decided that the G-15 ministers will meet in the  next two weeks before the authentication of the new GATT deal at  Marrakech in Morocco to take coordinated action aginst such  move. The joint communique issued after the summit called for  setting up a monitoring mechanism to protect the interest of the  developing countries during the implementation of new GATT  accord. Official sources in New Delhi said the leaders also  decided to maintain the practice of holding the G-15 summit  annually, but with a flexible quorum.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Moulinex losses deepen to FFr598m Moulinex, the French household appliances group, suffered a net loss of FFr598m (Dollars 104.54m) in fiscal 1993, a sharp increase from losses of FFr41m the previous year. The company, which is in the process of a substantial refinancing and restructuring programme, said the results for the year to the end of March included a FFr185m restructuring charge, a FFr132m exceptional charge relating to a write-down of R&amp;D investments and a FFr170m charge relating to product and customer risks. Moulinex said negotiations with Euris, an investment consortium which is planning to take a substantial stake in the company, could be completed by the end of this month. The refinancing package includes a FFr1bn rights issue, the details of which are being finalised. In addition to the restructuring charges, last year's results were also affected by recession in many of the group's principal markets in western Europe and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations in Italy, Spain and the UK. Moulinex said that it had responded to the more difficult economic environment by cutting inventory levels and reducing capital expenditure to FFr230m, compared with FFr569m in the previous year.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Sanctions spawn a new Bedlam in Serbia: Laura Silber finds medieval conditions in a psychiatric hospital deprived of modern drugs At Toponica, Serbia's largest psychiatric hospital, even the silent, skeletal faces shriek. Day after day, patients shrunken by starvation, cold and infections, shiver and die beneath grey blankets, two dozen in the last fortnight, hospital workers said. Corpses decay as the staff search in vain for relatives who can afford the burial expenses. The living spend their days sitting in their own excrement as hospital workers, with no drugs to administer, stand by helpless. Few people can even travel to Toponica because petrol is in short supply and public transport has been slashed since the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Serbia for lending military and economic support to the Serbs carving up Bosnia. Toponica is not an island of horror; it is but one gruesome sample of the crisis consuming the former Yugoslavia. Mr Sven Lampell, Belgrade head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) says donor countries are 'prejudiced', reluctant to give aid to the remnants of Yugoslavia, whose leaders have been branded the chief instigators of the war. He fears Serbia will be unable to cope with the economic collapse. The stench and squalor of Toponica are evidence of his grim view. An IFRC doctor estimates that at least 200 patients are at risk of imminent death, but warns of similar cases elsewhere. Toponica is Bedlam, the word coined from the Bethlehem Royal Hospital established in 1547 in London. Only centuries later did anti-psychotic drugs subdue the tumult. The 1,600 psychiatric patients, 400 more than the maximum legal capacity, have fallen between the cracks of a society caving in. The inmates are undergoing a cruel experiment, deprived of drugs, food and heating. A hospital doctor puts it bluntly: 'We have gone back in time 50 years at Toponica.' And by western standards, hospital conditions in Yugoslavia before the Second World War were almost medieval. The story of Toponica is filled with villains and heroes. Mrs Nadica Radic, a seemingly tireless head nurse, and a team of medical technicians, are heroes, especially given their average monthly wage equivalent to DM3. Until last week, Serbian authorities ignored the pleas of Mrs Radic about the plight of the hospital. Now they have seized on Toponica as yet another example of the 'injustice' of sanctions. While the embargo is the scapegoat for everything gone wrong in Serbia, this institution also exposes the legacy of communist disregard for psychiatric care. Serb officials blame the sanctions for the acute shortage of medicines but a Belgrade pharmacist say neuroleptic drugs are available, 'but you just need to have money', he adds. In a state whose leaders seem immune to the suffering of the population, psychiatric patients rank at the bottom of the agenda because they pose no threat to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. With resources wanting in Serbia, local relief officials spar over scraps of aid. Dr Radomir Krstic, president of the Red Cross in nearby Nis, 180 miles southeast of Belgrade, appeals for help for the Nis children's clinic, dismissing the patients of Toponica. 'They are just idiots, they need drugs, not clothes.' Four lorries carrying emergency aid have been despatched to Toponica. But Handicap International, a Paris-based aid organisation, says a Dollars 2.5m emergency aid package for Serbian centres serving disabled populations is necessary to meet the bare minimum. But two years of war, the UN sanctions and corruption have emptied the state coffers, on one hand, while war profiteering and sanctions busting, on the other hand, have made Belgrade's power brokers and protected crime figures rich. Mrs Radic points to stacks of wood, cut from the snow-covered grounds at Toponica. This hospital and scores of other institutions in the shattered former federation are the quiet casualties of the war. 'These people are the least to blame. They cannot defend themselves,' she says.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Shlomi Eldar] </F>   [Excerpts] The issue of the Palestinian prisoners is  turning into the central issue in the territories in  anticipation of Yasir 'Arafat's arrival. Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] and the rejectionist organizations are  calling for mass demonstrations in the Gaza Strip to protest the  delay in the release of the prisoners. A leaflet distributed  today says that the terrorist Rabin -- as the leaflet depicts  him -- cannot be expected to release the prisoners. Almost 300  prisoners who according to the Oslo agreement must remain in the  autonomous area are grounded in Jericho at the present time. Our  correspondent Shlomi Eldar reports:    [Begin Eldar recording] The pressure being exerted by the  families of the Palestinians behind bars imprisoned in Israeli  prisons is growing. In a mass demonstration organized by George  Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Habash's  picture was hoisted alongside that of thousands of prisoners.  So far Israel has released less than one half of the security  prisoners it promised to release, and this issue tops all other  issues on Gaza's public agenda. This pressure has reached  'Arafat. He knows that without affecting the release of the  prisoners he will not be able to come to Gaza and Jericho with  peace of mind. Today he sent Brigadier Ziyad al-Atrash to  address the crowds on his behalf. [passage omitted]    Al-Atrash will in all likelihood convey a message to 'Arafat  advising him not to arrive in Gaza and Jericho before he  succeeds in dissolving this protest movement.    The thousands of demonstrators later held a protest march in  Gaza City, chanting slogans calling for the release of the  prisoners. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 13 May (PAP)--The government will definitely  adhere to agreements concluded with hard coal and lignite-mine  workers, said Trade and Industry Minister Marek Pol, while  delivering a government report on the strike situation and the  results of negotiations with trade unions in the Sejm today.    "There has not been a single day without strike since this  government took office. Most strikes do not meet the  requirements of legality, but we recognize this method of  protest. Strikes are always dangerous. This one, however, was  particularly dangerous because it affected strategic sectors,  crucial to the security of the state. We are aware that trade  unions are not rich, but, all over the world, financial  compensation for strikes is paid by the organizer," Minister Pol  said.    According to Pol, the strikes in the lignite-mining industry  were caused by anxiety over the sector's restructuring. The  protest in the hard coal mining industry was initially linked to  support for lignite-mine workers and later became a  manifestation of support for Solidarity's demands on the  national scale.    Pol believes that mine workers should elect their  representation; there are from several to a dozen or so trade  union organizations in each colliery. For example, in the hard  coal mining industry, there are 39 trade union organizations.    The minister briefed the deputies on the content of  agreements concluded with lignite-mine workers on 30 April in  Konin and with hard-coal mine workers on 11 May in Warsaw.</p>

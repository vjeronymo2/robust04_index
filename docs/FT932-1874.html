			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (2): Compromise and persuasion - Europe adopts a slower approach towards a single electricity market FOR THE first months of 1993, the opening up of the European Community electricity market seemed to have ground to a halt, in the face of opposition by national utilities and their governments. Now the new energy and competition commissioners, appointed in January, seem fully committed to reform. It will, however, be a process of gradual change rather than the revolution which had been threatened by their predecessors. Compromises are being sought by commissioners, particularly Mr Abel Matutes, at energy, and the electricity companies say they are ready to listen. The utilities can take comfort from the case of another EC initiative which many believe would harm their interests. Finance ministers last month damaged the prospects for an EC-wide energy tax to fight global warming by refusing to endorse it after rows over how the levy should be apportioned. With the UK government and most utility companies opposed to a levy, some EC officials believe it may take years to implement an energy tax. Implementation of the energy market will similarly be difficult but the process is back on track in a diluted form which at least tackles the thorny issue of allowing utility companies to sell directly to customers in other countries. Third party access (TPA), as this form of liberalisation is called, has long been backed by commissioners who argue that a free market in all goods can only be achieved if the primary industrial source of electricity is subjected to the same treatment. Allowing full trade between electricity companies and consumers would tackle monopolies and force a cut in power prices, they say. The first move to liberalisation was the Transit Directive, in force since July 1991, which forced utility companies to extend high voltage networks beyond their areas. Another directive sought transparency of pricing by obliging companies to publish prices. As the next stage, Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, Mr Matutes's predecessor, had planned to break up the monopolies using the EC's special powers, but he was forced to desist. Instead, he sought to attack the monopolies by demolishing exclusive rights to generate electricity and obliging them to unbundle their accounts so that the various segments (generation, distribution, contracting etc.) operate more autonomously. This would make it easier for outsiders to gauge the market and compete. He also proposed that large consumers - for example, steel, chemicals and fertiliser companies - should be granted access to energy networks by the beginning of this year. If successful, the right to buy electricity from anywhere in Europe would have been extended to smaller consumers from January 1, 1996. It was not. Only Britain was wholly in favour of the proposals. Other states expressed cautious approval for accounts transparency and ending monopolies over electricity production. But Spain, Italy, France, Greece and Luxembourg are still strongly opposed to the principle of TPA. Part of the problem is that, apart from Britain, most countries see electricity as a natural monopoly. National policy decides price, with different internal constraints leading to different price structures. Even Spain, which is liberalising its internal electricity supply, is against third party access. 'Security of supply is the responsibility of each member country, not the Commission,' says Mr Ramon Perez Simarro, secretary general of energy in the industry ministry. 'We want as much competition as possible. But the critical issue is security of supply and that depends on primary energy diversification. We cannot delegate that to the market as in the UK.' In outlining his company's opposition to TPA, Mr Jean Bergougnoux, chief executive of Electricite de France, the French utility, says it would be economically inefficient. It would restrict companies' ability to apply equality of treatment conditions in their areas and would reduce interconnections through which energy is traded between countries. 'It is not easy or cheap to build new lines,' he says. 'Companies would not be motivated if competitors would be able to use lines in their place.' In Germany the utility companies are strongly against TPA, arguing that they would be placed at a strong disadvantage to France which sells its largely nuclear-generated electricity at prices that they cannot match, largely because of their requirement to buy expensive German coal. To achieve a truly free market, they say, all subsidies would have to be removed, whether in Germany, Britain, France or Spain, but that is not in sight and there is no pressure from them to bring it about immediately. Outside the utilities the liberalisation argument in Germany appears to be turning, with some sections of the government favouring it as a means of reducing prices and helping the country out of recession. How can the Commission circumvent this opposition? Mr Matutes favours amending the existing legislation so that member states will no longer be obliged to grant free access to the electricity and gas networks. Instead, users which wanted to buy energy across EC borders would negotiate access to other networks, signing individual contracts. Member states and operators would have to justify any decision to refuse a request - for example, on the grounds that there was insufficient capacity, the negotiated price was too low, or there was a risk that domestic energy companies would be unable to meet their obligations to existing clients. Supporters of full liberalisation need convincing. Dissident states may find ways of circumventing any directive and there is a strong danger of unequal implementation. Much therefore will depend on the drafting, expected to take place later this year after the European parliament discusses the issue.</p>

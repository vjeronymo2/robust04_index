			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A Chinese parliamentary delegation led by Wang  Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], today held  parliamentary talks with Senate Speaker Ahmad al-Lawzi and a  number of Senate members. The delegation also visited the Royal  Jordanian Scientific Society.    The visit seeks to examine prospects of Jordanian-Chinese  cooperation in various fields. Senate Speaker Ahmad al-Lawzi  noted the importance of this visit because Jordan believes that  China's role in and concern about achieving peace in the region  is one of the most important bases on which we depend. This is  especially so since China is one of the five permanent UN  Security Council members. Therefore, it is directly concerned  with implementing UN Security Council resolutions that deal with  the Middle East issue.    Al-Lawzi called on the Chinese friends to exercise their  real  role based on the international legitimacy to solve the  Arab-Israeli conflict. He noted the firmness of  Jordanian-Chinese political, cultural, and economic relations as  a result of both countries' eagerness to develop and reinforce  these relations.    The head of the Chinese delegation said that the Chinese  leadership and people greatly appreciate His Majesty King  Husayn's balanced stands on various international issues.  [passage omitted]    The Chinese delegation arrived in Amman this morning on a  four-day visit to Jordan. The delegation was received by a  number of Senate members, the Parliament's secretary general,  and the Chinese ambassador in Amman.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Buying interest moves to Australia WITH Tokyo closed for the spring equinox holiday, equity market interest seemed to move to the Antipodes yesterday although Bombay, too, rose sharply. AUSTRALIA was boosted by encouraging economic news and the All Ordinaries Index closed up 12.6 at 1,584.1, a fall of 0.2 per cent on the week. The market was encouraged by a rise in consumer sentiment to its highest level for more than three years. BHP put on 18 cents to ADollars 13.44 and was followed by fellow mining groups, CRA rising 4 cents to ADollars 13.80 and Western Mining gaining 13 cents to ADollars 4.86. TNT was off 2 cents at ADollars 1.86: it announced on Thursday that it had agreed to operate a joint international express mail service with European and US post offices. NEW ZEALAND recovered after hitting a four-month low in early trading: the NZSE-40 index closed just 0.38 down at 1,438.81 after falling to 1,424.95, a 0.9 per cent decline over the week. Turnover was NZDollars 19.9m after NZDollars 10.3m. Analysts said that sentiment was encouraged by the stronger Australian market, but noted that a series of cash issues and public flotations over the coming weeks will take more than NZDollars 1bn from the market. Fletcher Challenge gained 4 cents to NZDollars 3.42 having earlier hit NZDollars 3.36. Telecom remained weak, closing down 3 cents at NZDollars 2.28. HONG KONG closed higher after speculation in second line stocks, the Hang Seng index ending 25.22 higher at 5,015.81, 1.1 per cent lower on the week, after a low on the day of 4,967.37. HSBC Holdings, parent of the Hongkong Bank, traded heavily, adding HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 41.25. Brokers said that positive economic signals coming from the National People's Congress in Beijing, including a formal end to the Chinese austerity programme introduced in 1988, had little effect as the news was already built into the market. BOMBAY rose sharply after reports that a daily limit on share purchases may be relaxed. The BSE index closed up 115.52 or 3.7 per cent to 3,243.53, but down 0.4 per cent on the week. SINGAPORE finished easier, the Straits Times Industrial index falling 0.58 to 1,435.81, 2.1 per cent down on the week. Volume rose from 24.7 to 26.3m shares. Landmark rose seven cents to SDollars 1.10 in 2.05m shares on speculation that shareholders will be given an option to buy new shares in a subsidiary due to be listed this year. KUALA LUMPUR closed firmer, the composite index finishing the day up 5.23 at 603.19 in turnover of some MDollars 120m and registering a 1.3 per cent rise on the week. BANGKOK's advance continued with the SET index closing 2.61 higher at 814.39, a 1.1 per cent gain on the week, in turnover of Bt7.29bn. Bangkok Land fell Bt3 to Bt199, Bangkok Bank gained Bt8 to Bt704 and Thai Farmers Bank lost Bt2 to Bt514. MANILA rose in light trading on bargain hunting. The composite index closed up 15.10 to 1,120.17, but down 0.2 per cent over the week. Turnover was 52m pesos after 61m pesos. The rise in the US of shares in Philippine Long Distance Telephone prompted activity by local investors and it closed 10 pesos ahead at 875 pesos. TAIWAN finished higher on political concerns, but in slow trade, the weighted index closing 7.95 higher at 4,818.18, 4.2 per cent lower on the week, in thin turnover of TDollars 17.1bn, down from TDollars 19.7bn previously. Investors were sidelined by political concerns as a National Assembly session opened to amend the constitution. SEOUL saw strong gains in Hyundai subsidiaries on rumours that the Hyundai founder, Chung Ju-yung's newly-formed Unification National Party would do better than expected in the March 24 election. The composite index rose 2.72 to 615.39, fractionally higher on the week in turnover of Won372.3bn. JAKARTA closed barely changed, with the official index 0.68 higher at 277.49 as profit-taking kept some shares under pressure.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] London, May 12, IRNA -- The British Government  refused to comment Thursday on its MI6 intelligence service  bugging the Iranian Embassy in London.    A spokesman for the Foreign Office was adamant that there  was  no official response to hidden microphones being found in the  newly renovated mission, which only reopened six months ago. He  did not expect any comment would be made about the illegal  bugging.    The tight-lipped reaction was met with a news blackout in  the  British media, which even extended to the PRESS ASSOCIATION, the  UK's national news agency, not carrying the Wednesday night  report of the disclosure by Iran's president, Hashemi-Rafsanjani.    With dailies exercising the same trend and only a few  carrying extracts from foreign agencies, the suggestion was that  there had been a blanket ban imposed to hide the government's  humiliation of being caught red-handed contravening  international law.    The disclosure also reveals that the UK's recent propaganda  campaign to discredit Iran was orchestrated to cover the  embarrassment of being found spying on a foreign embassy in  London.    The Iranian Foreign Ministry disclosed that the devices were  discovered before the UK Government, assisted by the British  press, launched smears two weeks ago that claimed Iranian  intelligence had links with the IRA.    Bugging a foreign mission is nothing new to British  intelligence. Former agent, Peter Wright, has revealed in his  "Spycatcher" book that such clandestine activities extended to  even embassies of Britain's allies.    It has also been disclosed that the UK has tapped the telex  lines of IRNA in London, when the interception warrant was found  to be still in place long after the location of its bureau was  removed from Leicester Square in 1987.    All international telecommunications are commonly assumed to  be monitored by the government's communications headquarters  (GCHQ) in Cheltenham, western England.</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW GOES THE MUSIC VIDEO REVOLUTION?;  </P> <P> THEY HAVEN'T REPLACED RADIO AS A MARKETING TOOL, BUT THEY'RE STILL GAINING  MOMENTUM  </P> <P> Soon after MTV went on the air in the summer of 1981, the word was that videos  were going to revolutionize the record business.  </P> <P> The new, three-to-five-minute promotional clips would not only cause television  to replace radio as the dominant medium for selling records, but an artist's  look might become as important as the music.  </P> <P> For a while, videos seemed well on the way to fulfilling that promise. The  success in the early and mid-'80s of such colorful, video-conscious acts as  Michael Jackson, Madonna and Duran Duran did indeed suggest the important thing  in pop was as much what you heard as what you saw.  </P> <P> But what now?  </P> <P> Have videos, as some rapturously predicted, replaced radio as the chief means  of selling acts? And has appearance become as important as music as a basis for  signing acts?  </P> <P> Based on interviews with a variety of music-industry executives on the eve of  Wednesday's sixth annual MTV Video Awards ceremony at the Universal  Amphitheatre, the answer is that, yes, video is continuing to gain strength as  a marketing tool, but, no, video hasn't replaced radio as the chief means of  selling records.  </P> <P> The negative aspect of the expanded music video market is the waste factor.  More are being made but, conversely, more aren't being played.  </P> <P> "Every record company has a shelf full of videos that have never seen the light  of day and never will," pointed out Jo Bergman, vice president of Warner Bros.  video department. "The problem is that many of them should never have been made  -- for whatever reason. Some are made too late or too early (in terms of  drawing attention to the single). Some aren't very good and don't get played  for that reason. Some are made just because the artist's contract calls for a  video."  </P> <P> Added Jeff Gold, A&amp;M Records' vice president of marketing and creative  services: "In the early days of music video, things were different. The  channels were starved for programming. It was easier to get videos played. Not  as many music videos were made and the ones that were made were played  somewhere. If a label made 50 music videos in a year in those days, all of them  would be shown somewhere. Now if you make 50, maybe 15 might get aired."  </P> <P> Often a record company can justify making music videos for another reason: They  can be vital marketing tools in foreign markets, creating an image for artists  who've never appeared there. "These days companies sign artists with worldwide  potential," Bill Berger, executive vice president of Arista Records, said.  "They need videos to market artists in places like Europe and the Orient. Even  if the video doesn't get played in the United States, it might get played in  some foreign country and help sales over there."  </P> <P> All of the more than a dozen industry executives interviewed agreed that music  video is continuing to gain importance, thanks to the increased penetration by  cable TV into American homes and the rise in recent years of two additional  all-music cable channels, VH-1, which aims at an older pop-rock crowd than MTV,  and Black Entertainment Television, which specializes in soul and rap styles.  </P> <P> But, executives were quick to point out, music videos alone still cannot create  a hit record.  </P> <P> "Radio airplay is still the most important (device) for selling records," said  Bob Willcox, vice president of marketing for Columbia Records. "That's because  it still offers us the biggest audience."  </P> <P> Videos have encouraged record companies to think more visually -- though, they  insist, not at the expense of the music.  </P> <P> "Since music videos came along, the look of an act has become much more  important than it ever was," said Ron McCarrell, Capitol Records' vice  president of marketing. "But make no mistake -- music is still the most  important thing. An act can have the right look and come across great in the  videos, but if the music isn't good, the act won't get very far. You still have  to consider radio and having the right look doesn't do you any good on radio."  </P> <P> Video, in the early days of MTV, brought new excitement to the record industry.  After passing the $4-billion-a-year mark in sales in the late '70s, the  industry had been in a serious slump, with sales falling about $500,000,000  between 1978 and 1979.  </P> <P> The drop-off, industry observers now believe, was due to more than just general  problems with the economy. Teen-agers, long the most active buying group,  seemed alienated. They had burned out on disco and were having trouble finding  new heroes as radio stations tended to stay with veteran rockers that the kids  found tame and boring.  </P> <P> But video provided these teens with a new wave of heroes. MTV was their own  private world. Parents grumbled about videos, dismissing them as silly gimmicks  to sell records. They couldn't believe that anyone could sit in their rooms  watching those videos all day and night on MTV -- as their kids were doing.  </P> <P> Eventually, however, many adults became converts. The audience for videos  expanded, encouraging record companies to begin making them for artists in  other genres -- not just for teen-oriented music. This adult interest also led  to the formation of the additional cable music channels.  </P> <P> In July, according to Nielsen Media Research figures, 56.4% of the nation's TV  households were connected to cable, as opposed to 39.3% in 1983. MTV is still  the cable-music-channel champ, reaching 47 million homes -- up from just 20  million homes five years ago.  </P> <P> VH-1 -- owned by MTV Networks, also the parent company of MTV -- claims it can  be seen in 34 million cable homes, up from just 14 million homes three years  ago. BET, which has steadily increased in stature and prominence in the last  few years, is in 23 million homes.  </P> <P> While MTV is stronger than ever, it's not what it used to be. Instead of simply  playing videos all day and night, MTV now sees itself as an entertainment  network, devoting much of its time to a variety of programming, including the  "Remote Control" game show, a comedy show and programs like "Yo! MTV Raps" and  "Headbangers Ball," which spotlight certain genres.  </P> <P> Still, MTV continues to be the most powerful cable music channel, especially  for the rock audience. The competition -- VH-1 and BET -- pick up where MTV  leaves off.  </P> <P> Explained Jeff Rowe, VH-1's vice president of programming: "We program what's  hip for the (over 25) group, the best of Top 40, the best of AOR  (album-oriented rock). This audience grew up on rock 'n' roll but is too old  for what's being played on MTV. Their tastes have changed somewhat but they're  used to watching music clips -- so they tune in VH-1."  </P> <P> Black artists too have benefited from the changes in the music-video scene.  </P> <P> "Three years ago there was no place for black artists on video," said Capitol's  McCarrell. "It was tougher to justify a video for a black artist. But now more  black videos are being made since there's an outlet for them -- an outlet that  gets results."  </P> <P> These added forums have encouraged record companies to make videos for more  artists than in the past.  </P> <P> MTV's statistics show the significant increase in the number of music clips  since the early '80s. In May, 1982, music videos were made to promote 28 of the  singles in the Top 100 songs on the Billboard sales chart in 1982. During a  recent week, all but three of the Top 100 singles had accompanying videos.  </P> <P> Another indication of the rise in clip productivity -- the number of music  videos made -- is how many are submitted to MTV. "The difference between now  and years ago is staggering," said Lee Masters, MTV's executive vice president  and general manager. "In the early '80s we used to screen five or six a week.  Now we're getting 30 to 40 a week, sometimes more."  </P> <P> For the record companies, there's a downside to all this -- the costs of making  videos are way up. It's an expense the companies share with the artists.  </P> <P> McCarrell explained how the system works: "The companies front the costs of the  videos in nearly all cases. If the artist winds up selling enough records to  make a profit, the record company can recoup some of that expense -- maybe as  much as half. But the deals vary with the artists."  </P> <P> Arista's Berger pointed out that most videos now cost between $50,000 and  $125,000, while the average cost of a video in the early '80s was about  $25,000.  </P> <P> Lamented McCarrell: "There was a time when you might do two videos for $18,000.  That's out of the question now. Those bargain days are long gone."  </P> <P> Music videos, the executives pointed out, can create an excitement and a  mystique about an artist like nothing else can. Look at what they did for  Michael Jackson, enhancing his stardom by magnifying his image and blanketing  the country with it.  </P> <P> Music videos can also expand an artist's audience by reaching fans who don't go  to concerts or kids in out of the way places who don't have easy access to  major concerts.  </P> <P> Alan Niven, manager of Guns N' Roses, the hottest new hard-rock band in years,  noted:  </P> <P> "When you talk to kids out there in certain parts of the country, they'll tell  you their total exposure to music is watching MTV. For a band like Guns N'  Roses, that MTV audience is the core audience. Music videos expose kids to a  band and inspire them to buy records by creating visual excitement. Without  music videos, there's a lot of fans who might not be turned on to Guns N'  Roses."  </P> <P> While music videos can be influential in all areas of pop, they seem to have  the most impact in the areas of hard rock/heavy metal and rap.  </P> <P> Columbia's Willcox said videos are important in both of these areas because MTV  often leads the way by playing videos of singles even before the records are  played on radio. That early TV video exposure, in fact, can in some cases  influence what's eventually played on the radio.  </P> <P> In the last year, MTV has helped break Living Colour -- a black rock band whose  album, "Vivid," started very slowly until it began getting the TV exposure, and  Winger, the hot new metal band. Poison and Great White, two other metal bands,  also got massive boosts from music videos.  </P> <P> Once an underground phenomenon, rap has become increasingly mainstream, partly  thanks to video exposure on MTV and BET. Tone Loc and D.J. Jazzy Jeff and the  Fresh Prince are among the rappers who have benefited from video airplay. In  addition to black youngsters, rap appeals to white hard-rock and metal fans who  are attracted to its raunchy, rebellious qualities.  </P> <P> "Music videos are now indispensable to rap," Arista's Berger explained. "That  MTV show ('Yo! MTV Raps') has really helped. About 10 or 12 months ago, you  might not have made a rap video because it didn't seem necessary. Now, we've  seen the impact a rap video can have on both sales and image. If you have the  budget, you make the rap video. It can have a big effect on that young target  audience -- both black and white -- that's into rap."  </P> <P> What's next for music videos?  </P> <P> Possibly the emergence of another music channel or two to expand the market  even further. Also, record companies are so desperate for alternatives to the  main music channels that they'll probably develop some new outlets of their  own. But the music video, some executives speculate, may not be invincible.  </P> <P> "Maybe something that hasn't been developed yet will replace music videos in  the next decade," Warner Brothers' Bergman speculated. "Technology is changing  things so fast. VCRs and CDs and music videos came about in this decade. The  way things have been changing, if something came along and replaced music  videos I don't think many people would be surprised."  </P></p>

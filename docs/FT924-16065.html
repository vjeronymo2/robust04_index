			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Gould attacks housing policy LABOUR turned up the rhetoric in its denunciation of government housing policy yesterday, as Mr Bryan Gould made his farewell address from the conference platform. Mr Gould appealed passionately to the government to allow local councils to use billions of pounds of capital receipts in their possession to build council houses. 'This is a problem literally on our own doorstep which we can solve if we have the political will to do so,' he said. Mr Gould received a warm reception, just 48 hours after learning he had been voted off the national executive committee, Labour's ruling body. The former shadow heritage secretary also indicated that he felt Labour could have made more of housing as an issue in the general election campaign. 'In my view, it was the issue on which the Tories were most vulnerable,' he said. The 'mess' the government had made of housing was responsible for much 'sheer unadulterated personal misery'. Mr Gould was joined by Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, who also hit out at Conservative housing policies. What was needed was a 'relentless crusade' to stand up for the homeless and ill-housed, he said. The council tax - due to be introduced next year - would prove to be 'almost as great a fiasco' as its predecessor, the poll tax. Earlier, Mr Straw had claimed that of Pounds 6.5bn in local-authority hands from the sale of council homes an 'astonishing' Pounds 5.1bn had been frozen by Conservative legislation and could not be spent on housing investment. Delegates backed a broad motion condemning government housing policy across the board and setting out a blueprint of measures for Labour, including a mortgage rescue scheme and steps to ensure that housing associations enjoyed similar rights to council tenants. They also urged the NEC to 'organise a vigorous, effective and forceful campaign against implementation of the council tax'. In a debate on Labour's organisation in rural constituencies, the leadership was urged to regard forthcoming boundary changes - which are expected to favour the Conservatives - as an incentive to step up its efforts in such seats. For years, prominent Labour figures had been 'as rare in rural areas as farmers voting Labour', according to one speaker. Conference approved a motion noting with concern 'the negative attitude of the leadership, the national executive committee and the party organisation towards rural voters and non-key seats in the run-up to and during the general election'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Han Zhenjun (7281 2182 6511)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 5 Apr (XINHUA) -- This reporter has  learned from the relevant department of the Chinese Space  Technology Research Academy that the "Shijian [Practice] No. 4"  space probe satellite, launched by China earlier, has been  running safely in its fixed orbit for two months. All  logistical systems on the satellite have been operating  normally, and all payloads for probing the space environment and  studying environmental effects have obtained important data.  Currently, all instruments inside the satellite are  continuously transmitted probing data to the ground.    "Shijian No. 4," which was developed by the China Space  Designing Institute's Beijing Spacecraft General Designing  Department, was launched to its predetermined orbit with a  Changzheng [Long March] No. 3 rocket carrier on 8 February.  After two months of tests in space, instruments inside the  satellites have functioned normally and have obtained a series  of useful reference materials. Through tests under adverse  conditions in synchronous orbit for 20 days, the original data  put into the "ultraviolet ray erasable and programmable read  only memory," an instrument for measuring single particle  effects in space, are totally wiped out by the secondary  radiation caused by high-energy particles in space. After  functioning for 19 days, the central processing unit's dynamic  single particle monitor arrested a serious lock-in effect from  an instrument inside the satellite. The "lock-in effect" caused  an "overflow protection" phenomenon in the secondary power  supply system inside the satellite. After the ground command  rebooted the instruments, they resumed normal functioning.    It is understood that the preliminary results obtained from  the current space probe can give technical explanations for  computer breakdowns that occurred previously in satellites. The  contingency measures taken by the "Shijian No. 4" under special  circumstances will provide invaluable experiences for improving  satellite computers' adaptability to the space environment.    According to a briefing, since 26 March the "Shijian No. 4"  flight control group and the Xian Satellite Monitoring and  Control Center have worked intensively for more than a week and  used remote-control command to successfully switch the power  supply system inside the satellite from nickel-cadmium to  nickel-hydrogen accumulators. Used by China for the first time  in spacecraft, the nickel-hydrogen accumulator is a kind of  space energy with great potential.</p>

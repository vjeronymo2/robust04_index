			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: James Capel forms South Africa link International securities house James Capel and South African stockbrokers Simpson McKie have announced plans to form a new company, Simpson McKie James Capel, to be responsible for the marketing of South African securities through James Capel offices worldwide. Once the necessary amendments to South African securities law are made, expected by April 1995, a James Capel affiliate will purchase 30 per cent of Simpson McKie. It plans ultimately to purchase a further 21 per cent when further legislation permits. The value of the transaction has not been released. All 16 current directors of Simpson McKie will be on the new board while James Capel will nominate a further three. Mr Duncan Agar, James Capel international director, said the transaction gave James Capel direct access to the South African market. According to Mr Dixie Strong, Simpson McKie chief executive, his firm's expertise would be able to provide the new company with top quality South African research, while the James Capel link would provide it with an established global marketing network.</p>

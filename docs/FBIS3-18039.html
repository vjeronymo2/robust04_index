As the  3d Corps, which is responsible for the Somalia units, stated in  Koblenz on Monday [28 February], the last FRG soldier left the  East African city. There is no more material from the German  Armed Forces in the desert city and the tent city has been  completely dismantled.    The Bundeswehr mission started last May. In August, 1,700  German soldiers were operational. The main task for the  Germans, to provide logistical supply for an Indian brigade,  could never be fulfilled because the Indians were not stationed  in the Beledweyne area. Hence, the Bundeswehr contingent  concentrated on humanitarian aid for the population of  Beledweyne and the neighborhood. The troops built schools and  dams and dug wells.    A spokesman for the 3d Corps added that the last convoy is  on  its way to the Somali capital Mogadishu, some 370 km from  Beledweyne. There have been no incidents. In Mogadishu, the  soldiers are accommodated in a provisional camp. From there  they are shipped by German Navy ships to the Kenyan city of  Mombasa. Some of them will return to Germany from Mombasa as  early as this Tuesday. The return of the last 250 Bundeswehr  soldiers is scheduled for 23 March.</p>

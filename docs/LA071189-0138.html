			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ESTRADA KEEPS FEATHERWEIGHT TITLE  </P> <P> Juan Jose Estrada of Mexico retained his World Boxing Assn. junior  featherweight title here Monday night with a unanimous 12-round decision over  Colombian Luis Mendoza.  </P> <P> Estrada was always in control, despite a dangerous opponent who was quick and  showed that he had a powerful punch. But Estrada was in better physical shape  and took the fight to the Colombian.  </P> <P> Mendoza landed punches repeatedly to the face of the champion, but the  difference between them was reflected in the verdict. The three judges all  scored it 117-112 to Estrada.  </P> <P> This was Estrada's third successful defense of the title he won on May 2, 1988,  when he beat Bernardo Pinango of Venezuela.  </P></p>

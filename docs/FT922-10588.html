			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (8): New ways to ease stress  -The psychological impact of relocation TODAY it is widely recognised that moving home can lead a significant levels of stress. But planners in the 1950s and '60s were nevertheless surprised that so many former slum-dwellers pined for their old homes after they had been relocated to improved housing. 'New town blues' characterised many relocated young families at that time, although there was plenty of historical evidence of homesickness in other situations where people were uprooted - for example, in the 17th century, migrants and soldiers' described maladie du pays, a painful longing to return home. Furthermore, Austrian doctors in the First World War found that homesickness was a significant factor in cases of desertion. Psychologist Shirley Fisher of Strathclyde University has recently investigated severe instances of homesickness which can prevent students finishing their studies. Typical signs of severe homesickness are passivity, depressed moods and difficulties in concentration. Thoughts of home or memories of years spent elsewhere intrude persistently into consciousness. Fisher found that the tendency to habitually use fantasies about happy times elsewhere, in order to help overcome present boredom or loneliness, can undermine a person's capacity to improve their present situation. Regional and international relocation for work reasons will often involve a change for entire families. Researchers and experienced management psychologists indicate that the 'family' is a significant cause of assignments coming to an end prematurely. Conversely, a poorly-planned relocation can be a strong contributor to family stress and sometimes even to its break-up. An increasing level of expertise - ranging from advice on housing and local educational facilities to legal issues and counselling - is now available from the larger business relocation agencies. These facilities help many families avoid the stress in moving. For example, when Nissan European Technology Centre planned their move from Sunderland to Cranfield in 1991, they sought out a relocation company which would address the stress issues. Nissan chose Blackhorse Relocation Relocation Services, an offshoot of Lloyds Bank's Black Horse estate agencies, because of its experience in preparing people for such life changes. The question of the 'trailing partner' (see page three) is receiving more attention in relocations. In a recent study, Miriam Smith of Organisation Resources Counsellors found that lack of foresight and agreement about what the relocation is going to entail for the partner or spouse, can lead to serious conflict later, when it may not be easily resolvable. Miriam Smith found that relatively few companies were offering planning and support in this area, although BP is an exception and an acknowledged pioneer in this field. A little imagination goes a long way in helping husbands and wives adjust to a new location. For example, in Cleveland, a consortium of companies has a joint clearing house for job vacancies and partners' career details. International relocations involve the additional problems of cross-cultural adjustment. Premature terminations of such postings are very costly in both human and financial terms. Most people experience an initial 'honeymoon' period of great interest and excitement, but as time passes, the 'loss' of old friends and activities, together with new local frustrations, create feelings of disappointment and doubt as to whether 'the big move' was really worthwhile. Personal suitability for making a success of international relocations requires maturity, social skills and appropriate cross-cultural awareness. Supportive social networks will then grow and foster both self-development and increase cultural learning. These are the benefits for those who make the best of their international assignments. There are often other problems for families who relocate abroad, and then move back to their original base, since 'repatriation' is not always easy. Expatriates, who were known historically as 'exiles,' return to find that they have missed significant developments in the lives of friends and family. Having not shared in these events, former expatriates often report a feeling of dislocation from the lives of their old friends. Not everyone will make a success of relocation, so it is worthwhile making early evaluations and preparation. We are talking here of an individual's qualities, rather than qualifications. Many relocation agencies have developed an awareness that husbands and wives are not always 'on the same wavelength' about an intended move. According to Carla Roundell-Greene of People and Property, it is important to understand the social implications of moving to particular locations in order to satisfy a particular housing need. And how far can a prosperous, middle-aged couple with adolescent children sustain initiatives to build social networks, when for a decade or more they have enjoyed easy reciprocity with long-established friends and close relations? Do they want to live within a corporate neighbourhood with ready-made colleague/friends, - or as far from that as possible? Providing realistic job/relocation previews is a wise course. Europeans posted to busy and exotic locations - such as Hong Kong or Tokyo - have sometimes suffered panic attacks in such densely populated and unfamiliar urban environments. Evaluating employees for likely success for an overseas posting can save a lot of grief. Businesses with North American connections such as RHR International - the firm of consulting psychologists - and PRlcoa Relocation Management, a subsidiary of Prudential of America, which also offers psychological advisory services, are aware of the legal and political sensitivities of probing into employees' private lives. They offer the family an opportunity to review their position within a confidential counselling session, so that the family itself raises the crucial issues. The outcome of this, according to Robert Brown, director of consulting at PRlcoa, is that clear suitability may or may not be established, but the particular training or support systems which will be needed to make a success can be undertaken. As an aid to this, Brown uses a validated psychometric instrument, the 'overseas assignment inventory.' He is careful not to allow this to be used as a 'Go' - 'don't go' flag, but rather to help the employee, the family and the employer see how a good judgment can be made in complex circumstances. Hambro Countrywide Relocation have now added a 24-hour 'stress counselling service' to its relocation package for corporate clients. Occupational psychologist Dr Tony Munton, a research fellow with the Medical Research Council, says that 'people's attitude to the whole relocation operation in influenced by the personal touch. 'However generous the financial package, the employee will not be grateful unless he is helped to sort out the problems of new schools for children, a job for the spouse and the possible pyschological fall-out from the stress of the move.' The writer is a consulting psychologist with RHR International.</p>

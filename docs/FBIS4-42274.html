			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--Record high interest rates offered on  T-bills by the cash-starved Treasury have given a boost to the  Turkish lira but have angered several businessmen who are  already fighting for survival due to surging lending rates.    On Friday [27 May], the third trading session after the  religious holiday, the Turkish lira [TL] firmed to 31,000  against the U.S. dollar, after Thursday's close of 32,000. It  was traded at 33,000 on Wednesday.    The lira has recovered by 22.5 percent since April 7 when  the  lira/dollar parity peaked at 40,000. Its losses against the  dollar have amounted to 82.3 percent this year.    Thousands of individuals lined up in front of bank branches  from 4 a.m. Thursday to buy three-month government papers  carrying an annual compound rate of 406 percent.    The three-month net rate on the same Treasury bills was an  all-time high 50 percent, compared with only 32.5 percent in the  previous auction.    All of the TL20 trillion papers were sold out by 2.30 p.m.  on  Friday, Treasury sources said.    The Treasury will make payments worth TL58 trillion during  June to finance domestic debt repayments and public sector  salaries.    In 31 different auctions, it has raised a total of TL34.511  trillion this year, but cancelled nine auctions.    Following a government decision to cover all savings  deposits  under full state insurance, the banks have tended to raise both  deposit and lending rates.    Presently, annual rates on three-month, six-month, and  one-year accounts range from 135 to 160 percent.    Experts say the banks have been flooded with fresh funds  after the decision.    "After the government gave assurances on savings deposits,  the deposit volume has doubled," said Ismet Alver, general  manager of Tekstilbank.    Bankers said high rates will be maintained as long as the  Treasury remains short of cash and the monetary authorities  insist on defending the national currency with the interest  instrument.    "We shall work with high rates for some time to come.  Otherwise, money will flow into foreign currencies, pushing up  the exchange rates," said Hamit Belli, board chairman and chief  executive officer at the private-owned Turkish Bank. During a  summit Thursday, held under the auspices of the Turkish Banks  Association, the banks did not reach a gentlemen's agreement on  interest rates.    "We postponed talks to an unknown date. There was no  agreement as to what the interest rate ceiling should be," said  one banker who attended the summit.    Businessmen are worried.    "The latest rates on Treasury bills are incredible and may  create endless fear. This will worsen the economic crisis,"  said a statement from Atalay Sahinoglu, chairman of the Istanbul  Chamber of Commerce (ITO).    He pointed out that the Treasury came forward with the 400  percent interest rate exactly on the day when the bankers had  gathered to discuss a reduction in interest rates. "This is  ignorance," Sahinoglu said.    There were reports from the Istanbul Chamber of Industry  that  capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry dived from  82.5 percent in April 1993 to 69.9 percent in April this year.</p>

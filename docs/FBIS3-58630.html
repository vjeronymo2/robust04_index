			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michael Voelker: "`NS' Letter Deplores </F> `Genocide'"]    [Text] Vienna -- A "Self-Defense Community of Police  Officers" [Notwehrgemeinschaft der Sicherheitswachebeamten],  which uses the initials "NS" is causing a stir among the Vienna  police. In a "Dear Colleagues" letter, the "infiltration of our  state leadership by Jewish circles" is deplored.    The letter, seen at nearly all Vienna police stations and  also found at external units, including the Security Alert  Department, lists eight persons -- partly indicating their  addresses -- who participated in talks on amending the  "Stalinist" law banning neo-Nazi activities.    The names include Simon Wiesenthal, "correct name: Szymon  Wizenthal, reparation fraud," and the lawyers Gabriel Lansky and  Georg Zanger, both described as "Jews, communists, freemasons,  members of the Udo Proksch gang [Vienna businessman who was  sentenced for causing the death of six persons], probably KGB  and Mosad agents." Zanger has now brought charges against  unknown perpetrators, and he wants to support the proceedings as  a private person.    According to the Self-Defense Community, the Austrian  Government consists "only of freemasons and partly of Jews or of  persons with Jewish ancestry (Education Minister Scholten, Vice  Chancellor Erhard Busek, Social Affairs Minister Hesoun,  Transportation Minister Klima, Finance Minister Lacina)."  Austria's "official immigration policy" leads to the  "destruction of the racial nature of the people through the  replacement of natives by foreigners, and through the settlement  of members of other races." Thus, the government is "guilty of  genocide." The "admission of foreigners and the destruction of  closed settlement areas of native (German) population" is "high  treason."    The letter refers to, among other things, the "Illustrated  Review of the Austrian Federal Police" and a "secret file of the  Vienna Police" and also deplores the fate of Gottfried Kuessel  and Guenter Reinthaler.    A "statement" that ends with "yours sincerely, your  Self-Defense Community of Police Officers (NS)," announces that  the politicians will no longer be protected. "Our professional  honor and conviction as representatives of law and order -- and  not of `legal injustice' -- commands us to serve the people."  Thus, the "NS" considers itself "unable to guarantee the  security of politicians responsible for the replacement of  natives because they have lost their right to protection through  their criminal actions."</p>

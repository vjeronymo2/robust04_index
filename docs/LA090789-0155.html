			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> REGION'S FOOTBALL TEAMS HAVE SEEN HIGH TURNOVER  </P> <P> The coaching turnover trend continues at a high rate in Southeast/Long  Beach-area high schools this fall. One-third of the area's 39 head coaching  positions have been vacated since last year. In the past six years, 69 jobs  have changed hands.  </P> <P> Some of the more interesting changes for 1989:  </P> <P> * Bellflower High will not have a head coach.  </P> <P> * Artesia's Norm Flowers has the head job after sharing it last season.  </P> <P> * Three head coaches in other sports have been given extra duties as football  coaches.  </P> <P> * Wayne Manzo jumps from Cerritos to La Serna.  </P> <P> Bellflower thought it had solved its vacancy when it hired Jim Wright from a  high school in Arizona. But Wright had second thoughts. Football practice  opened without a coach, and school officials now say the Bucs will be handled  by three assistants.  </P> <P> Tom Tereschuk (baseball) of California, Mark Rose (track) of Lakewood and  Harold Eggers (boys volleyball) of Cerritos have all been appointed to  additional roles as head football coaches.  </P> <P> The naming of Flowers at Artesia is the third coaching change in three seasons  for the Pioneers.  </P> <P> Manzo joins former Cerritos baseball coach Vern Brock at La Serna. Brock is the  school's athletic director and baseball coach.  </P> <P> Two trends remain fairly constant: St. Anthony has a new coach (Ralph Godfrey)  for the seventh time this decade. Ken Davis, dean of area coaches, begins his  18th season at Schurr.  </P> <P> The number of coaching changes in the Southeast/Long Beach area is higher than  in other areas of Southern California. Orange County, which has 28 schools,  loses five to seven coaches a season, most from firings, according to figures  compiled by The Times. This fall eight new coaches debut in the San Fernando  Valley, which has about 50 schools. In other areas the turnover rate averages  about 10%.  </P> <P> Coaches in the Long Beach/Southeast area often cite burnout, the desire to move  on to more prestigious positions, long hours and substandard pay as reasons for  leaving.  </P> <P> COACHING CHANGES  </P> <P> High School: New Coach  </P> <P> Lakewood: Mark Rose  </P> <P> Cerritos: Harold Eggers  </P> <P> Downey: Phil Dunaway  </P> <P> Artesia: * Norm Flowers  </P> <P> Bellflower: ** None  </P> <P> Norwalk: Ken Mardis  </P> <P> California: Tom Tereschuk  </P> <P> La Serna: Wayne Manzo  </P> <P> Leffingwell Chr: John Shepperd  </P> <P> Pioneer Bapt: Manuel Cortez  </P> <P> St John Bosco: Gabe Soumakian  </P> <P> Pius X: Mike Gallegoes  </P> <P> St Anthony: Ralph Godfrey  </P> <P> * Co-head coach in l988  </P> <P> ** Hired Jim Wright, who resigned late last month.

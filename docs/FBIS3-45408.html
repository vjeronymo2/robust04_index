At the meeting, the two sides stressed the need to seriously  honour the provisional agreement which was signed (by Vietnam  and China) on Nov. 7, 1991, control the border area basing on  the status quo at the time of signing the above-said agreement  without any artificial actions made in order to change the  border situation, promote the opening of the official border  gates agreed by the two sides and try to restore order and law  in trading and travelling across the common border.    Regarding problems happening in the border area, both sides  had the same view that the local authorities and offices  concerned of Vietnam and China should meet for peaceful  negotiations to settle them properly and at the same time report  them to their respective governments.    The two sides agreed to extend the provisional agreement for  another two years.    On Jan. 15, the Vietnamese expert delegation was received by  Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan.</p>

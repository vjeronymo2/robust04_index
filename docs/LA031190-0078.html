			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: JACK KEMP LINED UP AS SPEAKER  </P> <P> Pepperdine Associates, the university's most prestigious support group, scored  a coup for its annual black-tie dinner March 22 at the Biltmore. Jack F. Kemp,  U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, will speak. Lodwrick M. Cook  is dinner chairman.  </P> <P> CHEERS: Partisan supporters of the Spotlight Awards at the Music Center were  anything but reserved. Not only did Doc Severinsen and his "Tonight Show" band  raise decibels, but the youthful audience unabashedly cheered favorite  competitors. The Spotlight Awards, presented through a grant from Pacific  Telesis, honor Southern California's finest young performers.  </P> <P> Actor Gregory Harrison kept a cute commentary going as awards went to singer  Lynette Tapia, pianists Anders Martinson and Wendy Chen, violinist Michelle  Kim, dancer Arthur Leroy Sabb and the drama teams of Jeff DiFranco and Angela  Randall Hoover and Chris DuVal and Jeremy Johnson. Winners received $40,000 in  scholarships, then attended the gala dinner in the Grand Hall planned by Peggy  Parker, Fred Roberts and Joni Smith.  </P> <P> Joni Smith had special toasts for Spotlight's executive producers, Walter E.  Grauman and Peggy Parker, now Mr. and Mrs. The couple, Smith noted, were  married by Judge Matt Byrne "somewhere between revising the program and doing  the seating for this party -- between 11:15 a.m. and 2 p.m."  </P> <P> Everyone wanted to speak to John Frohnmayer, chairman of the National Endowment  for the Arts. He was widely feted, breakfast to dinner, last week. The  festivities included a California Arts Council breakfast at City Club for heads  of arts organizations, the same day Frohnmayer spoke to Town Hall.  </P> <P> NICEST KUDOS: To the Weingart Foundation, donating $3 million to Childrens  Hospital of Los Angeles to help construct the Weingart Center for Imaging and  Diagnosis (single largest gift in the hospital's history). . . .  </P> <P> To Fred L. Hartley, chairman emeritus of Unocal, receiving the California  Museum of Science and Industry Award of Excellence from the Advisory Board. . .  .  </P> <P> To retired Gen. William Lyon, receiving the Asa V. Call Achievement Award at  the USC General Alumni Assn. salute. . . .  </P> <P> To Richard Fiedler, new chairman of California Music Theatre . . . .  </P> <P> To the Merchant's Club for City of Hope, announcing at the Regal Ball that it  has raised $2.2 million in 57 years.  </P> <P> ON TOES: Beautiful, blond June Haver MacMurray was so elated she was in the  clouds on stage with star Andy Williams (in his silver shoes and sparkling  shirt) and celebrity host Robert Wagner.  </P> <P> That's because the Friends of Childhelp announced at its "Evening of Elegance"  at the Beverly Hilton net proceeds of $500,000 for Childhelp National Toll-Free  Hotline (800) 4-A-CHILD. Thanks go to angels: Wearing halos were Billie Ruth  Galef, who donated $100,000 for new roofs for Childhelp USA Village in  Beaumont; Hal and Cynthia Gershman, who gave $50,000 to underwrite the party;  Gerber baby food, a $75,000 donation; and co-chairman Frances Franklin.  </P> <P> In the surprise of the night, Jimmy Stewart announced the winners of the  donated classic BMW -- Bob and Dolores Hope. They had bought five tickets for  $1,000 each. When Andy Williams sang "Dear Heart," Childhelp founders Yvonne  Fedderson and Sara O'Meara Sigholtz beamed.  </P> <P> THE TOWN: Distinguished donors -- those who have pledged $100,000 to $1 million  to the Music Center United Fund during the past year -- drew praise at a Music  Center party. Bert and Corina Greynald's $1-million gift makes them grand  patrons. Other patrons in attendance included Ted and Rhonda Fleming Mann and  Michael and Suzanne Tennenbaum. . . .  </P> <P> Barbara Nyden Rodstein, who parlayed in six years a $5,000 investment into  annual sales of $25 million (she's owner of Harden Industries), will be named  Woman Business Owner of the Year by the National Assn. of Women Business Owners  on Tuesday at the Beverly Wilshire. . . .  </P> <P> Stephen D. Gavin was in the spotlight when Skid Row Development Corp. hosted  its reception gala to benefit Transition House for the homeless at the Los  Angeles Athletic Club.  </P> <P> CIRCLE RED: The Hollywood Charity Horse Show at the Equestrian Center of Los  Angeles Tuesday through Saturday will benefit a different charity each night.  Charities include Make-A-Wish Foundation, California Special Olympics, Ahead  With Horses, the Jeffrey Foundation, Oralingua School and Friends of Child  Advocates. American Saddlebred and hackney riders will compete for $85,000. . .  .  </P> <P> The Irene Dunne Guild of Saint John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa  Monica hosts "An Evening at Butterfield &amp; Butterfield" Thursday at the  gallery, 7601 Sunset Blvd. Carolyn M. Mullaney and Colleen O'Beirne Brydon are  co-chairs. . . .  </P> <P> Harvard School headmaster Tom Hudnut, who is known to have a silver tongue,  presides over the parent association's Spring Roundup dinner-dance Saturday.  Co-chairs are Pat Rauth and Caryn Tebbe. Last year's event raised $135,000.  </P> <P> DESERT: Washington's Rose Narva (who has managed the Jefferson and Hay Adams  hotels) is negotiating to buy the Gene Autry Hotel in Palm Springs, and it was  she who whirled the red-haired Georgette Mossbacher around the grounds on a  golf cart while Georgette's husband, Secretary of Commerce Robert Mossbacher,  was being interviewed by media. . . .  </P> <P> Don and Judy Tallarico showcased their jewels for the Vintage Chrysler  Invitational Ladies Luncheon and fashion show headed by Lois Horvitz and Carol  Carr.  </P></p>

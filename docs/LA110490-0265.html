			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROFILE;  </P> <P> THE PATRIARCH OF 'PARENTHOOD'  </P> <P> Actor William Windom strolls into the room sporting an Irish blackthorn walking  stick, a subtle touch that lends a theatrical flair to his entrance.  </P> <P> Windom, the curmudgeonly grandfather in NBC's "Parenthood," is adept at  gestures that get him noticed in supporting roles. Until this season he played  Dr. Seth Hazlitt on CBS' "Murder, She Wrote."  </P> <P> He describes his "Parenthood character, Frank Buckman, as "kind of a pain in  the butt," adding, "So am I."  </P> <P> "Frank's resigned to being the elder statesman of the family," Windom said.  "He's old Mr. Reliable without a lot of laughs. He doesn't expect a lot of  people, and he's seldom disappointed."  </P> <P> Windom's character has a touchy relationship with one of his sons, played by Ed  Begley Jr.  </P> <P> "There's a bit of warfare there," he said. "If you can combine it with a hug  now and then, it's great."  </P> <P> Windom takes over the "Parenthood" role played in the hit movie by a longtime  associate and former nextdoor neighbor, Jason Robards.  </P> <P> "He was Doc Holliday in 'Hour of the Gun,' and I was one of the henchmen,"  Windom recalled.  </P> <P> Windom, who had spent 15 years on Broadway appearing in 24 plays, got one of  his biggest acting challenges in his 1962 film debut. He shared courtroom  scenes with Gregory Peck in the Academy Award-winning "To Kill a Mockingbird."  </P> <P> "I was the district attorney, and he was the defense attorney," he said. "I  didn't have many lines. I had to keep making up all kinds of business. I'd have  my tie on funny, chew on a pencil, throw my leg over a chair."  </P> <P> In the 1960s, Windom moved to Los Angeles to concentrate on movies and  television. In his first TV series, "The Farmers's Daughter," he was the  congressman and romantic interest for Inger Stevens.  </P> <P> In his second, "My World and Welcome To It," he won a 1970 Emmy as best actor  in a comedy series -- after the show had been canceled. His role was loosely  based on the works of writer-cartoonist James Thurber. Since 1972, the actor  has done four one-man shows on Thurber material; he is currently at the  Westwood Playhouse Tuesday-Nov. 11.  </P> <P> He also has added World War II correspondent Ernie Pyle to his repertoire. He  will perform "Ernie Pyle" Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m. at Pasadena's Ambassador  Auditorium.  </P> <P> "I was looking around for another one-man show," said Windom, who was with the  82nd Airborne in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge. "I didn't want to do  George Washington or Mark Twain. I thought of something from World War II. I  was going to do fiction, until I discovered Pyle. I also found some of his  civilian writing. He was a very sensitive human being, like Thurber.  </P> <P> "I still do (the Pyle show) on weekends. It keeps the stage in me alive. The  stage makes me more confident to do movies and television. And movies and  television help you sell more tickets."  </P> <P> Windom recently was in St. Joseph, Mo., to film "Back To Hannibal: The Return  of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn," now airing on the Disney Channel.  </P> <P> In the movie, Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, now grown up, return to defend  their friend Jim on a murder charge. Windom plays Judge Thatcher, Becky  Thatcher's father.  </P> <P> "We couldn't film in Hannibal because the city's too built up," he said.  </P> <P> Born in New York City, Windom began acting in military school at the age of 14.  </P> <P> "I was the ingenue (in one of the school's plays) since it was an all-boys  school," he said. "My mother came backstage afterward, and she hadn't realized  I was actually in it. I held up the brassiere under her nose. She said, 'You  know, I looked at that girl."'  </P> <P> The actor mused that he didn't learn of his most notable academic achievement  until 10 years ago, during a lunch with actress Margaret Hamilton, who played  the villain in "The Wizard of Oz."  </P> <P> "She said something about Rye, New York, and I said I had gone to kindergarten  at the Rye Country Day School," Windom recalled. "She said she had taught  there. We compared notes and it turned out I had been in her class. I started  my education under the Wicked Witch of the West."  </P> <P>  "Parenthood" airs Saturdays at 8 p.m. on NBC. "Back to Hannibal: The Return of  Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn" airs Thursday at 8 p.m. and 1 a.. early Friday  on the Disney Channel.  </P> <P>  For ticket information on Windom's "Thurber," call the Westwood Playhouse at  213 -- 208-5454 and for "Ernie Pyle," call the Ambassador Auditorium at 818 --  304-6161.  </P> <P> </P></p>

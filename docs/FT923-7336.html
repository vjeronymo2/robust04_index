			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Bundesbank attacks Bonn's policies THE Bundesbank is intensifying its attack on the Bonn government's economic policies in east Germany, claiming that large subsidies east of the Elbe are stoking inflation. In its August monthly report, published today, the independent German central bank urges a 'step by step' reduction of subsidies for investment in the east. Attempting to shift part of the responsibility to the government for last month's  3/4 percentage point rise in the discount rate, the Bundesbank says eastern subsidies are blunting the effects of its monetary policy. 'The east German economy is almost totally shielded from the effects of interest rate policy,' the report says. 'This impairs the efficacy of monetary policy instruments and the monetary braking distance becomes longer.' Investment incentives are in any case no panacea for east Germany's economic problems, the Bundesbank argues. Recovery in the east is not linked simply to the sheer volume of investment, the bank argues, but to the quality of investments and their commercial viability. 'The more an investment decision is distorted or eliminated,' the central bank says, 'the greater the danger of misinvestment and at the same time the waste of already scarce resources.' The attack on the subsidies is consistent with the Bundesbank's opposition to excessive spending. Net transfers from the western part of Germany to the east are likely to amount to DM143bn (Pounds 50.7bn) this year, falling to DM131bn in 1993. The broadside criticism also reflects the bank's general frustration that easy corporate access to borrowing for eastern investments is lowering the efficacy of its anti-inflation strategy. Because of the considerable impact of government-stimulated borrowing on monetary growth, the bank argues, interest rates have to be higher to achieve the same effect. This is especially noticeable now when it is in the interests of the economy as a whole to promote stability-orientated monetary policy. Bundesbank defends rate increase, Page 2</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUDGED NUMBERS, SMUDGED IDEALS;  </P> <P> CORRUPTION: WHEN A CONTRACTOR LIKE NORTHROP CHEATS ON NATIONAL DEFENSE, WE KNOW  WHERE OUR REAL ENEMY IS.  </P> <P> This is one of the jokes I heard last week in Buenos Aires while discussing the  problems of South America over a long barbecue with a bunch of Argentines:  </P> <P> The chief of staff of the Argentine army was invited for a weekend at the ranch  of his Brazilian counterpart. "What a spread," the Argentine said. "How can you  afford this on a soldier's pay?"  </P> <P> "See that automobile factory over there?" said the Brazilian, pointing to  buildings and smokestacks on the horizon. He patted his pocket. "I get 10% of  everything."  </P> <P> The next year the Argentine general returned the courtesy, inviting the  Brazilian general to his ranch. "Wow! This is grander than mine," the Brazilian  said. "How did you do it?"  </P> <P> "See that highway there?" the Argentine said. "No," the Brazilian said. "I  don't see any highway."  </P> <P> The Argentine patted his pocket and said, "100%."  </P> <P> We all laughed -- me with the expected hint of Yankee superiority. One of the  assumptions of the telling was that such things are not acceptable in the  colder and more righteously puritan regions to the north. In fact, one of the  men there talked about how depressing it had been to come back home to  Argentina 25 years ago after years of education and work in the United States  where business was business, just honest supply and demand.  </P> <P> But then I came back home on Thursday to be greeted by the most depressing of  news about the state of American business and Yankee honesty. In the first  newspapers I saw, there was story after story about investigation after  investigation of dishonesty and corruption in places high and low, reaching  deep into the soul of American business and government. Defense contractors, I  saw in the Wall Street Journal, were cheating the military; banks were  knowingly laundering drug money; a date was set for the criminal trial of the  mayor of the capital city itself; a survey of the National Assn. of Accountants  showed 87% willing to commit fraud for their bosses or clients.  </P> <P> Most shocking of all to me were the accounts of Northrop Corp.'s deliberate  cheating of the government on contracts for Air Force missiles and bombers.  This was not just overcharging -- although Northrop did that on the Stealth  bomber program; it was the falsification of test data on intercontinental  ballistic missiles, supposedly the heart of our national defense.  </P> <P> It takes a lot of people to fake test results on such things as guidance  systems. A lot of engineers. It happened that my Argentine companions around  the barbecue, the men, were all engineers. So am I, or at least I have a degree  in mechanical engineering. I mention that because we were trained in numbers;  we respect the factual results of experimentation and tests -- that is our  professional religion.  </P> <P> Engineers are usually simpler people than, say, lawyers or investment bankers  or mayors. There were few slippery slopes in the world of my education. There  were numbers, knowns and unknowns, variables and invariables. We don't like to  fudge it. If the culture of Northrop, or of the United States itself, is now  such that engineers are faking data, we, too, could end up sitting around  telling bitter jokes and patting our own pockets.  </P> <P> What Northrop and other defense contractors, including General Electric, have  admitted doing is a far greater danger than anything that the Russians and the  Japanese could ever do to us. The problem is not being bombed or out-traded or  cheating the government. Many societies have survived such things. The problem  is corrupting ourselves, or allowing ourselves to be corrupted by each other,  rotting ourselves and our ideals from the inside out.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [News Report: "Number of AIDS Patients Triple in Pakistan"] </F>   [Text] Karachi, 1 December (AMN News) -- One 40-year old  AIDS patient tried to commit suicide at her home in Karachi last  October. This incident took place two months before the  international AIDS day when the media were informing people all  around the world about this fatal disease. The effort of this  Karachi patient to commit suicide is considered an example of  the lack of education in Pakistan. Both people and AIDS patients  are careless about this deadly disease. The Karachi lady was  found by a relative who had come there by chance for a visit and  saved her life. This woman had seen two members of her family  die. The bad luck of this woman began when her drug addict  husband learned he had the deadly virus. In 1986 it was  confirmed that this woman's husband had that poisonous virus,  and he finally died of it. He had transferred the deadly virus  to his wife and eight-year-old son before he died. A bigger  problem than this is that our society does not accept AIDS  patients, and the public attitude toward AIDS patients is very  hostile and deplorable. Mr. Shaukat Ali, a social worker helping  AIDS patients, said that it is important to look after AIDS  patients; however, no attention is given to them. The people do  not know much about the HIV positive condition; although, it is  very dangerous. According to Dr. Sayyed Abdulmajib, the tendency  to commit suicide by AIDS patients is the same around the world,  and to reduce their suicide rate we must pay attention to them.  People should change their attitude. They should know that the  AIDS virus is not transferred by shaking hands or kissing, and  AIDS patients cannot transfer this sickness to another. No part  of the world is safe from this peril and its only solution is  education. There is no cure for it. This disease came to  Pakistan seven years ago. The number of patients is increasing  continuously here, and it has tripled now. The number of HIV  patients has reached 251 now, while in 1991 there were only 90  patients.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> LENDL ROUTS CURREN IN STRAIGHT SETS, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3  </P> <P> Top seed Ivan Lendl continued his straight-set streak Friday by sweeping Kevin  Curren in the semifinals of the International Players Championships.  </P> <P> Lendl won 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 in one hour, 50 minutes. He has yet to lose a set in  six rounds.  </P> <P> "It's easy to play when you're healthy, relaxed and confident," he said.  </P> <P> Seventh-seeded Thomas Muster was scheduled to meet No. 12 Yannick Noah in the  other semifinals match Friday night. Lendl will play the winner in Sunday's  finals.  </P> <P> "I like my chances, but it doesn't really matter that much," Lendl said. "If I  lose, I'm not going to lose any sleep over it. . . .  </P> <P> "I've done well in Australia (he won), and that's good enough for me until the  French."  </P> <P> Curren, seeded 13th, was unable to capitalize on his first semifinals berth in  a two-week tournament since 1985. Only 51% of Curren's first serves were good,  which neutralized his best weapon. He also had trouble putting away shots at  the net, and said Lendl messed up his rhythm.  </P> <P> "Normally it works the other way -- I don't give the opponent any rhythm,"  Curren said. "Today it felt like that for me. . . . He left me a little  confused."  </P> <P> Curren lost the last four games of the first set and the last six games of the  second set. In the final set, he scored six points in Lendl's five service  games.  </P> <P> "Nobody has really tested him," Curren said. "That's what I had hoped to do.  Then you get the tentative Ivan Lendl. . . . He's loose and he's having a good  time."  </P> <P> The first service break came in the sixth game, when Lendl chased down a lob  over his head and hit a brilliant backhand winner for a 4-2 lead. He was in  control of the match thereafter.  </P> <P> Lendl improved his record this year to 19-1, his best start since 1986. He won  this tournament that year.  </P></p>

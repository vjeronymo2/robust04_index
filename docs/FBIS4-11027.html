			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Otero] </F>   [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate for  the "United People" presidential slate, has termed as a "useless  effort" the call for unity made by the so-called civic forces to  create a common front against the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary  Party] for the upcoming 8 May elections.    This week, different political groups, among them some  legislators, offered to act as "mediators" to create a great  front of the democratic and civic forces, so as to achieve unity  to defeat the PRD in the upcoming elections.    "I think what these people who call themselves  antimilitarists [civilistas] are trying to do at this point is a  useless effort, because the only thing they will accomplish is  to stir up passions. This could result in situations we may all  regret," Perez Balladares said, without specifying what he was  referring to.    The PRD presidential candidate said there are politicians  who  have claimed the right to call themselves antimilitarists and to  speak for an entire people, while he remarked that there are  people who fought against Noriega and who now support his  presidential candidacy.    "They are trying to create in this electoral period  conditions similar to those in 1989, and this is a mistake," the  opposition politician noted.    Perez Balladares added that the current political moment  must  not be taken as a struggle against anyone in particular, but as  a struggle against the problems in 1994.    Meanwhile, Perez Balladares described the communique issued  by the Justice and Peace Commission regarding the videos about  the past military regime presented by President Endara last week  as rickety.    "We accept the decision of the Justice and Peace Commission,  but we think they could have been a bit stronger," the PRD  leader pointed out.    Meanwhile, Perez Balladares accepted the existence of a  large  number of corporations with which his name is associated, but  explained that this situation is not illegal but a part of his  job as a businessman.    "They have accused me of not working since 1984. This  situation shows that I am neither retired nor unemployed, as  they have tried to portray, but that this is how I made my  living," Perez Balladares concluded.</p>

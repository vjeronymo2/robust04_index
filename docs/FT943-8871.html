			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Arts (Openings): Helsinki This year's Helsinki music festival has a strong British slant. After the opening performance of Messiah at the Opera House on Sunday, the programme offers a ballet by Johann Kresnik inspired by the paintings of Francis Bacon, a performance of Britten's Nocturne by Neil Mackie and a pair of London Sinfonietta concerts devoted to music by Birtwistle and other contemporary British composers. Jukka-Pekka Saraste conducts home forces in Mahler's Eighth Symphony, and there is a concert devoted to Finnish composer Kalevi Aho.</p>

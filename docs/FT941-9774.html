			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Brother of Berlusconi faces corruption inquiry The political ambitions of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate, were threatened yesterday when Milan magistrates issued an arrest warrant for his brother, Paolo, on suspicion of corruption. Mr Silvio Berlusconi staked his claim last Sunday to lead Italy at the head of his new movement, Forza Italia, amid signs of a strong showing in the opinion polls. His brother's troubles came on the day Mr Berlusconi announced an electoral pact with the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi to fight the March 27 general election. The combined movement stands a good chance of picking up more than a third of the total vote. Aides of Mr Berlusconi insist that he cannot be condemned for unproven allegations against his brother Paolo. But the Italian media, generally hostile to Mr Berlusconi's political ambitions and concerned at his use of his near monopoly of commercial television for self-promotion, will try their best to use the issue against him. Mr Bossi and Mr Berlusconi said the magistrates' move was politically motivated. Mr Paolo Berlusconi, who handed himself over to the authorities yesterday, is being questioned about alleged payments made in connection with property development on the outskirts of Milan. That in turn is part of a broader inquiry into the affairs of the pension fund of Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank whose chairman, Mr Roberto Mazzotta, was arrested on Monday. Cariplo officials are accused of conducting a series of fraudulent property transactions to hide political pay-offs. Between 1983 and 1986, three Berlusconi properties were sold to the Cariplo pension fund for some L22bn (Pounds 8.8m), magistrates claim. Mr Paolo Berlusconi is alleged to have paid bribes totalling more than L900m to a Cariplo official. The money was then split between local politicians, intermediaries and bank officials. When the allegations appeared this week, Mr Paolo Berlusconi's lawyers denied that any such payments had been made. Paolo, aged 43, is widely regarded as having grown up in his elder brother's shadow. In 1992 he came to prominence when Silvio split some of his newspaper interests and the construction business, Cantieri Milanese Riuniti, from the Fininvest group and placed them with his brother. However, Mr Silvio Berlusconi made the move to avoid anti-trust legislation and is thought to have continued to take a close interest in the construction business, which he founded. Mr Paolo Berlusconi has already had one brush with Milan magistrates last year and is to stand trial with 34 others for alleged corruption related to waste disposal contracts.</p>

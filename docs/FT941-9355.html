			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Andre Rousselet resigns as Canal Plus chairman Andre Rousselet yesterday resigned as chairman of Canal Plus, the French media group, in the latest instalment of his bitter row with its main shareholders. The resignation follows the announcement on Friday that Mr Rousselet was leaving the board of Havas, the French leisure group which is Canal Plus's largest shareholder, in protest against plans to merge its holding with those of Generale des Eaux and Societe Generale. Mr Rousselet, 72, has for years been a pivotal figure on the French media scene. He will be succeeded as chairman by Mr Pierre Lescure, 48, Canal Plus's chief executive. The departure of Mr Rousselet, who founded Canal Plus in 1984 and has since turned it into one of Europe's most successful television groups, comes at a very difficult time for the company, which is preparing to renegotiate with the French government the terms of its French pay-TV franchise. The original 10-year franchise was negotiated before Canal Plus's launch when no-one realised how successful the new pay-TV channel was going to be. The government is now expected to try to strike a tougher deal and to force Canal Plus to help France's ailing cable television system.</p>

Javier Solana made a short visit to Malta on Monday [28  March] where he met President Vincent Censu, the prime minister,  and the foreign minister.    Solana believes that one should work in the areas of  politics, economics, and the institutions to find ways that will  allow this country to join the EU. According to Solana, the  discussions of these three points essential for a rapid  accession are progressing well, and the dialogue that started  over the last few years is about to come to a conclusion. Malta  applied for EU membership in July 1990.</p>

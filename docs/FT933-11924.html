			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: BMW sales slide 9% to DM14.7bn in first half SALES AT BMW, the German luxury car manufacturer, fell 9 per cent to DM14.7bn (Dollars 8.5bn) in the first half of this year, and profits suffered from the 'known leverage effects' of such a decline, according to Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, group chairman. Even so, the group had to reduce production by only 10 per cent to 275,000 units, while the German motor industry overall had cut output by a quarter, he said. At the same time, BMWs were the most sought-after cars in their class in western Europe, he said, and the group had managed to adapt output without short-time working, which has been widespread in other companies. Earnings figures, and more details of Mr Pischetsrieder's plans, are expected to be announced tomorrow. In the first half of last year, the group earned a net DM421m on sales of DM16.2bn. Analysts expect full-year profits of around DM500m, compared with DM726m in 1992. Mr Pischetsrieder, who took charge of the group in May, indicated that he wanted to build world market share - currently 1.7 per cent - and further improve efficiency so 'we can earn money with sales of 500,000'. Last year, the group delivered 595,000 cars to distributors. At present the group has capacity to build 560,000 cars a year in Germany. The planned opening of a new works - its first outside Germany - in South Carolina in 1995 will increase the total by 70,000, or 13 per cent. Mr Pischetsrieder also suggested that BMW might attempt to build its international position by making cars smaller than its current entry-level models, the 3-Series. For the present its most important projects were the US works and building sales in south-east Asia and China. Volume sales rose 23 per cent in the US in 1992, contributing 11 per cent of turnover.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Uwe Backes article: "An Urge to `Fulfillment'"] </F>   [Text] Nowhere in Europe did a communist dictatorship and  pluralist democracy collide so hard as in divided Germany. For  better or worse, the political fate of the extreme Left in the  West was closely linked to "real socialism." In the first few  years after the war, the Communist Party of Germany [KDP],  profiting from the bloody resistance against the Nazi regime and  linked to Moscow and East Berlin, still played a major part on  the left-wing fringe of the political spectrum (it was present  in the Parliamentary Council, in the landtags, laender  governments, and Bundestag), but it was banned in 1956, and its  successor, the German Communist Party [DKP] founded in 1968, did  not enjoy any significant election successes.    The lack of attraction, or rather the repulsiveness, of the  Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] reduced the chances of  the small western "fraternal parties." The people in power in  the east attempted to boost the western communist parties by  means of high subsidies, over 70 million German marks per year.  Thanks to this, the DKP was able to exert a not insignificant  cultural influence in the West in the form of its own newspaper  and publishing empire, and infiltrate such social spheres as  educational establishments, individual trade unions such as the  Trade Union of Education and Science [GEW], and the network of  "new social movements." Other groups from the extreme Left also  received smaller pieces of the big East Berlin pie inasmuch as  they availed themselves of the DKP's technical and  organizational infrastructure. But by and large, the existence  of the GDR [German Democratic Republic] was a burden, even  though people did not spare their criticism and geared  themselves to more remote patterns and models like Castro's  Cuba, Tito's Yugoslavia, Enver Hoxha's Albania, and Mao Zedong's  China, and even the writings of Leo Trotsky.  <H5>  The Crisis in the DKP </H5>   The demise of "real socialism" and the end of the SED regime  led to great changes in the extreme left. According to he  Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, total  membership of extreme left-wing organizations fell from 41,000  at the end of 1989 to 29,500 at the end of 1990. At the end of  1992, membership rose to 29,000. Particularly hard hit was the  DKP, already weakened by a power struggle between  traditionalists and adherents of renewal. The end of material  benefits from the SED caused the DKP's party-owned media empire  to collapse and necessitated drastic personnel reductions inside  the DKP apparatus and in allied organizations. The "Spartakus"  student organization was disbanded in June 1990, and the  shrinking West Berlin SED offshoot bearing the name of the  Socialist Unity party of West Berlin was restructured and  renamed. The number of DKP members fell from over 35,000 at the  end of 1988 to less than 7,000 at the end of 1993. Although a  personnel reshuffle took place among the party leadership, the  traditionalist ultra-Orthodox segment pushed through in the end.  The DKP assumed the nature of a sect and became hardly capable  of maintaining an alliance.    If the DKP was the extremist left-wing party with the  greatest membership in western Germany before the turnabout,  after the turnabout this position was assumed by the Party of  Democratic Socialism [PDS], into which the SED had changed  itself. The PDS (originally SED-PDS) was not banned, and was  the legal heir of the SED. There was of course an exodus of  members, so that out of the 2.3 million SED members in August  1989, there were not even 10 percent left. By the end of 1992,  the party membership files had sunk to about 120,000 names.    According to PDS data, in 1991, 95 percent of PDS members  came from the SED. Particularly well-represented in the PDS was  the intellectual GDR elite consisting of teachers, scientists,  and artists. This information alone suggests that the turnabout  propagated by the PDS leadership kept to narrow limits. An  ideological opening-up might have been signalled by means of  references to such authorities as August Bebel and Eduard  Bernstein, but the stubborn adherence to earlier advocates of  Marxist-Leninist tradition removed the credibility from any  attempt at an ideological opening-up.    The same applies to internal party reforms. On the one hand,  the democratic centralism of the past was split up by allowing  the formation of "workers cooperatives" and "platforms" with  various ideological profiles, but on the other hand an almost  all-powerful party presidium emerged, and the  strongly-constrained "pluralism" was also extended to hard-line  communists such as the Communist Platform.    Naturally, the PDS hard liners maintain the closest links  with the DKP. In addition, the PDS is concerned with availing  itself of as much of the potential beyond the Social Democratic  Party of Germany and Greens as possible. Comprehensive contacts  are taking shape within the party "base" and inside various  bodies, for example vis-a-vis the German Communist Party [KPD]  that was formed in 1990 during the GDR's existence; or the  Federation of West German Communists that was formed in 1980;  the Workers Federation for the Reestablishment of the KPD; the  ecological-fundamentalist Ecological Left; and the United  Socialist Party, a party formed in 1986 out of a merger of  Trotskyists and former Stalinist and pro-Albanian communists.  But these are all small groups that share a few hundred members  between them at the very most.    On the other hand, the two extreme left-wing organizations  with the largest memberships after the PDS and DKP refuse to  link themselves to any political federation. The  Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany, claiming to have 2,000  members, continues to refer to the teachings of Stalin and Mao  Zedong, and sympathizes with the Maoist guerrilla organization  "Sendero Luminoso" [Shining Path] of Peru. The Marxist Group,  with about 10,000 members, mainly from the university milieu,  seems to continue to exist secretly even though it dissolved  itself in May 1991. This fact is suggested by the appearance of  an agitation journal called GEGENSTANDPUNKT since that date.    The PDS itself is seeking contacts with the proviolence  groups of "autonomists" that have gained popularity since the  turnabout (in 1993 they had about 5,000 members). The "Scene,"  consisting mainly of 18-28 year-olds, is hardly affected by the  often-quoted "crisis of the Left" because it has never been  connected to any governing political orthodoxy, and its aversion  to any theory or organization, suggesting an exposure to  anarchist influence, conforms to a trend toward "alternative"  fundamentalistically oppositionist subcultures that was visible  long before 1989. The usually loosely structured groups that  are concentrated in a few large German cities, including  university cities (for example Berlin), are joined together by a  hatred of imperialism, capitalism, and state violence. In  addition, they are much more interested in militant "actions"  than theoretical discussions. For years, they have borne  responsibility for most of the acts of violence possessing an  extremist left-wing background (797 such acts in 1991, 972 in  1992, and even more in 1993, according to the Federal Office for  the Protection of the Constitution).  <H5>  The "Autonomous Scene" </H5>   The "Autonomous Scene" is linked to the milieu that supports  terrorist organizations, whereby the environment of the Red Army  Faction [RAF] and Revolutionary Cells [RZ] displays a higher  degree of ideological and strategic discipline. In addition,  the political turnabout of 1989 onwards has left deep traces in  left-wing terrorism, placed a question mark over political  identity, and reduced the circle of helpers and sympathizers.  The RAF was particularly affected by the discovery that it had  had links with the GDR state security. Today, both underground  and inside the prisons, the RAF is usually divided into two  groups. One of them has abandoned the idea of an "armed  struggle," but the other continues to adhere to it strongly.  The shots fired at the headquarters of the Metalworkers  Association in Cologne in November 1993, and especially the  carefully planned and executed bombing of the newly constructed  Weiterstadt correctional facility in March 1993, have cast  doubts on whether the so-called "commando levels" are at all  capable of holding talks.    Hopes for an end to extreme left-wing violence seem to have  proven as naive as hopes for an end to left-wing ideology.  Instead, the left-wing and right-wing extremes seem to be  helping each other back onto their feet. In view of the rise in  right-wing extremism, "anti-Fascism" once again seems to be in  vogue. It improves the chances for broad social groups to  mobilize themselves, and at the same time serves as a  replacement for the now-lost feeling of reassurance connected to  the past. In the meantime, circles of theoreticians are working  on a redefinition and modernization of well-worn dusty  doctrines. Out of anarchy, Marxism, pacifism, and feminism, new  ideological compositions are being created to dampen the  soon-to-reappear urge for fulfillment, for the solving of  problems, and for predicting the future.</p>

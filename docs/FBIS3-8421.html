Judging by the U.S. President's special envoy Charles  Redman's visit to Belgrade on Tuesday, the Americans seem to be  very anxious to find the solution, but, at the moment, they fail  to come up with a clear conception of how to give a definite  shape to the peace package.    The reason for the U.S. anxiousness is obviously a result of  its wish to neutralize, as efficiently as possible, the Russian  initiative in seeking a solution to the Bosnian conflict.    Following the talks with Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic, Redman indicated two phases of the peace process. He  said that the first phase, which was almost finished, would  complete a Moslem-Croat deal on setting up a federation made up  of territories controlled by the two peoples and its later  entering into a confederation with Croatia. The key to the  solution, however, could not be found before reaching the  following (second) phase, for which the U.S. needs the  participation of the third warring nation, i.e., the Serbs.    Redman's visit to Belgrade was a "feel the pulse" operation  and an attempt to solve essential matters "in passing." It is  hard to tell whether the U.S. official, while conferring with  Milosevic and later with Bosnian Serb Republic Vice-President  Nikola Koljevic, had found out what he came to Belgrade for. It  was made clear to him, however, that the Moslem-Croat agreement  is not binding for the Serb side.    Redman in Belgrade insisted on "an overall settlement" of  the  Bosnian crisis, but failed to specify what exactly he meant by  that. He was also told that under the circumstances it was very  hard for the Bosnian Serbs to take an integral stand.    The statements he made in Belgrade differ a great deal from  a  statement by U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith.  Redman, for instance, categorically argued that the  Moslem-Croat agreement was not aimed against the Bosnian Serbs.  On the other hand, Galbraith on Tuesday told the press  conference in Zagreb the agreement's main aim was to put an end  to the senseless conflict between the two nations, victims of  the Serb aggression.    At a point when Redman tried to persuade the Bosnian Serbs  of  the necessity of their involvement in the latest peace process,  Galbraith has offered them only an alternative -- either to join  the Moslem-Croat agreement and the West, or to continue the war.    Be that as it may, Charles Redman left unfinished the job he  came to Belgrade for, so he is likely to come back for talks  shortly.    Meanwhile, the Russians don't sit on their hands, either.  Bosnian Moslem Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian  Foreign Minister Mate Granic were in Moscow on Wednesday.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. State  Secretary Warren Christopher are scheduled to meet next Monday.  To all appearances, the situation would somewhat clear up only  after all these talks about the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

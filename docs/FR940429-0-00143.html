One commenter believed that institutions should have to apply to have eligibility extended to educational programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  With regard to an institution's eligibility for purposes of the title IV, HEA programs, &sect;600.10(d)(1) provides that an institution's eligibility designation for the title IV, HEA programs will expire when the institution's program participation agreement expires. Section 498(g) of the HEA requires the Secretary to establish a schedule for the expiration of those program participation agreements. When this schedule is established, the Secretary will notify each institution well in advance of the scheduled expiration of its program participation agreement of the need to reapply in order to continue its eligibility designation without interruption. Similarly, the Secretary will provide each institution with the necessary information about the forms to use and the date by which the application must be submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once an institution has undergone a reapproval review, if it is approved, it will receive a program participation agreement with a specific expiration date. Thereafter, it is the institution's responsibility to reapply for approval to continue its eligibility to participate in the title IV, HEA programs beyond the expiration date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has addressed the addition of new educational programs in connection with &sect;600.10(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 600.30&blank;Notification Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters noted that institutions would be required to notify the Secretary of certain changes within 10 days of occurrence, but that it was unclear whether such changes would necessitate the filing of a new application and reestablishing eligibility, especially with respect to such changes as changes in boards of directors and percent of ownership interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 600.30 specifies the institutional changes of which the Secretary must be advised. Upon receipt of the notification, the Secretary will advise the institution of any additional information that needs to be provided and whether the institution needs to file an application. Section 600.20 identifies those key circumstances in which an institution is always required to file an application. However, the Secretary retains the authority to request that an institution undergo a reevaluation of institutional eligibility and certification whenever warranted. It should be noted that the new institutional eligibility application will consist of a cover sheet plus separate schedules that deal with the institution's additional locations, educational programs, boards of directors, etc. Thus an institution that has a change in its board of directors or a change in the address of one of its locations may be asked to submit an application, but that application may consist only of the application cover sheet and the appropriate schedule(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, &sect;&sect;600.20, 600.21, and 600.30 taken together explain what an institution is required to do and when.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 600.31&blank;Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change in Control <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A commenter expressed the view that the statute did not require that divisions, mergers or consolidations of public or private non-profit institutions be treated as changes of ownership under section 498(i) of the HEA and objected to their inclusion in the requirements of this section of the regulation. The basis for the comment is the list of examples in section 498(e) of the HEA of an ``ownership interest.'' The commenter noted that these examples are not typical of the ownership of public or non-profit entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary disagrees with the commenter. As indicated in section 498(e) of the HEA, the list of examples provided is not exclusive, and the examples of change of ownership and control included in section 498(i) of the HEA include transactions that public and non-profit institutions undergo, such as sales, mergers, and divisions. Therefore, such changes of ownership and control are covered by &sect;600.31 and could cause the eligibility of those institutions to lapse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to changes of ownership of non-profit institutions, where the non-profit institution is incorporated as a stock corporation, the same bright lines used to identify changes of ownership constituting changes of control for other stock corporations will apply. For non-profit institutions organized as member corporations, the corresponding interest is the membership interest, and those rules should apply in the same way to changes in the membership of the non-profit institutions. Changes of ownership and control also occur with regard to institutions that are owned by non-profit corporations; changes in the persons or individuals who by virtue of their membership in the non-profit corporation own the institution can result in a change of ownership and control of that institution. The bright lines that identify changes of ownership and control of other corporations apply to changes in the membership of non-profit corporations as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In connection with any change of ownership, whether a transfer of the assets and educational enterprise of an institution to another institution is a change within this section, or is subject to &sect;600.32 turns on whether the institution continues to function as a separate educational enterprise after the transfer. If the entity that acquires the institution continues the operation of that institution not as a separate institution but as part of another institution, the transaction would be considered an acquisition of an additional location and would be subject to &sect;600.32.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Commenters expressed apprehension about how the change of ownership rules affect sales in which the parties make the sale conditional upon securing the Department's certification for the institution under the new ownership. Commenters believed that the proposal that the Department would not review the school under the new ownership until the sale has been completed would tend to foster undesirable disruption of title IV, HEA program funding and pose a threat to continued training of students enrolled at the time of the sale. Commenters urged adoption of a procedure in which the Department would review a proposed transfer of ownership before the consummation of the sale, so that the sale could be aborted if certification were denied. A commenter suggested consideration of a preapproval procedure described as used by other agencies in which the Department would review a proposed sale, and, if the institution under the new ownership would qualify for certification, offer the certification on the condition that the sale be fully consummated promptly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

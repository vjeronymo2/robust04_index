			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Industrial injuries scheme under fire Some claimants to the industrial injuries scheme administered by the Department of Social Security's Benefits Agency may be wrongly turned down, a report from the Commons public accounts committee said yesterday. . The committee found that more than half of all appeals made on medical grounds were decided in favour of the claimant, compared with one in three of most other social security appeals. 'This higher proportion of successful claims gives cause for concern that other claimants may not be getting their due entitlement to industrial injuries benefit,' it said. Employee sickness absence has fallen over three years in more than 60 per cent of 75 organisations surveyed, says a report by Industrial Relations Services, the independent research body.</p>

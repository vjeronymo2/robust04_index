			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PROBE OF RAPE AT GOVERNOR'S MANSION IN S.D.  </P> <P> A special prosecutor has been appointed to investigate a report of a rape at  the governor's mansion at a time when apparently only Gov. George S.  Mickelson's 17-year-old son was in residence.  </P> <P> Mickelson said the investigation is causing agony for his family.  </P> <P> The special prosecutor, Craig Kennedy, said Wednesday he expects the Pierre  Police Department to complete its investigation into the rape report within the  next few days.  </P> <P> Kennedy and other officials refused to discuss details of the allegations.  </P> <P> Police received a report on Nov. 30 alleging there had been a forcible rape at  the mansion two days earlier. A statement on a police log sheet said: "Four  boys at mansion raped her."  </P> <P> The Republican governor was in Washington at a U.S. Department of Agriculture  conference on Nov. 28. His wife, Linda, was in Texas at the time.  </P> <P> The Mickelsons' son, David, a senior at Riggs High School, is the only other  family member who is a permanent resident of the mansion. Two older children do  not live in Pierre.  </P> <P> Asked whether David was traveling with either parent on Nov. 28, Mickelson  press secretary Gretchen Lord Anderson replied, "We don't feel that where David  was is relevant."  </P></p>

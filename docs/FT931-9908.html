			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Fall in level of skill shortages SKILL shortages are at a much lower level than two years ago but still exist, especially among small engineering companies, according to a Department of Employment report. Five per cent of large companies interviewed had hard-to-fill vacancies last year compared with 22 per cent in 1990. Other findings include: In large establishments hard-to-fill vacancies were most often reported in the distribution and consumer services sector. Sixty per cent of companies felt that the level of skills needed by the 'average' employee were increasing. Three quarters of large companies funded or arranged off-the-job training.

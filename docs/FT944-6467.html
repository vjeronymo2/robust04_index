			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farm leaders attack set-aside delay British farm leaders yesterday attacked the European Parliament for holding up implementation of a cut in the amount of arable land which European Union farmers have to leave uncultivated as 'set-aside' next year. Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said that the procedural hold-up by the parliament in giving its opinion on the cut was causing farmers 'delay and uncertainty'. Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, agreed that the delay was 'irritating' as it was becoming too late for farmers to make drilling decisions for next year. The reduction of 3 percentage points to 12 per cent in the amount of land that arable farmers have to set aside next year was agreed by EU agriculture ministers a month ago. But the parliament must pronounce on the move before it can be implemented by agriculture ministers. Sir David said there was concern that the parliament might not give its opinion in time for the last agriculture council meeting of the year, in mid-December. 'Farmers and growers are consistently being exhorted to move closer to the market place,' he said. 'But that can all too often turn into a nightmare in the business sense if the politicians indulge in verbal sparring of a kind which bears little reality to what is happening in the market place.' Winter wheat crops should mostly have been drilled by now, and many farmers are believed to have gone ahead in planting more land than last year on the assumption that the cut will be implemented. If they left the decision until late December or January, they would be restricted to planting lower margin varie-ties of wheat or crops such as barley.</p>

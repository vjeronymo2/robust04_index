			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Decision on Ulster talks NORTHERN Ireland's political leaders agreed yesterday to spend a further two days trying to resolve a row over the timing of the Irish government's entry into the talks. There was little evidence that intensive talks in a sub-committee over the past few days had made significant progress towards resolving the deadlock. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, may decide to suspend the process, or he may announce unilaterally when the Irish government will enter. Yesterday, Sir Patrick and Mr Jeremy Hanley, the minister responsible for political development in the province, had talks with the party leaders before to a full plenary session. The Northern Ireland Office said it had been agreed that the sub-committee would continue to try to move the process forward before reporting back tomorrow. All parties were yesterday maintaining their pledge of confidentiality.</p>

Saitoti made the remarks while meeting visiting Chinese  Vice-  Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who paid a courtesy  call on the Kenyan vice-president.    Saitoti noted that Kenya and China have shared a good  relationship for 30 years, adding that "your country, although a  developing country, has been able to render substantial  assistance to our country. We Kenyan people consider Chinese  the very true friend of Kenya."    He cited Arap Moi International Sports Complex built by the  Chinese Government as an example of China's aid to Kenya, saying  that the Kenyan Government is very much pleased with the  assistance provided by the Chinese Government in education,  health and other fields.    Kenya, he said, is going through a fundamental economic  reform. He expressed the hope that more Chinese businessmen  would invest in Kenya "either through joint venture or direct  investment."    Meanwhile, the Kenyan vice-president said that there are  thousands of Somali and Sudanese refugees in his country, which  have posed heavy burden on Kenya in social and economic  respects. He appealed to the international community as well as  China to continue the efforts to bring peace to Somalia and the  Sudan.    In response, Qian Qichen said the Chinese Government is  satisfied with the development of the relations between China  and Kenya, hailing the importance the Kenyan Government has  attached to the relations between the two countries and peoples.    "We also appreciate your adherence to the one China policy,"  said the Chinese vice-premier.    "Kenya is a very important country in East Africa," Qian  said. He voiced his appreciation to the Kenyan Government,  especially President Daniel arap Moi, for the important role  they have played in promoting the peace in Somalia and the Sudan.    On the trade relations between the two countries, Qian said  the Chinese Government is willing to strengthen economic  cooperation on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful  Co-existence.    Moreover, Qian expected that his visit will further promote  the relations between the two countries.    The Chinese vice-premier and foreign minister arrived here  on  Saturday [15 January] and this is his second visit to Kenya. He  is leaving here tomorrow for Madagascar.</p>

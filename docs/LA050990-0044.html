			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXILED LEADER'S SON SWORN AS PRESIDENT OF COSTA RICA;  </P> <P> CENTRAL AMERICA: HE VOWS TO LEAD THE DEMOCRATIC AWAKENING IN THE REGION AND  TACKLE ECONOMIC WOES AT HOME.  </P> <P> Rafael Angel Calderon, whose father's Costa Rican political career ended in  exile, was sworn in Tuesday as president of Central America's most enduring  democracy.  </P> <P> Invoking his father's one-time populist ideals and briefly acknowledging the  foreign activism and peacemaking role of his predecessor, Oscar Arias Sanchez,  Calderon promised to tackle Costa Rica's deficit. He also pledged to help lead,  by example, a region that until only recently has been torn by civil war and  violence.  </P> <P> "Only the combination of economic growth and social justice can immunize  democracies against the totalitarian dangers of the extreme right and the  extreme left," he told a capacity crowd at the 25,000-seat National Stadium.  </P> <P> During his 40-minute speech, Calderon was flanked by all of Central America's  heads of state, including Nicaragua's new president, Violeta Barrios de  Chamorro. Most of the leaders, like Calderon, are newly elected moderate  conservatives.  </P> <P> Calderon said regional troubles appear to have eased and that many of the  Central American nations have edged toward Costa Rica's century-old example of  democratic stability.  </P> <P> "Being now halfway down the road toward a better future, it is for us, the  presidents of Central America, to assume the responsibility of leading our  peoples into a new stage in the process, in which the great goal will no longer  be to silence the uproar of cannon fire, but to take off at last toward  economic development," he said.  </P> <P> First Lady Barbara Bush, appearing calm and proud on her first solo venture  abroad to represent her husband, was cheered when she led the U.S. delegation  into the stadium. Earlier, she had delivered a letter from her husband, in  which he pledged to work with Calderon to "bring peace, democracy and  development to the region."  </P> <P> Calderon's Feb. 4 victory ended eight years of rule by Arias' National  Liberation Party.  </P> <P> It was also the 10th consecutive election in Costa Rica since Rafael Calderon  Guardia, president from 1940 to 1944, sparked a civil war after he tried to  nullify the vote in his losing 1948 electoral campaign. The family was driven  into exile in Nicaragua, where Rafael Angel Calderon, known as Junior, was  born.  </P> <P> Calderon, 41, has tried to follow in his father's footsteps almost since he  graduated from the University of Costa Rica law school in 1972. He served in  various government posts and lost two presidential campaigns.  </P> <P> But in his most current bid, at the head of the Social Christian Unity Party,  he had the help of Roger Ailes, President Bush's campaign wizard. Ailes  refashioned Calderon's image from that of a hard-liner on foreign issues into  that of a man of the people -- a reflection of his father's early political  life.  </P> <P> Ailes was part of the U.S. delegation Tuesday along with John H. Sununu, the  President's chief of staff, and his wife, Nancy; former Puerto Rican President  Luis Ferre, and the Bushes' son, Jeb.  </P> <P> Calderon promised to reduce the $35-million deficit of Costa Rica, a country  the size of West Virginia with a population of 2.2 million, by forcing  "self-sacrifice."  </P> <P> He said he will encourage new markets and bolster tourism but insisted he will  keep his campaign promise to build 160,000 housing units by his term's end.  </P></p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / At least five killed after rockets hit Azeri town ARMENIAN rocket attacks on the Azerbaijani town of Agdam yesterday killed at least five people and injured about 60, writes Jim Bodgener from Agdam, Azerbaijan. The town's market, school and about 40 houses were hit. Ambulances, cars and jeeps were still bringing in the wounded to an improvised hospital at the railway station two hours after the second salvo at midday The intermittent rumble of artillery duels echoed from the Karabakh mountains, about 8km from Agdam. A school teacher said they had been attacked by 'tanks with the help of uniformed Russians'. Chrystia Freeland adds from Kiev: Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, said yesterday that Azerbaijan had requested Ukrainian protection from what it described as 'Armenian aggression'. Mr Kravchuk said Ukraine would not become involved militarily in the conflict. He added, however, that it would put forward a peace plan at the March 20 meeting of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Kiev.</p>

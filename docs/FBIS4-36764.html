			<p>BFN     [Text] Since last night, Israelis have been banned from  entering the Jericho autonomy region until a new announcement is  issued. Our correspondent Ron Nesi'el reports that the reason is  concern about attempts to attack Israelis after hundreds of  Palestinian prisoners arrived in the town. Jericho itself is  quiet. There is a large Palestinian police presence, especially  in the area of the mosque, but there have been no reports of  disturbances.</p>

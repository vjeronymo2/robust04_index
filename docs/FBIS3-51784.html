			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nicaraguan Central Bank President Jose </F> Taboada by unidentified reporter in Managua, dated not given;  from the "Extravision" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] Minister, the disbursement that was just  made is a result of this agreement and it involves $40 million  that President Bill Clinton had promised to President Chamorro  in December. How will the $40 million be spent now that this  agreement was signed? I ask this question because there are  great expectations. It has been said that the country faced  economic problems, more economic problems when the aid was not  disbursed. The $40 million will be forthcoming. The $40 million  will reportedly, and according to U.S. Ambassador Maisto, be  credited to Nicaragua's account this week. How will the $40  million be spent?    [Taboada] This is a donation that will be applied to our  balance of payments. This means that those resources will be  added to Central Bank reserves. The Central Bank may sell this  foreign currency to Nicaraguan importers, pay oil debts, or pay  debts to multilateral financial organizations in Washington.  Those are basically the three options for which we may earmark  the foreign currency that will be deposited in the Central Bank.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [Taboada] The entire debt, the debt in arrears, which is a  government priority, may be paid with these funds as long as  such payments are made to multilateral financial organizations  such as the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. We  cannot use this money to pay Germany, for example.    [Reporter] How much does the Nicaraguan debt amount to at  present?    [Taboada] The Nicaraguan debt, unfortunately, is more than  $10 billion. This is why the government has focused efforts on  renegotiating and obtaining pardons for our debt. Thus, the  stock [previous word in English] of the debt continues to be  very high. This is why when we talk about payments on our debt  it must be clearly understood that we are referring to payments  of that part of the debt that the government considers to be a  priority. We must pay about $254.5 million in 1994.    [Reporter] Minister, you talked about a deficit in our trade  balance. How much does it amount to?    [Taboada] That deficit could reach $400 million, perhaps a  little more. This is why we need to cover this deficit with  foreign cooperation, that is, loans or donations.    [Reporter] Minister, let us switch to another topic: the  signing of the ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility].  You said moments ago that the ESAF was signed. The ESAF is a  reality. The signing of this agreement was strongly questioned  months ago, last year, late last year when the first IMF and  World Bank delegation visited our country. The government was  unable to sign at that time. Days later a new delegation of the  IMF and a World Bank delegation arrived to finalize the signing  of the ESAF.    My question is: Opposition leaders, Sandinist leader Daniel  Ortega thinks that the signing of this agreement will bring  about negative effects, because there is talk of drastic public  expenditure reductions. Will this bring about positive or  negative consequences? The government argues that the signing  of this agreement will bring about positive results for the  entire population. What are the final conditions for the  signing of this agreement called ESAF?    [Taboada] We are now at a stage in which structural reforms  have already been agreed upon. For example, in the financial  sector we will continue to maintain the independence of the Bank  Superintendency. This commitment was also acquired by the  Legislative Branch through Law 125.    There are at times attempts to reaffirm [reiterar] aspects  that are already recognized or contained in the government plan.  Such aspects include the independence of the Bank  Superintendency, the role of state-owned banks as effective  mediation instruments in the financial sector, and the continued  efforts to further reduce bank operational costs and increase  revenues. In sum, to turn banks into instruments to support  Nicaraguan production activities.    There are also reforms, that is, agreements in the fiscal  area to reduce exonerations, except, obviously, those granted by  law. The idea is to benefit Nicaraguan society with the  collection of taxes from certain import sectors that are  currently exonerated and not protected by law.    [Reporter] What about a reduction in public expenditures?    [Taboada] We realize the need to make further adjustments,  that is, reduce public expenditures, in keeping with the  resources available to the Nicaraguan economy, that is, the  revenues that will be at our disposal from taxes, funds  collected by public sector companies, and loans and donations.  We must continue our efforts to reduce the size of the  nonfinancial public sector to secure resources to ensure that  the private sector is able to produce.</p>

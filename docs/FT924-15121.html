			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (9): Battle over regulation - Developments in North America reviewed by Patrick Harverson REGULATION has been the dominant issue in the US cable television industry this year, or to be more precise, re-regulation. The cable television industry was deregulated in the mid-1980s under the 1984 Cable Act, but last month the House of Representatives and the Senate voted by overwhelming majorities to pass a bill that will re-impose rate regulation on basic cable television providers who face no competition from other multi-channel TV services. The bill is also designed to stimulate competition against cable-TV monopolies. The legislation attracted enormous publicity. The cable industry, backed by some powerful Hollywood production companies, conducted a huge lobbying campaign against the bill, while the consumer groups and cable competitors (such as network television broadcasters and providers of satellite and microwave services) who initiated or supported the legislation worked equally hard to ensure its safe passage through Congress. The debate on regulating cable was also aired in scores of newspapers, and via television screens where cable providers ran anti-regulation advertisements aimed at persuading viewers to lobby their Congressmen to stop the legislation. Even sports fans could not escape: one commentator, working for a powerful cable company, voiced strong opinions on the industry regulation in the middle of a baseball game last month. The president, in the heat of a fierce election battle, has also been involved in the controversy. After the House vote he attacked the bill as full of 'costly, burdensome and unnecessary requirements', and promised to veto it, suggesting Congress would better serve the consumer by 'promoting vigorous competition, not massive re-regulation'. A presidential veto, however, is unlikely, given that Congress has the required two-thirds (plus one) majority among senators and representatives to override the veto. Mr Bush is proud that his veto has never been overriden during his term of office, and it is improbable that he would accept the humiliation of defeat by Congress so close to the election, especially over an issue that is not particularly close to his heart and that is popular with voters. The bill is an ambitious attempt by consumer groups to place restrictions on prices for basic cable services, and open up the local monopolies that many cable providers enjoy to competition from outside. Over the years, consumer advocates have been critical of the price and quality of cable services. Figures show that cable rates have risen by 60 per cent, many times the rate of inflation since 1986. At the same time, cable providers are monopolies in most cities, and subscribers have long complained of the poor service they receive for their money. The present legislation is aimed primarily at 'basic' cable services, which are the broadcast, government, public, educational channels and the so-called 'superstations'. These include TBS, part of Ted Turner's media empire, which owns a host of cable channels including the Discovery and Family Channels, TWX, part of Time Warner and owner of the greatly-watched Home Box Office (HBO) and Cinemax movie channels, and VIA, owner of MTV, its music counterpart VH-1, and several other popular channels. Rate regulation would be the responsibility of the Federal Communications Commission, the government's broadcasting watchdog, which would regulate basic rates wherever local authorities fail to, or cannot, set guidelines of their own. Additionally, the bill will bar cable programming affiliates from refusing to sell programmes to cable competitors, and bar local franchising authorities from issuing exclusive cable TV franchises. It will also allow over-the-air broadcasters (such as the big networks) to negotiate with local cable operators for fees, promotions, channel positioning and other considerations. Under the present law, cable operators get over-the-air broadcast signals for free. In spite of all the controversy surrounding re-regulation, industry observers believe that if the cable business is to be regulated once more, the bill Congress has passed is the least restrictive legislation cable companies could have hoped for. 'It's a liveable bill,' says Jessica Reif, cable industry analyst with broking house Oppenheimer in New York. 'Nobody ever wants to be regulated, but it is not a tough bill and at least it gets all the uncertainty out of the way.' So why did the opponents of the bill make so much fuss? Their argument against it was relatively simple: re-regulation would push up cable companies' costs significantly, and those higher costs would have to be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher subscription rates. In private, cable providers feared losing valuable monopolies, and were especially concerned about competition from big telephone companies, who want to offer television programmes and other electronic information services over their communications networks. Yet the cable industry also tried to block the bill because of an inherent fear of any kind of regulation. In the early days of the bill's drafting it was particularly nervous about how far the legislators would go, and indeed, the bill that was eventually passed was a watered down version of the one originally proposed in the Senate earlier this year. The best indication of how restrictive the new bill will be for cable companies came from the stock market, which took the news of the bill's passage through Congress in late September with a remarkable degree of equanimity. This sober response suggested investors regard the bill as little threat to cable companies, at least for now, and it contrasted with the big sell-off in cable stocks that followed the first House vote on re-regulation in July. Even if the new bill is relatively mild, cable companies will face fresh competition as the 1990s progress. In June the FCC voted to allow broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) to buy local cable television systems, ending a 22-year old ban. The new FCC ruling, however, carried restrictions aimed at preventing the big networks from putting local broadcasting stations out of business. Even with greater competition, the future remains bright for cable companies in the US. One avenue with particular potential is pay-per-view television - where the cable subscriber pays a one-off fee to watch a special event or programme. Since 1988 revenues from pay-per-view have more than doubled to Dollars 388m. More than 18m homes in the US are able to order pay-per-view, and industry observers forecast that figure to reach 32m homes, paying as much as Dollars 1bn, by 1995.</p>

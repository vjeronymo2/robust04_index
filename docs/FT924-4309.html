			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Shipyard closure to cost 900 jobs VSEL gave up its attempts to sell the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead yesterday and announced that the yard would close in July, with the loss of 900 jobs. VSEL bought Cammell Laird for Pounds 1 in 1986 in a management buy-out from British Shipbuilders. Its Birkenhead yard has largely concentrated on building diesel-electric submarines, while its yard at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, has concentrated on nuclear submarines. The work at both yards has fallen off since the end of the cold war, and work on the last Upholder class submarine at the Merseyside yard will be completed in June. Cammell Laird has been an essential part of Merseyside's economy for more than 100 years and had one of the area's few large concentrations of skilled labour. Two years ago it employed 2,000 people. The best hope for the yard's survival had been that Amec, the construction and civil engineering group, would buy it to help exploit the natural gas discovered in Liverpool Bay by Hamilton Oil, the US group. That depended on Hamilton's getting approval to build a gas terminal at Point of Air on the Welsh side of the Dee estuary. Gas would have been piped from the terminal to fire a new power station at Connah's Quay, just over the Welsh border from Chester. The planning application for the terminal was referred to a public inquiry last March after protests by environmental groups. Mr Noel Davies, chief executive of VSEL, said yesterday: 'Prevarication over the Liverpool Bay project has been one of three reasons we have been forced to announce closure. It seems many people in the Wirral are more concerned about a pretty skyline as they look across to north Wales than they are for the jobs of the lads at Cammell Laird.' Another reason was failure to secure help from the EC's intervention fund, which helps shipbuilding areas. Mr Davies said the third reason was that the recession meant VSEL had been unable to sell the yard, which it believed could have been broken up for a variety of engineering uses. He said he hoped the site could be converted to mixed use, including residential and industrial developments. Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, said that was 'absolutely potty'. He is arranging meetings between union leaders and the cross-party group of all Wirral MPs next week, and hopes for meetings with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and with Mr John Major, the prime minister. He said the aim would be to put Cammell Laird's ownership into trust while further efforts were made to attract investment. His suggestion that the trustee might be the Merseyside Development Corporation, a government agency, was rejected by the GMB general union.</p>

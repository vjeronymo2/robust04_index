			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Currencies It almost looks as though leading industrial countries are willing the dollar to drop. After German officials proclaimed the lack of need for a rescue package at this weekend's Naples summit, the Federal Reserve yesterday missed an opportunity to raise interest rates aggressively following its Open Market Committee meeting. Yet this does not mean that governments can get away with a course of benign neglect. The pressures which have already produced two rounds of concerted intervention this summer have not gone away. They will almost certainly intensify if the summit ignores the currency issue. Perhaps it would pay the authorities to wait until the market is short of dollars. Intervention always works best when speculators are burnt. But the strength of the D-Mark against other European currencies - yesterday the French franc again fell below its old intervention floor - suggests Germany cannot remain insouciant. Its European partners will soon complain about the effect on their own bond markets of a strong D-Mark. Ultimately the problem has more to do with bonds than absolute exchange rates, which puts the US authorities in a quandary. Liquidity worries mean that if they raise interest rates to stabilise the dollar, they risk upsetting the bond market in the short term as much as if they do nothing. But bond markets will not recover till the inflationary spectre is laid to rest. Higher interest rates are thus inevitable despite the turbulence in their train.</p>

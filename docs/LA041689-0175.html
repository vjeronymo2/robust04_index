			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KING OF COWBOY COUTURE;  </P> <P> DESIGNER RIDES HIGH WITH WESTERN CLOTHES  </P> <P> When Jerry Cohn realized his wardrobe would not be complete without a pair of  denim boots, he did not think twice about where to go -- he took his unusual  request to his designer of the last 10 years, Manuel.  </P> <P> "It was my idea," said Cohn, who manages the careers of such stars as Barbara  Stanwyck, Cesar Romero and Rose Marie. "I said, 'I've got a great idea . . .  How about making me a pair of denim boots?' But he'd already thought of it on  his own. He pulled out a pair and said, 'You mean like these?' "  </P> <P> "Everyone who sees my Levi boots says, 'Gee, what a great idea!' " said Cohn,  who paid $800 to fulfill his sartorial fantasy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Celebrity Clients  </P> <P> Manuel, who uses no last name, is renowned among fanciers of Western-style  clothing. The 55-year-old designer, working out of his North Hollywood store  that bears his name, has put together wardrobes for such high-profile  entertainers as Johnny Cash, Dwight Yoakum, Randy Travis and Emmylou Harris.  Sylvester Stallone and Bob Dylan have purchased his brightly colored jackets,  made from Indian blankets.  </P> <P> "People don't realize that they've been wearing Western clothes all along --  jeans and Levi jackets are all Western-American clothes," Manuel said. "The  American heritage, the settlers, the Army, the real Indian costumes, the  weavings and patterns. I have absorbed all this and put it on the clothing. I  try to follow the American tradition."  </P> <P> Manuel, who was born in Michoacan, Mexico, said he started sewing "odd ends and  shirts" when he was 8. When he moved to this country 34 years ago, he went to  work for men's clothier Sy Devore.  </P> <P> "I started working in several of Sy Devore's shops," he said, "but he made  nothing but the regular clothes. Nothing got fancier than the regular suits. I  was looking for something more than that."  </P> <P> After just a few months with Sy Devore, he went to work for a North  Hollywood-based clothing designer named Nudi, who specialized in Western  clothing. "Country and Western was Nudi's clientele," Manuel said. "He used  embroidery and rhinestones. I incorporated a little more than he had. It gave  the clothes a more sophisticated look."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Movie Costumes  </P> <P> While working at Nudi's, Manuel started to create movie costumes. He clothed  the characters in movies such as "Myra Breckenridge," "Xanadu" and  "Rhinestone," but said the work was not satisfying. "I don't like to deal with  the character of the so-called movie star. Sometimes my way of thinking  interfered with that. I don't believe in ego stuff. I believe in  professionalism."  </P> <P> Manuel left Nudi's 14 years ago to set up his own shop. And in the past few  years, he has phased out of movie costuming entirely.  </P> <P> He looks askance at Americans who wear imported, European-tailored clothing. "I  don't think Americans should wear Italian- or French-made suits," he said.  "Those people are built so differently. When Americans wear those clothes, they  look like they've been wrapped like a mummy."  </P> <P> In addition to traditional materials such as cotton, wool, denim, silk, suede  and leather, Manuel also uses blankets made by New Mexico's Chimayo Indians.  Manuel turns them into striking coats that sell for $4,000 and up. "Bob Dylan  has a $7,500 jacket made out of one of these blankets, Sylvester Stallone has  one, too," he said.  </P> <P> Manuel also sells sterling silver jewelry embedded with turquoise, coral or  rubies; hand-tooled belts; hand-embroidered or hand-tooled leather or fabric  boots; and blouses, shirts, jackets, dresses, and suits that are usually  embroidered, fringed or trimmed with rhinestones. Prices range from $200 to  four figures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Store Shows Style  </P> <P> His open, airy store, with its blond hardwood floors, provides more evidence of  his sense of style. Manuel embroidered the pillows that are artfully tossed on  the sand-colored couches. He also fringed and tooled Indian designs into the  store's smattering of antique chairs and he painted the Western mural on a  partition near the back of the store. "I did do a couple of chairs for Johnny  Cash, and for Elvis," he said, "but I prefer to do clothes and jewelry. Really,  the chairs and pillows are just for myself, to liven up the store."  </P> <P> The walls are covered with gold records sent by singing celebrities and rows  and rows of photographs of smiling celebrities in Manuel-designed outfits. "I  made the first Western suit that John Lennon ever wore," he said.  </P> <P> Clients arrange to meet with Manuel in his store by appointment only. And his  clothes, like his service, are so personalized that Manuel always makes a point  of sewing a label that says "Designed For (blank) By Manuel" into each garment.  </P> <P> Lynn Landon, former wife of actor-producer Michael Landon, has been going to  Manuel for 15 years. "I discovered him when he was working at Nudi's," she  said. "I love his country and Western clothes. If I wear jeans, I'll have a  jacket or coat or vest that's country and Western. He did the dress I wore when  my son got married. It's a blue silk, then there's a design in rhinestones on  the back of a cropped jacket."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Looks Like Art'  </P> <P> Landon also owns one of Manuel's Indian blanket coats. "He did an Indian  blanket coat for me and added little beads. I wore it in New York City, and  people said, 'Where did you get that coat?' A lot of people think his work  looks like art."  </P> <P> Manuel is now working on a black Western jacket for Landon. "It's from a very  old design," she said. "I think to wear it with a little black dress and heels  would be fabulous, but it's also a jacket you could wear with a pair of jeans."  </P> <P> Cohn said Manuel's designs fit his casual sense of style. "I wear a lot of  boots and jeans and suits," he said. "He makes my regular suits, and he's also  made a tuxedo for me. It's a velvet jacket with a twill vest, twill slacks and  no buttons, no pockets. I wear that with black, patent leather sandals and no  socks -- that's my style."  </P> <P> "I'm very comfortable there in his store. Even if his store were a warehouse,  you'd still feel good being there. He makes you feel special."  </P></p>

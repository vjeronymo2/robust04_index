			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Report hails 'lively' Germany recovery The German government was quick to claim yesterday that its policies had been vindicated by a report from the country's six leading economic institutes predicting that the economy would grow by 2.5 per cent this year and by a further 3 per cent next year. Presenting their twice yearly study, the most comprehensive check-up on the health of the German economy, the institutes said the recovery had been 'surprisingly early and lively'. In April they had predicted that German gross domestic product would rise by 1.5 per cent. 'Now we can see that the government's economic assumptions were not just calculated optimism but based on the improved conditions for growth which have been achieved,' Finance Minister Theo Waigel said. For the third time running, however, the left wing Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) disagreed with the other five institutes, arguing that the rise in long-term interest rates posed a threat to economic recovery. The institute said GDP would grow by 1.5 per cent next year. The report says Germany's recovery had initially been driven by exports but there was now evidence that capital investment had become the driving force of the recovery. Responding to the report, however, the influential Federation of German Industry (BDI) said there were fewer grounds for optimism because companies were still not earning enough to make substantial investments. Inflation, which has failed to fall below 3 per cent in August and September, is forecast to dip to 2.5 per cent next year, the report said. Continuing inflationary pressure caused by the growth of the M3 money supply, the key indicator used by the Bundesbank, suggested there was no need for the central bank to make any substantial cuts in its leading interest rates, the report said. The institutes also recommended the government increase the budget deficit in order to relieve companies and consumers of 'massive tax increases'. But the association which represents Germany's largest private banks, said it would be wrong to raise the budget deficit in order simply to cut expenditure. 'A strict reduction of spending and the reduction of the amount of taxes levied should go hand in hand,' the Federation of German Banks said. The report coincides with figures which show that Germany's trade surplus rose sharply in August to DM7.1bn (Pounds 2.9bn), double the July level. Exports were 14 per cent up on the previous year while imports rose 6 per cent. The trade surplus for the first eight months of this year totalled DM47bn, 25 per cent higher than for the same period a year earlier. The current account deficit, however, almost doubled to DM36.5bn, partly because of the high level of payments by German tourists abroad. Meanwhile the public sector financing deficit confirmed the positive trends, falling by DM23bn to DM63bn for the first half of this year, better than the 1994 budget plan had indicated according to a statement from the Federal Statistics Office.</p>

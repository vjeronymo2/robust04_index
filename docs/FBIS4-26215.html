			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- A copyright official  urged here today that overseas groups and individuals  participate in China's copyright protection campaign.    "Chinese people are most directly harmed by copyright  piracy.  The country not only respects foreign copyright owners but also  regards anti-piracy as a helpful activity for our own economic,  cultural and scientific development," said Shen Rengan,  vice-director of the State Copyright Bureau.    He said that copyright piracy has blocked the development of  China's publications, film, and computer industries.    "Copyright protection in China is not an interim measure,"  he  said, adding that the opening policy has quickened the pace of  bringing China's copyright protection in line with foreign norms.    He noted that overseas people should come to realize this  attitude and provide more active cooperation with the Chinese  Government, including providing some techniques for copyright  protection such as identifying and affirming foreign copyright  owners.    Meanwhile, those overseas people whose copyrights have been  violated in China should inform the Chinese side in time, so as  to provide clues for China to find the violators.    According to Shen, currently all copyright pirates in China  are illegal. Some culprits have contacts with or are even  directly manipulated by overseas people.    He also said that Chinese people have shouldered more  responsibilities in protecting overseas copyrights. However,  Chinese works have been repeatedly pirated in other countries  and regions -- a headache which has not been solved.    These works include books, video tapes, films and paintings.  In recent years, cases of piracy of Chinese computer software  have been found, for example, piracy of a Chinese-language input  system and a Chinese-language desktop publishing system.    Shen noted that a joint action of cracking down on pirated  recording tapes is still going on nationwide and has won great  success, with several illegal production lines being destroyed.    A similar action on pirated books is planned, and in the  future, copyright violators will be sentenced to jail terms  instead of being fined.</p>

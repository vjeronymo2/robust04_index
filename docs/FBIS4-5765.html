			<p>BFN     [Text] A feeling of relief is spreading in the central  government offices in Kasumigaseki at the current moves of the  ruling coalition parties to select Deputy Prime Minister and  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's successor. This is because the basic framework of  the ruling coalition parties will be maintained, and the  political upheaval will probably be resolved sooner than  expected.    Hata, who has served in key cabinet posts, including the  minister of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, and the  minister of finance, also has great credibility. In particular,  being the incumbent foreign minister, he is familiar with the  substance of the stalled negotiations between Japan and the  United States, and has many personal connections in the United  States. He is widely expected to effect a breakthrough in the  negotiations.    The Ministries of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] and International  Trade and Industry [MITI] say that Hata "stands firm on issues  of principle," (MITI) and that "he will speak up to the United  States whenever necessary." (MOFA) He is admired for  negotiating with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor for six  and one-half hours on the bilateral economic framework talks  immediately prior to the Japan-U.S. summit meeting in February,  and insisting that "numerical targets are absolutely  unacceptable."    The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries [MAFF]  says that, "He has served twice as agriculture minister, and is  the number one expert on agriculture in the coalition  government," (according to a senior MAFF official). There is  widespread expectation on Hata particularly because the MAFF and  the Prime Minister's Office did not exactly see eye to eye  during the decision process leading to the partial opening of  the rice market last year.    The Ministry of Finance is elated at the fact that the  framework of the ruling coalition parties will be basically  maintained. It believes that not only have prospects for  starting deliberations on the draft 1994 budget become brighter,  "some progress can also be excepted in tax reform, although this  is already a bit behind schedule," (according to the Tax Bureau).    However, while expectations are high regarding a  reconciliation between Japan and the United States, others  express the concern that: "He is the very person who brought  about the breakdown in the Japan-U.S. summit meeting; he may  have some problems when it comes to breaking the current  deadlock in bilateral relations." Still others are apprehensive  that with the discord in the ruling parties coming to the  surface, the policymaking process will be even more arduous.</p>

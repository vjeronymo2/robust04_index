			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW U.S. RULES MAKE SOVIET IMMIGRATION MORE DIFFICULT  </P> <P> The United States, overwhelmed by a dramatic surge in the number of Soviet  citizens permitted by their government to emigrate, has changed its rules so  that Soviets will face far more difficulty in being allowed to settle in  America, a senior U.S. official told reporters here Wednesday.  </P> <P> The new rules, which take effect Monday, not only close the door to some  would-be immigrants but also reflect a significant change in the way the United  States views the issue of Soviet emigration.  </P> <P> Previously, U.S. officials, citing human rights violations, protested regularly  that Moscow should give exit visas to all who wished to go, and virtually every  Soviet citizen who received permission from his government to leave was  welcomed into the United States.  </P> <P> Now that Moscow has opened its doors much wider, permitting about 300,000  Soviet citizens to seek U.S. immigration visas in the year that will end Sept.  30, the United States is forced into the uncomfortable role of setting limits.  </P> <P> "We're in a bit of a moral quandary," a top-ranking U.S. official in Moscow  said. "We insisted for years that all Soviets who wanted to should be allowed  to go to the United States. Now we're the ones telling them no."  </P> <P> The regulations, under which 70,000 to 80,000 Soviet citizens are expected to  be allowed to emigrate to the United States in the next fiscal year, require in  the majority of cases that new immigrants have either parents, children,  brothers, sisters or spouses living in the United States, the official said.  </P> <P> According to a U.S. government leaflet being distributed to Soviets in Moscow,  U.S. immigration officials will make exceptions in cases "of special concern to  the United States," but those with no close family ties "will face long delays,  and may wish to explore alternative destinations."  </P> <P> The new regulations are likely to please Israel, because they will eliminate  the so-called "dropout phenomenon." This involves Soviet Jews who have been  granted visas to Israel but who, once in a third country, usually Austria or  Italy, then seek and receive U.S. visas.  </P> <P> As of Monday, the U.S. official said, Soviet citizens sent to third countries  on their way to Israel will no longer be granted visas to the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eagleburger Testimony  </P> <P> The announcement underscored recent testimony in Washington by Deputy Secretary  of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger.  </P> <P> Calling the increase in emigration "a great success for our American foreign  policy," Eagleburger, nevertheless, said that the practice of granting visas in  third countries posed an insoluble and overwhelming problem with the rapidly  rising tide of applicants.  </P> <P> "While we applaud these developments, we must be honest in appraising our  national ability to respond to unprecedented, unpredictable and previously  unmanaged flows of people," he told the Senate's Judiciary Committee's  subcommittee on immigration and refugee affairs Sept. 15.  </P> <P> Jewish organizations in the United States supported the changes as constructive  efforts to deal with the unprecedented surge of emigrants.  </P> <P> Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive director of the Conference of Presidents of  Major American Jewish Organizations in New York, called the new policy "a  thoughtful approach."  </P> <P> Soviet Jews seeking to emigrate to the United States, as well as victims of  more recent persecutions such as Christian Armenians living in areas under the  control of Muslim Azerbaijanis, fear that their chances may be worsened by the  new rules.  </P> <P> Soviet citizens who gather daily outside the U.S. Embassy in Moscow seeking a  visa to emigrate said Wednesday that they were confused about the new rules and  concerned about how they would be affected.  </P> <P> The U.S. official, who talked with reporters with the understanding that he  would not be further identified, said the United States is simply trying to  treat the Soviet Union like any other country, and added, "This is the way  refugee business is done all over the world."  </P> <P> He said U.S. officials interviewing would-be immigrants will be taking greater  care to differentiate between victims of persecution and discrimination.  </P> <P> Under the new rules, applicants will pick up questionnaires in Moscow, fill  them out and send them to Washington, where immigration officials will study  them and, within three or four months, notify those they find to be acceptable  candidates for immigration.  </P> <P> The candidates will receive in the mail a letter notifying them of a time for  an appointment with U.S. officials in the embassy in Moscow.  </P> <P> Those who have close relatives living in the United States and are found by the  Moscow interviewer to be victims of persecution will be granted refugee status.  This carries with it about $7,000 each in resettlement aid, the official said.  </P> <P> Those with close relatives living in the United States who are not victims of  persecution, but are selected by Washington, will be allowed to enter the  country as "parolees," without official status but with permission to live and  work there.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Michael J. Ybarra, in Washington, contributed to this  report.  </P></p>

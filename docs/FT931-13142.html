			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Thames in TV and film joint venture THAMES TELEVISION is joining forces with International Artistes to co-produce a wide range of television and film projects for the world markets. Thames is investing a 'substantial' but undisclosed sum in the deal, which is an indication of the way television in the UK is moving closer to the US model. 'Television production is a mixture of talent and business. This partnership of the combined reputations of Thames and International Artistes will be a major creative force in an expanding broadcast industry,' Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames said yester-day. Now that Thames is no longer an ITV broadcaster it is free to do business with ITV, Sky, Channel 4, the BBC and others in a way that could not have happened before. The new partnership has already begun pre-production work on seven projects in the entertainment area including a controversial drama on the mystery surrounding the death of the 'King' of Rock'n Roll, Elvis Presley. The partnership's early comedy output will feature comedians Ronnie Corbett and Max Boyce. Ronnie Corbett will play the press secretary of one of the younger members of the Royal Family in an, as yet untitled, situation comedy. Feature films are also planned including the movie debut of Hale &amp; Pace. Recently Mr Dunn forecast that despite losing its ITV franchise Thames should have a turnover this year of Pounds 100m for its continuing businesses, particularly independent programme production. Meanwhile Thames says it is still talking with a wide range of potential investors in its Channel 5 consortium despite its application being rejected last month by the Indepen-dent Television Commission. The plan is to present the ITC with a properly-funded project as quickly as possi-ble. As well as companies such as Time Warner it is believed that CanWest, the Canadian international broadcaster which pulled out of the project last year, has shown renewed interest. Seeking a judicial review of the ITC's decision has not yet been formally ruled out.</p>

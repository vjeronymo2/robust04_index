			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Accounting body warns over cap on audit liability Auditors should not be protected from the consequences of professional negligence by an ability to limit their exposure to loss, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants says today in a submission to the Department of Trade and Industry. Most of the large accountancy firms face lawsuits for audit negligence as a result of some of the spectacular corporate collapses of recent years. The sums at stake are unprecedented, and the big firms have been lobbying for a change in the law to prevent the collapse of one or more of their number if a series of suits succeeded. But the association rejects as 'against the public interest' calls from some large accountants for a system whereby auditors and their clients can agree a cap on liability. Such agreements would encourage poor-quality audits, it says. 'It is better, in order to protect the quality of audit work, to allow the commercial pressures of competition to be counterbalanced by the threat of liability should audit work be found to be negligent.' Instead, the chartered association suggests that incorporation would give members of accountancy firms some protection against bankruptcy, and would make accountants' operations more transparent to public examination. Even if audit liability cases caused the collapse of one or two large firms, healthy competition would remain, the association says. Last Friday, in an increasingly typical move, Price Waterhouse, liquidators of Maxwell Communication Corporation, issued a writ against Coopers &amp; Lybrand for its audit of MCC in the year to December 1987 and the 15 months to March 1989. However, Price Waterhouse described the writ as a purely protective measure before action passed out of reach through the statute of limitations. It had no immediate plans to serve the writ, which contained no detailed accusations, or to take further action. Price Waterhouse is itself named in writs in connection with the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. It said: 'We all have drawers full of writs.' How many would lead to court action, and which ones, would not become clear for a considerable time, it said.</p>

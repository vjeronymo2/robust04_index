			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava April 19 (CTK) -- Slovak Economics  Minister Peter Magvasi said in Geneva on Monday [18 April] that  Slovakia was seeking acceleration of the ratification of the  European Agreement so that it might be associated with the  European Union (EU) soon, his spokesman told CTK today.  Slovakia signed the association agreement last October.    Speaking at a session of the UN European Economic  Commission,  Magvasi said that Slovakia's economic situation in 1993, the  first year of its independence, was influenced by the split of  Czechoslovakia and the ensuing split of the currency. The  economy was also affected by the taxation reform and recession  in advanced Western European countries, he added.    Compared with 1992, when the gross domestic product dropped  by 7 percent, the estimated decline of 3.7 percent last year was  relatively favourable, Magvasi said.    He added that consumer prices increased by 15 percent last  year against 1992, and that the rate of unemployment had  stabilised and reached 14.4 percent at the end of the year.    Magvasi said that the fundamental goals of Slovakia's  independent monetary policy in 1993 -- stabilisation of the  national currency, minimisation of inflationary trends,  maintenance of the balance of payments and increasing of  convertible currency reserves -- were in harmony with the  process of transformation.    He said that by the end of 1994 Slovakia would like to  accede  to the agreement on the cross-border effects of industrial  disasters.    Magvasi also said that Slovakia would welcome acceleration  of  the construction of the key "North-South" transport artery which  will effectively link the Scandinavian and Baltic states to  southern Europe via Poland, Slovakia and Hungary.</p>

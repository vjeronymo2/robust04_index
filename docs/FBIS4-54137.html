			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak  reported the outcome of the recent meeting of a group of 14  agricultural products exporting countries, or Cairns Group, in  Uruguay. He noted that several conclusions were made especially  on a push to lessen protectionism and subsidies for agricultural  goods in the world market.    On the occasion, the deputy prime minister said that  Thailand  proposed that the Cairns group include fishery products in its  list of agricultural goods so that the group could together push  developed countries to minimize their trade protectionism  against fishery products from other countries. Their objective  is especially focused on the United States, which often sets  conditions for imported fishery products from other countries.    Moreover, Suphachai noted that the proposal will be greatly  beneficial to Thailand. This is because fishery goods make up  half of the total value of all Thai agricultural products. This  proposal gained support from Australia, New Zealand, and  Argentina. Nevertheless, Chile was still reluctant to follow  suit for fear that the developed countries would use the  proposal as a bargaining tool to open up marine resources as  well.</p>

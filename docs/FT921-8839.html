			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Cuba doubles vegetable prices Cuba's government doubled the official prices of several vegetables yesterday, moving to cut heavy state farming subsidies and offset the rising cost of fertiliser, pesticide, herbicide and seed imports, Reuter reports from Havana. The official Communist party newspaper Granma announced the price increases to consumers who are already squeezed by tight rationing and shortages of some food products and practically all consumer goods.</p>

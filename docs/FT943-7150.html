			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Durable goods orders fall 4.2% US durable goods orders fell 4.2 per cent in July, the biggest decline in 2 1/2 years, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The drop in demand surprised analysts, many of whom had been predicting a moderate rise following strong increases of 1.2 per cent in June and 1.4 per cent in May. The drop in new orders by Dollars 6.4bn to a seasonally adjusted Dollars 144.9bn was largely attributed to a decline in orders for transportation equipment, which fell by 15.8 per cent last month to an adjusted Dollars 31.91bn. The substantial fall reflected the growing practice in the motor vehicle and parts industry of shutting down for two weeks in July, the Commerce Department said. Analysts expected a resurgence of motor industry orders in August and September as 1995 models went into production. The 4.2 per cent drop was the largest month-on-month drop since a 5.4 per cent drop in December 1991. But new orders are up 13.3 per cent over the same period a year ago. Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the drop in durable goods orders did not indicate an economic slowdown. 'We think the economy is ticking along well,' he said. The markets reacted positively. Although analysts had predicted a moderate rise in durable goods orders of between 1 per cent and 3 per cent, the drop seems to have been welcomed as evidence there will be a slowing in economic growth in the second half of this year. Mr Ram Bhagvatula, Citibank's chief economist in New York, welcomed the drop, saying that in combination with the Federal Reserve's rate rise last week, the economy could expect to see a moderation in production in the second half of the year.</p>

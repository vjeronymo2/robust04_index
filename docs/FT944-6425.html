			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (14): City centre versus outskirts - Businesses are moving out of town When John Lewis, the department stores group, announced this year it would close its Bristol store in 1997 and move to Cribbs Causeway, an out-of-town regional shopping centre, it sent shock waves through the city. It reinforced fears that Bristol was in danger of succumbing to the 'doughnut' effect, with retailers and companies moving to the city fringes and leaving a hollow centre. To the north of Bristol, in particular, there has been substantial development. This includes a Pounds 254m procurement headquarters being built for the Ministry of Defence. At more than 1m sq ft and designed for 5,700 staff, this is said to be the UK's largest current office development. Another big project nearby, on the Parkway business park, is a 600,000 sq ft headquarters for Sun Life which will house 2,400 staff. The staff will relocate from separate buildings in the city centre, reinforcing the 'doughnut' fears. Cribbs Causeway itself is north of Bristol, next to the M5 motorway. A development by Prudential Assurance and JT Bayliss, it is planned to have 650,000 sq ft of retail space, with John Lewis and Marks and Spencer taking a total of 230,000 sq ft. After two public inquiries, the shopping centre was approved by the environment secretary in 1991, before his department's tardy awareness of the effect on town centres of out-of-town stores. John Lewis's existing store is a mainstay of the city's principal shopping centre, Broadmead. It is a post-war centre, showing its age, with a dreary environment and poor access. As a result, it is calculated that Bristol attracts lower retail spending than should be expected of a regional capital. What John Lewis's decision has achieved is a concentration of minds. This has been further encouraged by the retail aspect of Bristol Development Corporation's proposed Quay Point, which is also perceived as a threat to Broadmead. For its part, the BDC argues that Quay Point, by improving the city's range of shopping, will help to arrest Broadmead's decline. There is now a positive intention to improve Broadmead by the council, which is the landlord, the retailers, and Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Initiative. 'Broadmead is not dead but it is sick - it needs revitalising,' says one leading chamber member. 'But I think with co-operation between the chamber and city it can be solved.' A new retail occupier is being sought for the five-storey John Lewis building. One improvement already has been the Norwich Union development of the Galleries' enclosed shopping centre near Broadmead. Although it opened during the recession, it has let reasonably well. For companies, the attractions of being north of Bristol have been the liberal planning policies of Northavon district council plus access to the M5 and M4 motorways. For example, the long-established Aztec West business park, managed by Arlington, has more than 80 companies. Pearce Developments has started infrastructure work for a second Parkway business park on 40 acres. At Bristol Business Park, a 38-acre site in north Bristol, contracts were exchanged this month between Bristol &amp; England Properties and Barclays Bank Pension Fund for the funding of its second phase. The Pounds 11m scheme is described as one of the largest speculative fundings in the Bristol area for five years. Longer-term, there is the prospect of commercial development on 400 acres at Emer sons Green. In contrast, companies have complained of transport and parking difficulties in the city centre and, at least until recently, of an unhelpful attitude by Bristol council. Hartnell Taylor Cook, the property consultant, describes the council as having hitherto taken a regressive attitude towards office development. Car parking was restricted to a ratio of one space per 5,000 sq ft. 'This policy has proved commercially unacceptable,' it remarks. Under its draft local plan, the council has revised that to one space per 2,000 sq ft. Mr Edward Cussen of King Sturge, comments that there is now a positive spirit of co-operation between the public authorities and private sector. 'Coupled with this are some outstanding development opportunities and signs that demand is increasing.' The doughnut effect may prove to have been exaggerated. Demand for space in the centre has not dried up, as indicated this year by Midland Life taking 30,000 sq ft of offices and Direct Line, the insurance company, occupying a 50,000 sq ft block. 'Instead of the city centre vacuum which was feared, big employers have moved in this year, bringing hundreds of new jobs with them,' says Mr Mike Henry, of Chesterton, the property consultant. King Sturge reports rents remain below Pounds 20 per sq ft but incentives to tenants are disappearing. In fact, there is a severe shortage of large, good quality offices in the centre. One plan is for Stonecutter Court, where Chesterton seeks an occupier for a proposed 113,000 sq ft building. Eaglebrook Properties has consent for Marlborough Gate, with 47,000 sq ft. Helical Bar has a speculative scheme at Venturers House, funded by Norwich Union. And Courage has applied for planning consent for 93,000 sq ft of offices on a disused part of its brewery. One deal just completed is the sale of the 26,000 sq ft Armourers' House for nearly Pounds 3.2m to clients of Henderson Property Fund. While Quay Point is a heavyweight project, it is rivalled in its ambitions by plans - promoted by the council - for Harbourside, a mixed-use scheme on the waterfront. The site is potentially one of the finest of any British city but has remained largely derelict for many years. At long last, agreement has been reached among the landowners and English Partnerships, the government's regeneration agency, has indicated support.</p>

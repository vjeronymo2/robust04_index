			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Management: Go away, Sir John - How do you respond to the advice of a troubleshooter? James Buxton looks at the case of Charles Letts When former company doctor Bill Gore became chief executive at the diary maker Charles Letts last year, the problems he was to tackle were already known in outline to several million people. A few months earlier Sir John Harvey-Jones, former ICI chairman-turned business guru, had breezed through the company in his popular Troubleshooter 2 television series as well as devoting a chapter of a book to it. Harvey-Jones had been called in by the Letts family (which then controlled the company) after it plunged heavily into loss in 1991. He examined its core diary publishing business and concluded it suffered from excess costs and too little capital, and was split inefficiently between a sales team in London and the printing plant at Dalkeith near Edinburgh. As for the company's diversification into book publishing, the division required more capital than Letts could afford and should be sold. All this was pungently conveyed to the urbane but wincing owners and managers of Letts in an agonising televised session. Later Harvey-Jones lamented to the camera that the Letts management 'have taken some actions, but not the ones that I would wish them to. I don't think that the family are yet sufficiently worried to take the actions I think they should.' That was in December 1992. The dramatic (but untelevised) sequel was that within weeks Letts' bankers Hambros, which had been supporting the business with loans and preference shares, lost confidence in the company's management under Anthony Letts, chairman from the sixth generation of the family. Gore was asked by Letts' accountants at the time, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, to draw up a recovery programme. In June 1993, at the insistence of Hambros and 3i, which had an equity stake in Letts, he became chief executive. The company was supported at the end of 1993 by a refinancing package worth Pounds 16m which came from Hambros, Morgan Grenfell, 3i and the new management. The Letts family's stake was drastically cut from 58 per cent to 15 per cent. Gore had not seen the Troubleshooter programme - and took took care not to watch the video so that he would be able to make up his own mind. But he too decided that many of the company's recent efforts to restore profitability amounted only to tinkering. He reckoned Letts had 'a good wide customer base and a good name, but an excess of costs and an excess of unnecessary activity'. However, he did not do everything Harvey-Jones suggested. One glaring source of excess costs was never identified as a problem by Harvey-Jones, even though he was often filmed visiting it - the company's stylish headquarters in Battersea, which was costing Pounds 1m a year in rent. 'I regarded that as fundamental,' says Gore. He quickly struck a deal with the landlord under which the building was leased to a new tenant at no cost to Letts and the remaining staff moved to Dalkeith. Like Harvey-Jones, Gore focused on the books publishing business and decided it had been rendered unviable by the sale in 1992 of its profitable line of examination revision guides, leaving a range of lifestyle books without the revenue to meet overheads. The division was sold at the end of 1993. A recurrent theme of the TV programme was that Letts should sell Mayfair Trunks, a shop in London that sells luxury goods. It was small but losing money, did not sell many Letts products and should not have been acquired, Harvey-Jones said. But Letts has not sold Mayfair Trunks. 'It is not draining cash and we have cut the staff to two,' Gore says. 'It's not worth spending management time on it. When rents improve we will find a good home for it.' Across the organisation Gore has trimmed surplus layers of management, shedding staff in the process. Of the three executives from the Letts family, all in their late 50s, Martin Letts and his cousin Timothy retired, while Anthony moved, 'after some quite fundamental discussions', from being executive to non-executive chairman and stepped down last August, remaining a director. Charles Letts, another family member, is a management trainee. Staff were also cut in the US, where Letts distributes diaries. Initially the new management attempted to diversify into producing corporate gifts, an idea proposed by Harvey-Jones, but it has since changed its mind and pulled out of that operation. The most important part of the business is the diary operation, which claims a quarter of the UK diary market but was, Gore says, under-performing and inflexible. The production process for printing standard diaries was too slow and it was taking too long to design and manufacture customised diaries for corporate clients. Gore praises the GMBU general union at Dalkeith for understanding 'the commercial realities of life' and abandoning the annual three-week works shutdown in midsummer, switching to staggered holidays and a system of working 30-hour weeks in the first half of the year and 45-hour weeks in the second half. Production staff were put into small groups to analyse problems. 'We identified the main problem as the slowness of changing plates in the presses at the end of a print run. We have now got that down by half, cutting the total production time by 25 per cent,' Gore says. Reflecting the slimmer company, turnover on continuing activities dropped from Pounds 30m in 1993 to Pounds 23.6m in the year to January 1994. A loss of Pounds 7.5m was reduced to Pounds 785,000. It made an operating profit of Pounds 2.2m. In retrospect Gore feels Harvey-Jones's investigation was a mixed blessing. It focused the attention of management and unions, and of the banks and investors, on the need for something to be done, and 'helped identify the real problems'. But, as a result of the programme, 'our customers withdrew a little bit (out of nervousness about the company's future) and certainly didn't come up with new proposals. And our sales force was left a little dead in the water'. In fact, he says: 'I'd like to see that man go away.' It's the sort of bluntness Harvey-Jones would respect.</p>

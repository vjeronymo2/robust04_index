			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: CAP fraud is too costly to pursue Sir, Like your correspondent Peter Marsh (European News Digest, May 25) I, too, heard the House of Lords European communities committee question Mr Jo Carey, former president of the European Court of Auditors. It was all too clear that the noble Lords do not yet understand the two main reasons for the escalating Common Agricultural Policy frauds. First, fraud becomes ever easier given the lax controls, exacerbated by the May 1992 McSharry (so-called) reforms which have now brought fraud 'down to the farm'. But second, and dominantly, there is no incentive for any European government to expose fraud by its own nationals. The present EU rules mean that upon exposure of the fraud the government concerned has to make full reparation to the EU and then try to reclaim this from the fraudster. Politicians are thus content to believe that CAP fraud amounts to 'only' Pounds 150m rather than the actual Pounds 6bn as estimated by Mr Carey's successor as court president.

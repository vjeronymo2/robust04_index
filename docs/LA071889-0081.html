			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Hart Lee Dykes, a first-round National Football League draft choice of the New  England Patriots, has agreed to terms for a 1990 minor league contract with the  Chicago White Sox.  </P> <P> Dykes, a left-handed pitcher, has been working out in Sarasota, Fla., with the  White Sox rookie team. Dykes was the Chicago's 54th selection in the June  amateur draft.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-4, 220-pound Dykes, who played at Oklahoma State, was the first wide  receiver taken in April's NFL draft and was the 16th player selected overall.  </P> <P> White Sox General Manager Larry Himes said Dykes "signed a contract for a  Class-A salary. There was no bonus money involved."  </P> <P> Asked if Dykes might be using baseball as leverage in negotiations with the  Patriots, Himes said: "I don't know. This was his personal choice. Maybe he  wants to play both baseball and football."  </P> <P> Patrick Sullivan, New England general manager, said in a prepared statement:  "When we drafted Hart Lee, we knew he was an exceptional athlete who had pro  baseball potential. In our conversation with his agent (Monday), however, he  left no doubt that football is Hart's first choice."  </P></p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Airbus hits crosswinds THE REVELATION that Boeing is in talks with half of the Airbus consortium about developing a super-jumbo airliner should make the governments of Europe sit up and take notice. Airbus is the EC's most successful example of state-sponsored industrial planning. The Boeing deal could threaten its ultimate dissolution. It would also raise questions of competition on a global scale, since the proposed new consortium could end up as monopoly supplier to the top end of the world market. The deal might be blocked by the competition authorities on either side of the Atlantic, since US or EC airlines would have a reduced choice of supplier. But it is conceivable that a product with development costs of Dollars 10bn is a natural monopoly, on the grounds that the market is not big enough to support duplication of effort. Indeed, perhaps only a transatlantic consortium of the type proposed could undertake it. If so, to block the deal would be to deny the market the product. It might thus be sensible to allow the consortium to proceed and submit it to some kind of global regulation. The separate question then arises of why such a consortium should not involve Airbus as a whole, rather than only two of its members. It is perhaps too early to rule that out. If Boeing secures the agreement of the German and British partners, there will be considerable pressure on the French and Spanish partners to fall into line. This would have the effect of introducing US influence into a showcase EC project. But if Airbus's partners are already breaking ranks, the alternative might be the ultimate demise of almost the only serious competitor Boeing faces on the world stage. But other steps are needed as well. The apparent willingness of the British and German partners to consider throwing their lot in with Boeing shows how urgent it is that Airbus's shaky structure should be strengthened. In particular, it is high time that Airbus moved forward to the status of a conventional public company. The French government, which is a partner through its ownership of Aerospatiale, might not relish its new status as a mere minority shareholder. But to the extent that Airbus is an irrational structure, it is the fault of governments. It is the job of governments to sort it out. Whether Airbus deserves nurturing as a beacon of EC industrial policy is a more debatable question. The EC is not alone in identifying aerospace as one of the key industrial growth areas of the future. Ultimately, though, it is no more sensible to lose money in a growing market than in a declining one. Airbus has been a huge drain on public funds for years, and its finances remain opaque. If it is to serve as an example of industrial policy, the minimum requirement is that it should make the kind of profits appropriate to a public company. Not the least argument for a conventional corporate structure is that taxpayers would be provided with published accounts to help them judge that for themselves.</p>

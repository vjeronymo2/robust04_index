			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUIT CITES ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS  </P> <P> The city failed to conduct proper environmental reviews of a developer's  application to subdivide parcels of foothill land flanking her single-family  home, a homeowner charged in a lawsuit filed last week in Pomona Superior  Court.  </P> <P> Developer Everett Hughes submitted separate applications for the subdivisions:  one in 1987 to create a 32-lot subdivision on 72 acres, and the other in 1989  to subdivide a 2.7-acre lot into five residential lots.  </P> <P> The city approved both requests but scaled down the larger proposal to 26 lots.  </P> <P> In her suit, filed March 12, Lone Hill Avenue homeowner Diane Michelsen asked  the court to order the city to rescind its decisions, and to require a new  environmental impact report considering both subdivisions as a single proposal.  </P> <P> Michelsen's attorney, Ronald Ballard, said the city's approvals are invalid  under the California Environmental Quality Act because the previous  environmental review considered the proposals separately. No date has been set  for the case, but it must be heard within 90 days, he said.  </P> <P> City Atty. Cheryl Kane and developer Hughes did not return phone calls seeking  comment.  </P> <P> Michelsen is a co-founder of the slow-growth group Glendora Pride. She said she  helped establish the group two years ago in response to the impending  development around her home.  </P></p>

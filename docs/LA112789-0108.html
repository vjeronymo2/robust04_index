			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> MOBILE CHOLESTEROL TESTERS HIT  </P> <P> More people are having their cholesterol levels tested by inexpensive mobile  health services, but there is evidence that many of the facilities are unsafe  and inaccurate, a government report said today.  </P> <P> The Health and Human Services Department study said some of the screening  violates federal guidelines for controlling blood-borne diseases such as AIDS  and hepatitis, which call for technicians to wear new gloves each time blood is  drawn and to dispose of bloody materials in specially marked containers.  </P> <P> The report found examples of used needles thrown into regular garbage cans,  technicians taking blood -- sometimes from a vein -- without wearing gloves or  wearing used ones, and blood covering mats and counters at sites frequently  operated amid the tumult of a grocery store or shopping mall.  </P></p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Burnfield shares fall 29p despite profits rise PROFITS of Burnfield, the West Midlands-based specialist engineer, improved from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.27m pre-tax for the six months ended July 2. The market, however, was disappointed with the results and marked the group's share price down by 29p to 124p. Mr Brian McGowan, chairman, said the business climate 'remained unpredictable'. He pointed out that some recovery was apparent in the US, demand in the UK was variable and recessionary forces continued to affect the group's French and German markets. Sales for the half year improved from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 18.4m, which included Pounds 1.16m from acquisitions. Earnings per share dipped to 2.2p (3.9p) but the interim dividend is being maintained at 1.65p. The results included a one-off Pounds 300,000 provision to restructure Isopad's operation in France and thus eliminate losses. The Isopad offshoot is a maker of heating products. At period end group net borrowings were Pounds 2.5m compared with net cash balances of Pounds 3.1m at end-December 1992. The movement primarily reflected the acquisition of Desgranges et Huot in March for Pounds 5.2m, including assumed borrowings. Mr McGowan said the overall outlook for Burnfield was encouraging. He said the balance sheet remained strong which enabled the group to 'focus on growth, both organic and by appropriate acquisitions'.</p>

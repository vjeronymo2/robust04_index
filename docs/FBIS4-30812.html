			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Members of the Council of Bosnian  Posavina, deputies from that area, and members of the Croat  National Council of Bosnian Posavina had a meeting in Sarajevo  today. Army General Rasim Delic, commander of the supreme  command headquarters of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, spoke about  the current military (situation) in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Bosnian Posavina. Mladen Bosnjak has a report.    [Bosnjak] As Rifad (Semulabegovic), president of the Council  of Bosnian Posavina, said in an introductory speech, the aim of  the meeting of people from Posavina is to adopt conclusions on  the eve of tomorrow's session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  assembly. They want to define the relationship of the  federation's assembly with Posavina. [passage omitted]    At the beginning of his speech, Army General Rasim Delic  stressed that the balance of military power in Posavina is such  that the aggressor, although technically incomparably superior,  cannot do much to change the front lines. Regardless of the  possibility of winning, Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units will not  launch attacks on the technically superior aggressor and  sacrifice its' people. However, they will use any opportunity to  capture territory that is strategically very important for the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. He gave examples of having captured  the strategically important locations such as Vijenac on Mt.  Ozren and some locations on Mt. Vlasic. Speaking about the  military aspect of severing the corridor near Brcko, Mr. Delic  said:    [Begin Delic recording] The army headquarters has made an  official statement, I hope that our political bodies will uphold  it, that if the Security Council discusses the protected area it  will only speak about the protected zone of the free territory  of Brcko, not of Serb-held Brcko. To protect Brcko is to protect  the occupation. The deployment of the observers on the Serb side  is a trap for us because they will monitor our activities. They  wanted to ensure that if we start attacking, then we will be  accused. [passage indistinct]    Yesterday I had specific talks with Croat General Petkovic  to  see what interest the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] has to take  part in [word indistinct] Bosnian Posavina. Bosnian Posavina  does not belong only to the Muslims or the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army.    In the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army there are Muslims as well as  people of other nationalities. We must find common ground.  [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

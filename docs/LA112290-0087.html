			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CONTROLLED BURNS PROMPT INQUIRIES  </P> <P> More than 50 controlled burns took place throughout Ventura County on  Wednesday, sending smoke through the air and prompting residents to wonder if  there was a brush fire.  </P> <P> About 200 people called the County Government Center to ask what was on fire,  said Larry Scott, an inspector with the Air Pollution Control District.  </P> <P> The agricultural burns are used to dispose of such things as tumbleweeds and  old trees that have been cut down to make room for new crops and can take place  only on days forecast for certain weather conditions that help disperse smoke  and ash, Scott said.  </P> <P> However, contrary to the forecast, Wednesday turned out to be a poor day for  burning, said Herm Ragsdale, an air quality specialist with the district.  </P> <P> An air mass held pollutants near ground level rather than letting them escape,  Ragsdale said.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Early this morning the leader of the gang that was  transporting 7.5 metric tons [as heard] of cocaine from  Tocantins State to Santos, Sao Paulo State, was arrested.  Colombian Vicentico Junior [Vicente Wilson Rivera-Ramos] had  spent two days hiding in the forest along the Tocantins River's  banks.    Federal Police now are investigating the gang's links with  international drug trafficking. The group is believed to be a  Brazilian branch of the Cali cartel.    The eight Brazilians and three Colombians arrested during  the  operation will be transferred to Brasilia.</p>

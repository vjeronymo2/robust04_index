			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 Feb (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR wonders  whether the United Nations has become an establishment that only  follows the orders of the major Western countries. It asks if  the UN Charter has been amended to bless aggression against  nations and human rights violations and reward aggressors.    In its editorial today, the newspaper says that the United  Nations, the Security Council, and the major powers are adopting  an unbelievable position and that the massacres inflicted on the  people of Bosnia-Herzegovina over the past two years reveal that  the international organization established in 1945 to defend  security and prevent aggression is now only a scarecrow, like  that which farmers set up to scare off crows.    The paper urges the Islamic countries not to remain  spectators to this tragedy. The blood of a Muslim nation is  being shed and its territory has become a human slaughterhouse.</p>

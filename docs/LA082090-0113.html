Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FOOD STAMP ROLLS RISE SHARPLY  </P> <P> A large jump in the number of people eligible for food stamps and welfare  benefits this year is costing states and the federal government billions of  dollars, a published report said today.  </P> <P> At least 44 states have reported increases in enrollment, with some rising up  to 50%, according to an Agriculture Department report quoted in The New York  Times.  </P> <P> The number of people receiving food stamps rose by 1.3 million from May, 1989,  to May, 1990, when it topped 20 million for the first time since 1985, found a  report submitted to Congress by the Agriculture Department.  </P> <P> The department, which administers the food stamp program, noted that food stamp  rolls have risen 16% in the last year in Texas, 19% in Florida, 26% in Nevada,  54% in New Hampshire, 12% each in Georgia and Massachusetts, 7% each in New  York State and California, and 21% in Connecticut.  </P> <P> Congress appropriated $14.8 billion, but that proved inadequate and it had to  provide an additional $1.2 billion in May. It then directed the Agriculture  Department to investigate the causes.  </P></p>

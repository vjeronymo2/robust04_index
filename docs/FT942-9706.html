			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / EU considers tourism impact European Union environment ministers discussed the effect of tourism, one of Europe's most profitable sectors, on the environment at an informal meeting yesterday. 'There is a common view that we need to face environment management as a whole in areas under tourist pressure,' said Greek deputy minister for the environment Ms Elisavet Papazoi, who is presiding over the two-day meeting. Santorini, considered by many the most stunning of Greece's Cycladic islands, served as a perfect backdrop for the talks, not only because of its natural beauty but also the evident destruction that masses of travellers have brought to its once quiet town. Ms Papazoi said the main square of Fira, where the meeting will continue today, was a good example of bad catering for tourism, with its profusion of neon lights, electrical wires and traffic congestion. She said she planned to propose Santorini, which also boasts a well preserved ruin of a city dating to 1450 BC, as the site for an EU pilot programme for sustainable developments.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Smith urges four-tier government - Constitutional Reform MR JOHN Smith, shadow chancellor, yesterday threw his formidable political weight behind his party's commitment to radical constitutional reform if Labour wins the general election. Speaking at a lunch organised by the Newspaper Press Fund, the journalists' charity, Mr Smith called for the large-scale dispersal of decision-making from Whitehall and Westminster to update 'the constitutional architecture' of the UK. Drawing a strong link between systems of government and relative prosperity, he contrasted the UK's relative decline with Germany's economic success. Mr Smith dismissed the idea that the Commons was among the west's powerful and effective legislatures. Concentration of political authority in the executive had left parliament weak and out of date. Devolution for Scotland and closer integration in the European Community should be seen as the starting point for reforms. He envisaged a structure in which power was properly shared across four tiers of government. At the lowest level would be local authorities. Above them the Scottish, Welsh and English regional assemblies proposed by Labour. The third and fourth tiers would be Westminster and Brussels respectively. Mr Smith did not mention a move to a proportional voting system at Westminster. Colleagues believe he would back such a change, however, if it smoothed the transition to more devolved government. Mr Neil Kinnock has professed himself to be 'open-minded' about proportional representation. Mr Jack Cunningham and Mr Robin Cook, however, are among a growing number of leading Labour figures openly backing a switch from the first-past-the-post voting system. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, is expected to take up the theme in a speech next Monday to Charter 88, the pressure group for constitutional change.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCCANEERS CONTINUE TURNAROUND, 26-14;  </P> <P> NFC: VINNY TESTAVERDE PASSES FOR A SEASON-HIGH 292 YARDS AS TAMPA BAY DEFEATS  THE PACKERS TO REMAIN UNBEATEN AGAINST CENTRAL DIVISION TEAMS.  </P> <P> Vinny Testaverde and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers continued their turnarounds  Sunday in a 26-14 victory over the Green Bay Packers.  </P> <P> Testaverde, demonstrating the maturity that has made him the NFL's top-rated  passer, completed 17 of 29 passes for a season-high 292 yards and a touchdown.  </P> <P> The Buccaneers (4-2), who were 5-11 last season, are off to their best start  since 1981 and have a 4-0 record against NFL Central Division opponents.  </P> <P> "We would have liked to have scored more, but we had some breakdowns here and  there," said Testaverde, who is in his fourth season out of Miami. "We just  have to work on those things and come back strong next week."  </P> <P> Two years ago, Testaverde had an NFL-high 35 interceptions and passed for only  13 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Last year, he was intercepted 22 times and passed for 20 touchdowns.  </P> <P> But Testaverde's 14-yard touchdown pass to Ron Hall against the Packers gave  him eight touchdowns against only two interceptions this season. He has not  been intercepted in his last 96 attempts.  </P> <P> Wayne Haddix, returning from a knee sprain, ran back one of Tampa Bay's five  interceptions for a touchdown as the Buccaneers dealt Green Bay (2-4) its  fourth loss in five weeks.  </P> <P> Tampa Bay Coach Ray Perkins, who was criticized for unimaginative play-calling  in last week's 14-10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, opened with four consecutive  passing plays against the Packers -- three of them completions that set up the  first of four field goals by Steve Christie.  </P> <P> "I told the offensive line, 'We're gonna come out throwing it, loosen them up a  little bit, then we'll settle in and get back to our game plan,' " Perkins  said. "We wanted to loosen it up, but quite frankly I wanted to get some points  on the board."  </P> <P> Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski completed 25 of 42 passes for 355 yards and  one touchdown, but his five interceptions helped Tampa Bay build a 26-7 lead  and thwarted Green Bay's effort to come back.  </P> <P> "I get a lot of the glory when we win, so I take my share of the blame when we  lose," Majkowski said. "I made some poor decisions."  </P> <P> Haddix intercepted a sideline pass intended for Sterling Sharpe and returned it  29 yards for his second touchdown of the season.  </P> <P> Haddix had another interception on a tipped ball near the Buccaneers' goal line  that stopped a Packer threat in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Winston Moss, Harry Hamilton and Mark Robinson also intercepted Majkowski  passes.  </P> <P> "It's a simple fact that we can't be as charitable as we've been. . . ," said  Green Bay Coach Lindy Infante, whose team had six turnovers.  </P> <P> "I haven't given up on this team, and I don't expect anyone else to."  </P> <P> Green Bay scored both of its touchdowns in the third quarter. Ironically, one  of them came on Hamilton's interception.  </P> <P> The Tampa Bay safety picked off a pass at the Buccaneers' one, fumbled into the  end zone on the return and the Packers' Jeff Query recovered for the touchdown.  </P> <P> Majkowski passed eight yards to Herman Fontenot for the other touchdown.  </P> <P> Sharpe had seven receptions for 139 yards.  </P> <P> Buccaneer running back Gary Anderson rushed for 46 yards in 11 carries and had  four receptions for 96 yards -- the sixth consecutive game he has gained more  than 100 yards from scrimmage.  </P></p>

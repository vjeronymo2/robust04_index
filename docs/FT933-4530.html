			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Casino group seeks ADollars 246m AN Australian company that successfully bid for a licence to build and operate a casino in Melbourne aims to raise ADollars 246m (USDollars 164.00m) through an initial public offering of shares, AP-DJ reports from Melbourne. The licence was awarded to a consortium of companies, including Foster's Brewing and property developer Hudson Conway, following a bid earlier this week of ADollars 750m to the Victoria state government. The consortium has formed Crown Casino which is to take a stock market listing late this year or early 1994 to pay for part of their successful bid. Investment institutions and private shareholders will be offered ADollars 246.0m of shares, or 60 per cent of Crown, and the three-member consortium will take up the rest, giving the company an issued capital of ADollars 410m.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Enterprise first-half plunge to Pounds 34.6m gets market welcome SHARES IN Enterprise, the independent oil company, yesterday jumped 19p to 317p in spite of the company's announcement of a near-halving of after tax profits from Pounds 60.3m to Pounds 34.6m in the first half of 1992. The company blamed the twin effects of recession and weak sterling oil prices for the fall. But the net income figure was close to the top end of analysts' forecasts, and with a maintained dividend of 6.5p, prompted a recovery in the share price. The shares had lost 13p in the last two days on fears of a dividend cut. Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive, said the company was on track almost to double its daily oil production to more than 260,000 barrels a day by 1995. Enterprise is developing a number of North Sea fields to add to the 20 already producing. The two biggest, the Scott and Nelson fields in the central North Sea, are due to come on-stream late next year and in 1994. The company will also benefit from its interests in the Elf Enterprise joint venture, whose Piper, Saltire and Chanter fields are due to begin producing next year. Production in the first half of 1992 rose by 5.9 per cent to 135,500 b/d, but a drop in average oil prices from Pounds 12.13 to Pounds 10.59 a barrel caused turnover to fall from Pounds 244.4m to Pounds 239.5m. Net interest income also fell, reflecting an increase in capital expenditure from Pounds 116.9m to Pounds 133.4m. Despite the increase in spending, however, gearing dropped to 46 per cent from 49 per cent at the end of last year, due largely to a successful Dollars 172m US preference share issue. Earnings per share fell from 13.2p to 7.9p. COMMENT Barring disaster, Enterprise should almost double its oil production by 1995 and is comfortably financed. Its management also has a reputation for prudence and shareholder loyalty, which has helped the share price to hold up in an otherwise severely depressed exploration and production sector. Moreover, with Enterprise expected to run large cash-flow surpluses from the mid-1990s, patient shareholders should be rewarded by strong dividend growth. In the shorter term, the expected sale of its stake in the Hudson field for about Pounds 25m will be required if full-year forecasts of about Pounds 74m are to be achieved, while increased costs and expenditure may reduce earnings and raise gearing next year. But Enterprise is in a better position to maintain its dividend than, say, rival Lasmo. At a yield of 6.7 per cent, Enterprise is still seen as the stock to be in in the E&amp;P sector.</p>

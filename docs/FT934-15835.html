			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Make sure of tax credit Sir, When our family receives dividends by post from companies in which we are shareholders there is often a tear-off form to request future dividends to be paid directly into a bank account for the convenience of all concerned. However, in the instructions as to how to complete the form, very few companies mention that they would still send the tax voucher to the registered address of the recipient. If my experience is anything to go by, any such vouchers that are sent to one's bank for eventual onward transmission to the shareholder either seem to get 'lost' or disappear en route; I certainly will not sign a dividend instruction unless the registrar agrees to send me the voucher showing tax credit, holding etc. I wonder how many other shareholders take a similar view? Registrars of companies such as Southern Water and Rolls-Royce do indeed mention on the form that tax vouchers will be sent direct to the shareholder so why cannot others confirm similarly?

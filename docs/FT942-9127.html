			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Traders stand by for news on US interest rates - Market Report The London stock market joined with other European bourses in holding its breath yesterday as it waited for the US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee to meet today. UK analysts appeared to be expecting, indeed hoping for, the Fed to announce a decisive increase in its key interest rates, perhaps as much as 50 basis points in both the Federal discount rate and Federal Funds rate. Such a move, while perhaps discomforting for markets in the short run, would be regarded as the best way to restore stability to global bond markets, and thus set the background for a genuine advance in share prices. With little else but the FOMC meeting to focus on, UK equities lacked direction as they made a start to the new trading account with a relatively lightly traded session. An attempt to move forward was thwarted when UK government bonds proved unable to develop a lasting trend, and the FT-SE 100 Index moved in a narrow range around its previous close. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 3,115.6 for a net loss of 3.6. Earlier, the index had been 14.4 ahead, helped by the latest domestic producer price data, which was in line with expectations and regarded as neutral on inflation pressures. Other hurdles on the domestic economy lie ahead this week, notably tomorrow, when the market faces the latest retail price index, and data on unemployment, average earnings and public sector borrowing. The concensus is for a monthly rise of 1.3 per cent in the retail price index. But these are overshadowed by the meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee today, which was reflected by firmness in the US currency towards the close of trading in London yesterday. Statistics on US industrial output and capacity utilisation appeared to leave unchanged the likelihood of a tightening in US credit policy. The UK market slightly underperformed other European markets, reinforcing perceptions that the UK is seen as closer to the US in terms of the economic cycle, and therefore more likely to see domestic interest rates rise while France and Germany look for further reductions. Trading volume, as recorded by the Seaq electronic trading system, was about 18 per cent down from Friday's level, at 548.4m shares. Friday afternoon saw increased activity when securities houses unwound positions as the trading account came to its end; 671.7m shares were traded in that session for a retail worth of Pounds 1.43bn. Second line issues played a subdued role, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 14.9 to 3,706.9 yesterday. The FT-SE 100 stocks found some impetus from the stock index futures market, a factor of no effect on the second-liners. Market analysts were taking a cautious view at the beginning of a week in which so much will depend on developments across the Atlantic. Although nervous regarding US rate policy, most UK analysts believe that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor of the exchequer, will be unwilling to raise domestic interest rates in the near term in what Kleinwort Benson describes as 'an environment of economic slowdown'. Nikko commented that UK consumers do not appear to have reacted sharply to the tax increases introduced this month, although it adds that consumer related companies are 'still finding things difficult'.</p>

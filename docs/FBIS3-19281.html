			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has declared that the  request to use the Turkish straits as an oil route poses a great  danger to Istanbul -- with its population of 10 million -- and  the accident that occurred last night has once again  demonstrated this. Cetin stated that the most appropriate route  for the safe transportation of the oil from the Caucasus and  Central Asia is an oil pipeline via Turkey.    Cetin replied to questions by TRT correspondent Ersin  Kucukbarak.    [Begin recording] [Kucukbarak] Two foreign ships collided  in the Bosporus last night and the population of Istanbul was  again faced with great danger. Given the fact that there are  requests to use the Istanbul strait as an oil route, how do you  evaluate last night's incident?    [Cetin] Istanbul, which has a population of 10 million, was  really faced with great danger as a result of the collision of  two ships last night. This shows that the passage of flammable  and explosive substances, such as oil, from the Bosporus will  create problems, especially from a safety viewpoint. For the  past few years, we have been trying to explain to both our  neighboring countries and to transporters using the route the  safety problems entailed in this. Last night's incident  demonstrated once again how justified we are in our sensitivity  to the matter.    Turkey believes that the passage from the straits should be  regulated by certain rules. To this end, a statute was drawn up  with the contribution of my ministry. This statue is due to  come into effect on 1 July 1994. The arrangements stipulated in  the statute comply with the Montreux Treaty. When the statue is  implemented, such accidents will be reduced to a minimum, but I  do not believe that this will constitute a total solution. The  Istanbul strait is one the most dangerous sea routes in the  world. At certain points, this strait becomes as narrow as 700  meters. Given the tonnage of today's ships, even their ordinary  passage becomes highly dangerous. Transit traffic through the  straits has become increasingly intense in recent years. More  than 50,000 ships pass through Istanbul every year.    Turkey cannot remain indifferent to such an important issue.  This is unthinkable. The Bosporus is extremely important  because of the people around it. The Istanbul strait cannot be  utilized for long to serve such a purpose from the  environmental, security, and technical viewpoints. In the  future, dry cargo traffic will increase and the development of  Ukraine and the Russian Federation will contribute to this  increase. Therefore, we propose the following as an ultimate  solution: The Istanbul strait should not used for the  transportation of flammable and explosive materials such as oil.  If at all, it should be used at a minimum.    Therefore, for some time now, we have been explaining these  problems, introducing new arrangements, and speaking to  neighboring countries. We are seeking a definitive and lasting  solution with a view to preventing the increasing traffic in the  future. This solution consists of transporting crude oil to the  Mediterranean via pipelines to pass through Turkey. Last  night's incident has unfortunately once again demonstrated how  justified we are on this matter. It seems that the world wishes  to ignore such dangers as long as it does not witness or  experience them. For a long time, we have been trying to  explain that the Istanbul strait cannot be used to this end.  Therefore, as an ultimate solution, the Bosporus should not be  used to transport dangerous substances like oil and the oil  should be transported to the Mediterranean via pipelines through  Turkey.    [Kucukbarak] Would this entail a change in the Montreux  Treaty?    [Cetin] Actually, there is no need to make an amendment to  the Montreux Treaty for the oil pipeline. A change is also not  necessary for the new statue. In other words, even if Turkey  does not rediscuss the Montreux Treaty, it cannot allow this.  It cannot endanger a city with 10 million people.

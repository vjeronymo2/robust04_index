			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> MOMIX WARHORSES AT SADDLEBACK COLLEGE  </P> <P> Momix, the 10-year-old company of dance illusionists, is starting to look like  Mo-formula. In a bill full of warhorses from their 1975-88 repertory Saturday  at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, repeated motifs made a once-innovative  style seem as tired as the dancers themselves.  </P> <P> Like artistic director Moses Pendleton's first company, Pilobolus, Momix  combines fantasy themes, strange beasts and large props together with an  athletic if unspectacular modern-dance vocabulary.  </P> <P> Among the familiar works, the interludes that held up best were the ones with  few or no props: "Kiss Off Spider Woman" (1986), an authoritative solo  featuring a game Beth Starosta; Cynthia Quinn's gestural "Bird in My Dreams"  (1987); and "Alruane" (1975), a seemingly Indian-inspired duet in which Karl  Baumann and Starosta interacted so well it was difficult to tell which limbs  belonged to which dancer.  </P> <P> Alan Boeding's "Circle Walker" (1983), a duet for the  choreographer-dancer-sculptor and a large, rolling metal device, was cramped on  the mid-size stage, but managed nonetheless to suggest human turmoil.  </P> <P> "Spawning" (1986), on the other hand, a nature parable in which three nearly  naked women (Lisa Giobbi, Quinn and Starosta) danced with huge balloons between  their legs, was riddled with formulaic movement.  </P> <P> Other gimmick dances -- such as "Venus Envy" (1986), with its two women inside  a giant clam shell, or the life-size partner puppet of Quinn's "When We're  Alone" (1988) -- remained no more than visual one-liners.  </P> <P> Last and perhaps least, for those who like high-tech shadow puppets, there was  Momix's sign-off, "E. C." (1982), an extended scrim and strobe routine, heavy  on the cute and more than a little dated. JAN BRESLAUER  </P></p>

He said so in an interview with  INTERFAX given upon his return to Simferopol from Kiev, where he  conferred with President Kravchuk on Friday.    According to Meshkov, his conference with the Ukrainian  president passed in a "frank atmosphere" and gave "a new  impetus" to relations between the Crimea and Ukraine.  Nevertheless he noted that the problems faced by his republic  remain the same: The lack of social security, rising crime, the  Black Sea Fleet.    For its part, the press service of the Crimean president  told  INTERFAX that Meshkov had returned from Kiev "satisfied with his  talks there". Right after his visit to Kiev Meshkov went on  vacation, the press service added.    Earlier the leader of the domestic politics service of  Ukraine's president, Nikolay Mikhalchenko, said that the meeting  was "open and constructive, and the two sides reached agreement  easily".    Judging by the official communique released after the  meeting  by the press service of Ukraine's president, the two sides  focused on economic issues. During the talks they agreed to  form a mixed working group representing the Ukrainian and  Crimean governments, and discussed a mechanism for maintaining  working contacts between the two presidents. Meshkov outlined  to Kravchuk a model for developing economic ties between the  peninsula and its traditional partners - Russia and other CIS  countries.    In the meantime the journalists who saw the two presidents  have said that after his meeting with Kravchuk Meshkov looked  "depressed".</p>

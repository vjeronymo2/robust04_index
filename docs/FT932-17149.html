			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Kashmir rebel leader murdered DR Abdul Ahad Guru, one of India's top heart surgeons and a prominent supporter of the Kashmir rebellion, was killed yesterday, dealing a blow to the government's plans to revive the political process in the state. Dr Guru would have been a key figure in any attempt by the government to negotiate with the militants, and his death yesterday will prove a strong deterrent to any moderate voice in the state. More than 12 people, including the dead doctor's brother-in-law, were later killed when security forces opened fire on his funeral procession. Small processions took to the streets defying curfew in some parts of Srinagar, the capital, shouting anti-India slogans, and the mourners, for whom killings by security forces and militants have become a daily feature in the past three years, cried openly in the streets. Dr Guru's body, shot at three times at close range, was found yesterday morning. He had been abducted on Wednesday by armed militants who hijacked his car as he was driving to a meeting of the Supreme Revolutionary Command Council of the militant Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front of which he was one of the main leaders. The JKLF and other militant groups accused Indian agents of killing him. Home ministry officials blamed the militants. The government is preparing a series of measures to try to solve the three-year crisis in Kashmir. It has replaced the discredited state governor and plans other personnel changes to revive the defunct administration, as well as economic grants and an amnesty for some prisoners. There are also plans to grant an amnesty to Kashmiris in custody against whom there are no serious charges. In Srinagar, militants are openly derisive of the government's approach.</p>

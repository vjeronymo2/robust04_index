			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa insisted Friday [4 February] on a 7 percent indirect  tax despite a coalition agreement earlier in the day to scrap  his proposal to impose a "national welfare tax."    Hosokawa argued for the 7 percent rate at a meeting with  Japanese reporters at his official residence.    Hosokawa said the 7 percent rate for the indirect tax is  necessary to finance tax cuts of 6 trillion yen the government  was planning to implement as part of a new comprehensive  pump-priming package.    He said the revenue-boosting measure is indispensable to  enable his administration to compile the fiscal 1994 state  budget.    "I want coalition party leaders to come up with the right  answer as quickly as possible so the government can compile the  state budget according to its originally scheduled timing," he  said.    The premier's statement came a few hours after the leaders  of  the coalition announced they had renounced his plan to introduce  the new 7 percent tax and implement a tax cut of 6 trillion yen.    The coalition leaders decided to give up the tax program to  avert a political crisis which was threatening to scuttle the  seven-party coalition government.    The Social Democratic Party, the biggest in the alliance,  threatened to quit the coalition unless it abandoned the plan  which the party said would amount to a de facto doubling of the  current 3 percent consumption tax.    Earlier on Friday, Hosokawa apologized for failing to ensure  "sufficient contact among the government and ruling coalition  parties" before announcing a package of tax cuts and increases,  coalition officials said.    Hosokawa offered the apology at a meeting of cabinet  ministers following the day's regular cabinet session, the  officials said.    In a meeting with Hiroyuki Sonoda, a senior official of the  alliance between the Japan New Party (JNP) and Sakigake  (Harbinger), Hosokawa expressed the hope that the coalition  parties will discuss the tax reform plan, the officials said.    Hosokawa heads the JNP, while Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura leads Sakigake. Both parties are in the  ruling coalition.</p>

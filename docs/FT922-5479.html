			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week - Primula sieboldii A very attractive genus of Asiatic primroses, mainly from Japan, and flowering in late spring and early summer. The leaves are softly hairy, the flower stems about six inches high but variable and the primrose-like flowers are carried in loose clusters. They are variable in colour from white to lavender and pink to quite deep shades of red. Numerous varieties have been given garden names but this has never been a really common or popular plant. It is hardy and thrives in peaty soils that are porous but do not dry out readily. A little shade will do it no harm.</p>

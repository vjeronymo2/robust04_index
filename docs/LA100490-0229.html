MIKE PORT IS RETAINED AS GENERAL MANAGER.  </P> <P> Richard M. Brown was appointed president and chief executive officer of the  Angels today, a move that means the duties of owner Gene Autry will be reduced.  </P> <P> Brown, 47, has been a member of the Angels' board of directors since 1986 and  the team's legal counsel since 1981.  </P> <P> It was also announced at a news conference at Anaheim Stadium that Mike Port  will continue full-time baseball activities as the Angels' executive vice  president and general manager.  </P> <P> "The baseball environment has exploded within the recent past with regards to  both technical aspects and talent, search and evaluation requirements," Port  said.  </P> <P> "The new structure will enable me along with Dan O'Brien, senior vice-president  of baseball operations, Bill Bavasi, director of minor league operations, and  Bob Fontaine, our scouting director, to devote full attention to improving the  Angels' on-field product."  </P> <P> As president, Brown will oversee the entire operation and be responsible to  ownership.  </P> <P> Autry, who turned 83 last week, is a former singer and actor who has owned the  Angels since they were formed as an American League expansion team in 1961.  </P> <P> "I am obviously honored by the Autrys' confidence and the position entrusted to  me," Brown said. "My responsibilities will include a portion of the demands  previously handled by Mr. and Mrs. Autry and a portion of the corporate  administrative duties previously handled by Mike (Port).  </P> <P> "I hope to contribute to a bright new future in Anaheim with all my energies  directed toward this goal."  </P></p>

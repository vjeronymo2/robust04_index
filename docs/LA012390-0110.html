			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS AUSTRALIAN OPEN;  </P> <P> BECKER AND GRAF ADVANCE; GARRISON UPSET  </P> <P> Neither Boris Becker nor Steffi Graf nor Zina Garrison had an easy time in the  heat at the Australian Open.  </P> <P> Becker had to go five sets. Graf nearly lost a set for the first time in the  tournament.  </P> <P> Only Garrison wilted.  </P> <P> The third-seeded woman fell to Mary Joe Fernandez, 1-6, 6-2, 8-6, today  (Tuesday) in the quarterfinals at the National Tennis Center, where the  temperature on court was said to be well above 100 degrees.  </P> <P> "It's pretty frustrating. I don't understand it sometimes," said Garrison, who  appeared to have a clear run to the final after an injury forced No. 2 Gabriela  Sabatini to withdraw.  </P> <P> Garrison was serving for the match at 5-4 and 6-5 in the third set, but her  serve was broken each time and then broken again at love when the sixth-seeded  Fernandez won the match.  </P> <P> "I work very hard, but I never seem able to make my breaks," said Garrison, a  Houston native who was a semifinalist at last year's U.S. Open. "Until I do, I  don't deserve to win. (This was) a match I think I lost. It was in my hands and  I didn't take advantage of it. More than anything, I wanted to win. Sometimes  you want to win too bad."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Graf had her toughest challenge of the tournament before turning  back Patty Fendick of Sacramento, 6-3, 7-5. That tied Graf's career-best  winning streak with a 46th consecutive victory.  </P> <P> Fendick had a 5-2 lead and a set point on Graf's serve in the second set, but  Graf held and allowed Fendick only four points in the next four games.  </P> <P> Becker survived a tougher test. Down a service break in the third set to  Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia, Becker stormed back to win, 4-6, 6-7 (8-6),  6-4, 6-1, 6-1, and reach the quarterfinals against Mats Wilander.  </P> <P> "I was quite astonished I got out of it," Becker said.  </P> <P> It was the third time in recent months that Becker has come back from two sets  down -- the first time against Derrick Rostagno in the second round of the U.S.  Open, the second time against Andre Agassi in Davis Cup play.  </P> <P> "You have to tell yourself not to go down," Becker said. "If I go down, the  other guy has to beat me. So it's first a struggle against yourself. That's the  first fight you have to win, and then your opponent."  </P></p>

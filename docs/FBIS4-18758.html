			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter Wagner] </F>   [Text] Demonstration at Bonn's Muenster square. Over  25,000 people, mainly refugees from former Yugoslavia,  commemorated the 250,000 people killed in the war in the  Balkans. Under the slogan Let Bosnia Live, all speakers  demanded that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina be brought about, if  necessary by force. The world must no longer watch the  atrocities; a division of Bosnia is out of the question.    [Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth] The world community  must not allow cultures to be destroyed, religions attacked,  people exterminated. [end Suessmuth]    Cheered by his fellow countrymen, Bosnian Foreign Minister  Ljubijankic spoke in support of further NATO ultimatums and for  an end to the arms embargo. He thanked the German population,  saying that no country has accepted more refugees than the FRG.  This help will never be forgotten.</p>

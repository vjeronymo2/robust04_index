			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A guide to CGT I AM LOOKING for a suitable guide to capital gains tax. Can you recommend one? If you need only simple information on a limited range of CGT rules, then ask your local tax office for the free catalogue of free pamphlets. Those in the CGT series which may interest you include CGT4 - Owner-Occupied houses; CGT13 - The indexation allowance for quoted shares; CGT14 - Capital gains tax: an introduction; CGT15 - Capital gains tax: a guide for married couples; CGT16 - Indexation allowance: disposals after 5 April 1988. If you want a brief but comprehensive guide, then, for Pounds 24.95, there is Tolley's Capital Gains Tax 1992-93 (ISBN 0 85459 668 2) published by Tolley Publishing Co. Ltd, 2 Addiscombe Road, Croydon, CR9 5AF (tel. 081-686 9141). CGT is an intricate and arbitrary tax with scant regard for logic or equity, so any simple guide must inevitably over-simplify many aspects and skate round others. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Greece to speed up asset sales GREECE plans to sell majority holdings in two state-owned oil refineries in the next few months as the government tries to speed up its much-delayed privatisation programme. The two refineries, which account for 40 per cent of Greece's refining capacity, will be offered separately to international bidders. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, is acting as financial adviser. More than two years have passed since parliament approved the privatisation of state utilities and transport companies. But disposals have been delayed, for political and practical reasons. It was only recently that Mr Stefanos Manos, the economy minister, managed to overcome opposition to privatisation from one faction of the governing New Democracy party. Meanwhile, international accountants were called in to audit large state enterprises which had produced incomplete balance sheets in recent years. This proved more time-consuming than expected, reportedly because of the old-fashioned book-keeping methods in Greek public administration. With mounting interest payments due on the public debt in 1993-94, the government is anxious to secure as much extra revenue as possible. It hopes to raise more than Dr200bn (Pounds 633m) from the sale of a 35 per cent stake in OTE, the state telecoms monopoly.</p>

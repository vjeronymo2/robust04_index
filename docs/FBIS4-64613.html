			<p>BFN     [Text] Hans Stercken, chairman of the German Bundestag  Foreign Affairs Committee, has announced that his country has  lifted the ban on arms deliveries to Turkey. Stercken, who is  conducting various contacts in Ankara, met with Interior  Minister Nahit Mentese today.    In a statement during the meeting, Stercken said that the  arms deliveries are not undertaken only in accordance with the  agreements between Turkey and Germany but also within the  framework of NATO agreements.    In turn, Mentese noted that the arms deliveries were  suspended as a result of pressure from German public opinion,  adding that the lifting of the ban is a welcome development.  Stating that German weapons are not being used in the struggle  against the terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]  organization in south and southeast Anatolia, Mentese remarked  that there are no restrictions on where and when the weapons  should be used.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: SIA and Tata in software venture Singapore Airlines (SIA) has linked up with India's Tata industrial grouping to form a joint venture company to develop computer software. The new company, to be based in India, will concentrate initially on developing SIA's computer system. The move is the latest by international companies to make use of the plentiful supply of high-skill, low-cost software engineers in India. Airlines, hotel chains, banks and other operators of large computer systems are among those which have moved parts of their programming operations to India. SIA is increasingly moving its backroom operations out of Singapore because of labour shortages and also to cut costs. Last month, Singapore's national carrier announced it would be moving part of its accounting operations to China. SIA said that India was a good choice for developing computer systems due to the country's many information technology professionals. 'India has the third largest pool of software development expertise in the world after the US and the former Soviet Union,' said SIA. An SIA study recently recommended that the airline join with the Tata group to form a joint venture domestic Indian airline. It is believed that SIA would have a 40 per cent stake in such an airline, with Tata controlling the remainder. The Indian government is expected to announce soon the conditions under which foreign investment is to be permitted in the fledgling domestic air industry. About 10 companies have been launched since private capital was permitted into the industry two years ago. Exceptionally, one already has foreign shareholders - Jet Airways, which is partly owned by Gulf Air and Kuwait Airlines. Rolls-Royce has scored its first success in Singapore's fast-expanding airline market with Silk Air, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SIA, selecting two of the RR Tay-engined Fokker 70s for services on regional routes. Airline industry analysts say RR is also favoured to supply its new large Trent engines for the latest stage in a multi-billion-dollar fleet expansion and renewal programme being undertaken by SIA. The Singapore carrier has traditionally chosen American Pratt &amp; Whitney engines for its large aircraft.</p>

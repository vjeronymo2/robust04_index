Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a  press conference that Japan maintains its three-point nonnuclear  principle of not possessing, producing or allowing nuclear  weapons into Japan so that developing nuclear weapons is  "impossible."    Saito said the ministry is investigating whether the British  Ministry of Defense has compiled a report on the possibility of  Japan's development of nuclear weapons, as was reported by the  SUNDAY TIMES. The SUNDAY TIMES said the Ministry of Defense has  warned Prime Minister John Major that North Korea's nuclear  program may force Japan to abandon its nonnuclear stance.    The paper said Japan has acquired all the parts needed to  make a nuclear weapon and may have built a bomb which requires  only plutonium to be completed and that the risks were detailed  in a paper to the Joint Intelligence Committee, the government's  main security adviser to the cabinet.    Saito said the option to possess nuclear weapons would only  contribute to the instability of the international environment  surrounding Japan and that it runs counter to Japan's peace and  prosperity. "So it is totally impossible that Japan will change  the three-point nonnuclear principle," he said.    He added that Japan is a member of the nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty and that it also supports the indefinite  extension of the treaty when it is reviewed in 1995.    If such a British Government report exists, Japan will have  to once again make clear that it is impossible that Japan will  opt to possess nuclear weapons and seek understanding from  Britain and the international community, he said.</p>

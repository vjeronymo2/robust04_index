			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Pressure builds over coal deal THE GOVERNMENT is stepping up pressure on the electricity industry and British Coal to reach an early agreement on new coal supply contracts to the power generators. Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, is believed to have held talks this week with the two biggest power generators, National Power and PowerGen, as well as with representatives of the 12 regional distribution companies of England and Wales. Further talks are scheduled at the Department of Trade and Industry today. Speculation that the generators, particularly National Power, are facing the strongest pressure to yield ground and break the deadlock helped to depress shares yesterday. National Power shares closed down 4 1/2 p at 234 1/2 p. According to one market report, Mr Eggar has given the electricity companies and British Coal until September 16 to come up with an outline agreement. That is to enable the government to formulate a position on the privatisation of British Coal in time for the Conservative Party conference which starts on October 5. The DTI refused to comment on Mr Eggar's meetings with energy company representatives, saying that they were a commercial matter. British Coal said: 'We're close. But we've been close to the finishing line before.' The new long-term coal supply contracts, due to run from next March, are an essential precursor to the privatisation of British Coal, which is planned for the end of this year. The contracts will determine the size and potential profitability of British Coal because they will replace the subsidised prices that the UK coal industry has been enjoying with ones based on world prices.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: HIGH-TECH STOCKS REDISCOVERED  </P> <P> Just in time for Valentine's Day, investors' love-hate relationship with  high-tech stocks is back in the I-can't-get-enough-of-you mode.  </P> <P> While the broad market was plunging in January, many high-tech stocks were  inching higher. And over the past two weeks, some of the tech stocks have  turned red hot. Year-to-date, many are up 20% or more. And some smart money is  betting we're just at the start of a major surge.  </P> <P> The buyers have focused not so much on the giants of the computer business but  on many of the smaller companies -- especially those that make specialized  computer equipment, such as workstations, and those that supply key computer  parts, such as disk drives. Some of the big gainers include Seagate Technology,  Conner Peripherals and Sun Microsystems -- all California-based.  </P> <P> What's happened in recent weeks, analysts say, is the realization by Wall  Street that while the computer business is slowing with the economy, it isn't  collapsing -- at least not for personal computers and other desktop equipment.  Inventories appear to be under control, and many tech firms are far stronger  financially than a few years ago.  </P> <P> Last fall, at the first signs of weakness in the business, many investors  assumed the worst and tech stocks were murdered. "Particularly in the personal  computer business, there was so much negative stuff," says analyst Steven Ossad  at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "Now, there's an acceptance that  while (PC sales) annual growth isn't 25% to 35%, it's still in the 15%-plus  category worldwide. And that's still pretty good."  </P> <P> If investors overreacted last year, their nervousness was understandable. Many  high-tech stocks rode a roller coaster in the 1980s as boom-bust cycles  repeated. Plenty of companies alive at the start of the '80s don't exist now.  Value Line Investment Survey notes that, of 24 computer equipment makers it  followed at the start of the '80s, 11 no longer are in the business.  </P> <P> Indeed, tech stocks are in some ways Wall Street's favorite horror story. But  as in many horror stories, tech stocks left for dead often return as monster  performers just as most investors turn their backs on the group.  </P> <P> That's the case once again. The renewed interest in the stocks is partly  attributable to a show-and-tell conference on tech stocks that Goldman, Sachs  &amp; Co. hosted in New York this week. Analysts say that while little new  information came out of the conference, big investors woke up to the reality  that tech stocks are depressed, compared to the companies' healthy earnings  prospects for 1990.  </P> <P> Seagate, which makes minicomputer and PC hard disk drives -- the devices that  enable data to be stored and retrieved by a computer -- is a good example of  what analysts consider an undervalued stock. It is expected to earn about $2 a  share in the year ending June 30. So at $18.25 on Thursday, the stock is  selling for just nine times earnings. In contrast, the average stock, as  measured by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, sells for about 13 times  estimated 1990 earnings.  </P> <P> Analyst John Rossi of Alex. Brown &amp; Sons in San Francisco thinks that  shares of Seagate and several other disk drive makers, including Maxtor Corp.,  still have much further to rise. His optimism stems partly from the  consolidation of the industry in the 1980s: As competitors have fallen away --  including the most recent casualty, MiniScribe Corp., last year -- the  survivors are in better shape to make good money off the demand expected for  more powerful computers in the '90s.  </P> <P> Rossi's main fear is that the Japanese will somehow figure out how to grab  control of the hard disk drive market. Still, he notes, despite their efforts  to make inroads in the 1980s, Japanese drive makers were able to raise their  U.S. market share to just 15% by last year, from 5% in 1980.  </P> <P> Among tech-stock fans, some picks now include:  </P> <P> * Conner Peripherals. Also a disk drive maker, Conner is a major supplier to  Compaq Computer and is "talking with a lot of other companies about the right  kind of products" for the '90s, Ossad says. He estimates that Conner will earn  $1.55 a share this year. At $15.25 on Thursday, that gives the stock a  price/earnings ratio (P/E) of just under 10.  </P> <P> * Autodesk. This firm makes software for computer-aided design and drafting.  Richard Frucci, manager of the $100-million Putnam Information Sciences Trust  mutual fund in Boston, doubled his holdings in Autodesk in January. He says the  company has a "unique position selling their type of software for the desktop  computer" market, which continues to boom. As earnings have soared since 1985  ($2.70 a share is estimated for 1990), the stock has risen to $44 from $4.  </P> <P> For Technophobes, a Better Way: If the tech stock rally piques your interest,  but you're terrified of ending up with a bankrupt, there's a way to lower your  risk: Use mutual funds that specialize in tech stocks. There are 24 such funds,  according to Lipper Analytical Services.  </P> <P> Over the past 12 months (through last week), the average tech-stock fund gained  just 8.4%, compared to 9.6% for general stock funds, Lipper says. The tech  group under-performed because investors shunned the stocks for much of last  year. But if the group is indeed being rediscovered in 1990, the tech funds'  performance should reflect that. And the funds lower your risk of being hurt by  any one stock disaster, because they buy a diversified portfolio of issues.  That also means you can't make the kind of money you could by getting lucky on  a single stock. But in the volatile world of high-tech, one-company bets are  strictly for investors with money to burn.  </P> <P> Too Many Bears? Market pros are more bearish than at any time since June, 1982,  the latest weekly survey by Investors Intelligence of Larchmont, N.Y., shows.  And that has contrarians -- who believe the majority is always wrong --  wondering if stocks are ready to soar anew.  </P> <P> The Investors Intelligence survey of 130 market analysts shows 57.3% now  bearish. The last time it was higher was in June, 1982, at 57.6% -- just before  the bull market began in August, 1982.  </P> <P> But the survey's overseer, Michael Burke, admits that even if the majority is  wrong again, it could be months before the market turns, and it could go lower  in the interim. The high reading for bearishness was 60.9% in March, 1982 -- a  full five months before the bear market ended.  </P> <P> HIGH TECH IS HOT AGAIN  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.10IN:2.44IN:1.78IN:2.33IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 52-week  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> % change,  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Stock  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> range (]  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Thurs.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> yr. to date  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> AST Research  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 15-6 5/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 14 1/2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +39.8%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Adobe Systems  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 30-14  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 26  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +28.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sun Microsystems  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 23-13 1/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 21 3/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +26.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Seagate  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 19 1/4-8 1/2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 18 1/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +21.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Maxtor  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12 1/4-7 3/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10 5/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +21.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Tandem Computer  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 28 1/4-14 3/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 27 3/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +20.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Octel  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 27 3/4-16 1/2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 25 7/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +17.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Conner Peripherals  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 15 1/2-6 1/2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 15 1/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +16.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Autodesk  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 44-26 1/2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 44  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +12.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Consilium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 17 3/4-10 1/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 17 1/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +11.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

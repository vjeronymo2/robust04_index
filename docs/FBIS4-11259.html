			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sao Paulo, 22 Apr, (EFE) -- The member countries  of the Rio Group and the EU today agreed to hold a high-ranking  trade meeting to evaluate the impact of the GATT pacts on  international trade.    The decision to hold the meeting is included as a special  point in the final declaration of the fourth ministerial meeting  between the Rio Group and the EU that was made public this  evening, despite the meeting lasting until 23 April.    The ministerial meeting, the fourth since the talks between  the Rio Group and the EU were institutionalized through the  Declaration of Rome in 1990, is taking place in the Latin  American Parliament (Parlatino) headquarters in this city, with  the participation of all the Rio Group foreign ministers.    The trade meeting should take place before the end of the  year with the participation of the vice ministers of foreign  trade of the 13 member countries of the Rio Group -- the main  Latin American political and economic forum -- and the 12 EU  countries.    When expressing their interest in holding a new meeting  among  economic and trade experts from the two blocs, the participants  at the fourth ministerial meeting said this kind of "specialized  forum of continuous dialogue has been very useful in exchanging  ideas about current affairs and matters of common interest."    The trade meeting's main objective will be to determine the  new context of international trade after the signature on 15  April in Marrakech of the GATT pacts and the creation of the  World Trade Organization.    The effects of the European market's unification process on  Latin American exports also will be analyzed at the trade  meeting.    The Rio Group asked for more trade meetings between the two  blocs because after two meetings of foreign trade vice ministers  in Brussels they had not defined an agenda for more similar  meetings.    The Latin American countries said the meetings were useful  to  "study the effects of the unified European market and the future  expansion of the EU, as well as the regional integration  programs and free trade zones of Latin America."

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Abidjan crackdown after day of rioting IVORY Coast's main opposition leader was arrested with hundreds of supporters yesterday when an anti-government march degenerated into the worst rioting seen in the west African country, Reuter reports from Abidjan. The mass round-up came when thousands of demonstrators poured through the capital, Abidjan, smashing everything in their path. Brandishing clubs and hurling rocks they shattered hundreds of car and shop windows in the central Plateau area. Mr Laurent Gbagbo, leader of the Ivorian Popular Front, was detained at a military camp with his wife, Simone, prominent opposition figures and at least 300 supporters, witnesses said. Mr Alassane Ouattara, the prime minister, said the opposition had failed to control the marchers, estimated at about 20,000.</p>

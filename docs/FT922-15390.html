			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Personal View: One, two pull together As election day approaches, the polls continue to suggest that a hung parliament in which all parties become minorities will be the most likely outcome. This would mean that the result which may be most favoured by Financial Times readers, that of an overall Conservative majority, will not be on offer - and a Conservative government is the one with which the markets have traditionally felt most at home. I do not favour a hung parliament, and I know that I am not alone in the ranks of industry and commerce in taking this view. However, in a situation where the electorate decides to deny any party overall power, it is incumbent on those of us engaged in wealth creation to think hard what would then be best for us. The preferred solution for short- and long-term benefits would be a stable coalition. Consider the alternative. A hung parliament could result in chronic instability: a minority government trying to go it alone for a few months in a desperate bid to conjure legitimacy out of office rather than from the voters; a second election within months and continuing crippling uncertainty for markets, investment and consumer spending. John Major has already noted that vital economic decisions, by companies and shoppers, are being postponed until after the election. That paralysis would become much worse with a second election continually just around the corner, and no assurance that even then the voters might not decide on a replay. The end of the recession would be further delayed with damaging consequences for those companies hanging on by their fingernails. The temptations to play for time for a short period until the Queen can decently be asked for a second election are considerable in a system of government which Lord Hailsham described as an 'elective dictatorship'. I believe the markets fear this scenario most of all. Were the fear to spread, sterling could be put under great pressure. This, taken together with events in Germany and the uncovenanted rise in the UK public sector borrowing requirement, could force an interest rate increase. A minority government might find that such an increase becomes an indispensable hostage to be given to uncertainty. But a hung parliament does not have to result in such a vicious circle of instability and uncertainty. Political leaders could behave with decent humility in the face of the fact that the electors have decided not to trust them with unfettered power. They could act responsibly as their counterparts do throughout continental Europe and resolve to create stability by sharing power. This may be difficult in an adversarial political culture after a bitter election, but it is not impossible. A stable partnership government or coalition, working to an agreed programme over a period of, say, four years could offer an attractive climate for business and personal investment. The more excessive policies of the senior partner, for instance Labour's high marginal tax rates and its minimum wage, or the Conservative refusal to invest adequately in education and training, could be reversed. There would be less legislation, and what there was would be of higher quality. Nothing can remove the difficulties of governing in a complex modern society but at least such a partnership government would have the authority of most of the electorate behind it; and could avoid follies such as the poll tax which resulted from an exercise of power without formal limits. The natural junior partners in such an election are the Liberal Democrats, who seem likely to emerge from the election with Paddy Ashdown's authority enhanced, more than one fifth of the vote and more than 20 seats. Proportional representation - the Lib Dems condition for participation in a partnership government - would have a special advantage. It would open the door to a modernisation of our democracy, making Westminster and Whitehall more like our best companies: open, communicative and capable of getting the best out of people rather than being closed, secretive and ultimately incompetent. Many business leaders have supported the introduction of PR, including the Confederation of British Industry Conference just before the government came to office. What they seek is the stability which comes from governments' being forced to listen and to adopt evolutionary rather than revolutionary change. So when we ponder our response to a hung parliament let us remember that what happens afterwards depends on the politicians, and on the pressure the public puts on them. They could choose confusion and instability, and we would all pay the price; or they could settle down to make parliament viable and stable good government possible. I have no doubt which would be best for business, and ultimately for all of us. The author is chairman of Mitsubishi Electric (UK).

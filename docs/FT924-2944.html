			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Accountancy Column: Recession hinders efforts to improve racial mix - Few applicants and even fewer recruits mean only 1.6% of trainees are black ANYONE turning to the last report of the Commission for Racial Equality on discrimination in the accountancy profession six years ago was in for some unpleasant reading. Now the impact of the recession is threatening to stall any further progress. The CRE report, published in 1986, showed that the proportion of white candidates hired by the larger firms was about four times higher than for black applicants. The white success rate at interview was nearly twice as high, with a slightly higher disparity at second compared with first interview. Black applicants were disproportionately rejected at all stages. It recommended that improved recruitment, assessment and selection techniques would not only reduce these disparities, but also assist the profession to solve its own graduate recruitment shortage. The situation today remains hard to assess, because reliable statistics are still not available. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales began ethnic monitoring of candidates in 1988 but a significant number of trainees signing contracts are still reluctant to provide this information. For 1991-92, the proportion of training contacts held by black students was 1.6 per cent, and for Asians 8.4 per cent. The impending shortage of young professionals in the early 1980s prompted accountancy firms to adapt their recruitment practices. Mr Richard Parnell, a director at Robert Walters Associates, says: 'Certain firms were making little effort to give people from ethnic minorities any equal opportunity. They then realised that they had to get all hands on board. They turned to all sections of the community.' Gradually the ethnic mix has been changing. Mr Stephen Boley, national director of graduate recruitment at Coopers and Lybrand, says that of his firm's junior grades, 8 per cent come from ethnic minorities. 'This reflects the higher percentage now coming through the higher education system,' he says. 'We expect this to work through to higher grades in the coming years. Currently we have only one partner from an ethnic minority.' Lack of representation at senior levels is also true in the professional bodies. Mr Prem Sikka, a lecturer at the University of East London, points out that there is not a single ethnic minority on an important committee in the accountancy profession. 'The people running these committees will not see it as a deliberate decision, but it has always been that way so they are institutionalising unequal opportunities,' he says. The Institute of Chartered Accountants points out that it does have a small number of people from ethnic minorities on some of its committees. One reason for continued under-representation is the concentration by firms on recruiting from a small number of long-established universities. By contrast, most ethnic minorities attend the modern universities and polytechnics and those in London. In the capital each college draws more than one quarter of its intake from ethnic minorities, though many of these are foreign students who could not be employed. Mr Nigel Llewellyn, national recruitment partner at Touche Ross, defends his firm's strategy. 'Some campuses have more potential applicants of better quality, so it makes sense that we direct a greater proportion of marketing spend to those areas where it will yield the best results,' he says. 'This does not mean that a candidate from a campus which has not been targeted in this way stands less chance of receiving an offer.' In the late 1980s, firms were keen to look beyond their traditional pool of applicants. With the recession, much of that impetus has been lost. Mr Andrew Colquhoun, secretary and chief executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, says: 'Many accountancy firms still only recruit actively from a limited number of universities because that is where they have met their best graduates in the past. That is rational economic behaviour on their part. Unfortunately the recession has probably narrowed this recruitment base further.' Firms are nevertheless adopting a number of tactics to counter potential discrimination. Ms Faith Jenner, UK director of recruiting and personnel at Arthur Andersen, says more than one person considers each candidate in order to eliminate any chance of individual bias creeping in. 'We aim to recruit the best so it is very much in our interest to help interviewees feel comfortable,' she says. 'That way we see them at their best and can gauge their potential better.' Mr Llewellyn says that a big element of interviewer training at Touche Ross is focused on the need to eliminate bias. 'These procedures have proved very effective over the last ten years,' he says. 'Sadly, a deeper issue remains, which is that the number of applicants from minority backgrounds with proven academic strength is disappointingly low, particularly in the case of those from the Afro-Caribbean Community. If more would apply the final position would be much improved.' Ms Jo Magne, national personnel manager at Moores Rowland, agrees. 'We closely monitor graduate applications and have traditionally received very few from African or Afro-Caribbean candidates,' she says. 'Asian candidates apply in higher numbers.' The firm's recruitment figures for the last four months of last year highlight the problem. Two-thirds of applicants to the firm were European, of which 47 per cent were invited to a first interview. Asians comprised 30 per cent of applicants, but 37 per cent of them were invited for interview. But for Africans/Afro-Caribbeans, the figures were 4 per cent who applied and 16 per cent invited for interview. Ms Magne says that African and Afro-Caribbean applicants are generally not invited to interview because of their lack of research into the profession and their inability to provide a sensible answer to the question of why they want to be a chartered accountant. That is a view shared by Mr Errol Elliot, chairman of the recently-formed Black Accountants Society. He argues that accountancy has a low profile in the black community and many black applicants carry out insufficient research into the profession. 'The bottom line is that the accountancy exams are tough and time-consuming,' says Mr Elliot. 'We are there to provide support so that black students realise that the exams are there to be passed.' Mr Deepak Haria, a manager in the financial markets division at Arthur Andersen, who was seconded to the firm's recruitment department for seven months in 1990, says that firms should not under-estimate the importance of using role-models to attract high quality graduates from all backgrounds. 'It is the diversity of skills, knowledge and background of an accounting firm's workforce which contributes to its present business success and future growth.' Mr Philip Nagenda, a black African chartered accountant and head of internal audit for three NHS authorities, has observed that many clients have difficulties coping with the idea of a black senior auditor. 'If there is a black person in a team of two or more auditors, they automatically assume that the black person is the junior auditor,' he says. 'This stereotyping will not change until we have more black accountants.' While the economy was growing, the increase in demand for recruits by the leading accounting firms coincided with the emergence of a second generation of highly educated ethnic minorities who were joining the job market. But the present recession is so intense that the demand for young professionals has been reduced and accountancy firms can afford to make less effort to widen their ethnic base.</p>

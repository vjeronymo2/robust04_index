			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Decision and Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> In the matter of: New Harmony [Case No. CW&hyph;001].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, Public Law 94&hyph;163, 89 Stat. 917, amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, Public Law 95&hyph;619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776, which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer products, including clothes washers. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the waiver process (45 FR 64108). Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a Waiver of such prescribed test procedures (51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to temporarily waive the test procedures for a particular basic model when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according to the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is the subject of the waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Interim Waiver provisions, added by the 1986 amendment, allow the Assistant Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to &sect;430.27(g), the Assistant Secretary shall publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice of each waiver granted, and any limiting conditions of each waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with &sect;430.27 of 10 CFR part 430, on February 2, 1993, New Harmony filed a ``Petition for Waiver'' and an ``Application for Interim Waiver'' regarding its series 1 and 2 clothes washers with the following design features that differ from those covered by the existing clothes washer test procedure: An internal water heating source; a various temperature selection capability; and an alternate electrical power supply. On June 15, 1993, the Department published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the New Harmony petition and solicited comments, data, and information respecting the petition and granted the requested Interim Waiver with minor revisions as discussed in the Interim Waiver (58 FR 33089).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments were received from the Whirlpool Corporation (Whirlpool). All comments received were sent to New Harmony for its rebuttal. The Department consulted with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the New Harmony petition. The FTC did not have any objections to the issuance of a Waiver to New Harmony.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Assertions and Determinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New Harmony's petition seeks a Waiver from the DOE test procedure that is based on an external water heating source. Instead, New Harmony requests the allowance to test its series 1 and 2 clothes washers using an internal heater which heats the cold inlet water supplied for washing. Since the nature of a water-heating clothes washer is significantly different than a non-water-heating clothes washer, several issues have developed and have been commented on. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing test procedure for non-water-heating clothes washers uses inlet water at ``100  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F'' and requires a temperature rise calculation based on water volume which assumes a hot wash temperature of 140  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (60  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C). Thus, the calculation for the warm wash temperature is presumed to be set at 100  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (37.8  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) which is obtained from assumed equal amounts of hot and cold water being mixed in the clothes washer. For clothes washers equipped with thermostatically controlled inlet water valves the hot water inlet temperature is set to ``140  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F'' and the cold water inlet temperature is set to ``60  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Harmony originally proposed testing their machines utilizing the existing test procedure Temperature Use Factors (TUFs) for a three temperature selection machine with a slight revision. New Harmony proposed changing the TUF for the ``hot'' setting from ``30%'' to ``25%'' and adding ``5%'' for the hottest setting on their machines. The Department did not concur with this proposal because New Harmony did not present any basis for the ``5%'' value. The Department issued an Interim Waiver with test requirements which were more representative of the existing test procedure. The Interim Waiver required testing at three temperature settings (hot_140  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (60  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C), warm_100  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (38  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) and cold_60  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (16  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C)) for maximum and minimum fill conditions. The results of the temperature setting tests were prorated using the existing test procedure TUFs for a three-temperature selection machine. The combined results for maximum and minimum fill were prorated using the existing test procedure values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CLASH OVER SOVIET ARTS FESTIVAL DIVIDES SAN DIEGO EDUCATORS  </P> <P> A philosophical clash over how best to prepare students for the Soviet arts  festival -- a clash deepened by personal friction between two educators -- has  resulted in competing "official" curriculum guides for San Diego County  teachers as part of the ballyhooed event beginning in mid-October.  </P> <P> The county Office of Education, which helps plan curriculum for area school  districts, has issued the 109-page Soviet Arts Curriculum Guide, which its  fine-arts administrator calls the "official" pamphlet because her office has  responsibility for such education countywide.  </P> <P> But the chairwoman of the education committee of the city-sponsored "San Diego  Arts Festival: Treasures of the Soviet Union," the group planning the  exhibitions, says her two guides are the "official" documents because they have  the imprimatur of the mayor and the City Council.  </P> <P> Although some people caught in the middle of the spat say teachers will not  find the guides all that different in substance, the main editors of each  firmly defend their own approaches as the correct way of tying schools to the  festival.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Multicultural Ties  </P> <P> "It's an ugly dispute," lamented Ann Heidt, the education office's arts  coordinator. Nevertheless, she defended her work as "best" because it attempts  to teach art from Soviet cultures, using general concepts taught by teachers in  math, literature, art and history, and to emphasize multicultural ties.  </P> <P> Jessie Flemion, a history professor at San Diego State University and  chairwoman of the city's festival education committee, retorted: "All I can  tell you is that the  </P> <P> materials the county produced were too narrowly focused and she (Heidt)  wouldn't change, so (the city committee) went ahead to implement our concept of  having a balanced presentation in literature and social sciences as well as  arts."  </P> <P> "Hopefully, teachers and students will get the enrichment intended no matter  which one is used," said Kay Wagner, arts coordinator for San Diego city  schools.  </P> <P> Wagner said her office "is caught in the middle," even though her staff  produced much of the material for both guides.  </P> <P> At this point, the two sides are even holding separate workshops to promote  their guides to teachers who want to prepare their students for the festival.  </P> <P> The flap has its origins in events almost nine months ago, when Flemion's  committee began planning a specialized curriculum for the county's 350,000  students in kindergarten through 12th grade, using the funds donated to it for  education-related purposes.  </P> <P> The committee opted to tap the resources of Wagner's office at the San Diego  Unified School District. Wagner, a member of Flemion's committee, made  available one, and then a second, resource teacher to help develop materials,  which include the guides as well as books, maps and videotapes.  </P> <P> "There was a real demand on the time of my people," said Wagner, whose small  staff must also cope with an increased workload this year given the expanded  "Arts in Education" program, which this year places an artist in every one of  the city's 109 elementary schools.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Heidt -- a bit miffed that she had not been asked to serve on  the festival education committee -- began writing her own curriculum, using  contributions and research from many art and cultural experts.  </P> <P> In late spring, Wagner decided that the best results would come from merging  the efforts, and she arranged for Heidt to sit down with the city curriculum  specialists to produce a single guide. Flemion was in the Soviet Union at the  time, obtaining materials for 20 "treasure chests," traveling collections of  Soviet arts and crafts that will move from school to school.  </P> <P> But, when Flemion returned and saw the guide results, she objected.  </P> <P> "I saw that the materials were presenting only one area, the arts, and did not  include literature and social sciences," Flemion said. So she rewrote parts of  the guide to reflect her own concepts and to focus more closely on the festival  itself. In addition, she wanted two guides -- one for elementary students and  one for secondary students -- to make it easier for teachers to apply the  materials.  </P> <P> "I think it was a shock to me that the city wanted to spend more money and  write something separate," Heidt said. "Our guide does focus on arts, but this  is an arts festival, not a social sciences festival. . . . But we use the arts  to go into all other curriculum areas and to show that Soviet arts can be used  to teach about our area's own ethnic and cultural diversity.  </P> <P> "Their concept has nothing about (state) curriculum frameworks and nothing  about multicultural approaches."  </P> <P> Wagner, of the city schools district, said the competing guides actually will  have many similarities because her staff did much of the writing for both.  Flemion conceded that "some of their things are incorporated into ours and some  of ours into theirs."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Just Wasn't Resolvable'  </P> <P> Heidt is upset that Flemion borrowed some of the county material by promising  it would not be copyrighted but that the festival committee now plans to  copyright its guides. Flemion said the guides are being copyrighted, but Wagner  said she doubts a copyright has any meaning because so many people contributed  material to the guides and have not been asked permission to grant copyrights.  </P> <P> "I feel like I'm caught in the middle of a dispute that just wasn't  resolvable," said Wagner, adding that she does not care what guide her teachers  use as long as they find the materials useful and enriching for their students.  </P> <P> "The way I see it, these are enrichment guides, not guides to teach curriculum  per se in art or social science or anything else, and therefore, as long as  they put the arts festival into context from a cultural and artistic  perspective, that's fine.  </P> <P> "But both feel very strongly about what they have done. . . . I work with Ann  on a regular basis, but I also know Jessie as a member of the arts commission,  and I am grateful to the mayor for having 1989 as the 'Year of the Child.'  </P> <P> "Just let me say that the way things have been done would not be my style."  </P></p>

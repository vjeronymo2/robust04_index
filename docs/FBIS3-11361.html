			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Six o'Clock Sharp" newscast] </F>   [Text] Nicaraguan international law specialists believe the  current border situation with Costa Rica, where local  landholders are invading part of Nicaragua, is extremely  serious, and that the government must immediately and thoroughly  act to clarify once and for all the sovereignty of their  homeland along the border, including the San Juan River.    The Foreign Ministry pointed out that the Sandinist National  Liberation Front is directly responsible for the current border  situation because during the war it displaced the peasants and  shopkeepers from the area and even mined part of it. Therefore,  Nicaraguans moved to the other side of the border, to Costa  Rica, where they helped to develop Costa Rica. After that, the  Sandinists completely ignored the strip between boundary posts  13 and 14, almost 30 km, which was abandoned. Nicaragua has  warned Costa Rica that if it does not pay attention to marking  out the area, it would unilaterally do so next April.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Nordbanken control unveiled THE Swedish government announced yesterday the creation of a new state company which will control all the shares of Nordbanken, the ailing commercial bank from September 1. The state was forced to intervene and take over the bank last month in the face of its increasing financial problems caused by bad debt losses. The Ministry of Finance said yesterday the new company, Venantius, had purchased so far 13.8 per cent of the 22.7 per cent of remaining equity and voting shares in Nordbanken from a number of its larger shareholders, including Nobel Industries, for SKr21 per share. The remaining 77.3 per cent of equity in Nordbanken is already owned by the state. A prospectus setting out the terms of the bid is to be published at the end of next month. The Swedish parliament two weeks ago agreed to the SKr20bn (Dollars 3.53bn) rescue plan for Nordbanken to save it from possible financial collapse. It was then authorised that a limited company made up of five officials from the Ministry of Finance should administer the shares. In the first quarter, the bank made a SKr1.97bn deficit and it expects a credit loss of between SKr6bn and SKr8bn for the full year. Standard and Poor's, the US credit rating company, yesterday placed Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, on credit watch with negative implications. It said that the action reflected 'the continuing sharp deterioration of the bank's asset quality, together with the increased pressure on earnings cause by the rapid build-up of non-performing loans.' Norway's Banking Association said yesterday that the country's troubled banks could begin to show a small profit next year after seven years of losses as long as there were no more setbacks. It estimated that while this year Norway's banks will lose NKr9bn (Dollars 1.46bn) in credit losses that will fall to NKr5bn by 1995. It believes there will be an increase in income and higher charges on customers. But the association added that the weakness of the banks would make it difficult for them to help in a revival of the Norwegian economy.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / International Company News: Ares-Serono to raise SFr51m by rights issue ARES-SERONO, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group which specialises in human fertility drugs, is raising SFr51.4m (Dollars 36.1m) through a one-for-six rights issue to bearer shareholders and a conversion offer to registered shareholders. The group, 86 per cent controlled by the Bertarelli family, then plans to split both classes of shares on a one for five basis. The capital restructuring, similar in many respects to those carried out recently by other Swiss companies, has been criticised in some quarters because it will result in a dilution of the value of the bearer shares. This is because the conversion of some of the Bertarelli family held registered shares to bearer shares will be carried out at the difference in their par values, SFr150 per share, which is well below the difference in their market values. Mr Hans Thierstein, finance director, pointed out that this option was set when the family floated shares in the company on the stock market in 1987. He also noted that the family had waived its right to participate in the proposed one-for-six rights issue at par.</p>

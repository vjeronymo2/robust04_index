			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] National Party [NP] leader F.W. de Klerk's road show  in the future north west province ended on a slightly  controversial note today. On entering the Vryburg show grounds  where an NP rally was held, a number of black farm workers were  handed 10-rand notes.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Ronel van Zyl] Mr. de  Klerk's target group in this traditional CP [Conservative Party]  country were black and colored South Africans. At mostly closed  meetings during the last three days, he made contact with more  than 12,000 people. Like yesterday farm laborers were bussed in  to today's rally. Eyebrows, however, were raised when farmer  Mr. Ben Schoonwinkel gave 30 of his workers 10 rands each.    [Schoonwinkel, in Afrikaans] I only gave them the 10 rands  in  advance -- they are getting paid next week -- so that they could  buy food.    [Van Zyl] Other farm laborers denied that they received  money  to attend the rally.    [Unidentified laborer, in Afrikaans] No, I was not paid  today  to come here. I came on my own.    [Van Zyl] Mr. de Klerk later rejected allegations of  bribery,  as well as claims by a handful of ANC [African National  Congress] supporters that they were refused entry to the show  grounds.    [De Klerk] We didn't bribe anybody, and we didn't refuse  anybody.    [Van Zyl] Turning to a favorite electioneering theme,  intimidation, Mr. de Klerk said he had been invited to black  townships, but was advised against it.    [De Klerk] It is apparent that the ANC has a strategy to  make  certain areas inaccessible to us.    [Van Zyl] This was the first of many campaigns for Mr. de  Klerk. He faces a grueling schedule -- at least one road show a  week -- until the watershed day in April.    [Correspondent Gary Alfonso] At another NP rally, this time  in Eldorado Park south of Johannesburg, the party's election  machine ran into noisy protests from ANC and Azapo [Azanian  People's Organization] supporters. After Government chief  negotiator Roelf Meyer made his way past a small group of irate  demonstrators, the protesters proceeded into the hall where  speakers were interrupted continuously. National Party  supporters voiced their dismay with the presence of the  intruders and drove the demonstrators from the hall. Mr. Meyer,  whose speech was also interrupted, drew cheers from the new NP  supporters when he dealt with the issue.    [Meyer] They can also say what they want like they do this  [as heard]. And there's nothing to be noisy about. They can  quietly do it. They can hold their own meetings, and we will  tolerate them to have their own meetings.    [Alfonso] No serious incidents were reported, but Mr. Meyer  opted to leave the building through a side door while protesters  waited for him at the main entrance. [end recording]</p>

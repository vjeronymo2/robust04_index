			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> CBS Joins CNN: In a cost-saving experiment that may be tried elsewhere  overseas, Cable News Network and CBS News will share a bureau and satellite  equipment in Berlin. The test will start in mid-June and is "a limited  experiment," in which the two organizations will maintain separate news  correspondents and producers. The Berlin bureau arrangement marks the second  deal between CBS and cable tycoon Ted Turner, who unsuccessfully tried to buy  CBS in 1986. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Two-tier Ad Scale To End?"] </F>   [Text] China is considering unifying advertising charges  for Chinese and foreigners so both pay the same amount.    "We will unify the dual-track advertising-price system as  soon as China attains its Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade) membership," said an official with the State  Administration for Industry and Commerce.    Foreign companies, including overseas-invested firms, have  to  pay 30 per cent more than their Chinese counterparts to place  ads on TV and other media.    To prepare for the advertising price reform, the central  government already is encouraging step-by-step price increases  for Chinese advertisers, Zheng Heping, deputy director of the  administration's Advertising Department, told Business Weekly in  an exclusive interview. Some media outlets have consequently  increased prices.    Zheng stressed that increasing the advertising prices for  Chinese firms must be accomplished gradually, because the  central government has to consider affordability for State-owned  firms in particular.    The government also is sensitive to the need to make efforts  to avoid domination of China's advertising by foreign companies  when prices are levelled.    China Central Television (CCTV) will, on July 1, take the  lead in raising its average advertising rate to 41,000 yuan  ($4,713) from the current 39,000 yuan ($4,483) for every three  seconds during prime time.    This further increase comes on the heels of a 30 per cent  price hike by much of the country's media at the beginning of  this year.    Zheng believes other media units and China's 1,605 local  television stations will soon follow CCTV's move.    The increasingly wide coverage of television programmes  encourages the TV stations to charge much higher advertising  rates than other media. Television stations account for at  least 22 per cent of the country's total advertising business  volume.    The administration's latest available figures show the  country's advertising sales were 13.4 billion yuan ($1.54  billion) last year, which was up at least 50 per cent from the  previous year.    Zheng predicted nationwide advertising business growth of  between 30 per cent and 40 per cent in 1994.    Estimates of growth this year probably would be even higher  had there not been substantial advertising price increases at  the beginning of this year, he added.    The government has launched a trial programme in Guangdong  Province to prohibit the province's media units from seeking or  meeting clients for advertising business without going through  designated advertising companies.    He expects similar moves will be carried out nationwide by  the turn of this century, he said.    Official figures show that, by the end of last year, the  country had already set up some 10,000 advertising agencies, up  149 per cent from the previous year.    At the same time, the government has come to realize the  need  to rein force the management of the advertising market.    It is still in its infancy, and while the State oversees  specific, designated advertising agencies, anyone could still  set themselves up to sell space or air time around the country.</p>

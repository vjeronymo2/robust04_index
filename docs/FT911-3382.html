			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Loans to Nicaragua clear way for arrears payment NICARAGUA expects to settle Dollars 360m in overdue payments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) by the middle of this year, following the approval of Dollars 225m in bridging loan finance by the Mexican, Venezuelan and Spanish governments. Mr Antonio Lacayo, Nicaragua's Minister for the Presidency, said on Tuesday night that Mexico and Spain had confirmed in the past week their support for the financial package. He said that Venezuelan support was to be ratified during the state visit of President Carlos Andres Perez to Nicaragua today, to mark celebrations of the first year in office of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of Nicaragua. Between Dollars 100m and Dollars 150m has been pledged by other countries on longer-term finance. A special meeting is to be held in mid-May in Paris to finalise the entire package. Settlement of the overdue payments to the multilateral institutions is considered to be a central pillar of the government's economic stabilisation plan, as it would unlock new foreign credit for the country.</p>

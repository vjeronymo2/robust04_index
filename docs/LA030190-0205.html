			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT'S IN L.A.'S NAME? $4 MILLION IN REVENUE, COUNTY OFFICIALS FIGURE  </P> <P> Sun lovers could soon purchase swimsuits or tanning lotion bearing the official  seal of approval of Los Angeles County lifeguards.  </P> <P> Gun fanciers could line up to buy weapons or bulletproof vests endorsed by  Sheriff Sherman Block and his deputies.  </P> <P> County officials envision earning as much as $4 million a year from firms using  the Los Angeles County name in the advertising of products.  </P> <P> "If Coke wants to be the official drink of county lifeguards, that's going to  be worth some dollars to us," maintained Chris Klinger, deputy director of  county beaches and harbors.  </P> <P> The county has been raising about $1 million a year by allowing advertising on  the beaches. But it is now seeking passage of legislation by Sen. Robert  Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) to spell out its authority to endorse products. On  Wednesday, the proposal cleared its first hurdle when the Senate Local  Government Committee approved the legislation in a 6-2 vote and sent it to the  Senate floor.  </P> <P> The possibility of creating centers of profit could extend to any county  government department with commercial appeal, and to every county in the state.  Orange and San Diego counties, for example, could also profit from  beach-related endorsements.  </P> <P> "Every county has some unique feature" that could lend itself to such a  licensing arrangement, Beverly said. The bill's supporters also anticipate that  the marketing efforts will capitalize on the worldwide appeal of Los Angeles,  especially its bronzed lifeguards.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County prohibits endorsements for tobacco and alcohol products. But  the proposal would not block wine-growing counties from promoting their own  line of burgundy or chablis.  </P> <P> And Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose), a member of the Local Government  Committee, suggested that brewers could also enter agreements for county-owned  stadiums to plug their beer.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County is not the only government to establish a marketing venture.  Montgomery County, Md., last November began to sell its own line of distilled  spirits. And last spring, Beverly Hills High School announced that it would  sell a line of clothes. Hali Wickner, a spokeswoman for Beverly Hills schools,  said Wednesday that the marketing program, after meeting mixed results, has  been on hold for the last two months. She said the school district is awaiting  a new proposal from another firm.  </P> <P> With local governments strapped for cash, Los Angeles County has championed  different ways to join with private enterprise to make money. In the last few  years, the county allowed bright yellow trash cans advertising suntan lotion on  beaches. Later, it approved signs that said "Nissan, official car of the Los  Angeles County beaches." And last summer, supervisors approved advertising on  beachside phone booths.  </P> <P> Klinger said these programs are designed to offset the estimated  $11-million-a-year operating deficit of his Los Angeles County beaches and  harbors department. "There are 70 million users on the beach each year and if  we can get a sponsor who is interested in cultivating them . . . I don't have a  problem with that," Klinger said.  </P> <P> Supporters said that eventually the county may create a county symbol to be  sold along with its endorsement.  </P></p>

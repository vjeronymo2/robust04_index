			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Observer: Initially free BT, Britain's biggest company, seems to be taking penny-pinching to a ridiculous extent. It contacted a colleague's husband the other day to ask whether he wanted all four of his initials to appear before his surname in the phone directory for his about-to-be-purchased house. He could have three for free, but the fourth would cost him Pounds 3 a quarter extra. Obviously a new money-making rule; he has all four in the 1992 directory without having incurred the extra charge.</p>

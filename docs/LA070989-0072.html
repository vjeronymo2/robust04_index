			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BEST STUFF  </P> <P> I have just come back from a long trip to New York, England and France. Thank  goodness, my office kept all the back issues of the Sunday Los Angeles Times. I  have just read and re-read your pieces on Bora Bora (May 14) and Raiatea (May  21). They are some of the best stuff I have ever read and I have saved them,  not only to refer to for my readers, but as a source of inspiration. Thank you  for your beautiful series.  </P> <P> WILLIAM TOMICKI  </P> <P> Publisher, Entree  </P></p>

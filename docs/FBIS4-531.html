			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Schnehage] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 12 SAPA -- African National  Congress President Nelson Mandela says he is confident  international mediation can resolve the deadlock over the  Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] participation in the election as  well as the role of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini under a new  constitution. Speaking in Johannesburg on Tuesday [12 April]  ahead of a meeting with Bophuthatswana traditional leaders, Mr  Mandela said he would meet later in the day with the group of  international mediators who arrive in South Africa on Tuesday.  The ANC leader said he would make "detailed recommendations" to  the mediators "so that their efforts can as far as possible be  successful".    Former British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington arrived at  Jan Smuts Airport on Tuesday morning and ex-US Secretary of  State Henry Kissinger was due later in the day. Lord Carrington  and Mr Kissinger are among seven foreign mediators who will try  to narrow differences between the ANC and the IFP.</p>

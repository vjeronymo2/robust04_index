			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Finland's Ministry of Trade and Industry has  published a new long-term program for space research. The  program is designed to retrieve as much as possible of the funds  spent on space research by promoting projects with realistic  economic prospects. Sheryl Riggins has more.    [Riggins] Finland's leading space researchers were out in  force on Monday [21 March] for the publication of the new space  research program. Finland does not plan to spend money on just  any project under the illustrious heading space, and Finns are  not seeking a spot for a Finnish astronaut on spaceflights.  Instead Finnish space research will be focusing on  down-to-earth projects with realistic applications.    Finnish scientists will be concentrating on three main areas  -- telecommunication satellites, remote mapping, and basic space  research. Finland already has extensive background in precisely  these areas of study. Remote mapping is a field of particular  interest, because it can bring significant economic rewards some  time in the future. Remote mapping is used, for instance, in  exploration for mineral deposits, charting timber reserves,  predicting the weather, and providing navigational assistance to  ships -- all of which are sellable services. The new national  space research strategy comes on the eve of Finland's entry into  the European Space Agency, ESA. Joining the club [as heard]  will cost about 100 million marks a year. The Finnish space  researchers believe that at least that much can be earned in  industrial orders.</p>

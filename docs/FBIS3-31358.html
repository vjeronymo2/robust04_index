At the end, the Commission adopted the proposal for a law for  the forming of an Intelligence Agency.    The representatives of the Interior Ministry pointed out  that  the law defines the control at three levels: "The president of  the state appoints and dismisses the director, the government  can demand responsibility from the director for the activities  of the Agency, and there will also be parliamentary supervision."    A couple of members of the commission emphasized the  conceptual inconsistency that the director answers to organs  which did not elect him. To this, the Interior Ministry  representatives replied that the strengthened control is  introduced in order to prevent the autonomous activities of the  agency, but also not to allow involvement in the daily political  interests.    In relation to this law, also two amendments were submitted.  The first one specifies that the employees in the agency cannot  carry out other activities and functions, and the second, that  both the employees in the agency and the Interior Ministry have  the right a 30 percent increase.</p>

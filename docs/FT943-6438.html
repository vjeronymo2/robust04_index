			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Frankfurt The market will be preoccupied with the Bundesbank's fortnightly central council meeting on Thursday, the fortunes of the domestic bond market and the Dax index's ability to hold above resistance at 2,100, according to Mr Detlev Klug at B. Metzler in Frankfurt. However, participants will be keeping a keen eye on the release on Wednesday of the mid-term report of Daimler-Benz, the automotive, aerospace and industrial group, after shares in Volkswagen, its fellow blue chip, slumped last week on its disappointing progress report. Brokers will be particularly interested in any full-year or second-half forecasts from Daimler after Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, depressed sentiment last week with his gloomy prediction of stagnant west European car sales this year. Other companies in the news include Kaufhof, the retailer, which releases mid-term results on Tuesday and Deutsche Bank which is holding an analysts' meeting on Thursday. MAN, which is expected to report full-year figures this week has warned that the outcome will be below last year's DM213m.</p>

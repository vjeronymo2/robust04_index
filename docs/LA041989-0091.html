			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS WILL NOT OFFER CONTRACT TO LAUFENBERG FOR THE 1989 SEASON  </P> <P> Babe Laufenberg, the free-agent quarterback who started the first six games for  the San Diego Chargers last season, will not be offered a contract for the 1989  season, team spokesman Bill Johnston said.  </P> <P> Laufenberg, 29, becomes a free agent again, a status he is familiar with after  being released eight times by four teams since his 1983 National Football  League entry as a sixth-round draft choice of the Washington Redskins.  </P> <P> "I am disappointed," Laufenberg said, "but I'm not bitter. In effect, they  fired me. This is what I do for a living. But I didn't make the big plays last  year. I would like to have had a second chance."  </P> <P> Laufenberg emerged from a 1988 training camp competition against Mark Vlasic  and Mark Malone as the Chargers' starting quarterback. Dan Fouts, San Diego's  quarterback for 15 years, announced his retirement after the 1987 season.  </P> <P> Last year was the first in which Laufenberg threw a pass during a  regular-season game. He completed 61 of 126 passes for 703 yards with four  touchdowns and five interceptions.  </P> <P> The Chargers were 2-4 with Laufenberg starting. Malone finished the season as  the starter for San Diego, 6-10 in 1988, after Vlasic suffered a severe knee  injury.  </P> <P> Malone was the league's lowest-rated quarterback for the second consecutive  year.  </P> <P> Charger Coach Dan Henning, who succeeded the fired Al Saunders, has said he  wants to improve the quarterback situation either through the draft or by  trade.  </P> <P> San Diego has the eighth overall pick in Sunday's college draft.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> NEPOTISM RULES NOT BROKEN, BOARD SAYS  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday that Dist. Atty. Michael D.  Bradbury did not violate anti-nepotism rules by allowing the head of his  child-support division to keep his new wife on his staff.  </P> <P> The supervisors approved a report by the county Personnel Department saying the  Civil Service Commission "concluded inaccurately" that C. Stanley Trom, the  child-support unit's manager, had hiring and firing authority over his wife,  Margaret Trom, an ombudsman in the division.  </P> <P> That power, called "appointing authority," actually was held by Bradbury,  Personnel Director Ronald W. Komers said.  </P> <P> In addition, Komers told the board that on Nov. 15, Margaret Trom's position  was placed under the authority of Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White,  removing Trom from her husband's supervision.  </P> <P> The Troms, both longtime county employees, married Oct. 7.  </P> <P> "With the change in reporting relationship, there is no direct or indirect  supervision of the ombudsman function by an immediate family member," Komers  said.

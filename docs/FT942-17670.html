			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / German interest rate cuts urged The German economy is so weak that further interest rate cuts are essential, and the government must also act to encourage job creation and prevent further contraction in domestic demand, a top Deutsche Bank executive has warned. The Bundesbank, the central bank, need have no fear of prompting a rise in the US dollar and thus fuelling imported inflation, Mr Ulrich Cartellieri told the bank's annual press conference. Nor need it worry about disturbing European exchange rates to the disadvantage of German exporters. Mr Cartellieri, the main board director responsible for foreign exchange and the economics department at Germany's biggest private sector bank, said the weakening dollar was virtually an 'invitation' to rate cuts. Every German rate reduction would be fully followed by European neighbours, he added. Other conditions were also favourable. Inflation was falling, and the recent annual pay round had resulted in the lowest wage increases since introduction of the D-Mark in 1948. Meanwhile, the economy remained weak. Unemployment would increase by around 500,000 to 4.5m this year. Exports might increase 5 per cent, but that would not compensate for last year's 10 per cent drop. Nor was there any chance of internal improvements, Mr Cartellieri claimed. Private consumption would fall at least 1 per cent this year and drop again in 1995 on the introduction of a 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge and new nursing care insurance contributions. Stating his case against a background of rising optimism in industry, he said false conclusions should not be drawn from the apparent improvement in company profits. This was due to reduced one-off costs for restructuring rather than a real upswing, he claimed. No one should count on increased investment. 'Even stagnation at last year's extremely low level could be counted as a success in 1994.' Expectations of 1 per cent economic growth in western Germany this year were based entirely on improved exports and special factors prompting a boom in house building. Government forecasts of 1.5 per cent pan-German growth were based on 'rather optimistic' assumptions, he said. Results, Page 13</p>

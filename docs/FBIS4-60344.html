			<p>BFN     [Text] Glorious ceremonies were held at the leader's hajj  headquarters last night on the third night that pilgrims to the  House of God camped at the holy land of al-Mina. Our  correspondent reports:    [Unidentified correspondent] Dear listeners of the midday  bulletin of the Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran: I speak  to you from the holy land of al-Mina. Tens of thousands of  Iranian and non-Iranian pilgrims took part in ceremonies held at  his eminence the leader's headquarters in the holy land of  al-Mina last night. The chants of Death to America and Death to  Israel of the participants could be heard all over the camp  where the Islamic Republic of Iran's hajj caravans stayed. At  the same time fully equipped Saudi special commandos surrounded  the leader's headquarters and the area where the Iranian  pilgrims resided and controlled comings and goings and created  problems for the Iranian pilgrims. So many pilgrims had  gathered at the ceremony that the leader's headquarters and the  tents beside it were filled with people.    During the ceremonies, Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi, one of the  Qom  Seminary scholars, spoke on the philosophy of the uprising of  His Holiness Abraham, peace be upon him, and the implementation  of divine orders at that holy land. He stressed: What was  special about the action taken by His Holiness Abraham was the  breaking of idols and his decisiveness against infidels and the  declaration of the disavowal of the infidels.    Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi referred to the leadership role of  the  velayat-e faqih [guardianship of the supreme jurisconsult] in  guiding the Muslim society toward understanding God and said: We  believe that the Islamic Republic is in line with the  implementation of Islamic principles and the uprising of the  idol-smashing Abraham. Therefore the Muslim and revolutionary  people of Iran continue to listen to the command of the leader  of the revolution and implement their duties. He pointed out:  The day that the late imam [Khomeyni] decreed that the disavowal  of the infidels ceremonies should be held, the Iranian nation  obeyed the order and even sacrificed a great deal of blood for  that holy cause. Today also, abiding by the orders of his  eminence the leader, it treads the path of its supreme ideals.    Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi said: If the disavowal of the  infidels  ceremonies were cancelled in holy Mecca and our people put up  with it, this was to protect the sanctity of that divine  sanctuary [the Ka'bah]. And it was due to the discernment and  vigilance of the leader of the Islamic revolution that the  ceremonies were cancelled.</p>

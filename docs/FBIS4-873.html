			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federal Government is to announce its political  agenda in January next year. The minister of information,  Professor Jerry Gana, made this known yesterday while briefing  newsmen in Lagos. Prof. Gana explained that January was chosen  to give the delegates at the national constitutional conference  enough time to finish their deliberations. The announcement,  according to him, will be the climax of phase two of the  government's political agenda, which started with the  constitutional conference. The minister said the government  would not want to give a specific date for the handover because  it did not know the regulations or the structure the conference  would want the nation to take. Prof. Gana, however, noted that  the constitutional conference, which was the first phase of the  political agenda, would not go beyond December this year. He  said the election of delegates to the conference will start in  the first week of June, while the conference will convene on 27  June in Abuja.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Pacific Dunlop sees brighter prospects PACIFIC Dunlop, the Australian industrial and food group, yesterday announced a 14 per cent increase in net profits to ADollars 121m (USDollars 86m) for the first half to the end of December, on sales up 11.6 per cent to ADollars 3.2bn. Mr John Gough, chairman, said the group was 'over the worst of the recession', and forecast that full-year profits would increase 'significantly'. The group maintained the dividend at 10.5 cents, 55 per cent franked. Pacific Dunlop said sales increased in all its Australian operations, which range from fashion clothing and processed food to packaging, automotive products and telecommunications cables. The Petersville Sleigh food division, acquired in 1991 from the Adelaide Steamship group and renamed Pacific Brands Food, increased earnings before interest and tax by 45 per cent to ADollars 29m. The group said its international medical and battery businesses accounted for 38 per cent of profits and 33 per cent of turnover, compared with 29 per cent and 31 per cent in the comparable period of the previous year. Mr Gough said the group was reaping the benefits of restructuring and rationalisation in the previous two years. He said a tentative upturn in demand for industrial products was being matched by a strengthening in retail demand, but profit margins remained under pressure. Mr Gough said trading conditions remained difficult.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> AKIHITO PLEDGES TO SAFEGUARD JAPAN CONSTITUTION  </P> <P> Japan's new emperor said today he will help safeguard the democratic  constitution, and leftist politicians urged vigilance against any government  effort to use the monarchy for "reactionary" ends.  </P> <P> One Communist and five Socialist legislators boycotted the ceremony at which  Emperor Akihito pledged himself to the constitution imposed by the United  States after World War II, but two Socialists did attend.  </P> <P> Those who stayed away said the monarchy's close links to the Shinto religion  violate the constitutional separation of state and religion. They were invited  in their capacities as chairmen of parliamentary committees.  </P> <P> Outside the Imperial Palace, nearly 315,000 mourners signed registers of  condolence for Emperor Hirohito, who died of cancer last week at age 87. His  62-year reign was marked by the rise of militarism, defeat in the war and  Japan's emergence as a leading economic power.  </P> <P> Akihito, 55, is expected to be closer to the people than his father, who was  thought a living god until he renounced the concept of imperial divinity after  World War II.  </P> <P> In his first speech as emperor, Akihito said he would continue on Hirohito's  path, "making his desire to constantly be at one with the people my desire as  well, joining together with you to preserve the constitution of Japan."  </P></p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / European Property 6: Sluggish outlook is taking its toll - France / France's property analysts believe that the slowdown is set to continue well into the mid-1990s IF you glance around the streets of Paris you might be forgiven for thinking that the city's property market is as frenzied as ever. A fleet of bulldozers prowls around the Musee du Louvre. The tiny streets on the other side of the Rue de Rivoli are being ploughed up for the redevelopment of the old finance ministry. To the east, the Bercy area, home of the new ministry, is a sea of cranes - as is La Defense to the west. There are very few streets in the city without at least one building shrouded by developers' hoardings and clouded by the dust of building work. But beneath the bustle of bulldozers and building sites, the Paris property market is in trouble. So far, the developers in France's capital have managed to avoid a repetition of the severe problems facing their counterparts in New York and London. They also have the consolation that demand for property in other French cities - notably Nice and Lille - is still resilient. But the property market in Paris, and to a lesser extent, that of Lyon, is undoubtedly slowing down. The consensus among France's property analysts is that the slowdown is set to continue well into the mid-1990s. A study by Finance Evolution predicted a 'crisis along the lines of those in the Anglo-Saxon market' for the Parisian market which would last for three to seven years. The fortunes of France's property industry are closely linked to those of the French economy. When the economy flourished in the late 1980s, so did France's property companies. The big cities bustled with building activity thanks to the government's grandiose Grands Projetsand the sea of private sector projects. As the economy has slowed down, so has the property market. France still boasts one of the lowest inflation rates in Europe, but the rigid economic policy pursued by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the long-serving finance minister, coupled with the need to protect the franc by pinning French interest rates to those of Germany, has impeded growth in the past year or so. As unemployment rises and Mrs Edith Cresson's government struggles for credibility in the approach to next year's national elections, the economic outlook for 1992 looks even more sluggish than in 1991. This lacklustre backdrop, combined with the flood of new property developments flowing onto the market, has already taken a toll on demand. The latest report from Jones Lang Wootton, the London-based commercial property consultancy, suggests that 'although over-supply is not of dramatic proportions' the French market has 'entered a period of indigestion' characterised by a 'wait-and-see attitudes by tenants and investors alike'. Predictably, the situation is worse in the very same areas that benefited most from the property boom of the late 1980s. In the 'Golden Triangle' area of central Paris, for example, average annual rents for office space fell from FFr4,500 a square metre in the first quarter of 1991 to FFr4,200 in the final quarter of the year, according to Jones Lang Wootton, which also noted that prospective tenants were demanding more and more concessions from landlords. Similarly rents at La Defense softened from between FFr3,000 and FFr3,200 in the first quarter to FFr2,800 by the end of the year. By contrast, rentals have held steady in the less prestigious areas on the outskirts of the city. The price of property in the Bercy area, where relatively few developments are actually ready for occupation, increased in the course of last year, rising from FFr2,800 in the first quarter to FFr3,000 in the fourth. The same pattern is apparent in Lyons. Jones Lang Wootton suspects that in the long term the Lyons market will be stabler than that of Paris but in the short term it, too, is suffering from depressed demand and the threat of over-supply. Office rents have stopped rising everywhere in the city apart from the Presqu'ile area in the centre where supply of space is still limited. But, in contrast to Paris, the city fringes seem to be suffering more than the centre. Other cities have yet to show the same signs of strain. The property markets in Lille and Nice are still buoyant as are those in other provincial centres. Moreover, Jones Lang Wootton is confident that neither Paris nor Lyons is likely to experience a collapse along the lines of those in London and New York. Nonetheless, the French property sector is bracing itself for a tough time over the next few years. The economic environment ought to improve from the middle of this year onwards. German interest rates are expected to come down by late spring or early summer, thereby allowing France to reduce its rates too. By 1993, election year, even with the rigid Mr Beregovoy still at the helm of the finance ministry, the French economy should be ready to return to growth. But this will not be enough to alleviate the property market's problems. The crux of the issue is the threat of over-supply. The Finance Evolution study suggested that even after the economy recovers, the Paris property sector will still be plagued by its own structural problems. It expects the supply of new property to outstrip demand for the next few years. Finance Evolution also sees no sign of an end to the trend for investors to leave Paris for other areas, or to concentrate on other sectors. It cited the example of Assurances Generales de France (AGF), one of France's largest insurance companies, which invested FFr3bn in property in the Ile-de-France, the Paris region, during 1990 and virtually nothing last year. The spectre of over-supply and a shortage of investment bodes ill for France's property companies over the next few years. Finance Evolution does not expect to see any real sign of recovery in the market until 1995 at the earliest. In the meantime, the Parisian building sites are still shrouded with dust and dirt as the builders labour on. What will happen when their work is finished remains to be seen.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ADDITIONAL PROPERTY COSTS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Landlords costs in letting  Agents fees: 15 per cent-20 per cent of a building               of annual rent often payable on new                             products + 18.6 per cent VAT, which is                             recoverable  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tenants costs in leasing    Agents fees: up to 30 per cent of first of a building               year's rent + 18.6 VAT, which is recoverable  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sale costs by investor      Agents fees: 1 per cent-3 per cent + or owner/occupier           18.6 per cent VAT, which is recoverable  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase costs by investor  Registration duty: 18.5 (approx). or owner/occupier           If the building is less than five years                             old and the sale is the first transaction                             following physical completion, VAT of                             18.6 per cent is payable on the purchase                             price instead of registration duty, but is                             recoverable.

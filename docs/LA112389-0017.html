			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: ON THE ROAD AGAIN, A HARD DRIVE TO BAKERSFIELD  </P> <P> "Why don't we go home through Bakersfield?" I asked my wife when we left San  Luis Obispo, knowing she would like the chance to visit her family.  </P> <P> One must look at the map to see that Bakersfield is actually north of Santa  Maria, though Santa Maria is 168 miles north of Los Angeles and Bakersfield  only 100. (Because the state angles so far to the west, San Francisco is almost  as far west as north.)  </P> <P> "Isn't that a hard drive?" she asked.  </P> <P> I was looking forward to it. I had been told that the road was good but lonely.  "You won't find any MacDonald's out there."  </P> <P> They said the road to take was Highway 166, which cuts off State 101 just north  of Santa Maria, and goes east through Los Padres National Forest and across the  steppes of the San Joaquin Valley to Maricopa, finally connecting with Highway  99.  </P> <P> We had no sooner left Highway 101 than we were swallowed up in the kind of  wilderness I had not seen in California for many years. The road was good, but  there were never more than two or three other cars in sight. Now and then two  or three of us would crowd up behind a truck on the narrow road before we could  pass.  </P> <P> We climbed through low mountains, skirting grotesque geological formations  thrown up millions of years ago by an angry earth. The brown earth was dotted  by cows and oaks. On the far side of the Sierra Madres, the downgrade was so  steep that I had to brake to keep our speed under 70.  </P> <P> We came to a town called New Cuyama. It did not look new. We saw no large  buildings or public accommodations. If there was a MacDonald's we missed it.  The only structure of any size was the school. We passed through the entire  town in 30 seconds.  </P> <P> Five or six miles down the road we came to old Cuyama. It looked no different  from New Cuyama. It was equally small, equally horizontal. Its most imposing  structure was also the school. We passed through it in 30 seconds.  </P> <P> For miles no other sign of human tenancy appeared but there were cattle feed  bins behind barbed-wire fences. Finally tin shacks and white oil tanks began to  appear in the foothills below the rugged escarpments. Then oil pumps turned up,  scattered, lonely. They looked like fastidious dinosaurs drinking as they  lowered and raised their enormous heads.  </P> <P> Much of the landscape was uncultivated grazing land. At one point we passed a  small stand at which a woman was selling apples. She sat on a stool in front of  her wares, staring at the horizon, monumentally patient. She was utterly alone  on the earth. We looked about us in vain for an apple orchard.  </P> <P> Soon the western reaches of the San Joaquin Valley spread out before us. It is  a part rarely seen by travelers who traverse the long valley as quickly as  possible over Highways 5 or 99.  </P> <P> It was a world untouched by civilization's ills. Uncrowded, spacious, serene,  unhurried. It belonged to hawks, rodents, coyotes, rattlesnakes and owls. Man  had barely scratched its surface. My tensions drained away.  </P> <P> We passed through the arid Elkhorn Hills and came to Maricopa, a small oil and  farming center whose most famous neighbor is Taft, of oil and high school  football fame.  </P> <P> Beyond Maricopa, heading for Highway 99, we crossed the California Aqueduct, a  blue thread on its journey across the wasteland toward the thirsty metropolis  below.  </P> <P> Once we reached 99 and turned north toward Bakersfield, I turned on our radio  and tuned in a country music station, as I always do on that stretch of  highway. Bakersfield is known as Nashville West; it has produced some great  country music.  </P> <P> I was not disappointed. Soon we heard a man singing in that nasal style, a  style that sings of love, betrayal, heartbreak and redemption. "Don't we all  have the right to be wrong now and then?" he sang. There was an ad, and then a  man sang, "I don't remember loving you. I don't recall the things you say you  put me through."  </P> <P> I was in a proper mood for my periodical return to Bakersfield, the town where  I started my career, as a sports writer, and where I met my wife, a local high  school girl. The most romantic city in the world.  </P></p>

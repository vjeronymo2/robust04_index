			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaker of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko  says he voted in favor of the government-proposed budget for  1994. Speaking in Moscow, he said his decision came after the  Council had pushed through new articles to the budget relating  to government spending on the armed forces.    Article 32 now provides for an extra budgetary fund of  support to the army to be raised as part of government revenues  from privatization. The resources are to be channelled to  provide social security nets to the servicemen including housing  construction and conversion of defense-related industries.    One other article binds the government to bring down the  cost  of this year's defense spending by offering contracts to men and  non-commissioned officers and hiring officers in reserve,  reducing the number of military schools and disbanding  understaffed contingents.    The budget now provides for 40.6 trillion rubles of defense  spending in 1994.    However, the Council did not adopt any resolution on  Shumeyko's report about FC's role and place in overcoming  critical trends in the country. The question will be discussed  as the Council meets again next month.</p>

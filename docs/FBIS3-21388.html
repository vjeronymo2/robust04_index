			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 25--Singapore proposes to invest  substantial amount of surplus capital in India, considered to be  a prospective Asian mega-economy. As much as two to three per  cent of Singapore's reserves are sought to be invested initially  in developing infrastructure in the newly industrialised  economies (NIEs) of the future, such as India. The amount could  be raised to 35 per cent over the next decade.    This was stated here today by the Singapore Prime Minister,  Mr. Goh Chok Tong, who called for the creation of a "Yin-Yang"  or complementary relationship between the two countries. "Yin"  and "Yang" are the two opposing and yet balancing elements in  Chinese philosophy.    Addressing a meeting of Indian businessmen, organised by the  Confederation of Indian Industry, he felt that the contrasting  strengths of the two economies created an opportunity for a  long-term strategic business alliance between the private  sectors of the two countries.    Agreement signed: A strategic framework agreement  was signed on the occasion between the Singapore Manufacturers'  Association and the CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) to  promote trade, investment and economic cooperation between the  industries of the two countries.    Mr. Tong told Indian businessmen at the meeting that the  countries expected to become NIEs, such as Hong Kong and Taiwan,  over the next two decades are China, India and Vietnam. In case  India's economic reforms quickened, it could become a  mega-economy such as China and Japan.    While urging further opening up of the economy, especially  in  the banking sector, he felt that concessions extended to  non-resident Indians should be available to other Singapore  businessmen. "Singapore should be treated as an NRI (Nonresident  Indian) country," he commented amidst laughter.    On reducing customs tariff, he said it would be welcome, but  recognised the revenue implications involved for the Government  of India. Similarly, the need for taking into account trade  unions' views on the unemployment likely to be caused by the  economic restructuring in India was also a knotty political  issue, he conceded.    `India must go international': Replying to  questions from Indian businessmen, Mr. Goh suggested that  India's growth rate should be in the region of about six per  cent per annum to take the two per cent population growth into  account. This was the right time for India to "go  international," he observed, as it had certain basic strengths  in terms of an industrial base and pool of technically qualified  manpower.    Mr. Goh highlighted the prospects of joint ventures between  the two countries, especially in the ASEAN countries as well as  China, Myanmar and Vietnam. Singapore could offer capital,  management, access to technology and the market. "We can be your  link to the Asia-Pacific," he said.    In this context, he mentioned the first major collaboration  scheme, the $150 million Bangalore information technology park.  This is an integrated project to develop offices, factories,  houses and recreational facilities to be set up over a five-year  period. It is a joint development programme involving a  consortium of Singapore companies, Tatas and the Karnataka  Government.    Mr. Goh said, "we are building an external wing to our  economy, we are encouraging our businessmen to invest in the  region." He pointed out that till now Singapore's reserves have  been invested mainly in bonds, stocks and real estate in the  developed countries. But it had now been decided to invest a  portion of the country's reserves in stable, high growth  developing countries of Asia. The investment would be directly  in infrastructure projects, industries, hotels and tourist  facilities as well as commercial properties.    `Open sky policy': Asked about the need for an  "open sky policy" in India, he said the Indian Prime Minister  had indicated interest in allowing the entry of Singapore  International Airlines (SIA) to more destinations in this  country. But the Civil Aviation Minister was more cautious in  this regard, he said.    Mr. Goh maintained that SIA could bring tourists into the  country in order to achieve India's target of increasing tourist  arrivals from the present level of one million per annum to  three to five million per annum over the next few years. He said  it was Singapore's open sky policy which had improved tourism  growth and also made SIA one of the best airlines in the world.    Regarding India's alignment with regional trading blocs, he  felt that India should move eastwards while seeking to enter  into any regional trade blocs. Conceding the problems faced by  India in trying to align with the various regional blocs of the  East as well as West, he expressed the view that European  countries had a greater preoccupation with Eastern Europe at  this stage.</p>

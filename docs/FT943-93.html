			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Restructuring at Alitalia starts to bear fruit Alitalia, Italy's state controlled airline, recorded a first-half loss of L242bn (Dollars 155m) amid the first signs that a tough restructuring programme is bearing fruit. Although Alitalia made a L214bn loss during the same period in 1993, the figure was distorted by an exceptional revenues of L112bn from assets sales, mainly aircraft. Part of this year's loss referred to L45bn covering staff redundancies. Staff numbers fell 3 per cent to 18,113 and the process of rationalisation is expected to lead to a further substantial pruning of the workforce, especially ground staff. The company has also begun to persuade cabin crew to adopt more flexible work practices; also allowing for more efficient use of existing aircraft. The number of passengers rose 11 per cent to 6.56m, compared to the average increase of 9.1 per cent among the Association of European Airlines. The load factor rose by 4.8 points to 66.9 per cent. 'Operating results have improved thanks to a significant increase in traffic carried, generating a higher load factor, coupled with a visible reduction of costs and expenses,' said Mr Roberto Schisano, managing director. 'Sales revenue increased by 12.7 per cent while costs and expenses increased by 6.6 per cent, ' added Mr Schisano, who was brought in earlier this year to be chief executive. Gross operating margins almost doubled to L115bn. Investments during the period totalled L830bn while debt rose marginally to L2,388bn.</p>

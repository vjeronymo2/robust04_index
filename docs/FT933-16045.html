			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Letter: 60-hour week not 'macho' Sir, I venture to take issue with the view expressed in 'Macho managers under fire' (July 3) that it is 'lunacy' to work long hours. For my part, I am at work by 8am and normally clock up 50 to 60 hours a week in the office, including weekends. However, while this can be tiring, it is never, of itself, stressful, nor is it in any way worthy of the term 'workaholic'. I agree that fear of losing one's job is a source of stress, but I would have thought this applied even more to poorly-paid clerks working a 40-hour week than to highly-paid managers. What the article does not point out is that the typical manager is too sedentary, and would feel less stressed if he or she ate fewer lunches and instead went to the gym. More important, 'Dorking Man' is stressed precisely because of living in Dorking. It takes me 10 minutes to commute to work. The time it takes for 'Dorking Man' to wend his weary way home would provide an additional hour to be spent with the family, which is equally true first thing in the morning. A 50-hour working week leaves sufficient time for other things. The roots of the problem lie elsewhere.

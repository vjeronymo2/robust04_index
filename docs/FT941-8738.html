			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Korean carmaker to set up design centre Daewoo Motor, the South Korean vehicle maker, is setting up a design and engineering centre in the UK as part of its expansion into world car markets. Daewoo Motor plans to establish itself as one of the top 10 carmakers in the world and is seeking to more than triple its world production capacity. It has taken over the facilities and staff of International Automotive Design in Worthing, West Sussex. IAD, formerly a leading UK automotive design and engineering company, was taken over from the receiver last year by Mayflower, the specialist automotive engineering group. The move by Daewoo is a bold step by the smallest of the big three South Korean carmakers to create a global design and engineering presence to accelerate the development of its new-vehicle programme. The South Korean motor industry is rapidly expanding overseas and both Hyundai and Kia, Daewoo's bigger domestic rivals, have entered many European car markets. Hyundai cars were launched in the US in 1986 and Kia is entering the US market this year. The Daewoo Motor technical centre in the UK has a workforce of about 200 and is recruiting additional engineering specialists, product planners and designers. The technical centre plans to start work this year on a project to design and develop a range of medium-size family cars. It aims to take on a new vehicle project each year. UK car production was 7.7 per cent lower in January at 100,711 compared with 109,127 in the same month a year ago, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday. It said output was depressed by a sharp fall in production for export. Car production rose by 6.5 per cent in the whole of last year to 1.38m, the highest since 1974. Output has been lower than a year earlier in three of the past four months. Output for export markets has been hit by the weakness of new-car demand in continental European markets, which has offset the rise in production for the UK market. Car production for export in January fell 27 per cent year-on-year to 36,724, while output for the domestic market rose 8.8 per cent to 63,987. The overall level of production was also affected by the lower number of working days in January. Vehicle output is still being affected by short-time working at several plants. The steep fall in commercial vehicle output continued in January with a year-on-year decline of 12.1 per cent.</p>

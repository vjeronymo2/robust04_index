			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Bosnia battle kills hundreds: Croat troops flee Moslem advance and surrender to Serbs HUNDREDS of people have been killed in fighting between Moslem and Croat forces over the central Bosnian town of Travnik, United Nations military sources said yesterday, Reuter reports from Travnik. 'I believe the number of dead is a matter of hundreds,' one western UN officer said. 'We don't know the precise figure because we still can't get in to all the villages.' The UN military sources said the Moslems had driven the Croats out of Travnik in fighting over the weekend, and had followed this yesterday by pushing out some 3,000 Croat civilians. The Croat military commander in central Bosnia said he had surrendered his troops to Serb forces to save them and thousands of civilians after a rout by the Moslems. 'We had no choice but to turn to the Bosnian Serb Republic and its army to enable us to save the necks of our children, women and elderly,' Commander Darko Kolenda told Reuter on nearby Mount Vlasic, which is held by the Serbs. The Croats' homes had been burnt or destroyed and they were now camped out in the open on a hillside. The Bosnian Serb army on Mount Vlasic said 1,000 Croat fighters surrendered to it rather than to the Moslems. The Bosnian Serb defence minister, Mr Dusan Kovacevic, said the Croat soldiers were accompanied by several thousand civilians. Bosnia's Moslem-led government said yesterday it would co-operate with a UN plan to set up 'safe areas' in Bosnia - but only if these havens were linked by protected corridors. In a statement issued by the presidency, and critical of the international attitude towards Bosnia, the government attached several strings to its co-operation, including the provision of an 'economic environment' around the towns. It was the ex-Yugoslav republic's first official comment on last Friday's UN Security Council resolution authorising the use of heavily armed troops and air power to defend six 'safe areas' - Sarajevo, Gorazde, Zepa, Srebrenica, Tuzla and Bihac.</p>

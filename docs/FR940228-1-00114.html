			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes that, notwithstanding the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for submission of reports, if an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution has provided Federal Pell Grants in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal Pell Grant Program regulations, but has not received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit or payment for those grants, the institution may receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment or a reduction in accountability for those grants. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would have to demonstrate that it qualifies for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit or payment by means of a finding contained in an audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report as initially submitted to the Department that was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted after December 31, 1988. The audit would have to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been timely submitted in accordance with 34 CFR 668.23(c), with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to grants made during the period of that audit. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary specifies that, in determining whether the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifies for a payment or reduction in accountability, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary would take into account any liabilities of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution arising from that audit or any other source. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary collects those liabilities by offset in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 34 CFR part 30.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are those resulting from statutory requirements and those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with information collection requirements, if any, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heading  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations justify the costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governments in the exercise of their governmental function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Department in complying with the specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient administration of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of small entities. The small entities affected by these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations are small institutions of postsecondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education. These regulations make modifications that reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential abuse in the Title IV, HEA programs. These changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sections 668.8, 668.12, 668.13, 668.14, 668.15, 668.16,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 668.17, 668.22, 668.23, 668.26, 690.83 and Appendix A contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information collection requirements. As required by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NPRM contains provisions that would affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postsecondary institutions who wish to participate in the Title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV student financial assistance programs. Annual public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting and recordkeeping burden contained in the collection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information proposed in these regulations is estimated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10,488 hours, including the time for searching existing data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, completing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reviewing the collection of information, and submitting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the information collection requirements should direct them to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3002, New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Office Building, Washington D.C. 20503; Attention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Daniel J.

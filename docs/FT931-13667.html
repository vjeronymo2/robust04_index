			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Observer: Pizza success After falling out with his partners, PizzaExpress founder Peter Boizot, has found a way to make everyone happy again. His chain of 70 pizza restaurants is coming to market through a complex Pounds 14.6m reverse takeover. The punters are said to be fighting for shares, and he gets to remain chairman, albeit with some rather strong handcuffs. The deal has established him as perhaps Britain's most successful restaurateur. No doubt haughtier dining-establishments would sniff at Boizot's success. But whatever the 63-year-old jazz and hockey-fan might be short of, he certainly understands how to make money out of pizzas.</p>

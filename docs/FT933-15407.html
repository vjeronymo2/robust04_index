			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Russia begins to fray at edges THE RUSSIAN Far East region yesterday declared itself a republic, the second region to do so in the past 10 days in what has become a dangerously centrifugal trend in Russian politics. The region's parliamentary deputies, quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that they had taken the action to get equal rights in the new constitution, insisted that their decision was dictated by 'economic necessity'. The region, with its capital in Vladivostok, receives some Japanese investment and could expect to be a significant beneficiary from Japanese and other Pacific Rim investment. Republican status would give it more control over foreign deals. The move would also strengthen the tendency for the Russian regions to escape from what they see as a high tax and inflation regime imposed by a remote Moscow government which can no longer give them much in return and can no longer exert discipline on them. The move came, ironically, as Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, met Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, in Tokyo yesterday at the Group of Seven summit - a meeting long delayed by Mr Yeltsin. Japan has effectively limited investment and aid while the issue of the four Kurile islands seized from it by the Soviet Union at the end of the last war are returned. Last week, the region of Sverdslovsk declared itself the Urals Republic  - the first of Russia's regions to claim the same status as the 20 'ethno-territorial' republics. In the draft constitution now being thrashed out, republics have greater representation and rights than the country's often richer and more populous regions. Discontent among regional leaders is now much more dangerous for Mr Yeltsin than the opposition of the parliament, where splits and backbiting among the deputies and the parliamentary leadership have allowed Mr Yeltsin to ignore it with impunity. The government is desperately seeking to convince both the regions and the outside world that inflation and the fall in production are under control. Inflation is down to around 15 per cent a month, the rouble strengthened slightly yesterday to 1050 to the dollar, and production falls are abating. However, the underlying engine of inflation, the printing of money by the central bank as credit to enterprises and agriculture, has been muffled rather than slowed.</p>

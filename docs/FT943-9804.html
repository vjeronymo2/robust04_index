			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Signet criticised by US holders Signet, the jewellery group formerly known as Ratners, was yesterday criticised by disaffected shareholders for failing to address their demands for a capital reconstruction. The San Francisco-based Delta Dividend Group said it would press ahead with plans to requisition an extraordinary meeting after receiving an 'inadequate response' to proposals for a restructuring and repayment of dividend arrears. Preference dividends have not been paid since early 1992, and arrears in the year to January 29 stood at Pounds 58m (Pounds 30.3m). Mr David Gale, president, said the US investors - holding variable term preference shares worth about Dollars 29m (Pounds 19m) - were disappointed by a letter from Signet which rejected their calls. 'We haven't been paid dividends for two and a half years, and I'm not sure the company has the means to compensate us,' he said. The US group had urged the company to relist the preference shares on Nasdaq; appoint a majority of non-executive directors; cap discretionary bonuses and restructure the capital. Delta, which claims to have backing from UK-based preference holders, said it would decide shortly on a set of resolutions.</p>

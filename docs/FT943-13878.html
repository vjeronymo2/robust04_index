			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Investment in SE Asia up Foreign investment in South-East Asia is rising sharply after two slow years and domestic investment remains robust, according to figures from national investment promotion agencies. Governments had feared that investors were losing interest in their countries and concentrating on China. But statistics show that companies from Japan, the US and other developed economies continue to commit billions of dollars to South-East Asia for everything from electronics and vehicle components factories to new power stations. Indonesia's Investment Co-ordinating Board said it had approved Dollars 5.33bn (Pounds 3.5bn) in foreign investment for the first six months of this year, up 23 per cent from the same period last year. Malaysia reported approved manufacturing investments of MDollars 10.5bn (Pounds 2.6bn) in the first half of the year, against MDollars 4.3bn. Thailand's Board of Investment received applications for Dollars 4.8bn in foreign investment in the first four months, only slightly below the sum for the whole of 1993. The Philippines BoI approved projects worth a record P239bn (Pounds 5.75bn) in the first half, more than quadruple the amount at the same time last year and more than double the target for all the whole of 1994.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / House prices increase again, says Nationwide HOUSE PRICES rose by 1.6 per cent in June, the largest monthly increase for two years and the fourth consecutive monthly rise this year, Nationwide, Britain's second-biggest building society, said yesterday. Mr Brian Davis, the society's operations director, said, however, that the recovery was 'still fragile, with turnover still only slightly above last year's depressed levels'. He said: 'The trend in house prices is clearly upwards but increases for 1993 as a whole can still, prudently, only be expected to be modest.' Prices have risen by 3.5 per cent in the first six months of this year according to figures compiled from Nationwide's monthly mortgage sales. The last time the society reported a monthly increase of more than 1.6 per cent was in May 1991, when prices rose by 2 per cent. House prices also rallied in the first half 1991 - rises were recorded by Nationwide in January, March, May and June of that year - only to fall sharply in the second half of the year as the recession deepened. According to Nationwide the average price of a house in May 1991 was Pounds 58,908. That compares with an average price of Pounds 53,710 at the end of last month - a fall of almost 10 per cent over two years. The market is not expecting a 1991-style collapse in prices this year. Nonetheless, there have been signs that some of the steam may have gone out of the housing recovery since Easter. Nationwide estimated that UK house sales had risen by about 5 per cent during the first five months of this year but said that was against very depressed levels last year. Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, reported that prices in May fell by 1.2 per cent after allowing for seasonal variations. Nationwide, which does not make seasonal adjustments to its figures, reported a 1 per cent rise for that month. Halifax is due to publish its June price index on Wednesday. It said that figures from both societies, 'averaged out' over the previous eight months, would indicate a very similar picture of flat house prices. In the second half of this year prices will show a 'more consistent pattern of small rather than large price rises as demand for homes increases', Halifax said.</p>

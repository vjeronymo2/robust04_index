			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Jupiter aborts plans for CST reconstruction Jupiter Tyndall has withdrawn plans for the reconstruction of CST Emerging Asia Trust. The change of plan is the latest of several aborted proposals by Jupiter, which has been battling to keep control of several trusts in its stable. The plan would have attempted to eliminate the discount through the issue of zero coupon convertible unsecured loan stock to replace the bulk of the trust's ordinary shares. No-one at Jupiter was available yesterday to explain why the proposals were withdrawn. Jupiter Tyndall has 29.9 per cent of CST Emerging Asia.</p>

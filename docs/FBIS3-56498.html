			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] There was quite a high turnout in the elections  for president of the republic on 16 January. [passage omitted]    INTERFAX reports that Ivan Yermakov, the Ukrainian  president's representative in Sevastopol, has been relieved of  his duties. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk signed the  relevant instruction on 17 January.    Local observers think this is the Ukrainian leadership's  first reaction to the results of the presidential elections in  Crimea, and do not rule out that other actions might follow this  dismissal.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (11): A feast of architecture - Top international designers have a field day STOCKHOLM FAIR, 1930; New York World Fair, 1939; Festival of Britain, 1951; Brussels World Fair, 1958; Montreal, 1967; Osaka, 1970 - the list of great exhibitions this century has offered a great series of opportunities for architects and builders to raise structures symbolic of their times. How often have the opportunities been seized to make architectural and engineering advances that might compare to the daring originality of the Crystal Palace designed for the Great Exhibition in London of 1851? It was in 1929 that Seville last hosted a great international exhibition, the Exposicion Ibero-Americana which was a companion to the Barcelona Exposicion Internacional in the same year. This year, the original plan was for Chicago to share the commemoration of the 1492 journey of discovery to America by hosting a parallel event in the Windy City. It would also have marked the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition  -one of the most architecturally magnificent fairs on the shores of Lake Michigan but its palaces were made of plaster and decidedly temporary. Architecturally, what is to be made of Seville's expo? Siting the Expo on the 500 acres of the island of La Cartuja provided a more or less virgin site around the old monastery. The situation also necessitated new bridges and an upgrading of the river banks which will be a positive and lasting benefit to the city. The island site has natural limits and so any visitor may well be surprised at the very high density of the exhibition layout. There are 103 participating nations and, although the planning allows for shaded walks and fountains, the pavilions are crammed together. The architectural dilemma facing any designer for a pavilion for a world fair is how can contemporary architecture, which is more or less a universal language, be used to exemplify national characteristics ? National architectural styles do appear at Seville, but the overall appearance is of futuristic modernism in keeping with the theme of 'Discovery' which runs through the fair. The organisers of the fair did lay down some ground rules for designers. They insisted on what they called 'urban architecture' - more substantial designs than is usual for temporary exhibitions as some 35 per cent of the structures will remain as will most of the infrastructure as the basis of a science and research park. Maximum height limits have been imposed (up to 25 metres) and, in the turgid language of the brief, 'homogenous density of building following a city/garden typology', has meant an agreeable scale and a sense of an extremely well landscaped site. There has also been insistence upon 'green' environmental conditions and the use of water and planting to ensure some relief from the intense heat of a Seville summer. There is also a unity of design in the street furniture, signage, paving, pergolas, and fountains. The overall sense of a site devised to reflect the best features of outdoor Mediterranean life looks very successful. The whole site is organised into a series of five international avenues, and an avenue of discovery that is the backbone of the expo. There is also a series of special public and performance areas around water. There are, besides the national pavilions, theme pavilions on subjects such as 'discovery', 'the future' and 'navigation', and the Expo Building itself, which has a definite future as a World Trade Centre. It is the Avenue of Europe (designers Hennin and Lippsmeier) which is the visible centre of the site. Here is also made plain the difficulty that modern designers have in expressing political ideas in any convincing built form. The 12 countries of the European Community are represented by 12 30-metre high towers. In shape these towers resemble the chimneys of the old Carthusian monastery and they are also designed to cool the air in the manner of the simple towers that cooled Moorish houses in Spain and North Africa. At the centre of the European boulevard is a giant plastic funnel composed of a swirl of translucent flags of the 12 nations. The lack of any shared symbolism is depressing - the glorious union of a free Europe that has vanquished communism and atheism is not represented ] For the visitor it is worth singling out some of the most interesting architecture of the national pavilions. With more than 100 to choose from the selection has to be subjective. The most cohesive and effective example of national architecture is the Japanese pavilion designed by Tadao Ando. It is a 25-metre high timber structure that is reminiscent of a brooding ancient temple. An escalator and staircase climb steeply to the bridge that is at its centre. It is both monumental and simple - and cleverly representative of both the past and the present in Japan. The Greek pavilion (architect Mariano Villalonga) looks like a truncated petrol station with a few attached columns; and the Italian pavilion (architects Gae Aulenti and Pier Luigi Spadolini) sadly is more like an office block than the fortified Italian palazzo it is supposed to represent. The Hungarian pavilion (architect Imre Makowecz) is a remarkable and beautifully built example of a national tradition. Representing a seven-towered wooden rural church, the interior is filled by a complete tree, its roots visible through a glass floor. The symbolism is clear - a country wanting to show that its roots belong in the west and it is now free to celebrate both its history and its future. The British pavilion is designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and it takes up the water theme of the expo in a spectacular way with a wall of moving water as the main elevation of the pavilion. Is there some significance that the British pavilion faces down the Avenue of Europe but has to be entered by a bridge over the troubled waters of its own moat? As an example of high-tech architecture the British pavilion is one of the most rational designs and visually undoubtedly a great success. It is worthwhile to compare it with the German pavilion - another exercise in structural virtuosity designed by architect Lippsmeier. Although the architectural opportunities at Seville have been significant I suspect that it will be the planning of the site and the landscaping efforts that have been made to cope with the extremes of climate that will be of more lasting interest and value. Visitors will probably sense how hard it is for contemporary international architecture to reflect national values. The memory they take away will be of trees and fountains and perhaps the brooding presence of Japan.</p>

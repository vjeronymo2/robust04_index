			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Manufacturing industry output is flat in June OUTPUT IN almost every sector of manufacturing industry was flat in June with only metals registering a fall from the previous month. The seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office paint a picture of an economy that has stopped contracting, but has yet to show unmistakable signs of growth. In the chemicals, engineering and textiles sectors output was unchanged on the previous month, while minerals, and food, drink and tobacco showed small rises. Manufacturing output is now 7.5 per cent below the level reached at a peak in the second quarter of 1990. Although this fall is not as steep as the downturn experienced by manufacturing during the recession of the early 1980s, it has occurred over a longer period. The latest figures show that manufacturing output has resumed an upward path for two successive quarters but remains 0.7 per cent down on the second quarter last year. After an upward revision to manufacturing output in May, growth in the second quarter was 0.4 per cent. That followed quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the year. Food, drink and tobacco registered the strongest growth in manufacturing. The sector was boosted by high drink sales during the hot weather in June and rose 1.1 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first. Chemicals suffered the sharpest fall as the output of pharmaceuticals dropped from a recent peak. Output declined by 1.4 per cent in the three months to the end of June compared with the previous three months. A breakdown of manufacturing by sector shows that output of consumer goods and investment goods rose in the second quarter, but production of intermediate goods - those supplied to other manufacturers - fell. The quarterly growth in consumer goods was fuelled by a strong rise in the output of cars, which rose 4.4 per cent from the previous three-month period. Other durables, mainly household goods, fell 1.6 per cent while clothing and footwear grew 0.6 per cent. Energy output fared less well than manufacturing in the second quarter, falling 2.1 per cent on the first three months of the year. The latest figures for energy and manufacturing suggest that overall GDP was flat in the second quarter.</p>

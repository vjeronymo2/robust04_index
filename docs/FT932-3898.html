			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: LVMH tries to adjust after a life of luxury - How the French group is coming to terms with a harsher environment When Mr Bernard Arnault battled his way to the top of LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods group, it was flourishing in the affluent environment of the mid-1980s. He now faces the challenge of adapting to the ascetic climate of the 1990s. The new battle has already begun. Mr Arnault yesterday told a shareholders' meeting that his group would suffer a fall in first-half profits this year. He warned that LVMH - which owns high prestige brand names ranging from Louis Vuitton luggage, to Hennessy cognac and Christian Dior perfume - would, at best, muster a slight increase on 1992's net profits of FFr3bn (Dollars 555m) for the full year. Mr Arnault said it was 'much more difficult to run a luxury goods group today than it was 10 years ago'. LVMH is not the only company to be struggling. Dunhill, its London-based competitor, last week disclosed a decline in profits last year. Gucci, an Italian rival, is said to be searching for new capital. However, LVMH has underlying strengths. First, it entered the recession having completed the restructuring that followed its formation in the merger of a number of family-owned companies in the mid-1980s. It was, at least, in a stable state when the market declined, unlike Gucci, which was struggling to reposition its brand. LVMH has the advantage of a broad base of interests both in terms of products and international spread. The strength of some sectors, notably perfume, has helped to counter the problems of others, such as champagne. Similarly, it is less exposed to individual markets than rivals such as Dunhill, which has been badly affected by Japan's instability. These strengths have sheltered LVMH from the rigours of the recession. Its operating profits fell to FFr5.5bn in 1992 from FFr6.4bn in 1991. However, the chief reason for the decline in net income to FFr3bn from FFr3.7bn was the reduction in the contribution from its 24 per cent holding in Guinness, the UK drinks group, to FFr681m from FFr1.1bn. So far, there is no sign of improvement in trading this year, except for the US. The luggage division is struggling to maintain operating profits as it did last year at FFr1.87bn. Cognac, which saw operating profits fall to FFr2.29bn in 1992 from FFr2.79bn in 1991, seems stable. 'The Japanese market has been affected by the economic situation,' said Mr Arnault. 'But we have had very strong growth from Taiwan, Hong Kong and China.' The chief concern is champagne, which has been trapped in a vicious cycle of weak demand, rising stocks and high raw material prices. Operating profits plummeted to FFr780m in 1992 from FFr1.33bn in 1991. LVMH last month called for 245 job losses at the 1,600-strong Moet-et-Chandon champagne house. This followed a 10 per cent price cut for Moet in France and Germany, although the price has been raised in the UK, Italy and Spain following the ERM crisis. Mr Arnault said it was too soon to assess the effect of the price changes. 'Champagne has always been a cyclical industry and we are at a low point in the cycle,' he said. 'But the cycle will change, hopefully from next year.' Meanwhile, analysts are braced for another plunge in profits this year. Perfume has been the most robust business with operating profits rising to FFr809m in 1992 from FFr636m, due to the successful launches of Dior's Dune and Givenchy's Amarige. Mr Arnault anticipates further growth in 1993. However, perfume margins, at 15 per cent last year, are far lower than those of cognac and luggage at 40 per cent. The fragrance market is also riskier with short product life-cycles and high launch costs. LVMH's finances are too constricted - with FFr14.5bn net debt and 50 per cent gearing - for Mr Arnault to buy his way out of recession. He has made a few small investments, notably last month's purchase of Financiere Truffaut, which owns minority holdings in the Kenzo fashion house and Agache, the Arnault master company. Mr Arnault said he 'could not exclude' buying out some of the Truffaut minorities. But the days of audacious deals, such as the Pounds 20m (Dollars 30.8m) launch of the loss-making Christian Lacroix fashion house, are over. 'The Lacroix experience has had benefits, we've learnt a lot from it,' he said. 'But no one would even imagine opening a new couture house today.' LVMH will have to engineer its recovery through its existing interests. Mr Sylvain Massot, analyst at Morgan Stanley, is confident that it can. 'So far, it's come through fairly well,' he said. 'Profits will probably be static in 1993, but we should see growth from 1994 onwards.'</p>

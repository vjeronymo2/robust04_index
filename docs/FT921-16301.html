			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Perspectives: As They Say in Europe AFTER Christmas there were suddenly these bunches of letters. CEI, CSI, GUS  -they all meant CIS or Commonwealth of Independent States. On the continent the acronyms were accepted at once - perhaps because the word 'commonwealth' exists only in English and Russian and must be rendered as 'community' in other languages. In Russia it is clear that the new organisation is not seen as one that matters. In Moscow, Kuranty, the liberal daily, summed up the changes: 'The world saw Gorbachev off in a respectfully reserved manner but without sentimentality, not only because everyone was reconciled to the change of scene in the Kremlin, but also because our foreign partners will not have permanent allies but rather permanent interests in Russia. Their interests coincide with our state interests in many aspects. Russia alone can exercise to the full the role of a Eurasian bridge as an alternative, rather than an antagonistic, centre of world influence.' Kuranty concluded that the West would do all it could to shore up Russia's great power status: 'It appears ready to cover our backsides here too. From a high moral viewpoint it is inadmissible that Russia should be admitted anew to the United Nations, kept in the Security Council, or invited to join in talks that have been underway for some time. The West is awaiting Russia's assurances about paying off debts since the bankruptcy of a great power can bring about considerable changes on the international scene.' This mixture of studied incoherence, demotic vulgarisms and a Chekhovian insouciance in the face of disaster is a feature of the Russian press today. It is not enough to sustain all those experts who used to make a living trawling the barren oceans of Pravda and Izvestia editorials but it is a sight more interesting. If the Russian press is refreshingly new, the German has gone back to another era. There is nothing like the advent of a new year to depress the Germans. The turn of this year is associated with the legislation allowing people to look up their old Stasi files. That is really going to set the cat among the pigeons. The East German secret police kept many miles of documents on 4m of its own citizens and 2m westerners. People can now look up their own files on demand. There has already been a notable case of an outspoken woman who found the Stasi was kept informed on her activities by her husband. So we have seen the re-emergence of that archetypal German word - Vergangenheitsbewaltigung. It means overcoming the past and was used formerly to describe the responsibility of the first post-war generation of non-Nazis. In Der Spiegel, historian Eberhard Jackel wrote a piece entitled 'The double past' about the relationship of the Germans with their history. He feared that the revelations of the horrors of the GDR could vitiate the memory of the horrors of the Nazis. He concluded, 'We can only become one people when we come clean about our double past, and that can be done decently only when we differentiate our history in sober comparison. In this context unification has thrown us back into the 1950s. There is yet again much to do.' A British businessman and private detective were found in Geneva to be investigating illegal sales of arms to Iraq. Both have been arrested. (Neue Zurcher Zeitung).

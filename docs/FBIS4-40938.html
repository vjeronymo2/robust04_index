			<p>BFN     [Text] Leader of the Russian communist party Gennady  Zyuganov believes that the country is on the threshold of  criminal dictatorship. On Saturday he addressed the sitting of  the forum Towards New Accord in Moscow. Representatives of 17  parties and 30 public organizations and movements from former  Soviet republics except Turkmenistan participated in the sitting.    According to Zyuganov, "dictatorship is inevitable" in the  case that "neither replacement of the course, nor refusal from  political revenge, nor formation of a government of national  confidence take place in the near term and priority trends in  the development of the agrarian industrial complex, military  industrial complex, education, science, and culture are not  determined."    The sitting discussed problems and prospects of economic and  political unification of the former Soviet republics. As said  President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs Arkadiy Volskiy, it would be necessary to Moscow  to invest 10,000 trillion rubles in order "to transfer to  self-subsistence economy" that is to manage without economic  cooperation with the former Soviet republics.    The volume of the inter-republican trade was 21 percent of  the USSR GNP, reported former USSR premier Nikolay Ryzhkov. At  the same time he said that out of 15 Soviet republics only  Russia and Turkmenistan had favorable trade balance. "Beginning  with 1917 Russia always gave more than it received," Ryzhkov  declared.    He warned about the danger "of ignoring and silencing" of  the  issue on the borders within the former Soviet Union and reported  there were 70 points on its territory "which can trigger the  issue on the borders."    In Ryzhkov's opinion, "the CIS appeared to be lacking vital  capacity and has not justified its tasks." A future voluntary  union, he said, should be open not only for former Soviet  republics but for other countries of Europe and Asia which will  express their wish to join it.</p>

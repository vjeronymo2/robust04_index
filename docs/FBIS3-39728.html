			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stefano Marroni: "Martinazzoli Versus De Mita: </F> `His Remarks Are Merely Insults'"]    [Text] Rome -- It was a sharp slap in the face: Nobody  likes to hear themselves being called "nonexistent," accused of  submissiveness to an "idiot" -- even if that idiot's name is  [Pact for Italy leader] Mariotto Segni. [Italian Popular Party,  PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli said nothing. Nothing to  journalists, nothing to his aides, and nothing even to those  working with him to draw up lists of candidates. It must have  been difficult not to comment even to his closest associates on  the bomb dropped by De Mita in the very heart of what used to be  the DC [Christian Democratic Party] left. To ignore the  announcement that, amid so many problems, the "great outcast" is  planning to wage war, within a PPI that he can see sliding to  the right, into the arms of [Northern League leader] Bossi and  [Forza Italian leader] Berlusconi. But in the evening  Martinazzoli's rage exploded: "Let him by all means occupy an  opposition stance within the party; that is his right. But,"  Martinazzoli said, "I consider some of his remarks entirely  unjust. They are insults, rather than arguments. And I greatly  regret the fact."    The secretary was furious, hurt, and worried. This is  because he is fully aware that De Mita is not alone in thinking  those things, as he witnesses the disappearance or the collapse,  one by one, of the candidates, representing all groups, of the  old left -- De Mita, Bodrato, Tina Anselmi, Granelli, Mancino,  and Mattarella. Moreover, in the shadow of the axis with Segni,  there is again a growing fear that the "ideologue," Rocco  Buttiglione, could realize the dream of a DC "controlled by  Communion and Liberation."    In fact the PPI [Italian Popular Party] leadership realized  at once that the secretary had read De Mita's interview  carefully. They inferred it from Martinazzoli's response to the  reckless person who asked him to reveal his plans for the coming  days: "But we do not even know what the world will be like next  week." The questions subsided, but his silence was not enough  to quell his anger. And when he drove off from his home at 1600  Martinazzoli looked extremely grim. This, even though he was on  his way to meet not with "the Irpinia progressive ethnic group"  (as PPI leaders call De Mita's supporters) but with the  officials of CIDA, the Business Managers' Federation.    He arrived dressed in blue, on edge, smoking a cigarette,  with a look that said: "Don't come near me or I'll kill you."  But television Channel 1 journalist Mimmo Sacco -- who has  devoured several DC secretaries -- was brave enough to approach  him. He knew exactly where he was driving, but he took an  oblique approach, asking whether there are still any "problems"  with Segni. His prudence did not spare him an attack: "You must  stop it. It is you who have fabricated these ruptures and  disputes. I have had enough of it." Sacco did not give up, and  craftily talked about Occhetto, about strong men, even  succeeding in making the secretary smile. He took advantage of  this to ask his key question: What about De Mita? This time  Martinazzoli did not even answer: He rolled his eyes, shook his  head, spluttered, "What, again?" and made off, turning his back  on Sacco.    At 1900 he returned to PPI headquarters. Rosy Bindi had just  left. It is well known that she does not like the right. So,  did she like what De Mita had to say? "His interview confirms  that he has tremendous political acumen," she replied with  conviction. So is he correct? Are the PPI's lists really in  danger of providing a stepping stone to a life to the right of  Segni? "We are indeed working to ensure that this does not  happen."    That is not exactly the official line. This, though  Martinazzoli did make hints at his meeting with CIDA officials:  He stepped up his attack on a Right that he swore he did not  want to ally with, a right that "if it continues this way  threatens to be victorious," a Right that "is anything but what  the country needs, and that will lead Italy back to the years of  autarchy" -- a Right that has "a real leader who is neither  [Northern League leader] Bossi nor [Italian Social Movement]  leader Fini" and within which the League "no longer represents a  break but has become an amalgamating force."    This is consistent, according to his associates; "it is what  he has always thought; he does not need to reply to De Mita."  They too are angry with De Mita who is "obsessed with being at  the center of the world"; "who is now attacking CAF [Craxi,  Andreotti, Forlani], though in 1989 he curbed Martinazzoli,  arguing the `realism' of the agreement with Forlani"; who "would  be right if it were true--which it is not--that he was left off  the electoral list without anyone having asked him to make such  a generous gesture..." Silvia Costa also defended the  secretary: "What? If we have always claimed that parliamentary  representation is a service, why should someone get angry over  their seat? De Mita is wrong: Unfortunately, it was the way in  which he was asked not to run that turned his personal candidacy  into a political one."    But these remarks came from the first floor, contrasting  with  the sepulchral silence that reigned on the second floor -- in  the inner sanctum, until Maria Eletta Martini emerged. So what  about De Mita? she did not reply, drew a sigh, and shrugged.  Are you turning to the right? She was about to shrug again,  then stopped herself and blurted: "Ciriaco is expressing  well-founded anxieties, with which I fully agree. But I  interpret them as anxieties, whereas he talks about them as  faits accomplis. In fact, after all, the elections have not yet  taken place. As you know, we are in a difficult situation. We  have loyally supported what was certainly not a progressive  government and have had to form handicapped alliances." And  were they fair with De Mita over his candidacy? This time the  old De Mita supporter became heated: "On this point De Mita is  entirely in the right. We treated him like dirt, like some kid  who should stand aside. I have said so, too." A few feet away,  Martinazzoli's press officer blanched. But by this point she  was unstoppable. And when someone asked her whether she trusts  Segni she looked at him as though he were crazy: "No, for  goodness' sake." These are difficult times for Martinazzoli.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHORALE'S ROBERT JONES TO LEAVE POST  </P> <P> Robert Willoughby Jones, executive director of the Los Angeles Master Chorale,  confirmed Friday that he is leaving his post when his contract expires June 30.  </P> <P> "Because of differences in management and musical philosophy, I will be leaving  the Los Angeles Master Chorale by mutual agreement," Jones said in a prepared  statement. He has been chief administrator at the Master Chorale since 1980.  </P> <P> Abbott Brown, president of the L.A. Master Chorale Assn., said Jones' departure  was the result of "a number of different points of view concerning the  direction of the chorale, which we have been discussing in the past year.  </P> <P> "We are looking at long-range planning consistent with the long-range plans of  the Music Center, at alternative directions for the chorale, and also at our  organization's overall structure," Brown said.  </P> <P> He said that the chorale was "in sound financial condition."  </P> <P> "We have had a good financial year," he said. "We are going to conclude the  season on budget, or even better."  </P> <P> John Currie, the organization's music director since 1986 -- Jones was  instrumental in bringing the conductor here from Scotland -- was not available  for comment.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fourth, in accordance with section 445(b)(2) of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.18 to provide that an institution is authorized to make payments to students for services performed on or after May 15 of the previous award year but prior to the beginning of the succeeding award year (that is, for summer employment) from the succeeding award year's allocation. This carry-back authority would be in addition to the existing authority to carry-back 10 percent of the succeeding year's allocation for use at any time during the preceding award year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fifth, in accordance with section 443(b)(2)(A) of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.18 to provide that institutions are required to use at least 5 percent of the total funds granted to the institution to compensate students employed in community service activities for the 1994&hyph;95 and subsequent award years. If an institution is unable to comply with this requirement to provide community services, the institution may request a waiver of this requirement. The Secretary will approve a waiver if the Secretary determines that enforcing this requirement would create a hardship for students at the institution. The public is invited to comment on the circumstances under which the community service requirement might create a hardship for students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 675.21&blank;Institutional Employment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current regulations provide that a proprietary institution may employ a student to work for the institution in jobs that are in community services but also involve the provision of student services that are directly related to the work-study student's training or education. In accordance with section 443(b)(8) of the HEA, as amended by the Technical Amendments, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.21(b) to provide that a student employed by a proprietary institution and performing community services is no longer also required to be furnishing student services. This change would help promote community services because of the limited employment opportunities that satisfy both types of services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 675.26&blank;FWS Federal Share Limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current regulations provide that the Federal share of FWS compensation paid to a student employed other than by a for-profit organization may not exceed 70 percent. In accordance with section 443(b)(5) of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.26 to increase the Federal share to 75 percent. However, the Federal share of FWS compensation paid to a student employed by a for-profit organization still may not exceed 50 percent as established by the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important to note that the Secretary will continue to authorize a Federal share of 100 percent of the compensation earned by students during an award year if all of the following criteria are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The work performed by the student is for the institution itself, for a Federal, state or local public agency, or for a private nonprofit organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The institution at which the student is enrolled is designated as an eligible institution under the Strengthening Institutions Program (34 CFR part 607), the Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities Program (34 CFR part 608), or the Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institutions Program (34 CFR part 609).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The institution requests the increased Federal share as part of its regular FWS funding application for that year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 675.28&blank;Community Service Learning Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current regulations provide for a separate ``Community Service Learning program'' under the FWS programs. In an effort to increase participation in community service activities in the title IV, HEA programs, Congress amended the statement of purpose for the FWS program to encourage students to participate in community service activities. The Amendments removed the authority for a separate ``Community Service-Learning program'' and instead require institutions to employ a percentage of their FWS students in community service jobs. As a result of this change, the Secretary is proposing to remove &sect;675.28 from the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Job Location and Development (JLD) Program (Subpart B)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 675.31, 675.32&blank;Purpose and Program Description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current regulations provide for two separate Job Location and Development programs: (1) A regular JLD program to expand off-campus job opportunities for students enrolled in eligible institutions of higher education who, regardless of their financial need, want jobs; and (2) a ``Community Services'' JLD program to locate and develop community services jobs for students with financial need.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.31 in accordance with amended section 446 of the HEA to combine the two programs into one program to expand off-campus job opportunities for students enrolled in eligible institutions, regardless of their financial need. The Secretary is further proposing to amend &sect;675.31, in accordance with the amended statement of purpose for all the FWS programs in section 441(a) of the HEA, to include in the statement of purpose for the JLD program the encouragement of participation in community service activities. Also, in accordance with amended section 446 of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.32 to allow an institution to use the lesser of $50,000 or 10 percent of the institution's allocation to establish or expand a program to locate and develop jobs, including community service jobs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 675.34&blank;Multi-Institutional Job Location and Development Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current regulations provide that institutions may enter into agreements with other participating institutions and nonprofit organizations to establish and operate job location programs for its students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.34 in accordance with amended section 446(a) of the HEA to eliminate the authority for institutions to enter into agreements with nonprofit organizations and limit institutions to working with other institutions for the purpose of developing jobs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

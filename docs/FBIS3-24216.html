			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Aspin: "Clients of New York Bank Offered </F> `Taiga Securities'"]    [Text] One of the largest American banks--Chemical  Bank--on Monday began regular operations in the purchase and  sale of Russian Ministry of Finance state domestic currency loan  bonds. The emergence on the market of such a professional  participant, in the opinion of KOMMERSANT experts, will not only  bring qualitatively new forms of operation with these  securities, but will also become the source of additional  liquidity for the still weakly organized market in currency  bonds.    The "Taiga bonds" (in the terminology of the Chemical bank,  this is what the Minfin [Ministry of Finance] state domestic  loan bonds issued against the frozen debts of the  Vneshekonombank [Foreign Economic Bank] are called) have  attracted the attention of banking experts for a number of  reasons. First of all, Chemical Bank has the reputation of being  one of the most active dealers on the state loan bonds markets  of the developing countries. Bank experts have experience in  working also with Soviet debts. Specifically, the bank conducts  active operations with the European bonds of Vneshekonombank.  Secondly, in the opinion of the Chemical Bank, domestic currency  loan bonds are very important from the standpoint of evolution  of the Russian securities market. A significant volume of  emissions, a broad investment base and diversification of  repayment terms makes these securities one of the basic  financial instruments in Russia.    As our KOMMERSANT correspondent was told at Chemical Bank,  today on the world market there is a small but stable demand for  Russian Minfin currency bonds. Specialists at the American bank  believe that the market in these securities is in the stage of  formulation and a serious quantitative leap may occur only after  certain steps have been taken in the development of its  commercial and accounting infrastructure. Nevertheless, the  Chemical Bank hopes that already in the near future transactions  on currency bonds may be conducted through the international  clearing systems Euroclear/CEDEL. In response to our KOMMERSANT  correspondent's question about what presently hinders the  performance of bilateral fixed quotation of these bonds (for now  the bank buys them from its clients, setting the price in the  process of negotiations), the bank representatives gave the  reason as being the insufficient liquidity of the market. They  defined the criterion of liquidity as follows: "When at least  three large financial institutions begin to announce bilateral  quotations of bonds for purchase and sale, and also are ready at  any moment to buy or sell the bonds for a sum of no less than $2  million, then we too will join in this game."  <H6>  Commentary </H6>   KOMMERSANT experts believe that the initiative in the  organization of a secondary market in currency bonds will  nevertheless come from the Russian banks. Judging by the  available information, at the beginning of the second quarter  the largest banks will be able to assure the bond market that  level of liquidity which experienced Western financial  institutions such as Chemical Bank demand. Moreover, the rapid  rates of development of the commercial networks of the MFD  [Interbank Financial House] and the Cash Union will already by  summer make it possible for the banks to conduct trade through  professionally organized dealing systems.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / High Court calls eating-up time RESTAURANTS ARE entitled to give customers 'eating-up time' in the same way that public houses can give drinking-up time, the High Court ruled yesterday. Southampton magistrates found Mr Anwar Amin guilty of contravening a condition of his restaurant licence which prevented him from 'keeping open' between 3am and 5am. Mr Amin admitted that some customers were still eating at 3.45am when police officers visited the restaurant. But no customers were admitted after 3am, and diners were finishing their meals, he argued. Allowing an appeal, Mr Justice Rougier, sitting with Lord Justice Watkins, said customers in the restaurant at 3am were entitled to finish their meals.</p>

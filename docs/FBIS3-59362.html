			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liu Wenbin (0491 2429 1755): "A Crucial Step in </F> the Perfection of China's Income Tax System"]    [Text] On 31 October 1993, the Fourth Session of the Eighth  NPC Standing Committee approved the "Resolution on Amending the  PRC Personal Income Tax Law," which amended personal income tax  law will go into effect on 1 January 1994. The new personal  income tax law will be very important in intensifying tax  reform, streamlining our tax system, and making tax burdens  fairer.    The amended personal income tax law preserves the continuity  of the original policy, while making further additions and  improvements aimed at changed circumstances, with the following  distinct features:    It has a clear guiding ideology. The general  guiding ideology of this amended personal income tax law is: To  adapt to the needs of a socialist market economy by streamlining  our tax system, making tax burdens fairer, strengthening the  organization of revenues and the proper regulation of personal  income, preserving national rights and interests, and enhancing  public tax payment awareness to improve the personal income tax  collection system. Based on this guiding ideology, the  particular amendment principle, premised on preserving policy  continuity, is to make appropriate adjustments: It retains as  much as possible certain effective existing provisions that have  been accepted by all, essentially maintaining the current tax  policy, while suitably adjusting tax burdens and collection and  exemption items; it adjusts high incomes to ease the conflict of  the personal income gap by placing the taxation priority on  those with high incomes, to reflect the policy of taxation based  on income and fair tax burdens; it proceeds from China's  realities while drawing on valuable overseas methods, being more  suited in tax model and collection method to the tax payment  awareness of Chinese citizens and the tax collection and  management status quo, and operable in line with our realities,  by making it easier for taxpayers to pay taxes according to the  law, while contributing to the tax management of tax collection  organs.    It streamlines our personal income tax laws. The  amended personal income tax law is "a merger of three taxes."  Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, the state had successively promulgated three personal  income tax laws and regulations; that is, the "PRC Personal  Income Tax Law" passed by the NPC in 1980, and the "PRC Interim  Regulations on Urban and Rural Individual Industrial and  Commercial Household Operation Income Taxes" and the "PRC  Interim Regulations on Individual Income Adjustment Taxes"  promulgated by the State Council in 1986. While the application  of these three laws played a positive role in areas, such as  increasing revenues, serving reform and opening, attracting  overseas talent, easing social-distribution unfairness, and  promoting public stability and unity, the intensification of  reform and opening has gradually shown up conflicts unsuited to  changing circumstances in these laws and regulations that were  put into effect under particular historical conditions. Taking  our personal income-tax law and the interim provisions on  individual-income adjustment taxes for instance, the former law  is applied to foreigners, while the latter regulations are in  force for Chinese, which state of affairs is hard to interpret  in both legislation and enforcement, as well as being out of  line with normal international practice. Then as to our  individual industrial and commercial household operations, their  income is also essentially in the category of personal income,  with many countries throughout the world now also including  income from individual industrial and commercial household  operations in personal income taxation. So the current  amendment of these provisions is in line with international  practice.    It stabilizes tax burdens, while giving consideration  to state revenue. The amended personal income-tax law makes  taxable income of monthly wage and salary income over 800 yuan  or minus surcharges. This provision, in comparison to the  current regulations, raises the tax collection starting point  for domestic wage and salary income, which adjustment was made  mainly in consideration of the increases in recent years in both  the price and employee cost-of-living indexes that have raised  cost-of-living expenditures. As this raises the tax base, it  may correspondingly reduce tax revenues, but as collection and  management work intensifies and employee income increases, more  people will become taxpayers, so that revenues will increase  somewhat instead. As to taxpayers who have no residence in China  but earn wage or salary income in China, and those who live in  China but earn wage or salary income outside of China, the  exchange-rate adjustments of recent years mean that continuing  to maintain the original deductions would obviously be unsuited  to the changed circumstances. The amended items are more  feasible, contributing to our opening up to the outside world,  as well as to the introduction of talent from abroad. As to tax  burdens, while they generally are essentially fair as before,  the burden on high-income taxpayers is increased slightly, which  is also in line with the principle of taxation based on income.    This personal income-tax law passed by the NPC Standing  Committee, in comparison to the one promulgated in 1980, makes  certain amendments in areas such as tax objects and limits, tax  reductions and exemptions, payment terms, and collection  management, mainly in the following points:    --It sharply adjusts the tax rate for individual industrial  and commercial household operations. The "Interim Regulations on  Urban and Rural Individual Industrial and Commercial Household  Operation Income Taxes" issued by the State Council in January  1986 provided that income taxes on individual industrial and  commercial household operations would be collected according to  a 10-grade progressive tax rate for excess income, with the  lowest grade being annual income of 1,000-2,000 yuan with a tax  rate of 7 percent, and the highest grade being annual income of  over 30,000 yuan with a tax rate of 60 percent. They also  provided that when annual taxable income exceeded 50,000 yuan,  an additional 10-40 percent income-tax markup would be collected  on the excess taxable income. But this amended personal  income-tax law provides for a five-grade progressive tax rate on  excess income for individual industrial and commercial  household-operation production and business income, with the  lowest grade being annual taxable income up to 5,000 yuan with a  tax rate of 5 percent, and the highest grade being annual income  over 50,000 yuan with a tax rate of 35 percent, as well as  abolishing the markup taxation method. The amended terms show  clearly that the tax burden on individual industrial and  commercial household operations is sharply lower than before.  This provision is a tangible expression of the state's policy of  support for individual industrial and commercial household  operations, in order to spur individual industrial and  commercial household operations to sounder market economy growth.    -- It provides tax reductions on income from payments for  articles or books written. In the personal income tax law  promulgated in 1980, income from payments for articles or books  written is included in remuneration for labor, with each earning  of less than 4,000 yuan being provided an expense reduction of  800 yuan, each one over 4,000 yuan granted one of 20 percent,  and the balance being taxable. But this amended personal income  tax law excludes income from payments for articles or books  written from remuneration for labor, listing it as an  independent tax item. While all matters, such as tax collection  criteria, expense-reduction amount, and tax rates remain  unchanged, a provision is added on a 30-percent reduction of  taxable income.    -- It adds income from property transfers and chance to  taxable items. As China's economic reform intensifies, with  stock and real estate markets growing very rapidly, and  transactions of all types of movable and real property, mainly  stocks, bonds, and real estate, becoming increasingly brisk,  some are earning increasing amounts of appreciation income.  Meanwhile, all sorts of lottery-attached activities such as  fundraising, savings, sales, and contests are increasing daily,  with the chance income of lottery winners also growing steadily.  In light of this, as the state should regulate through taxation  this appreciation and chance income, the amended personal-income  tax law lists these two incomes as taxable items.    -- It practices markup taxation on income from remuneration  for labor where one-time earnings are abnormally high. In our  current income from remuneration for labor, the income gap is  very high. Similarly in labor remuneration, some have very high  one-time earnings, as high as tens of thousands of yuan, which  easily sharpens the conflict of distribution injustice. As  taxation is a macroeconomic regulation and control tool that  should play a proper role in this area, the amended personal  income tax law clearly provides that "for income from labor  remuneration where one time earnings are abnormally high, markup  taxation can be applied." This undoubtedly is particularly  correct as to implementing the principle of distribution  according to work and alleviating social distribution injustice.    -- It clarifies the distinction between residents and  nonresidents. According to international practice, taxpayers are  distinguished as residents or nonresidents. Residents are liable  for an unlimited tax payment committment. In other words,  whether the income source is domestic or overseas, it is subject  to tax payment in China. But nonresidents are liable for only a  limited tax payment committment, or for paying taxes only on  income earned in China. This amended personal income tax law  uses the two criteria of whether or not there is a residence and  length of residence to set the limits between residents and  nonresidents, while the one promulgated in 1980 set only the one  condition of whether or not there was a residence. According to  the principles provided in general civil law rules, residents  are Chinese citizens who live in China and have Chinese  nationality or registered permanent residence, as well as  foreigners who have lived a whole 365-day year in China and  Chinese citizens without registered permanent residence. All who  do not conform to these terms are nonresidents. According to the  principle that residents are liable for an unlimited tax payment  committment, residents should pay personal income taxes on all  income earned both in or outside of China. This additional  "residence" condition includes personnel who go abroad to work  for public or other reasons as taxpayers, stopping up tax  loopholes, as well as conforming to international practice.    As the amended personal income tax law is very broad in  scope, strong in policy, and closely tied to vital public  interests, it needs widespread publicity and education, to raise  taxpayer legal awareness and enhance tax payment  conscientiousness. Every taxpayer should act in line with tax  law provisions, by strictly observing the law, and fulfilling  their tax payment committment to the country with their own real  actions. Tax departments must also intensify their enforcement  oversight and inspection by acting in accordance with the law,  and when discovering tax evasion or avoidance, dealing with it  strictly according to tax law provisions, and investigating and  affixing legal liability for serious cases. The implementation  of the amended personal income tax law will also require the  support and coordination of concerned departments, with close  and strong cooperation. Units responsible for withholding  particularly need to perform their tax withholding functions  strictly according to the provisions of the tax law. Moreover,  certain measures interrelated with the personal income tax law  also need to be correspondingly drawn up, for a complete  application.</p>

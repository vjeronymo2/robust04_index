			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo trembles The UK stock market shuddered and dealers marked down Glaxo shares after an article in the weekend press highlighted alleged violations of US drug laws by the UK company regarding Zantac, its anti-ulcer drug. In spite of claims by Glaxo that the allegations 'have been a matter of public record since they appeared in the US and UK pharmaceutical trade press last month', the shares were marked down to 631p by worried marketmakers. The move was largely successful and only the most bearish insti-tutions unloaded stock into what was clearly an unwilling market. After the early setback, the share price marked time until the US market opened. A flurry of American buying then lifted the stock to a London closing level of 652p, a net decline of 8. Turnover of 11m was well above usual. UK drug industry specialists were surprised at the impact of the story. 'It has been common knowledge that the US authorities have queried some claims, but the market had largely discounted these worries,' said one analyst. In another move, Glaxo said it had received approval from the Medicines Control Agency in the UK to market its new inhaled steroid treatment for asthma, called Flixotide.</p>

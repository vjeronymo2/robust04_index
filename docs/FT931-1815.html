			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / People: Non-executive directors J Rothschild Assurance, Sir Mark Weinberg's latest life insurance venture, has recruited another establishment figure to its board. Anthony Loehnis, 57, a former overseas director of the Bank of England, has become a non-executive director. Loehnis, who resigned as a vice chairman of SG Warburg at the end of last year, is already on the board of J Rothschild International Assurance. His decision to increase his involvement adds to the credibility of a new financial services venture which is already starting to make a mark in the fiercely competitive life insurance business. Dennis Stevenson, 47, chairman of SRU Group and the trustees of the Tate Gallery, as well as being a member of the City Panel on Takeovers and Mergers and a non-exec-utive director of Pearson, is also an outside director. In its first year of operation J Rothschild Assurance put on over Pounds 100m of new life insurance business. Set up by Lord Rothschild's St James Place Capital and Scottish Amicable, it has opened 14 offices and has a national salesforce of over 400. Chief executive Mike Wilson, 50, who has worked with Sir Mark Weinberg in his previous ventures, such as Abbey Life and Allied Dunbar, says that the intention is to float the company on the stock market by 1997.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: CIBC hit by CDollars 860m exposure CANADIAN Imperial Bank of Commerce, the biggest lender to Olympia &amp; York, has written off most of its CDollars 860m (USDollars 723m) exposure to the ailing property developer. CIBC, which has taken a hard line in debt-restructuring negotiations with O&amp;Y, is understood to be among the banks which refused to meet the company's request for a large new infusion of funds for Canary Wharf, the east London property development which went into administration yesterday. As a result of the provision, the bank suffered a loss of CDollars 440m, or CDollars 2.55 a share, in the three months to April 30, compared with earnings of CDollars 186m, or 90 cents a share, a year earlier. CIBC said that despite the big second-quarter loss, it was confident it would be in the black for fiscal 1992 as a whole. It has no plans to cut its dividend. The bank earned a record CDollars 811m in the year to October 31, 1991. About half the CDollars 860m O&amp;Y portfolio was advanced for Canary Wharf, with the rest split between properties in the US and Canada. The bank said virtually its entire portfolio of O&amp;Y loans was secured 'in form or another'. The decisive write-down is expected to reinforce the bank's determination to move quickly away from the O&amp;Y issue. Mr Paul Reichmann, O&amp;Y's co-owner and master strategist, was, until two months ago, a CIBC director. Mr Donald Fullerton, who retires as CIBC's chairman next week, said the bank considered the provision sufficient to 'cover a wide range of developments' and 'to put the O&amp;Y problem behind us'. The O&amp;Y provision makes up the bulk of a special CDollars 1bn charge against CIBC's second-quarter earnings. It also includes sour loans to the Goldberg group in Australia and provision for further losses due to weak business conditions in North America.</p>

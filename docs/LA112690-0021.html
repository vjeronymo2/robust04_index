			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPPORT FOR 'AFRICA NOW'  </P> <P> David Horowitz's Counterpunch article "The Left Is Crying Wolf Over 'South  Africa Now' (Nov. 19) was a tiresome string of '50s McCarthyite and '80s  right-wing think-tank cliches directed against the PBS series, its producers  and those who urge KCET to continue broadcasting it.  </P> <P> There are two major works that have put the myth of liberal domination in U.S.  media to rest: Mark Haagstad's highly acclaimed book "On Bended Knee: The Media  During the Reagan Years" and the in-depth study "Fairness and Accuracy in  Reporting on 'MacNeil/Lehrer' and 'Nightline.' "  </P> <P> Horowitz's Committee on Media Integrity accuses PBS of creeping leftist  domination, but it is soundly contradicted by facts: The "alternative" U.S.  guests on "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" were more than 90% white males and most  of them were right-wing or conservative.  </P> <P> The great majority of talk shows such as "Firing Line," "The Capitol Gang" and  "The McLaughlin Group" have made a practice of having center liberals  exclusively representing the left, usually in a setting controlled by  right-wing spokesmen.  </P> <P> Significantly, corporate sponsorship has been the cornerstone of these shows  and of the proliferation on PBS of business news programs (not of a leftist  perspective).  </P> <P> By comparison, television's "The Kwinty Report," hosted by Jonathan Kwinty,  author and former Wall Street Journal reporter -- which provided a more diverse  list of guests and more substantive and wide-ranging discussion -- was taken  off the air due to lack of renewed corporate and foundation support.  </P> <P> I'm still trying to figure out Horowitz's warped logic of calling those that  support the airing of "South Africa Now" "vigilantes" and those (such as the  Horowitz group) who ask for its cancellation proponents of "balance in public  television."  </P> <P> Horowitz tells us that the opponents of the series were "civilized" in making  their cancellation request and didn't even use a letter-writing campaign to  achieve their end. That's very kind of his organization -- in that the '80s,  like the McCarthyite '50s, was a period of well-financed right-wing  organizations that worked as media hit squads, with chilling effects on freedom  of speech.  </P> <P> Horowitz tries to accuse the left of the practices that the right wing has  perfected in its attacks against media. It's like accusing the victim of the  crime -- or Hitler burning the Reichstag to blame it on the communists.  </P> <P> ISAAC ARTENSTEIN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

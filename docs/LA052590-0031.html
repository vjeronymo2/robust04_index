			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SCHOOL BOARD REJECTS STIFFER PENALTY ON WEAPONS  </P> <P> Whatever happened to common sense, responsibility and accountability in our  public schools? The board's decision not to expel students bringing weapons to  school sets a poor example and shows a callous lack of concern for students and  teachers throughout the system.  </P> <P> Like a disaster waiting to happen, the increase in campus incidents clearly  indicates that guilty students as well as their parents should be made  accountable, severely and decisively. There should be a definite plan of action  in place now. Do Medflies have a higher priority than our students?  </P> <P> GARY TRAXLER  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

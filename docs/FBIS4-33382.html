			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 3 Jun (EFE) -- The fact that the 124 people  who have entered the Belgian ambassador's residence in Havana  apparently refuse to leave has led to a deadlock in the  conflict. In addition, two or three other persons entered the  residence today, diplomatic sources told EFE.    One of the Belgian officials told foreign journalists that  he  could "neither confirm nor deny" the report on the persons'  entry. Several witnesses, however, said the people slipped into  the building from neighboring houses' yards despite the presence  of dozens of Cuban plainclothes and uniformed police. Three  people left the house on Thursday. According to a report that  the other would-be refugees filtered to the press, these people  could be state security agents.    Serafin Rodriguez, director of the Cuban Foreign Ministry's  Europe Department, told EFE that the local authorities still do  not have a list of the refugees, "which could be useful for many  things, even to alert the ambassador, if necessary, about some  of the people inside the building."    Rodriguez said that a few days ago, the Belgian Government  mentioned to the Cuban Government the possibility of sending in  reinforcements to its four-person delegation in Havana. These  reinforcements would include diplomats and technicians. "We  accepted," Rodriguez said.    On Thursday in Brussels, a spokesman reported that the  authorities consider sending a small contingent of police -- not  more than five -- to keep order in the interior of the  ambassador's residence.    Rodriguez said Cuban Foreign Ministry officials, Belgian  Ambassador Paul Vermeirsch, and special envoy Willy Verriest  have continued to talk and that the two sides agree that the  occupants must leave. "The problem lies in getting them out," he  said.    Rodriguez said Cuba has "guaranteed in writing" that these  people will not be tried for the occupation of the embassy  building and that the offense "will not constitute aggravating  circumstances in eventual trials."    The fact that they created, inside the occupied residence,  an  organization, the Union of Cubans for Freedom, does not help,  Rodriguez said, but he added that this is something that  requires further study. Diplomatic sources commented that the  Belgians perhaps should "apply some more heat and pressure" on  the refugees to persuade them to leave the embassy.</p>

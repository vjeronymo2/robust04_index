			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Tonight's airing by ABC of a truncated version of "The Day After" is spurring  the Directors Guild of America to continue to pursue legislation on Capitol  Hill that would "protect the reputation of the artist from any mutilation of  his work," says a DGA spokesman. About 23 1/2 minutes have been cut from the  1983 landmark TV film that graphically dramatizes the aftermath of nuclear war.  In a letter to ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard, DGA executive  director Glenn J. Gumpel said airing the cut and compressed film "is  potentially damaging" to the reputation of its director, Nicholas Meyer. Meyer  has vigorously protested the trimming, calling it "censorship" and wanting his  name removed from the credits. ALEENE MacMINN and VICTOR VALLE  </P></p>

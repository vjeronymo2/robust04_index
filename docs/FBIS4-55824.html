			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vlado Trisic from Mt. Majevica front] </F>   [Text] Muslim forces, supported by the international  forces, are today again attacking Serbian positions on Mt.  Majevica with increasing intensity. On two occasions, at 0500  and 0800, NATO planes made a low altitude flyover, a mere 100  meters above the woods, and provoked Serbian defense forces,  which did not respond to the provocations. This seems to have  been an introduction to yet another attack of the Muslim forces,  who, from strongholds in Donje Hrasno, the region of the Stolice  transmitter, and Banj Brdo, showered the area with shells of  various caliber, at the same time regrouping for infantry  assaults.    The information service of the republic of Srpska army east  Bosnian corps this afternoon announced that the Muslim forces  were carrying out an artillery and infantry attack in the area  of Jablanica and Piper, north of Lopari. The Muslims from  Horozovina -- southeast of Tuzla -- are targeting ambulances and  Serbian positions in Banj Brdo with a Broving gun. As we report  this, and it is now just after 1400, NATO planes have again  begun carrying out provocations on Mt. Majevica [words  indistinct] did not cause the Serbian troops to waver in their  goal to defend their territory from the latest Muslim aggression.</p>

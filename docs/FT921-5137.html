			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / An inspector should call a lot more often NEXT WEEK will be one of the toughest in the short life of Imro. The parliamentary committee investigating pension reform is expected to target Imro and the City system of self-regulation for their failure to prevent the pillage of the Maxwell pension funds. Imro's job is to protect people whose money is being managed by professional advisers. Yet last year Mr Robert Maxwell siphoned away more than Pounds 400m from his companies' pension funds while they were managed by Imro members. More than 30,000 employees and pensioners now face uncertainty and perhaps poverty. In a hard-hitting report, due to be published on Monday, the social security select committee is expected to criticise Imro fiercely both for the standards of its initial vetting of members and for its subsequent supervision. Imro is one of several self-regulatory organisations created by the Financial Services Act 1986 (FSA). It was authorised to start operating in April 1988 by the Securities and Investment Board and most of its present 1,250 members were admitted in the first wave of applications. In Imro's own view its vetting of members is rigorous. It scans the applicant's 'business record and reputation', the 'honesty and integrity of its directors' and its financial resources. Imro's statement to the select committee calls the application a 'substantial hurdle' for prospective investment managers. It is a hurdle few have failed to leap, however. Imro has refused membership to fewer than a dozen applicants. Among those it authorised in 1988 were two companies controlled by Mr Robert Maxwell, Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM) and London &amp; Bishopsgate International Investment Management (LBI). BIM, which was wound up in the High Court yesterday, was the route through which much of the pension money vanished. Other public company assets were diverted through LBI on their way to private Maxwell companies. In the view of some MPs on the committee there were two reasons why Imro should have exercised particular care: Mr Maxwell's business reputation, and his intention that BIM and LBI would manage the pension money for companies also controlled by Mr Maxwell. By 1990 BIM ran 80 per cent of the Pounds 700m central pool of pension money for most of the UK-based Maxwell companies and LBI was one of the managers for the balance. Imro told the committee that 'a feeling of unease' does not justify it in refusing membership. 'The law is concerned to ensure that entrance into the market . . . cannot be stifled by dislike.' It said that in the Maxwell case it had concluded that 'neither (Mr Robert Maxwell's) business reputation nor the 1971 Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' report (which judged Mr Maxwell unfit to run a public company) represented sustainable grounds for refusal.' Although that is scrupulously impartial, if Imro is to let in members about whom it feels uneasy then its subsequent supervision needs to be vigilant. Yet in Imro's own words, once an applicant is deemed to be 'fit and proper', Imro's supervisory system 'has to necessarily assume that . . . by and large . . . the relevant law will be respected.' Imro's statement to the select committee says that it applied its normal supervision to the Maxwell fund managers - but that no system is proof against fraud. Its visits to LBI and BIM and the regular returns which they submitted threw up a series of administrative irregularities, but none that caused Imro 'great concern' and it received rapid written assurance that they had been corrected. Looking at Imro's account, there are several areas of weakness, however. The first is the infrequency of its visits. Imro made one formal assessment of each Maxwell fund manager, LBI in February 1989 and BIM in November 1990. If it had repeated the visits at any point last year it might have detected the abuse. It now appears that Mr Maxwell stripped pension funds of their money in just 10 months between February last year and his death. Imro says that it has tried to visit members every two years and that it has seen each member at least once in its four year life. Mr John Morgan, Imro's chief executive, accepts that Imro has had a 'protracted development phase', taking longer to set up its administration than it expected. In defending its slow start, Imro points out that it was the only SRO not to be based on a previously existing body, and had no experience of the investment houses for which it suddenly became responsible. A second question is whether the meetings between Imro and LBI directors last year on the subject of stocklending should have caused Imro more disquiet. LBI was the manager of First Tokyo Investment Trust, a trust tracking the Japanese stock market. LBI regularly lent out the trust's investments to LBI's parent London &amp; Bishopsgate Holdings, and Robert Maxwell Group, Mr Maxwell's main private holding company. Stocklending is a legal and common practice to increase a fund's income. However, it is normally carried out through specialised brokers with outside investment houses and traders. Stocklending proved to be the most important mechanism by which Mr Maxwell was able to transfer pension-fund investments out of the care of investment managers and into his private companies. Imro reports that during March and April last year LBI's compliance officer inquired about Imro's rules on stocklending and met with Imro staff, who discerned no problems. In May last year LBI took over First Tokyo and the offer document said that the stocklending might have jeopardised First Tokyo's status as an investment trust. This led Imro to investigate in July and August whether First Tokyo shareholders had been damaged by the stocklending - an inquiry which was out of its normal routine of supervision. It again found its inquiries satisfied. The First Tokyo case is crucial partly because of the timing - Mr Maxwell's theft of funds was well under way by the middle of last year. But it also gave Imro a reason to look closely at a member whose chairman had a troublesome reputation and wide-ranging power. The case points to a wider issue: Imro's reluctance to do more than make 'running repairs'. If Imro had added the Maxwell fund managers' record of small irregularities to its initial grounds for uneasiness about their chairman, First Tokyo might then have prompted it to probe more deeply. To help prevent future Maxwells, Imro will have to be prepared to be more intrusive in its inquiries - and to probe some members more deeply than others, because it has more cause to be uneasy. In Imro's view it has become more vigorous in the past year. It fined six members for administrative irregularities last year, and following a change in its rules in November began to publish their names. The most recent fines  -between Pounds 75,000 and Pounds 100,000 - have been heavier than in the past. According to Mr Morgan visits may now become more frequent. But it will need to persuade its members that it is not simply trying to cover embarrassment over Maxwell with a flurry of activity. If it successfully makes the necessary transformation it will need to accumulate a long record of success to compensate for its failure to spot the theft of pension funds in one of the biggest business frauds of this century. 'Imro will take steps to strengthen its supervision' 'What went wrong was the confusion - the imposition of very heavy duties on trustees of pension schemes by the Financial Services Act' 'It seems to me that (a pensions act) is inescapable. It's a bit simple-minded to argue that a few good ideas will solve anything.' 'The trustees (of the Maxwell company schemes) either persuaded themselves or were persuaded that they had no obligation to oversee the investment activities' 'The future role of Imro in any new scheme is to continue to govern the investment management of portfolios' John Morgan Imro chief executive</p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAFFIC CAMERA  </P> <P> The automatic camera being tested by the city of Pasadena, as well as its photo  radar, would be considerably less useful if traffic lights were properly  synchronized. I believe that the principal attraction of these devices is their  revenue-generating potential. The problem for us drivers is that the city gets  more return on its "investment" by not synchronizing the lights.  </P> <P> R.L. MITCHELL  </P> <P> Rolling Hills Estates  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Japan's farm minister denied  a news report Tuesday that the government has reached secret  bilateral accords with Australia and the United States to import  certain amounts of milk products.    The report, published in the Japanese daily ASAHI SHIMBUN,  said the accords were reached in the face of import  liberalization for the products next year.    Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Mutsuki Kato  told reporters that Japan is holding negotiations with the U.S.  and Australia to guarantee the 1986-1988 level of butter, skim  milk and other milk product imports.    The talks under way do not concern country-by-country  accords, which are prohibited by the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Kato said.    He added that Japan, which is holding the negotiations under  GATT rules, has no secret deals and has offered no guarantees on  milk product imports.    Kato said that Japan will inform GATT of the results of the  negotiations when they are completed.</p>

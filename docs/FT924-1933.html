			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: ANZ unit extends Islamic role ANZ Grindlays Bank is broadening its involvement in Islamic financing techniques by arranging what it says is the first Istisna project financing facility in Pakistan. The Dollars 92m six-month facility was provided to Hub Power Company, a private sector joint venture company building an oil-fired power station at the mouth of the Hub river. It was structured and funded by Al Rajhi Banking and Investment Corporation of Saudi Arabia. The term Istisna relates to the purchase of a specific piece of equipment made to order. The investor buys the equipment then sells it to the project, which pays for it six months later. The difference between the purchase and payment prices represents the profit element for the investor, rather than interest. Disbursement of the funds under the facility will allow work to start on the Dollars 1.8bn project, which is Pakistan's first private sector power scheme. ANZ has become something of a specialist in Islamic financings through its work in arranging a series of Morabaha short-term commodity transactions.</p>

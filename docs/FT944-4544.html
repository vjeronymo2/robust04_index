			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Orange County counts the cost: Taxpayers will be angry - at the officials who led it to bankruptcy and at the Wall Street firms which profited The bankruptcy of California's Orange County, announced on Tuesday evening, is without parallel in the history of American local government. One of the wealthiest counties in the US, with a population of 2.6m and an annual budget of Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 915m), has been forced into default in a game of double or quits in the financial markets. In time, the outraged taxpayers of Orange County will want their revenge. It may extend not merely to the officials who lost Dollars 1.5bn of their money, but to the Wall Street firms which profited by helping them. The immediate effects on life in Orange County may be minor. Under the provisions of Chapter 9 - the type of bankruptcy applying to municipalities  -the county cannot pay outstanding bills to suppliers or back wages to its employees, at least until a reorganisation plan has been worked out over coming months. In the meantime, though, it can pay wages or other bills incurred since the bankruptcy. The longer-term effects are another matter. While in bankruptcy, the county cannot pay income on its bonds. Its credit in the bond markets is thus badly damaged. Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, said yesterday it was downgrading Orange County bonds to speculative status. Even when it can re-enter the markets, the county will have to pay more for its money. A hint of what this might mean came yesterday from the county's transportation authority, which has Dollars 1.1bn invested in the loss-making central fund. It has assembled a team of bankers and lawyers and accountants 'to address debt service, payroll and other obligations'. Its planned mass transit programme, the authority said, should still be able to go ahead: 'However, it may not be on the same timetable.' Meanwhile, the financial markets are trying to come to grips with not just the scale of the event, but its complexities. One central point is unclear: whether the banks which hold securities against the county's debts are constrained by its bankruptcy from selling them. To finance its speculations, the county took on a rumoured Dollars 12bn in so-called reverse repurchase agreements. These were used to buy securities which the banks then held as collateral. On Tuesday several Wall Street houses, led by CS First Boston, cancelled over Dollars 1bn worth of those agreements and sold the securities. Orange County was obliged to file for Chapter 9 in an attempt to stop others doing the same. Whether this will work is uncertain. The county said yesterday it believed all creditors were 'stayed and enjoined from. . . liquidating the securities that are the subject of. . . repurchase, reverse repurchase or similar transactions'. Wall Street firms seemed less sure. Yesterday, they were reported to be sending their lawyers scurrying through the fine print of their agreements. Merrill Lynch, which holds Dollars 2bn of the reverse repos, said tersely that the bankruptcy did not affect the integrity of its collateral. If Orange County is right, the Dollars 1.5bn loss so far reported on its Dollars 7.5bn fund may remain largely on paper. If the banks are right, at least that amount of loss will be crystallised, and perhaps more besides. Either way, Wall Street will not look too good in the public's estimation. It is already being pointed out that the broker Merrill Lynch, in particular, was instrumental in helping the county treasurer, Mr Robert Citron, in playing the markets. The company is not commenting at present, but could doubtless argue that it is not its job to warn a client, merely to transact on his behalf.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 2 -- "Voucher privatisation has failed  not only in Moscow, but in all the Russian regions. It has not  been successful because the authors of the programme were  pursuing political, not economic goals," declared Moscow Mayor  Yuriy Luzhkov at a press-conference in the Moscow government  building on Thursday. According to the mayor, the founding of  voucher privatisation on the "dictates of the Federal State  Property Managing Committee" was not fair to the regions of the  Russian Federation.    Luzhkov noted that the government never received the  expected  inflow of funds from the privatisation programme. Over the last  two and a half years, according to Luzhkov, the capital's budget  gained only a "ridiculously small sum" from privatisation, 52  billion roubles. The most convincing evidence that the  privatisation programme is a failure is that even today there is  no class of property-owners in the country as a whole and in  Moscow in particular.    The capital's mayor said that the current market value of  one  voucher, 30 thousand roubles, is way under the minimum value of  half a million roubles a voucher should have if inflation is  taken into account. He called that proof of the public's  mistrust of the privatisation programme. Five hundred thousand  roubles is the real value of one one-hundred-and-sixty-millionth  part of the country's wealth, said Luzhkov.    "I will be happy to go to the procurator," the mayor said in  comment on Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's letter of May 26  which demanded that Luzhkov cancel within three days his ban on  the registration of joint stock societies in Moscow.    According to Luzhkov, the complaints which State Property  Committee Chairman Anatoliy Chubays has lodged against the  Moscow government in connection with the failure of  privatisation in the capital are based on the desire "to avoid  responsibility for privatisation's catastrophic results for the  Russian economy and to find a scapegoat."</p>

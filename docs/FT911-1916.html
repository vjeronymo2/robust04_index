			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Bush backs bank reform THE chances of wide-ranging bank reform in the US improved last night after President George Bush gave his backing to a comprehensive package and Democratic leaders of the House banking committee agreed to allow more time for debate on such proposals, Peter Riddell writes. It is still unlikely that all of the US Treasury's far-reaching proposals will be approved in view of widespread congressional caution. Last night's move gives a chance for Mr Nicholas Brady, the treasury secretary, to press his case, backed by the key banking regulators, for comprehensive action now to permit banks to open nationwide branch networks and to engage in financial service activities. In his first comments on the issue for several weeks, Mr Bush said the US should bring its banking system into the 21st century 'so that our banks can fuel economic growth. But in order to do that, we need comprehensive reform, not just a quick and narrow fix'. Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European Commission, last night wrote to Mr Brady and to key committee chairmen expressing his strong support for the liberalising thrust of the Treasury's plan. However, he warned that the ability of EC banks to compete in the US market would be severely limited by the requirement that foreign banks must operate through a subsidiary to engage also in securities and insurance activities.</p>

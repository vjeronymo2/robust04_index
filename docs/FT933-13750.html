			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Banks warned on account charges NEARLY 40 per cent of bank and building society customers would close their accounts if such organisations introduced charges on current accounts with low balances, says a survey published yesterday. The survey found strongest opposition to charges from young customers, and those living in southern England. Although only one retail bank, Abbey National, has indicated that it is considering imposing charges on current accounts, hints that clearing banks might follow suit have provoked protests from consumer groups. The survey, by the NOP Corporate and Financial research group, questioned 1,066 people, of whom 39 per cent said they would close accounts if banks imposed a Pounds 5 fee on accounts whose balance fell below Pounds 50. Another 48 per cent said they would ensure that their account did not fall below this level. Only 9 per cent indicated willingness to pay a charge - primarily because of the effort involved in changing accounts. Although 55 per cent of customers aged between 15 and 24 said they would close their account if charges were imposed, only 23 per cent of customers over 65 indicated that they would do the same. Forty four per cent of customers in the south said they would close their account, but only 27 per cent in northern England and Scotland. NOP said the findings should serve as a clear warning of the backlash that financial institutions would face if they sought to impose charges. Abbey National said: 'Everyone is aware of the risk that if you do impose charges you may alienate some of your customers. That is a business decision we have to make.'</p>

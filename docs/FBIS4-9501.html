			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with ex-King Mihai I by Liviu Valenas in Versoix, </F> Switzerland; date not given: "I Hope People Will Not Lose Their  Courage"; broadcast on Deutsche Welle on 6 April]    [Excerpts] [Valenas] Sire, three years ago you granted an  interview to our radio station, Deutsche Welle, and here we are  again after three years, resuming the discussion that we  interrupted then in Paris. Now we are in Versoix, Switzerland,  the place of your residence in exile, if I may say so. I would  first like you to talk about the award granted last year by the  Yad Vashem organization to your mother, Queen Mother Elena.    [Mihai I] It was a great pleasure for me that they did that,  and I interpreted this move as a reparation of a big injustice;  namely that not one single word was said about the Jewish people  in Romania and those deported in Dniester, and now, luckily, in  the past three years, all kinds of research has been done and  memoirs and documents have been consulted to reestablish the  truth. Finally, this year, this organization accepted the fact  that my mother's righteousness should be recognized. On her  behalf, I received a medal and a document, in which everything  she did for the Jews in Romania was recognized. [passage omitted]    [Valenas] Sire, how would you characterize the current  Romanian Army?    [Mihai I] In the past three years, I have realized that the  Army has regained its so-called independence from the political  vicissitude of the past years. The army is at the disposal of  the country and is ready to commit itself for the security of  the country. All attempts to take away its fundamental role  could only provoke a crisis within the army. The Army is there  to serve the Romanian people and our homeland, not the policies  of others. All officers and soldiers know what the Army means  and what our traditions are. However, just like other armies  throughout the world, attempts are made to politicize an army,  remove it from its own duty toward the country, and provoke  qualms.    [Valenas] How do you explain that there are still  sympathetic  feelings toward you among the Romanian officers?    [Mihai I] Whether I completed my military training in  Romania or whether I was an officer in the Romanian Army still  plays a role in this respect, and I do not know why because so  many years have elapsed. I have often said there is a soft spot  in my heart for the Romanian Army. Considering that I went went  through military training in our country, I feel very close to  our Army and, as a matter of fact, I believe the Army should  return to its old traditions.    [Valenas] Do you believe it is appropriate that at the helm  of our Army there should be a civilian who used to work at the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, about whom, as a matter of fact,  the Romanian press published conclusive data that he used to be  an employee with the rank of colonel in the former Foreign  Information Directorate of the Securitate?    [Mihai I] Again, here is a case in which all kind of things  are said, but in our country the minister of war [as published]  has always been a military person. To what extent his name is  appreciated in Europe or in the West, or whether he is a  civilian or an army person, is their business. Our business is  to preserve our tradition as it has always been. I do not think  that such a thing would have been easily accepted in our army.  [passage omitted]    [Valenas] Sire, how would you assess the current situation  in Romania from a social, political, and maybe even moral point  of view?    [Mihai I] As far as I know, there are two moral issues: the  people's morale is very low, as is morality. The finances are  still state-owned, the economy is destroyed, and people do not  have any money. It is a very difficult situation. I cannot  tell you much more than that. I can only say that the situation  is very difficult. [passage omitted]    [Valenas] Sire, at the end of our interview, what would you  recommend to the Romanian people?    [Mihai I] For the immediate future, I hope the people will  not lose their courage and look a little forward, and not just  to everyday difficulties, which are very big indeed. However,  people should not lose their belief in God and their hope in the  future.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Saudi snub for Hussein King Hussein of Jordan's efforts to mend fences with Saudi Arabia, which still begrudges Amman's pro-Iraqi stance during the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis, were shattered yesterday when he failed to meet King Fahd during a short visit to the Saudi kingdom, James Whittington writes from Amman. Although the trip was presented from the Jordanian side as a minor pilgrimage to perform the Umra at religious sites, officials in Amman had been privately optimistic that a rapprochement between the two monarchs was possible. 'We simply would not have made the trip if we thought King Fahd would not see us,' conceded one senior official. Diplomats described the trip as a 'serious snub' to King Hussein. 'It shows clearly that the Saudis have not forgiven him for what they saw as an act of betrayal during the Gulf war,' one said.</p>

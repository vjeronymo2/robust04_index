			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Improvement in property values seen by Brixton BRIXTON Estate, the seventh largest property company in the UK, produced a 4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds 28.5m for 1992. Its net asset value per share fell by 19 per cent, from 226p to 183p. Mr Harry Axton, the chairman who will retire this summer, was encouraged by the number of inquiries from potential tenants. 'I think that by the end of the year we will start to see an improvement in values,' he said. Value of the portfolio at the year-end dropped from Pounds 724m to Pounds 679m. The portfolio is split between the UK, which accounts for 83 per cent of the total, and Belgium, Germany and Australia, representing the remainder. The UK portfolio, half of which is industrial property, is concentrated on the western half of the home counties and, in London, at Holborn and in the City. Net rental income rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 55.2m (Pounds 50.7m). Interest costs increased to Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 20.8m); another Pounds 11.6m of interest was capitalised. The proportion of empty property in the portfolio increased marginally to 7.5 per cent, reflecting the rising number of UK tenants experiencing financial difficulties. In the year the company leased 486,000 sq ft of space, of which over 200,000 sq ft came from the development programme. A further 140,000 sq ft was under offer. A provision of Pounds 16.5m was made against the value of the development properties this time. The company has sites with planning permission for 600,000 sq ft of space. 'As soon as there is a clear trend in the right direction we shall restart our development programme,' said Mr Axton. Earnings per share increased from 12.64p to 13.86p. A final dividend of 5.35p makes 8.35p for the year (8.1p). COMMENT Brixton Estate is one of few property companies to survive the crash with its reputation intact. Its prudent management and successful development programme has given it a loyal following in the City, which in recent months has placed the shares on a premium to net asset value. But yesterday's results, with their larger-than-expected fall in property values, disappointed investors, and the shares were marked down 8p to 177p. With gearing of 114 per cent the company has little room to exploit opportunities in the market, unless it sells property, raises new money or benefits from a recovery in values. The potential for dividend growth is limited; if capitalised interest is stripped out, the dividend would not currently be covered. Assuming a net asset value of 170p for 1993, the shares are on a narrow discount of 4 per cent. They are probably fully priced until the company gets more fire-power or the recovery in the property market becomes more convincing.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Kravchuk gets more hawkish on N-weapons UKRAINIAN President Leonid Kravchuk said yesterday Ukraine should claim ownership of the nuclear weapons on its territory. The statement suggests that Mr Kravchuk, who in the past has blamed Ukraine's failure to ratify disarmament treaties on a hard-line lobby in parliament, is shifting to a more hawkish stance on the nuclear issue. On Friday parliament declared the 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles stationed on Ukrainian territory to be national property. American officials in Tokyo for the G7 summit yesterday voiced concerns that the legislature's decision was another instance of Ukrainian foot-dragging on disarmament, but they said they were reassured by Mr Kravchuk's continued commitment to ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start 1) and accession to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). However, Mr Kravchuk's comments could begin to erode his carefully constructed image of a dovish leader under siege from a hard-line legislature. While that perception has eased Mr Kravchuk's relations with western leaders, it could be a liability for the president in the national referendum scheduled for September 26. 'My feeling is that it should be set down that Ukraine must be the owner of nuclear weapons on its territory pending their destruction,' he said at a meeting with collective farm chairmen. Ukraine should, however, abide by its pledge to become a non-nuclear state and ratify the Start 1 and NPT treaties, he said.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: US stores operator tumbles to Dollars 22.8m GREAT Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, one of the largest US supermarket operators, saw first-quarter profits tumble. The company, which is 53 per cent-owned by Germany's Tengelmann group, also revealed it was writing off the value of its equity stake in Isosceles, which owns the UK Gateway grocery chain. A&amp;P owns 7.2 per cent of Isosceles and is taking a Dollars 89.2m provision to cover the potential loss on its holding. The after-tax figure, before the Isosceles provision and other one-off accounting items, was Dollars 22.8m, compared with Dollars 36.2m a year earlier. Sales slipped from Dollars 3.59bn to Dollars 3.32bn, while operating profits fell to Dollars 60.1m from Dollars 89.8m. A&amp;P has been badly hit by general food price deflation and acute competition in the supermarket industry. Acquisitions in Canada and Michigan have also proved tough to integrate. However, the company said the climate was gradually improving, as the US economy hauls itself out of recession. A&amp;P shares closed Dollars  1/4 lower in New York at Dollars 27, having earlier touched Dollars 26 7/8 .</p>

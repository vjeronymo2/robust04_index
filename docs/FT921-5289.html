			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / 'Poor environment to blame for most deaths' THREE-QUARTERS of all deaths worldwide are caused by diseases related to the environment and to lifestyle, especially infectious diseases and cancer, the World Health Organisation said in a report published yesterday. Arguing that action to stop environmental deterioration was essential to avert potentially disastrous consequences for human health and survival, the report said 2.5bn people suffer from illnesses resulting from insufficient or contaminated water and lack of sanitation. The 270-page report, 'Our planet, our health', the UN agency's contribution to the Earth Summit in Brazil in June, calls for measures to reduce population growth, waste and overconsumption in industrialised countries and poverty. The report says that while economic development has historically led to big improvements in human health, population pressures in poor countries and profligate lifestyles in rich ones are degrading the environment in ways that damage health. It cites urban overcrowding and insanitary conditions, high levels of air pollution including indoor pollution from open fires, unsafe working conditions especially in poor countries, and growing pressures on water reserves. International problems include acid rain, disposal of hazardous wastes, atmospheric ozone loss and global warming which may lead to crop failures and migration of diseases.</p>

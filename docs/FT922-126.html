			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Lippo Group restructures in Rp250bn scheme THE LIPPO Group, one of Indonesia's largest banking and insurance conglomerates, has announced a Rp250bn (Dollars 123m) corporate restructuring. In a move similar to that last week by the Salim Group, Indonesia's largest private conglomerate, large shareholdings in six Lippo Group subsidiaries are to be transferred to Lippo Pacific Finance (LPF), a quoted company. LPF, which is to be renamed Lippo Pacific, is to acquire stakes of between 40 per cent and 51 per cent in Lippobank, Lippolife, Lippoland, Lippo Industries and Multipolar. All are quoted companies in which Mr Mochtar Riady, the founder of Lippo Group, is a leading shareholder. Most of the companies were listed in 1989, and only a minority of the shares are traded publicly. LPF is also to acquire 100 per cent of Lippo Merchants, a wholly private finance company. The Lippo Group has not announced at what price it will make the acquisitions, but brokers estimate the deal will cost about Rp250bn. The Lippo Group, which emerged during the 1970s to become Indonesia's fourth largest conglomerate, with annual turnover of more than Rp1,800bn, has its headquarters in Jakarta and offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and the US. Brokers say LPF will finance the acquisitions with a four-for-one rights issue, which will follow a two-for-one bonus issue. The Lippo Group says that the deal will boost LPF's capital base and cashflow. A leading shareholder in many Lippo Group companies is Mr Soedono Salim, the founder of the Salim Group which last week undertook a Dollars 848m restructuring when it transferred ownership of the principal food divisions to its subsidiary Indocement, Indonesia's largest quoted company.</p>

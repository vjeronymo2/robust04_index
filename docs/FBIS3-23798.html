			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marina Grigoryan under the rubric "Parliament": </F> "By Bread Alone.... The State Is Not in a Position To Provide  Anything Else For Us"]    [Text] A parliamentary discussion of the outcome of the  monetary reform, and in essence--of the catastrophic  socioeconomic situation existing in Armenia, which is being held  this week, leaves a painful impression. It appears that all  sides are doing what they are supposed to do: the deputies  criticize, the government defends itself, the president tries to  lay the emphases he needs, but the feeling of being at an  impasse is growing stronger. The issue of the government's  resignation is not even being raised because everyone  understands that this is the easiest way out, but not by far one  that solves the problem. Only on rare, very rare occasions is  something constructive proposed in individual presentations--a  majority of speakers do not go beyond noting the current crisis.  Perhaps this is the most depressing of all.    To be sure, our government is still not short on optimism.  Just as before, it has no intention of acknowledging its  mistakes. At any rate, Minister of the Economy Armen Yegiazaryan  stated that all the actions of the cabinet have been correct on  the whole. He was also the one to rebuke the deputies for  failing to appreciate how critical a situation is in which it is  necessary to make decisions literally within two to three days.  However, the minister is clearly not willing to talk about who  brought the situation to this level of absurdity. In his  opinion, now is not the time to respond to the question of who  is to blame: We will sort that out later.    The government views a granting of additional powers to it  for a period of six months as a way out of this situation. A  number of draft decisions aimed at stabilizing the dram have  been submitted to the parliament. In particular, they envision  criminal liability for trading in foreign exchange, for refusing  to sell goods for drams, and for selling goods at prices higher  than those envisioned by the state, the subordination of the  activities of the Central Bank to the government, etc. Besides,  A. Yegiazaryan assured us that there is a program of actions  that will bring about stabilization in the sphere of monetary  circulation. The minister did not wish to dwell on what kind of  program that is: "We know what needs to be done, and we will do  it." The deputies quite reasonably answered that during the  entire year the parliament has given the "go-ahead" to all the  government's initiatives, and it is clear to everyone what the  outcome has been. Can a government that has brought the country  to the brink of an abyss be trusted?    In his brilliant lecture on Monday, Prime Minister G.  Bagratyan confidently diagnosed events: There is hyperinflation.  No, the deputies objected, this is an obvious collapse. The  ministers said that they were doing everything possible. The  deputies hurled rebukes at them: No, you are professionally  incompetent. And so on ad infinitum. Frankly, despite the  sharply critical arrows, this entire exchange at times smacked  of an undisguised farce in which everyone tries to pretend that  they are acting seriously, but clearly perceive themselves that  they are doing something very different from what they should be  doing. Incidentally, this has been the case not only with the  latest discussion. Whenever a debate on the socioeconomic  situation is underway, it acquires a truly farcical character.  The poorly disguised cynicism of some and the perception of  their own helplessness on the part of others cannot evoke  anything but laughter through tears. After all, when the  president himself says, virtually with pride, that he does  provide bread for the people, no commentary is required. This  suggests just one conclusion: that these people deserve nothing  but bread--they deserve neither heat nor light nor other  foodstuffs, in a word, nothing of what has long been a given for  the rest of the world at the end of the 20th century. If they  live, it means that it is possible to live that way--these are  also the words of the president, who admitted almost a month ago  that it could not get any worse. But it has, has it not?    If we digress from all these sad reflections and try to  understand what is behind the week-long parliamentary debate,  approximately the following will emerge. It is clear that the  issue of responsibility remains the global one: The search for  yet another scapegoat is on. Until recently, the government  (before Bagratyan) was quite suitable for this role, whereas  this time the president has apparently decided to rescue the  government. Why turn on "our own men" when the "panel of three"  who made decisions with regard to the monetary reform can be  saddled with everything? (It is interesting that, according to  confidential information, only one vote stood in the way of  "sentencing" the current cabinet at one of the latest meetings  of the board of the Armenian National Movement). It was for a  reason that the deputies persistently tried to learn whether  there had been differences between the state commission and the  government. The members of the "panel of three" answered this  question quite evasively, whereas A. Yegiazaryan in essence gave  a clear-cut answer: The government has nothing to do with the  monetary reform. A fine how do you do! The state commission is  to blame for everything, and the government is not involved. Who  created the "panel of three?" The parliament. So, hold the panel  accountable. Do you recall that a representative of the  parliament, Tigran Sarkisyan, was precisely the one to make the  most vigorous presentations during the days of the monetary  reform and immediately thereafter? He sort of assumed the role  of leader. So, this deputy took virtually no part in the debate  that was held.    Here is one more argument in favor of the suggestion that  the  government is trying to distance itself from the monetary reform  in every way possible: Why is the issue of subordinating the  Central Bank to the Council of Ministers being raised right now  rather than before the introduction of the national currency?  If, as Minister of Finance L. Barkhudaryan assures us, the  government was ready to take this step, why did it not assume  control over the process, agreeing instead to establish the  state commission? So that it would be possible to blame it for  everything later?    After all, judging by the presentations of the members of  the  government, a sharp loss of the value of the dram and, as a  consequence, a price stalemate had been predetermined ahead of  time. As it turns out, all credit for Armenia has been frozen  since November. Not a single international financial  organization, not a single country which has been approached for  help undertook to ensure the stabilization fund of the Armenian  national currency. It turns out, as Kh. Arutyunyan observed,  that the government ensured merely the technical aspect of the  endeavor--the exchange of currency within a record short period  of time which, incidentally, greatly shattered the nerves of the  already worn-down population. It is hard to disagree with Kh.  Arutyunyan on something else, too: the situation is socially  explosive, and emergency measures are needed which originate  precisely with the president. Meanwhile, the government coolly  states that there is hyperinflation, and demands additional  powers in order to stabilize the situation in six months(!)  There is a wise Armenian saying about this: Either the donkey or  his master will die by then.    I am far from thinking that the prime minister and his team  alone are to blame for everything. Of course, their blame, as  well as that of the "panel of three," for the specific  present-day situation is indisputable. However, who is to blame  for the executive authorities being given carte-blanche during  at least the last two years? Who has ensured the virtually  complete lack of control over the operation of the government?  Who has dealt absolutely all the cards to the president, while  at the same time not daring to openly hold anybody accountable?  During the more than three years of its existence the Armenian  parliament has reduced itself to the level of the most helpless  and powerless structure which allows anything at all to be done  to it. It was no accident that Deputy S. Zolyan said directly  that the parliament presently performs the functions of merely  the fourth branch of power, the press, because it is allowed to  say all it wants, but nobody pays any attention to it.    However, the crisis of absolutely all branches of power is  apparent. It appears that everybody has a clear notion as far as  the parliament and the government are concerned (to say nothing  about judicial power). However, will the president succeed in  coming out wearing white gloves this time, too? To be sure, the  stains are quite easy to see, but there is no dearth of  experience in getting them out.</p>

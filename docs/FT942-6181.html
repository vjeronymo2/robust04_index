			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Banks grant fewer mortgages New mortgage lending by UK banks fell in April to a level below that for the corresponding month last year, the British Bankers Association reported yesterday. The number of mortgages approved in April also dropped compared with the same month a year ago, and with March. These figures suggest that banks are losing the sharply increased share of the mortgage market they acquired last year at the expense of building societies. Gross loans made by the banks totalled Pounds 1.43bn in April - a drop of 11 per cent from the Pounds 1.61bn lent in March. In April 1993, the banks' gross mortgage loans amounted to Pounds 1.79bn. The fall in the number of loans approved, which is regarded as an important indicator for future mortgage lending, is even more striking. Some 26,989 new loans were approved in April, while in the previous month 31,518 were approved. Last month's figure is 24 per cent lower than the 35,348 approvals in April 1993. Lord Inchyra, BBA director-general, said the reductions were similar to those experienced by building societies. However, in contrast to the banks, the societies' monthly lending figures for April were higher than in April last year, even though they were lower than in March this year. Mr John Ecklin, BBA director of statistics, said that in 1993, monthly mortgage lending by banks was higher than the previous year while societies had been lending less. 'For the last four or five months the reverse has happened,' he said. Lord Inchyra said it was 'too soon' to attribute the fall in mortgage lending to the tax increases and the reduction in mortgage tax relief which took effect at the beginning of April.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: Swedish current account gloom Sweden recorded a larger than expected deficit of SKr4.4bn (Pounds 379m) in its current account in August because of a lower surplus in the balance of services and higher overseas interest payments by the state and private sectors. The Riksbank said the deficit pushed down the current account surplus for the January-August period to SKr2.3bn. But the overall trend of strong export growth this year means this surplus remains a significant turnaround from a deficit in the same period last year of SKr11bn. Industrial production, meanwhile, rose by 0.6 per cent in August compared with July, bringing the increase in the year to the end of August to 8.4 per cent and reflecting Sweden's slow recovery from recession over the past year. The central statistics bureau also said industrial labour costs in August stood at SKr146.70 per hour, or 5.4 per cent higher than at the same stage last year. EU annual inflation, as measured by consumer price indices, fell to 3 per cent in September, the lowest level since March 1987, according to figures from Eurostat. Inflation was 3.1 per cent in August and July after remaining at 3.2 per cent from March to June. Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece were above the EU average.</p>

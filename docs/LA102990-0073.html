			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE JOHN WILLIAMS ENIGMA  </P> <P> The day in 1986 came, and John Williams decided to leave Louisiana State  University. It wasn't pleasant for him. It has often seemed basketball hasn't  been much fun for Williams since.  </P> <P> The Washington Bullets have been locked in a 10-month battle with their star  over his weight, his work habits and, most recently, his money. He is in Los  Angeles waiting to be paid; the Bullets have just concluded an 0-7 preseason  but say they will pay him nothing until he comes east, undergoes a physical  examination and continues rehabilitation of his injured right knee under their  supervision.  </P> <P> Life has not been the same for John Williams since Dec. 2. That's when a  misstep tore the medial collateral ligament and partially tore the anterior  cruciate ligament in his knee and put on hold one of the league's more  promising careers.  </P> <P> It's a case in which neither side appears to be a victor -- the Bullets faced  with playing an 82-game NBA schedule without their best player, Williams  sitting on the West Coast knowing that, as the "Peanuts" philosopher Charlie  Brown said, "A great potential is man's heaviest burden."  </P> <P> "John did not want to leave LSU," said his coach there, Dale Brown. "When he  came to see me he was in tears. I think (his time at LSU) was the happiest he  ever was. I think he felt very comfortable here; there wasn't any pressure  here. He could just play.  </P> <P> "He said 'I've got to go.' (I said) 'Well, what happened, John?' (He said)  'Well, I've just got to go.' Some of those kids just aren't ready to go. John  just wasn't ready. Everyone was just pulling on him. John was like a big teddy  bear. I really loved John. John was real easy to coach. He was very gentle. He  had no ego whatsoever. His only problem was he was just too nice to too many  people. He couldn't say no."  </P> <P> Who were they? Friends, acquaintances, people who hooked onto the star of John  Sam Williams and helped convince him he belonged in the NBA. "A lot of those  people," Brown said, "I thought were parasites."  </P> <P> Williams, who declined to be interviewed for this article, told the (Baltimore)  Sun on Friday he would sit out the season if the Bullets didn't give him the  more than $276,000 they've withheld from his $1.2 million contract since  mid-July. They did that because he failed to attend rehabilitation sessions at  Kerlan-Jobe clinic in Los Angeles, his home city.  </P> <P> "John has had a history of this with us," former Bullets general manager Bob  Ferry said. "It could be anything. Over the years we've heard a lot of his  answering machine. He just doesn't face reality and by not communicating he  doesn't have to. He's really a nice guy but he's an irresponsible person."  </P> <P> No one with the Bullets is surprised at Williams's behavior. For three years,  they held their breath, they talked to him, they cajoled him, they praised him,  they cursed him. They let him do what he wanted in previous offseasons, but  requested he stay here last offseason. Ten months have passed. They're still  waiting to see him.  </P> <P> If John Williams were a selfish ballplayer, he probably could average 25 points  a game. He's got the heft to go around most big men, yet possesses a feathery  shooting touch around the basket. But what makes him special is his willingness  to integrate teammates into the flow of a game.  </P> <P> He's as good a passer for a big man as anybody not named Magic Johnson. As a  sophomore at LSU, he took over, leading the Southeastern Conference in  rebounding and earning MVP honors in the SEC tournament.  </P> <P> "He never really liked the publicity," Brown said. "He shied away from it. He'd  have his greatest game ever, and as soon as I came in he'd say 'Hey Coach,  didn't Don (Redden) have a great game?' He always did that. The kids just loved  him."  </P> <P> He had a solid relationship with the Bullets players, and as Washington's needs  grew, so did his responsibilities: point guard against pressure defenses,  low-post defender, ballhandler in the half-court offense, rebounder. This  continued for three seasons, and he never complained.  </P> <P> "I thought what he got most of his effectiveness from was his versatility,"  Bullets Coach Wes Unseld said. "I also thought it probably stopped him from  getting some of the notoriety as far as all-star games and things like that.  But I never did that without consulting him or talking to him about it. He sort  of regaled in that opportunity."  </P> <P> But there always was another problem, and Williams has acknowledged it in the  past. He'd always carry extra weight. He'd take enough off in training camp  that he could play, and because the team was asking him to do so much bumping  in inside traffic, it was probably better that he have a little extra heft.  </P> <P> The Bullets grudgingly accepted that Williams wasn't going to be a  chiseled-physique specimen. His contracts never have included weight clauses,  but incentive bonuses (last season, up to $200,000) if he held to a certain  weight.  </P> <P> After his injury, he spent several weeks in a cast, then was fitted with a  range-of-motion brace. He worked out in Bethesda and the knee started coming  around, albeit slowly. Then Williams asked to work out in Los Angeles during  the summer and the Bullets said okay.  </P> <P> But he gradually stopped. He told the Sun the reasons were personal -- the  death of a close friend and his father's stroke. He withdrew from public view.  One of the people he did see in Los Angeles was Delbert Wright, his junior high  school coach.  </P> <P> "Every Saturday the older guys come up and play," Wright said. "I told him,  'John, I'll dedicate my whole summer to getting you healthy and getting your  knee better and getting that weight off you.' He said, 'Okay, Coach.' I only  saw John once after that."  </P> <P> People grow apart, and it's happened with Williams and Wright. But it's left  Wright angry.  </P> <P> "He's got a big head," said Wright, who's known Williams since seventh grade.  "He won't listen anymore. It hurts when they act like they don't even know you.  ... To me it was more than a coach and a basketball player. It was like a  father and a son, or a big brother."  </P> <P> Soon after, the Bullets decided to stop paying him, and all this trouble began.  They lost track of him, and club owner Abe Pollin began using "back channels"  to find him.  </P> <P> The Bullets didn't regain contact with him until Oct. 11. And then the squall  over whether he'd get his money back all at once or in increments ensued.  Neither side is budging, and Williams says he is prepared for a long siege. His  teammates wonder. They don't want to talk much about it. Potential gradually  gives ground to reality.  </P></p>

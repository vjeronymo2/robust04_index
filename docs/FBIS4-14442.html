			<p>BFN     [Text] The Minister for Nationalities Sergey Shakhray  believes that the agreement on civic accord in Russia can be  given a legal form. In a Tuesday interview for Interfax he  expressed the opinion that the State Duma can pass it as a law  to be approved by the Council of the Federation and signed by  the president.    In Shakhray's opinion, initially the agreement on civic  peace  should be signed by parliamentary groups and leading political  parties. He is also convinced that if the work on the document  is done correctly, the process will be joined by all political  forces. "Parties and movements refusing to sign it will remain  outside the political process," the minister said.    Shakhray sees the greatest danger in the possibility that  several documents will appear. "If the right, left and center  each write their own agreements and start a competition of  documents, this can lead to a war of peace charters," he  remarked.    Shakhray assumed that after studying the draft agreement on  accord the president will submit the document to the parliament  and government. He did not rule out the possibility that the  draft can be published for a public debate.    In Shakhray's opinion, the agreement should set the rules of  political activities for two years. "During this time we should  concentrate on efforts to overcome the economic crisis," he said.    Shakhray is the leader of the Party of Russian Unity and  Concord.</p>

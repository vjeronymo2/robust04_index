			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Lebanon has expressed  grievances for the U.S. opposition to the efforts to call a U.N.  Security Council meeting to discuss its complaints against  Israel, leading the council's failure to take any measure to  denounce Israel.    Local press reported the Lebanese permanent representative  to  the U.N. said in a statement that "Because of one of the  Security Council permanent members which hindered any step to  condemn Israel or denounce its aggressions on Lebanon, the  Security Council has refrained from declaring it was against the  violations of the international law and the basic human rights."  He was referring to the United States.    The representative said the Lebanese requests were  understood  and supported by most of the 15 members of the U.N. Security  Council, but "after more than two weeks of consultations (since  Lebanon lodged its first complaint) the Security Council did not  take any measure."    The statement added that the failure to condemn Israel could  only lead to "encourage Israel to believe that it is above the  law and it is absolutely free to commit other violations against  Lebanon and its citizens."    Lebanon filed its first complaint to the U.N. Security  Council against Israel following an Israeli Commando raid deep  into Lebanon on May 21 in which Israeli Air-Borne Troops  abducted Lebanese guerrilla leader Mustafa Dirani.    The second Lebanese complaint was lodged after Israeli  warplanes attacked a training camp of the Lebanese pro-Iranian  Hezbollah, or Party of God, in Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon  and more than 100 people were reportedly killed or wounded in  the air raid.    Lebanon held intensive contacts with the member states of  the  U.N. Security Council in order to push it to condemn the  repeated Israeli aggressions.    The opposition of the United States for a Security Council  meeting to debate the Israeli aggression on Lebanon has aroused  criticism in Lebanon.    Local press accused the United States of standing behind the  Israeli aggressions in order to press Lebanon and Syria to give  up their firm positions in the peace negotiations with Israel.</p>

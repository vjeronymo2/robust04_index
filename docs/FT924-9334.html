			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Trade row erupts in Brussels as US sets out sanctions MR JACQUES DELORS, the European Commission president, was at the centre of a deepening row over farm trade last night, as the US announced plans for Dollars 300m (Pounds 194m) in punitive tariffs on European farm exports. Mr Delors was at odds with Mr Ray MacSharry, the European Community's agriculture commissioner, who confirmed he was handing over to Mr Delors all responsibility for negotiations in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. Mr MacSharry relinquished his responsibility after the collapse of talks in Chicago with Mr Ed Madigan, the US agriculture secretary, which were aimed at averting a trade war. Mr MacSharry, who remains in charge of EC agriculture, is understood to believe that his efforts to secure a breakthrough in protracted Gatt talks with the US were being undermined by Mr Delors. He has let it be known he believes that interventions by Mr Delors in the Gatt imbroglio constitute little short of sabotage. Mr Delors and the French government have accused the commissioner of going beyond his negotiating mandate. Other EC officials blame Mr Madigan for the failure to resolve the impasse in the US-EC talks. The US sanctions are in retaliation for damage that the US says is being caused to its farmers by EC subsidies for oilseed cultivation. The oilseeds dispute is one of the main obstacles blocking agreement in the Uruguay Round, which aims to expand world trade through liberalisation measures. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, announced that the first package of sanctions would involve 200 per cent tariffs on white wine, rapeseed oil and wheat gluten. The US also threatened to impose additional tariffs on Community farm and industrial products worth Dollars 700m. Mrs Hills sought to pre-empt a counter-explosion of EC tariffs on US products leading to a mutually destructive transatlantic trade war, by saying the sanctions would only take effect after 30 days. The US had been expected to try to limit the pain of the high tariffs to France, and perhaps Germany. But the tariffs on rapeseed oil, which hurt France, also hit Britain. Wheat gluten tariffs will penalise German producers. The tariffs on white wines will damage Italian exports as well as French and German. The US is pressing for negotiations on the oilseeds dispute to resume, in the hope of finding a settlement before the 30-day waiting period is up. The oilseeds dispute is at the heart of a two-year row between the US and the EC over Europe's farm subsidy regime. The row has blocked progress in the Uruguay Round of talks on trade liberalisation, which according to OECD estimates could stimulate world trade worth an extra Dollars 200bn a year. Many fear US sanctions will trigger a trade war enveloping a wide range of farm and industrial products. Senior EC officials confirmed that the EC in July had decided to retaliate if the US imposed sanctions. That decision would almost certainly have to be confirmed by the council of ministers. Mr MacSharry said: 'We would have no difficulty finding products to hit them back with.' He pinpointed Dollars 3bn of imports of US soya, soya meal and corn gluten alone. He repeated earlier remarks: 'It's very easy to start a war, but very difficult to stop it.' One senior Commission official argued last night that 'it won't come to that.' The official said the US had reopened contacts with the Commission to try to get a settlement before the sanctions come into effect on December 5. In Geneva, Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), expressed 'grave concern' about a US decision. But he said he was pleased the US and EC had expressed determination to continue negotiations before the sanctions came into effect. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, spoke of Britain's determination to restrain the EC from hasty retaliatory action against the US.

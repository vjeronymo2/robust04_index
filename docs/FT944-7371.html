			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Details of Berlusconi investigation leak out Milan magistrates are reported to have discovered a bank account allegedly used for making unregistered payments in the Fininvest business group of Mr Silvio Berlusconi. This discovery, according to the national news agency Ansa, lay behind the magistrates' move on Tuesday telling Mr Berlusconi, the prime minister, he was under investigation for alleged corruption. The report, quoting judicial sources, appeared to be a well orchestrated leak from Milan magistrates in advance of Mr Berlusconi's interrogation. No date has been fixed, but the meeting with the magistrates, whom Mr Berlusconi has accused of mounting a politically motivated campaign against him, is expected very soon. Throughout 2 1/2 years of anti-corruption investigations that have undermined Italy's post-war political system, sensitive information has consistently leaked from the offices of the Milan magistrates - including this week's news of the plan to interrogate Mr Berlusconi. The report of the bank account discovery followed publication in yesterday's media of the four-page document explaining why the magistrates wish to interrogate the premier about heading his Fininvest group, Italy's second largest private business empire. The bank account allegedly served to make off-balance sheet payments to members of the Berlusconi family and Fininvest executives as well as to others including the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police. Mr Jas Gawronski, Mr Berlusconi's spokesman, ridiculed the report, saying: 'Mr Berlusconi has for many years been the first and second biggest taxpayer in Italy. If he wished to give presents to his family and friends, he had no need to resort to illicit funds let alone Swiss bank accounts.' In July Mr Salvatore Sciascia, the head of Fininvest's tax department, admitted paying L330m (Pounds 130,500) between 1989 and 1992 to Guardia di Finanza officials. This related to tax inspections of Videotime, a Fininvest TV production company, Mediolanum, the group's life insurance company, and the Mondadori publishing division. Mr Sciascia also received a special L500m gratuity from Mr Silvio Berlusconi for his work at Fininvest. One of the reasons cited by Milan magistrates for questioning Mr Berlusconi was his responsibility as head of the group for such payments. Mr Sciascia told magistrates the funds were given to him by Mr Paolo Berlusconi, the prime minister's younger brother. Mr Paolo Berlusconi later confirmed the payment and claimed Fininvest had been forced to make it. This has been the standard defence of all businessmen accused in the ever-widening enquiry into bribes paid to tax inspectors. Mr Silvio Berlusconi used the same defence at a news conference in Naples on Wednesday. Milan magistrates are also investigating in a separate case alleged undeclared transfer fees paid by Mr Berlusconi's football club, AC Milan, for Gianluigi Lentini of Torino football club. Mr Mauro Borsano, the head of Torino, told the magistrates L8bn was paid secretly via banks in Liechtenstein and Lugano. Different judicial authorities in Italy are believed to be investigating at least seven separate cases within the Fininvest empire. Yesterday Rome magistrates revealed that Mr Berlusconi was on the list of people under investigation for abuse of office following complaints by a left-wing politician and a consumers' association, for allegedly putting pressure on the RAI, the state broadcasting organisation, to do a deal with Fininvest's TV channels on advertising rates. It also emerged yesterday that Mr Berlusconi's two children by his first marriage - 28 year-old Marina and Piersilvio, aged 25 - who have board positions in Fininvest, were under investigation for alleged false billing in connection with Publitalia, Fininvest's advertising arm.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / British Chambers of Commerce Annual Meeting: Heavy cost cuts ahead at Rover Further attacks on costs at the combined BMW-Rover motor group have been foreshadowed by Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, the BMW chairman. He told chambers of commerce members at their annual meeting in Birmingham that, in the European motor industry, 'the objective is to reduce the general level of costs by 20-30 per cent within two years'. Both BMW and Rover had been 'far-sighted enough to start this process of restructuring in good time, in this way coming out of the recession without any major problems,' Mr Pischetsrieder said. He did not specify how much further the restructuring in both companies had to go. 'We have to increase productivity by 4 to 5 per cent a year on an on-going basis.' But he indicated that Rover would be allowed to continue its restructuring independently. 'It is not our objective to integrate and bring together as many corporate functions as possible, in this way superficially reducing our costs. Instead, we wish to pool the specific skills and abilities of the two companies, working together to capitalise on our larger market,' he said. Mr Pischetsrieder sought to allay continuing fears that Rover's interests would be progressively subordinated to those of BMW: 'There will be no overriding holding company, the two companies being guided instead by joint committees,' he said. He added that Rover would maintain its research and development capacity. 'To have an individual car company as a partner in the UK, we have to maintain the capacity for R&amp;D in the UK and even to increase it.' The Rover 800 model would be replaced, even though in some respects it competed with BMW models. Mr Pischetsrieder said: 'We do want an exclusive image for Rover, and exclusivity starts at the top. We need a car succeeding the Rover 800, which is typical British luxury sedan.' Mr Pischetsrieder said Rover sales in Germany had increased by 100 per cent in the past two months and production volumes were 25 per cent more than a year ago. He also painted a bright future for UK component suppliers if they maintained present trends. BMW has increased by 400 per cent its purchases of UK components during the past three years.</p>

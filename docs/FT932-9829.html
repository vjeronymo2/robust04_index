			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / People: Invesco in hiring mode After the exodus of recent weeks, Invesco MIM yesterday announced a handful of senior appointments which confirm once again the steadily increasinging American influence on the still UK-listed fund manager. Significantly, the new chief financial officer is American Hubert Harris, who joined Invesco in 1988 and is currently president of Invesco Services. He replaces Ratan Engineer, the London-based finance director who left in April. Harris was assistant director of the Office of Management and Budget in Washington back in the Carter administration. Prior to that he worked at Citizens and Southern, the bank where executive chairman Charles Brady and others started before setting Invesco up. He is well plugged into the Atlanta, Georgia community, from where Brady operates; Harris is on the board of trustees of Georgia State University as well as a member of the advisory board of the Atlanta committee for the Olympics. Invesco has also brought another American non-executive onto the board following the appointment of Sandy White last November. He is Bevis Longstreth, a former SEC commissioner and currently a partner with law firm Debevoise &amp; Plimpton. Meanwhile Norman Riddle, newly appointed head of the European businesses, has brought in James Robertson from his previous stable Capital House. Robertson, who becomes finance director for the European division, had worked with Riddell in building up Capital House, the fund management subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, as director of finance and corporate development. He qualified as a chartered accountant with Arthur Andersen before joining the corporate finance department of Charterhouse merchant bank.</p>

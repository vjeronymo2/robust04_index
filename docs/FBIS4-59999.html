			<p>BFN     [Text] Presidential Council Chairman Brother Lieutenant  General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih last night telephoned his brother  His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal, king of the Hashemite Kingdom  of Jordan, and briefed him on the current situation in our  country in light of the victories that our valiant Armed Forces,  the forces of unity and legitimacy are scoring in repulsing the  forces of rebellion and secession that have ignited the war in  the homeland to implement their secessionist scheme of  fragmenting the homeland. The two sides also discussed issues  of mutual interest.    The brother chairman valued the pan-Arab and noble stand of  the brothers in Jordan, with his Majesty King Husayn at their  head in support for our people and for unity and democracy in  our country.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 18 February 1994, the National Army of Democratic  Kampuchea [NADK] and local people ambushed the attacking troops  of the two-headed government and the Vietnamese communist  puppets in areas south and west of the Anlung Veng region. The  attacking troops had launched an offensive in Anlung Veng with  an infantry unit moving in front of three T-54 tanks, and  another infantry unit behind the tanks. The NADK and local  people intercepted a group of the forward infantry troops and  attacked the troops behind the tanks. In a few minutes, we  killed or wounded many of the infantry troops in the rear. The  survivors retreated in disarray, leaving the tanks behind. At  the same time, we assaulted the infantry troops in front of the  tanks. They were all killed, wounded, or forced to flee in  disarray by our surprise attack. Moreover, they knew that the  infantry troops in the rear had been routed, and thus they had  no support in the rear. At that moment, we encircled the three  tanks that were isolated like iron ingots in the open field. The  occupants of the tanks jumped out and took off their uniforms so  that no one could tell whether they were officers or rank and  file. We destroyed two of the T-54 tanks and captured another.    On the same day, we damaged another T-54 tank west of  Lumpong. We also killed Brigadier Generals (Suan Siphon) of  Division 5 and (Chin Ieng) of Division 286, two colonels, and 36  soldiers; wounded 60 enemy soldiers; and captured 27 others.    According to a report from Route 68, nearly 100 puppet  soldiers deserted the front lines and arrived at Route 68.    The enemy is being encircled and smashed bit by bit. We are  attacking and smashing the enemy communications lines in  particular. The doomsday of the military ringleaders of the  Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government is  drawing near.</p>

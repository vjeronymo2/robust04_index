			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Pact freezes Chinese textile exports to US The US and China struck a last-minute textile quota agreement yesterday that effectively freezes Chinese imports to the US at present levels and averts a serious trade dispute. Under the agreement, signed in Beijing by special trade representatives, China's exports to the US market will not be allowed to grow as they have in the past three years. The move will cost Chinese exporters about Dollars 700m (Pounds 472.9m) and result in a 13 per cent reduction in expected shipments to the US in 1994-1996. China also agreed to penalties, proposed by the US, for violations of quota restrictions. A senior US trade official, briefing reporters, said the Chinese had agreed reluctantly to the quota penalties, but had clearly recognised that the row over illicit trans-shipments, overshipments and false labelling was harming China's image and trade prospects. Trans-shipment involves Chinese-manufactured goods being transported through third countries - such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates - to disguise their origin. US officials believe that the value of illegal trans-shipments of textile items exceeds Dollars 2bn annually. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, yesterday welcomed the textile pact as 'the beginning of a healthier and more productive relationship' between the US and China. Mr Henry Tang, textiles chief at the Hong Kong Federation of Industry, said the three-year agreement was good news for the colony. 'Our position as the major trans-shipment port (for Chinese textiles) is assured,' Mr Tang said. The deal was seen as boding well for an agreement to extend China's most favoured nation (MFN) status by the US administration this year. For Hong Kong, the extension of MFN is far more important than the current dispute about trans-shipment irregularities. Sir Hamish Macleod, Hong Kong financial secretary, said yesterday that renewal of China's MFN could not be taken for granted. He said that, if China were to lose its MFN status in the US market, growth in Hong Kong might be halved from its forecast level of 5 per cent this year. China's textile exports to the US under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement amounted to Dollars 4.68bn in 1993. Shipments of silk clothes - the fastest-growing Chinese garment exports to the US - accounted for a further Dollars 2.5bn. China's trade surplus with the US reached Dollars 25bn last year, prompting demands by US Congress members for steps to restrain Chinese imports. After the signing ceremony, Ms Jennifer Hillman, the chief US negotiator, said the agreement would 'provide for consistent and orderly growth of China's textile and textile product exports to the US'. China dominates textile exports to the US, accounting for 20-25 per cent of all clothing sold. US textile industry representatives say that illegal Chinese imports have cost 50,000 US jobs. US customs seized some Dollars 581m of textiles illegally imported into the US since 1991, during the previous agreement. Mrs Wu Yi, China's trade minister, expressed satisfaction with the agreement, appearing relieved that US demands had not been more severe.</p>

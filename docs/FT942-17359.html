			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: London Gilts will start the week in an uneasy mood as bond markets around the world react to the strong US employment figures announced on Friday. For a while last week it seemed the gilts market might have turned a corner, given the success of the floating rate auction last Wednesday and a rally in the long gilt future. Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, thinks the worst of the bear market may be over, as institutional demand for gilts seems to be aroused when yields reach 8 per cent. Nevertheless, the weakness of the US bond market and UK political worries may prevent a sharp rally in the near term, he believes. Hopes of a rate cut seem to have diminished, thanks to sterling's weakness. Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International (Europe) says that Wednesday's M0 data, the narrowest measure of the money supply, is likely to show a rise in the annual rate to 5.7 per cent, from 5.5 per cent in February. Notes and coins figures will be particularly strong, possibly because of the Easter holidays. However, the market may not pay much attention to M0 which the authorities seem to have downgraded as an inflationary indicator. In last week's Treasury monetary report, M0's refusal to fall within its 0-4 per cent target range was not mentioned.</p>

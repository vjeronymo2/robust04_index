			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Hawker Siddeley Canada lifts Orenda Hawker Siddeley Canada (HSC) has buttressed the long term expansion of its Orenda Aerospace Division with a CDollars 230m (USDollars 167m) agreement to make and service jet engines and parts for GE Aircraft Engines Canada, one of the world's two biggest jet engine producers. Orenda repairs and overhauls large jet engines and makes components for both jets and industrial turbines. It is HSC's biggest single subsidiary. The others lease railcars and build sawmill, mining and materials handling equipment. BTR sold its 59 per cent control of HSC last spring in a CDollars 122m secondary share offer. Orenda will become GE Aircraft's designated manufacturer of selected turbine discs and other parts for three engine series sold worldwide. The agreement will produce at least CDollars 230m worth of business over 20 years, and could generate further orders by providing access to European and Middle East markets. Orenda has already extended operations to the US. It has sold its steel foundry division in Canada and is struggling to turn round its loss-making sawmill equipment unit in the US. The British mining equipment unit is being restructured, while railcar leasing is highly profitable with booming North American commodity traffic.</p>

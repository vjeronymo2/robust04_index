			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Dollars 24bn aid to Russia threatened: IMF concern over economic concessions made by Yeltsin's government THE RUSSIAN government's moves to slacken economic reform and credit policy are threatening aid promised from the west, officials of international economic institutions warned yesterday. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are concerned that concessions the Russian government has had to make, in the face of a conservative onslaught on its reform programme, will render useless the proposed Dollars 24bn (Pounds 14bn) aid announced last week by US president George Bush and Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor. This is seen as especially true of the Dollars 6bn fund earmarked for the stabilisation of the rouble. One official said last night: 'It is hard to see aid flowing in large amounts if the programme proposed to the IMF is substantially altered. If they don't get what looks like a fixed exchange rate for the rouble they won't get the money to stabilise it.' In the past three days of sessions of the Russian Congress of Peoples Deputies, the government has made clear that it intends to grant credits of up to Rbs200bn to agriculture and industry, and to raise pensions and other benefits. However, even these concessions may not be enough to placate the deputies. Last night it emerged that the commission preparing a resolution on economic reform, due to be debated today, had narrowly voted to propose President Boris Yeltsin should be stripped of his emergency powers - including his post as prime minister. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, told a meeting of the deputies supporting the government: 'As soon as Yeltsin gives up his powers as prime minister there is no government in Russia any longer. Everything would be paralysed. All of the government would immediately resign.' However, another minister revealed that the cabinet had prepared a list of names of those with whom it would be prepared to work as replacement prime ministers, and another list of names with whom it would not be prepared to work. Russian membership of the IMF is expected to go through at the end of this month. However, an agreed programme of assistance could be delayed indefinitely if the reforms are off course. Western calculations suggest that the size of the budget deficit in the first quarter of the year stands at between 8 and 15 per cent of the gross domestic product. One western adviser said: 'If they really were closing enterprises and laying people off then there might be a case for putting more credit into industry. But they're not at that point yet, so it's hard to believe it's a good idea.' Mr Laurence Summers, chief adviser to the World Bank, said: 'The worldwide lesson is that hard budget constraints are not a sufficient condition for the reform of enterprises, but that they are necessary.' He would not comment on how the reforms would affect the international financial institutions' posture. Gold mining battle, Page 2</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] General Moises Shriqui, the Armed Forces Chief of  Staff, yesterday referred to statements by former labor union  leader Juan Lechin regarding a future rapprochement between the  armed institution and the peoples' organizations. He denied a  possible coup d'etat as a result of an alleged reduction of  troops.    Lechin said the U.S. Government fears rapprochement between  the Armed Forces and peoples' organizations. He praised the  role of the military since the country returned to democracy.    Shriqui told PRESENCIA: "We are very pleased with his  comments, and he is quite right. Mr. Lechin deserves our  respect as a combatant who has always struggled for the workers'  needs. If at times we may have been adversaries, as he stated,  it was only for constitutional reasons."    Lechin also warned that the Latin American military would  stage a coup if the U.S. continues to demand a reduction of the  Armed Forces and that the Bolivian military would adopt a  similar attitude.    Shriqui said: "That is what Lechin says, maybe we should ask  him why he says that."    The journalist insisted: "What do the Armed Forces think?"    The military chief answered: "We abide by the Constitution  and are determined to defend it. We remain aware of the  situation within the country."    Lechin admitted that in the past he criticized the Armed  Forces due to its involvement in politics. The old union leader  said: "I have dreamed of a productive Army, whose ideal was to  have soldiers carrying rifles but dressed in overalls."    He added that the people will never allow the elimination of  the Armed Forces.</p>

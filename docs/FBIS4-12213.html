			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 2 Apr (INA)--Deputy Prime Minister Tariq  'Aziz received here today Nicolas Rodriguez, under secretary of  the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Relations.    During the meeting, the talks addressed the friendly  bilateral ties and the means of promoting them despite the  embargoes clamped on both Iraq and Cuba.    The talks also addressed the imperialist U.S. policy, which  seeks to perpetuate the iniquitous embargo clamped on Iraq,  although Iraq has fulfilled all its commitments. The two  officials also discussed the wicked embargo the United States is  imposing on Cuba and its people to achieve tendentious political  purposes.    The two sides asserted that adherence to independence is the  best weapon to be used in confronting embargoes and conspiracies.    The meeting was attended by the Foreign Ministry under  secretary and the Cuban charge d'affaires in Baghdad.</p>

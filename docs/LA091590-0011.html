			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SEEKS SYRIA'S HELP IN MIDEAST  </P> <P> Re: President Bush's speech on the gulf crisis:  </P> <P> This is kinder and gentler? I will not dance to the beat of the (oil) drums of  war.  </P> <P> A strong support of the blockade should have been sufficient; sending in troops  was premature and overkill!  </P> <P> Bush's statement that we are in the Persian Gulf to "defend civilized values"  is ludicrous. We all know why we are there. His vague references to  conservation were laughable. But I don't think anyone missed his more serious  intentions -- domestic drilling (watch out, California and Alaska), and a  "sound" defense budget.  </P> <P> This crisis should force us to focus on our enormous consumption of oil and its  alternative sources -- not war.  </P> <P> DEBORAH V.

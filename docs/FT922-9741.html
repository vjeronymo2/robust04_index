			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (9): Now the grinding wheel comes full circle - Manufacturer's profile: Jones &amp; Shipman BUSINESS conditions have been as tough for Jones &amp; Shipman as any other UK machine tool maker, but the Leicester-based grinding machine manufacturer can hardly be accused of twiddling its thumbs during the recession. The 40-strong engineering department has been working harder than ever before over the past 12 months, says Dr John Liverton, director of engineering. Since September, a small group of engineers have been working on a project of considerable strategic significance for J&amp;S, one of the UK's three remaining publicly-quoted machine tool builders. Through an acquisition last year from Brown &amp; Sharpe, the venerable US machine tool builder which invented the grinding machine, Jones &amp; Shipman has become the first British machine tool builder to make CNC creep-feed grinders, one of the most promising product areas in the industry. In a sense, therefore, J&amp;S has now brought the grinding wheel full circle for creep-feed, on which much of the pioneering work was done at the University of Bristol in the 1970s, before commercial exploitation moved to the US and Europe. As the name suggests, creep-feed grinding involves passing the workpiece under the grinding wheel at a slow pace, allowing greater metal removal in one pass, and thus increasing the customer's productivity. Until now, creep-feed has been used mainly in the aerospace sector for producing turbine blades and other parts. However, many users are now contemplating replacing their original machines to take advantage of recent developments in CNC systems. At the same time, new markets are opening up for grinding materials such as ceramics and composites, while creep-feed technology can also be applied to the manufacture of such humdrum articles as scissor-blades, currently produced on milling and other machines. J&amp;S is keen to exploit these opportunities, as part of a strategy to expand its presence in the production grinding market, where the machines are bigger, and the prospects more promising, than in the toolroom grinding business. The need for speed of action coincided neatly with Brown &amp; Sharpe's decision last year to withdraw from machine tool manufacture, says Mr Eddie Gee, J&amp;S sales director. The result, among other things, was the purchase of the full intellectual property rights to the US company's Hi-Tech creep feed grinding product line, and its Techmaster surface grinder range. For J&amp;S, the Hi-Tech range was a solid springboard for moving into creep-feed. The machine, based on an epoxy granite bed to absorb the vibrations from the high-powered grinding process, was mechanically advanced, but the control systems needed to be re-engineered if J&amp;S was to take full advantage of business prospects. This has involved a combination of in-house and external computer expertise. The latest GE Fanuc 16 Series CNC system with an LCD flat screen display has replaced an older Allen-Bradley system, while Jones and Shipman has also installed its own PC-based software for solving problems such as the 'flight-path' of the grinding wheel when cutting difficult contours. Manufacturing has been brought back to Leicester from Rhode Island, making more efficient use of spare capacity caused by the recession. Outside the US, the machine is being relaunched as the Techmat 400. The Techmaster is also to be re-engineered, as a smaller creep-feed grinder, and will be launched later this year as the Techmat 200. Technically, says Dr Liverton, the new Techmat 400 is equal or superior to its European rivals, but the control system is superior - the machine is the first creep-feed grinder in Europe to have the new GE Fanuc control. Jones &amp; Shipman now faces the challenge of developing its presence in creep-feed grinding against entrenched European rivals such as Magerle of Switzerland and Germany's Hauni- Blohm. The British company is already talking to Rolls-Royce, a big user of creep-feed technology, and wants two or three good installations in the home market before tackling Europe. Today, at the Mach 92 Show, will see the start of a drive to persuade customers from outside aerospace to switch to creep-feed. Much will depend on business conditions - the Techmat 400 is a big investment for many companies at around Pounds 220,000. 'People have their installed capacity and you have to get over this obstacle,' says Mr Gee. J&amp;S is now hoping that a recent upturn in its small tools business will, as has happened in the past, herald better conditions in machine tools. Late last month, Jones &amp; Shipman announced machine tool orders worth more than Pounds 1.4m, evidence that a quickening pace in order inquiries is beginning to be converted into orders. Whatever happens, says Dr Liverton, 'I think we will get a lot of interested German and Swiss on the stand at Mach '92.'</p>

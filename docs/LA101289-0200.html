			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHASE SAYS $1.1-BILLION LOSS CAUSED BY BOOSTING RESERVES  </P> <P> Chase Manhattan Corp., the second-largest U.S. banking company, kicked off the  third-quarter earnings reporting period Wednesday by disclosing a $1.1-billion  loss, owing to a huge charge for boosting its Third World loan-loss reserves.  </P> <P> However, excluding the special provision, Chase's earnings were strong, fueled  by loan growth and trading income, analysts said.  </P> <P> The loss was attributed to $1.26 billion in after-tax charges for the increased  loan-loss reserves.  </P> <P> Without special items and reserve boosts, Chase's third-quarter 1989 income  rose to $151 million, up from $130 million a year ago.  </P> <P> The third-quarter operating profits, Chase said, were helped by increases in  net interest income, consumer and investment banking fees and trading account  income. Foreign exchange trading income was lower, and expenses were higher.  </P> <P> In the 1988 third quarter it earned $283 million, the bank said.  </P> <P> "Setting aside provisions, the quarter was confirmation of the high quality of  Chase's core earnings," said Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.'s James McDermott.  "Net interest income was up and the trading account was up nicely."  </P> <P> The banking company also took a $126 million pretax charge for Arizona real  estate assets, and a $38 million pretax charge to restructure its securities  trading business.  </P></p>

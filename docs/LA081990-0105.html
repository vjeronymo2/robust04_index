			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE VALLEY;  </P> <P> CURTIS PAGE, EDUCATION ADVOCATE  </P> <P> "I see an increase in the kind of urban issues as the Valley becomes more and  more urban. In a lot of ways that's very exciting. It's very exciting to see  the mixed ethnicity, the kind of exciting city life that comes. But I also see  the freeways more crowded. I certainly see a school district that's more and  more falling apart.  </P> <P> "Schools are failing -- failing our kids both literally and figuratively. The  district is trying to carry an overwhelming bureaucratic mess, trying to  respond to kids as though it is still 20-25 years ago. Teachers are weighed  down by a giant bureaucracy. They're trying to micro-manage the district from  the top, trying to force a pattern on a city that's no longer one kind of  person.  </P> <P> "The Valley faces an even greater problem than elsewhere. Fourteen languages  are spoken at my daughter's school. On my street, people are from about seven  countries. It requires dealing with education in a whole different way. Schools  are no longer places where you can assume kids are going to enter in  kindergarten and get out in high school, enter in September and get out in  June. They're going to enter at all kinds of different times with all kinds of  different backgrounds.  </P> <P> "We need to use the creativity of our parents, of our teachers and even of our  children. There's a real mythology that parents don't care. I think parents  care an enormous amount about their children. It's the bureaucratic system that  tries to scare parents away and tell them they aren't needed and they're  stupid. The school board hasn't been willing to change its way of doing of  things.  </P> <P> "The teacher my daughter had in first grade was horrid, totally incapable of  dealing with the situation. I've been lucky, my wife has not had to work  outside the home, so she's been able to hang around the school and make sure  things were OK.  </P> <P> "It's gotten to the point it has because more and more white middle-class  people have pulled their children out of the system and the system just doesn't  respond to the complaints of minorities. People need to get organized, they  have to get organized to raise money. Politicians can do one thing: They can  count. They can count votes and they can count money."  </P></p>

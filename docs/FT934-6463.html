			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Brazilian finance minister set to quit race for presidency Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, has signalled his withdrawal as a possible candidate in next year's presidential elections by promising to remain as a minister instead. Finance ministry officials say Mr Cardoso has written to President Itamar Franco saying he will not run in presidential, senatorial or gubernatorial elections next October. Technically, Mr Cardoso could change his mind before April 2, the deadline for candidates to announce they will run. But analysts said such a reversal would be politically damaging and provide an easy target for opponents. Mr Cardoso's term as a senator runs out next year and he had been widely seen as a presidential hopeful. As a former academic and foreign minister, he has strong support from foreign investors. However, his intellectualism was seen as a barrier to winning popular support. In opinion polls released at the weekend Mr Cardoso had only 7 per cent support. His withdrawal from the presidential race should improve the now slight chances of a successful economic reform package being approved before the elections. The government needs congressional support for its 1994 budget, due to be announced later this week, and other structural changes aimed at tackling inflation of close to 2,000 per cent a year. But some important political groups had been opposed to the measures because they feared a successful economic reform would boost Mr Cardoso's election chances. Mr Cardoso's letter suggests he needs more time to implement the reform measures, which involve spending cuts and are therefore likely to be difficult to implement in an election year. According to the polls, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers Party (PT) is the presidential favourite with 31 per cent, while his nearest probable rival is the right-wing mayor of Sao Paulo, Mr Paulo Maluf, with 12 per cent. However, analysts said these ratings could change considerably over the next 11 months.</p>

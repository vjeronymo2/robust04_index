			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 1 (YONHAP) -- Starting with the 33  Nepalese workers who arrived in South Korea Tuesday, some 20,000  foreign trainees will be supplied to small manufacturing  companies across the country by early August to ease a manpower  shortage.    The foreign workers will undergo a one-year apprenticeship  and they can prolong their stay by another year if they or their  employers request an extension.    The workers, allowed in by the government to alleviate the  worsening manpower shortage at small- and medium-sized  manufacturing firms, hail from 11 countries. Among these  nations, China is sending the largest number of workers with  8,000 including ethnic Koreans, followed by 3,000 Filipinos,  2,400 Vietnamese and 1,600 Bangladeshis. Myanmar [Burma] and  Sri Lanka will dispatch 1,000 workers apiece while Nepal,  Indonesia and Pakistan are each sending 800, trailed by Thailand  and Iran with 300 apiece.    The Korea Federation of Small Business (KFSB) has voiced  concern about possible social problems caused by foreign workers  deserting their places of employment. The KFSB is in charge of  overall management of their introduction to domestic enterprises.    Previously, the Ministries of Labor and Justice opposed the  introduction of foreign laborers amid a controversy over the  issue at the end of last year, citing a possible rise in  domestic unemployment, worsening labor conditions, an upsurge in  crime, and the possibility of the workers overstaying.    In an effort to ease such worries, the KFSB has made the  manpower agencies and manufacturers responsible for the workers  to lessen the chances of any untoward incidents during the  training period.    The manpower companies and manufacturers employing the  foreign workers must deposit 100 U.S. dollars and 300,000 won,  respectively, for each foreign trainee to guarantee performance  of contract. This guarantee money will be collected as a  penalty if the workers desert their workplaces due to an  employer's illegal treatment or a supplier's negligence in  management.    At the same time, they are obliged to be insured against  accidents so that the workers can be compensated for any  industrial mishaps.    However, small- and medium-sized companies insist the 20,000  workers "officially permitted" are insufficient to solve the  labor shortage, noting that many other businesses are paying  high commissions to manpower agencies or brokers in search of  illegal foreign workers.    According to the Justice Ministry, an estimated 70,000 to  80,000 foreigners are working illegally in Korea. That being  the case, smaller businesses insist that an additional 30,000 to  40,000 foreign workers be allowed to come to Korea under strict  controls to prevent the spread of illegal laborers.</p>

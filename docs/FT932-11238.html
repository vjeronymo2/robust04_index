			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Nicholas Ward quits managing director role at Brent Walker MR NICHOLAS Ward has resigned as group managing director of Brent Walker, the pubs and betting shops group which last year completed a Pounds 1.65bn refinancing. Mr Ward's departure follows that of Mr Ken Scobie, chief executive, who left in January amid suggestions that the group's banks, headed by Standard Chartered, had pushed him out. Mr Ward is expected to receive compensation, although no amount was announced. Brent Walker has yet to produce accounts for 1992. Mr Ward's resignation leaves only one of the four-man executive team which was put into Brent Walker in the early months of the 18 month-long refinancing, when Mr George Walker, who had been chairman and chief executive, was ousted. Mr John Leach remains as finance director. At the time of Mr Scobie's resignation Brent Walker announced the appointment of Sir Keith Bright as chairman, following a long search after Lord Kindersley left after last year's annual meeting. Brent Walker published a brief statement yesterday saying that Mr Ward had 'played a significant part in negotiating the restructuring of the company's financial affairs and in organising its programme of disposals'. It thanked him for his 'considerable contribution'. However, few disposals have taken place and the banks, which are also majority shareholders, are thought to be concerned that more have not been completed. Brent Walker's statement yesterday echoed that made in January when Mr Scobie left, and like that was published after the stock market closed. Brent Walker's shares were up  1/2 p at 10 1/4 p.</p>

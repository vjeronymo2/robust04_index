			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Gatt condemns EU over bananas - Import regime under fire as Latin Americans refuse to drop complaint A potentially embarrassing report criticising Europe's controversial banana import regime was released last night by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade after the collapse of negotiations intended to persuade Latin American complainants to withdraw their backing from the report. Contents of the report are unlikely to be made public for 30 days, but participants confirmed yesterday that the Gatt report condemns the European Union's preferential trading arrangements with former colonies. The five Latin American states which last year brought a formal complaint to the Gatt over Europe's banana import regime - Costa Rica, Colombia, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Guatemala - have come under intense pressure from the EU to drop their complaint. Over the past four days, all but Guatemala appeared inclined to bow to EU pressure, which was linked to offers of improved quota access to Europe's protected banana market. However, at the eleventh hour the Latin Americans backed away from compromise when it emerged it would lead to deep divisions among them. Apart from Guatemala - which accounts for a tiny 1.5 per cent of EU banana imports and has remained adamantly opposed to the EU proposals, it emerged yesterday that Costa Rica, which accounts for 20 per cent of EU imports, was also paralysed ahead of general elections on February 6. One Latin American negotiator yesterday voiced regret that no compromise had been possible: 'A solution is still necessary,' he said. 'If time conspired against agreement today, then we must still aim to find a solution in the month ahead.' It was unclear yesterday whether the EU would keep on the table an offer made in December to give Latin American suppliers improved quota access to its banana market. Letters written to Latin American ministers in recent days insisted that the offer would be withdrawn if compromise was not reached before the Gatt panel report was released. The deadline for releasing the report passed at the weekend. Gatt officials agreed to delay for two days as the EU and Latin Americans sought compromise. A hard-hitting first panel report on the EU banana import regime was released in July last year. This upheld Latin American complaints and ruled that the Lome convention of preferential trading arrangements between EU members and their former colonies could not be defended as a free trade agreement or a customs union. Negotiators have insisted that a Gatt ruling in favour of the Latin Americans would be embarrassing, but otherwise a pyrrhic victory, since the report is unlikely ever to be adopted. Gatt's rules require that a dispute panel report is supported by all Gatt contracting parties before adoption.</p>

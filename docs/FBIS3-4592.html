			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 27 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the  United States will make it clear that a decision on South  Korea-U.S. joint military exercise, Team Spirit '94, would be  made on the premise that IAEA inspections of North Korean  nuclear facilities and exchange of presidential envoys between  Seoul and Pyongyang will be fully implemented, a high-level  government source said Sunday.    If the conditions were not met, the source said, plans to  stage the military maneuver will be pushed for again. The South  Korean government is expected to announce the suspension of Team  Spirit '94 on Tuesday, the same day the inspectors from the  International Atomic Energy Agency are scheduled to begin their  tasks on seven declared nuclear sites in North Korea, the  official said.    The United States will announce Tuesday the terms of the  Pyongyang-Washington agreement made last Friday in New York and  fully agree to Seoul's position, the source said.</p>

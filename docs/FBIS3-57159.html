So the policy of financial stabilization is now absolutely  officially dead. Prematurely, without having achieved much of  what could and should have been achieved. The deceased had been  weak, of course, and was a lot of trouble for people, but some  future hopes were pinned on it.    "Granny," Korney Chukovskiy's young heroine asked, "when you  die will they bury you in the ground?" "Yes," granny replied.  "Deep?" "Deep." "Good, so I will be able to play with your  sewing machine as much as I like."    No doubt the "sewing machines" of the Main Administration  for  the Production of State Bank Notes, Coins, and Medals will be  chattering away for all they are worth very soon. The Central  Bank has already placed an order for the first quarter -- the  volume of money to be printed exceeds the entire amount of cash  available last year. We also know that 100,000-rouble [R] bills  have been printed and the likelihood is that we will soon have  them in our hands. It is perfectly clear that the printed bank  notes will not be languishing in bank storerooms. Viktor  Chernomyrdin, as head of the new-look cabinet, promised first to  pay any money owing to farmers, the military-industrial complex,  and budget-funded sectors. According to the most modest  estimates, that is R10 trillion, not counting the R10 trillion  the government was already intending to spend in the first  quarter.    Debts have to be paid, of course, but who, aside from the  agrarian lobby, forced us to be beholden to the farmers at  utterly absurd prices? Who is forcing military expenditure to  remain at a level that is only appropriate for a country at war?  It is clear that the claims by Vice Premier Aleksandr  Zaveryukha, who has already prepared a decree on agriculture  worth R26 trillion, are incompatible even with the moderate  financial policy the now former finance minister had agreed to.    If the finance minister says he cannot cooperate with the  head of the Central Bank, while the premier does not see any  reason why Gerashchenko should go, it is easy to guess who will  remain in the boat. It should be remembered that there remains  yet another principled opponent of Gerashchenko in the  government -- Anatoliy Chubays, the last Gaydarite. He was one  of the most vigorous critics of the Central Bank chief by virtue  of the latter's operating a system of the reciprocal offsetting  of state enterprises' debts, while Gerashchenko responded by  saying that the "little Chubayses" were hindering normal  operations. If the problem of which of them remains and which  of them goes recurs in the future, it is easy to predict who  will be favored.    So, having left the cabinet practically bereft of those who  designed and executed the former policy, Chernomyrdin announces  that the course of reforms is unchanged. If the unchanged  course consists in a switch from monetarist to nonmonetarist  methods of combating inflation, as the premier promised, then  there will certainly have to be different people in the  government to continue it in that way. Although, it is rather  difficult to imagine what the premier's new principles for  combating inflation will be like in practice. Price freeze?  Stronger state levers to influence economic activity? All this  is very much akin to free medicines, concerning which it is said  that free treatment means no treatment.    Gaydar's former colleague, former Vice Premier Sergey  Shakhray, who went to Chernomyrdin last May to try to persuade  him to bring Russia's [former FRG Economics Minister] Erhard  back into the government, now says that his vice premier  colleagues are leaving the government to avoid being held  responsible. Shakhray himself remains -- presumably because he  is not afraid of his responsibility for interethnic conflicts?    As for responsibility, why, one wonders, is it only the  premier's deputies that are being blamed for all the policy  failures? What about the premier himself, who has led the  government for 13 months now -- has he nothing to do with it,  and don't the results of the elections, which provided the  political grounds for the reshuffle, affect him at all? Why  not? Was he obediently carrying out Gaydar's will even during  the period when he was absent and therefore is not responsible  for the result? But if he was an independent leader, why does  he not share the responsibility?    It appears that our economy is on the brink of major  changes,  back to the old days. Fedorov has aligned himself with Gaydar,  who a week before had said that he found it impossible to be a  party to such changes. Maybe Fedorov will be one of the leaders  of Irina Khakamada's new "Union of 12 December" Duma faction.  Maybe he will head the banking subcommittee and hound  Geraschenko from there. But the move by the reformist wing from  government to parliament is unlikely to have a major effect on  the body's work. Although one can hope that the  liberal-agrarian-communist majority in parliament will have few  quarrels with the present government and the long-awaited peace  will be established between the two hostile branches of  authority. But what will become of the economy?</p>

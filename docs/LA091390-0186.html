			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT RESTRICTED ON STREETS NEAR HISTORICAL ZONE  </P> <P> Moving to put a buffer zone around the new Willmore City Historical District,  the Long Beach Planning Commission has restricted development in the Drake Park  area and portions of 7th Street between Pacific and Maine avenues.  </P> <P> The action is intended to protect additional historic structures and strengthen  design controls for renovation and new construction in the downtown-area  neighborhood.  </P> <P> At least 10 property owners decried the proposal, saying property values have  plummeted and the requirements make renovating or rebuilding financially  unfeasible.  </P> <P> Multifamily development will be permitted only on sites where no historic  structures now sit or where such buildings have been successfully moved to  another location.  </P> <P> Owners of historic buildings will be allowed to convert them to  bed-and-breakfast inns, add artists' lofts or pursue other limited commercial  efforts. The new restrictions allow late Victorian, California Bungalow,  Mediterranean Revival and Craftsman architectural styles and prohibit Queen  Anne, Art Deco and Modern International.  </P> <P> Among the property owners to praise the plan was Councilman Evan Anderson  Braude, a Willmore resident since August, 1989. "The value of this property is  going up, even with the down-zoning," he said.  </P></p>

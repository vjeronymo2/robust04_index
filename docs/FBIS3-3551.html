With a total investment of 400 million yuan, the limited  company will be jointly funded by the Civil Aviation  Administration of China, China Chang Jiang Three-Gorges Project  Development Corporation, Hubei Provincial Government and Yichang  city government.    Now Yichang city on the bank of the river is becoming more  and more conspicuous with the Three-Gorges project going on, and  the number of overseas businessmen and tourists is on the rise.    But since there is no airport in Yichang, transportation  connections are not easy for Chinese and foreign visitors.    The Chinese Government has decided to construct an  international airport to meet the demands of the construction of  the Three-Gorges project.    The runway for the planned airport is 2,600 meters in length  and 45 meters in width. The terminal building and waiting room,  with a floor space of 12,000 square meters, is designed to  handle 1.4 million passengers a year.    The airport will receive Boeing 737, 757, 767 and 747-SP  airliners.    Early this year, Premier Li Peng called a meeting to study  the issue for the construction of the airport at Yichang.    The airport project is expected to be completed at the end  of  1995.</p>

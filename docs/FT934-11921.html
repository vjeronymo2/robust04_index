			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Berlin airports seek private cash PLANS to expand Berlin's airport capacity are expected to be financed by the private sector in a move signalling a gradual shift from public sector borrowing for infrastructure projects. Investment bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd has been appointed to advise Berlin Brandenburg Flughafen Holding (BBF) how the existing structure, and the construction of a new airport, can be financed privately. BBF, a holding company whose shareholders include the German government, which has a 26 per cent stake, the state of Brandenburg (37 per cent) and the city of Berlin (37 per cent), runs the city's three airports: Tegel, Templehof, and Schonefeld. All three are operating at close to capacity; nearly 10m passengers used them last year. Also, Templehof may be closed by 1996 because it is virtually in the city centre. Mr Michael McGhee, a director of BZW in London, said: This is the first time an airport authority in Germany had considered approaching the private sector for financing a major infrastructure project.' In the past, the money to build airports has been raised by debt through the banks. An official from the Senate, Berlin's government, said yesterday the city was aiming to become the hub for for central and eastern Europe. The shift to the private sector coincides with attempts by the states of Brandeburg and Berlin to contain their budget deficits. Berlin this year overshot its budget by DM5.8bn.</p>

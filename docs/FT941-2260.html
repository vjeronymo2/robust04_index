			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's Television The extraordinary and fascinating thing about Italy's political situation is that matters could so easily go either way: after all the quick change governments since the second world war, the results of the impending election could be total chaos and the virtual disintegration of the country into northern, central and southern sectors - almost like the pattern in the middle ages. Or the country could emerge with the most stable government of the modern age. Assignment tries to answer the question 'Quo vadis Italy?' (7.45 BBC2) Torvill And Dean: Facing The Music is a documentary by Edward Mirzeoff that follows the pair through their attempted comeback at the National Championships, the European Championships, and finally the Olympics where, if the tabloid media are to be believed, they were so scandalously robbed of gold (8.00 BBC1). 40 Minutes is extended to 60 for its account of a year in the life of Bronwen Vickers, the mother whose leg was blown off by some lunatic wanting to further the aims of Irish republicanism (9.30 BBC2).</p>

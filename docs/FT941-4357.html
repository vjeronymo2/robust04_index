			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Beazer Homes Lord Hanson has built a small Yorkshire haulier into the ninth most valuable UK company by timing business cycles near to perfection. Investors should therefore question the wisdom of buying anything he wants to sell. Those US investors who subscribed for the Smith Corona flotation would readily testify that a Hanson cast-off is unlikely to contain much hidden value. That said, Hanson has done its best to allay such fears about Beazer Homes. The decision to sell may simply reflect the debt-laden Hanson's aversion to cash consumptive businesses. Beazer Homes certainly has its attractions. As the fourth-biggest UK housebuilder, it provides a pure and liquid exposure to the housing recovery. The price - at 14.5 times historic earnings - is decidedly modest when set against the sector. But that is for a reason. In swiftly writing down the value of Beazer's land by Pounds 75m, Hanson has ensured Beazer boasts fat margins today but leaves little scope for widening tomorrow. As has become the irritating modern practice, the maximum allocation of 75 per cent of the shares is going to institutional investors. That makes it highly unlikely that the issue will flop. Yet Beazer Homes is hardly screaming to be bought. Much of the sector's rating is predicated on a return of inflation. Multiples have a long way to unwind if that beast remains tamed.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ANTHONY QUINN'S SON ACQUITTED IN ALLEGED BEATING OF LIVE-IN GIRLFRIEND  </P> <P> Actor Anthony Quinn's son has been acquitted of felony charges that he beat his  live-in girlfriend, whom a defense attorney depicted as a crazed woman like the  villain in the movie "Fatal Attraction."  </P> <P> Francesco Quinn, an actor whose credits include several television roles and a  part in the movie "Platoon," was found not guilty Thursday of beating Carolyn  Greenberg.  </P> <P> The criminal charges stemmed from an alleged fight on Oct. 31, 1987, between  Quinn, 25, and Greenberg, 24, who shared a West Hollywood condominium.  </P> <P> In his closing argument Wednesday, defense attorney Godfrey Isaac told a jury  in Santa Monica Superior Court that no beating occurred. He portrayed Greenberg  as an emotionally unstable would-be model who, like the female villain in the  movie "Fatal Attraction," could not let go of a romantic involvement.  </P> <P> Greenberg alleged Quinn that beat her on the arms, struck her in the stomach  and kicked her in the side as she cowered on the bathroom floor of their condo.  </P> <P> The injuries resulted in a ruptured spleen, which doctors removed several weeks  after the fight, according to testimony at the trial.  </P> <P> Isaac maintained that Greenberg was injured while riding a dirt bike and lied  about the cause of her injuries because she was desperate over the failure of  the relationship.  </P></p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (5): Even world leaders need friends - Profile, General Electric A POWERFUL combination of strategic alliances, technology leadership and manufacturing expertise has helped General Electric (GE) retain its position at the top of the generating equipment league throughout the upheaval of the 1970s and 1980s. The US company is determined to keep it that way. By most standards, the numbers generated by GE's power business are impressive: the world's biggest installed base, with more than 12,000 operating turbine-generators in more than 80 countries; and 4,725 gas turbines installed or on order - four times more than its nearest competitor. Last year, GE Industrial and Power Systems, of which power generation is the most important part, was the US industrial group's fastest-growing business, with revenues rising 7 per cent to more than Dollars 6.2bn. The global reach of GE in power generation is illustrated by recent orders, and might suggest that winning new business is a push-over for the Schenectady-based concern. In Japan, for example, where US engineering companies have traditionally found it hard to make headway, GE - working closely with Japanese business associates Hitachi and Toshiba - is building the world's largest combined-cycle power plant for Tokyo Electric Power Company: a 2,800MW leviathan, scheduled to be completed in 1995. A much smaller order, but equally significant in its own way, was announced in March: a Dollars 16m contract, won with Elin Energieversorgung of Austria, for two 40MW turbines to power a combined-cycle plant at Linz. In fact, in a complex business heavily influenced by trade politics and national prejudices, nothing is easy, even for a world leader. GE has long recognised the need for partnerships to help it penetrate markets which otherwise would be closed. For GE the key to building a network of 57 business associates and licensees worldwide, and to winning orders in markets such as Japan, is technology leadership. 'If I lose that it all crumbles to nothing,' says Mr David Genever-Watling, senior vice-president at GEIPS. This is particularly true in the gas turbine business, where GE has clearly benefited from the spin-off effect of aero-engine research and development. Overall, with the help of its friends, GE has won about 50 per cent of worldwide power generating equipment business for many years. And over the past three years, it has made three important alliances to help overcome trade barriers in Europe. A series of agreements with Elin, last year, covers joint generator development; these are seen as a stepping stone to power equipment deals in eastern Europe. Earlier this year GE signed a manufacturing and marketing deal with Germany's Blohm &amp; Voss, covering both steam turbine and combined-cycle power plants. But the most important relationship in Europe is between GE and European Gas Turbines, the subsidiary of Anglo-French GEC Alsthom. GE and EGT have co-operated on development of the world's most powerful gas turbine, the 50-hertz Frame 9F, which has spearheaded GEC Alsthom's recent string of successes in European contract battles. The first commercial 9F, manufactured at EGT's factory at Belfort, in France, is scheduled to enter service at Electricite de France's Gennevilliers power station later this year. GE and EGT are also co-operating in the development of low NOx combustion systems to reduce emissions levels for GE Frame 3 and Frame 5 gas turbines; the new versions will be available from 1994. Along with other relationships in Europe (which have already included John Brown Engineering of Scotland, Kvaerner Eureka of Norway, Thomassen of the Netherlands and Italy's Nuovo Pignone), these deals enabled GE and its partners to claim 62 per cent of the orders for gas turbines in Europe last year. The European steam turbine market, however, is a different matter. Technologically, it is much more difficult for any company to gain an edge in a relatively mature business. Thus, local buying preferences prevail. GE has not sold a steam turbine in Europe since the days of the Marshall Plan, but is working hard to change that. Developments in GE's business associate relationships show clearly where GE sees its priorities for the 1990s. Apart from the Blohm &amp; Voss deal, the other important agreement announced this year involved Korea Heavy Industries &amp; Construction (KHIC). Already a GE steam turbine business associate, KHIC became the 10th gas turbine business associate in January. The deal provides for both companies jointly to manufacture turbines based on GE designs, and also allows GE-designed gas turbines, built solely by KHIC, to be marketed in the Republic of Korea. For Mr Genever-Watling, Korea is part of the industrial world - along with western Europe, North America, Japan, Taiwan and Australia - where the issue for GE is 'execution", holding on to its market shares. He divides most of the rest of the world three ways. South-east Asia is coupled with Mexico as the fastest growth opportunities of the 1990s - requiring the company to 'shift its centre of gravity.' Earlier this year, for example, GE reorganised its international operations, establishing a new GEIPS Asian office in Singapore under Mr Donald Kucza, who has been with GE for 25 years. The Middle East, Turkey and Iran are grouped together as priority lesser-developed markets for selective exports - via business associates, if necessary for political or trade reasons. This leaves what Mr Genever-Watling calls the mega-markets of the year 2,000  -China, India, Eastern Europe and the CIS. Here, he says, the approach needed now is to 'lay foundations.'</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: The great research divide widens - Lagging in R&amp;D Dr George Poste, research director of SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceutical group, and Prof Jurgen Drews, his counterpart at Roche of Switzerland, divide their time almost equally between the US and Europe - reflecting their companies' 50:50 split of R&amp;D facilities on either side of the Atlantic. Both find the scientific infrastructure more hospitable in the US. The most important factor in determining where science-based companies invest in research is the availability of R&amp;D personnel, Dr Poste says. 'I don't think Europe has the same long-term potential as a source of skilled personnel as the US.' Although European universities are widely praised for the quality of their basic research, many industrial scientists say they lag behind their American counterparts in providing a useful service to industry, either as a source of well educated graduates or as a partner in collaborative research projects. All industrial research managers agree that a fundamental handicap for Europe is its political, cultural and economic fragmentation. That makes it harder to mobilise technical resources for large-scale strategic programmes. Dr Frank Carrubba, an American who moved from California to the Netherlands in 1991 to become chief technical officer of Philips, says an important example is the Clinton administration's ambitious programme to stimulate the construction of 'information superhighways' - communications networks that will eventually enable every home and business to receive a wide variety of multimedia electronic services. 'The US is already ahead by 2 1/2 years, if not more, in many areas of multimedia and the information society.' Dr Carrubba says Europeans need to appreciate the extent to which the Clinton programme has galvanised the US electronics and information industries into action. 'There's an incredible political drive behind it, with (Vice-President) Al Gore going from school to school, town meeting to town meeting, taking about information superhighways. The problem is that Europe is not putting this high on the political agenda. There have been some good individual projects here but very few focused efforts.' Europe has had success with focused efforts at high-techcollaboration in the past. One is the European Space Agency whose efforts to develop a reliable satellite launcher have led to a commercial operation in the form of Arianespace, with more than half of the world market. Arguably, Airbus is another in the aerospace field. Research collaboration on a broader front has been gathering pace through the EU Framework programmes. The Fourth Framework Programme will direct 12bn ecu (Pounds 9bn) at a wide range of projects over the next five years, from computing to the life sciences. But as Dr Poste sees it, 'the challenge is to move from a culturally fragmented community to a union that can harness its enormous scientific potential. It is still bedevilled by the need to make sure that everything is spread equally across the community, rather than being directed to where it would do the most good.'</p>

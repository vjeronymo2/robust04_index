			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Greek inflation falls to 10.3% Greece's yearly inflation rate fell to 10.3 per cent in October, from 11.0 per cent the previous month, according to statistics service figures published yesterday. Monthly consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent in November because of higher prices for food, clothes and consumer durables. The government no longer expects to reach its target of single-digit inflation by December but last month's decline, together with delays in raising administered prices, makes it likely inflation can be held below 11 per cent this year, against 12.1 per cent in 1993. Greece's inflation rate is still more than three times the EU average.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Joaquim Chissano is in  Portugal. The Mozambican president came to Lisbon to talk to  President Mario Soares and Prime Minister Cavaco Silva about the  Mozambican peace process. The training of Afonso Dhlakama's  bodyguards by Portuguese experts will also be one of the issues  on the agenda. More details from Sofia Vieira:    [Vieira] Joaquim Chissano is in Lisbon in response to an  invitation by President Mario Soares. This is a brief visit,  during which he will also talk to the prime minister about the  Mozambican peace process. These highest-level meetings follow a  meeting at the weekend in Davos, Switzerland, with Portuguese  Foreign Affairs Minister Durao Barroso.    During this stopover in Lisbon--on his way to Luanda where  he  will be attending a meeting of African leaders--Chissano  stressed the importance of the peace process in his country and  reminded that all processes in southern Africa are interlinked.  Therefore, contact with his Angolan and South African  counterparts is important.    This short visit may also be used for clarifying the case  related to the training of the Renamo leader's bodyguards. The  Mozambican president accused the Portuguese Government of having  provided training in Portugal for Afonso Dhlakama's men.  According to Chissano, this situation is unacceptable because  it goes against the principles contained in the peace agreement.    Another issue that will certainly be discussed at the  meetings with Soares and Cavaco Silva is related to the training  of the future Mozambican Armed Forces. Troop  confinement--particularly that of the Frelimo troops--continues  to delay the peace process, and the UN Security Council has  already warned that it may condemn the Maputo government for its  continuing delay in implementing the agreement.

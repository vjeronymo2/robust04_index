			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: P&amp;O property hint Speculation that P&amp;O was about to announce a huge Pounds 600m property disposal drove the shares sharply forward. They closed 13 ahead at 633p, in strong turnover of 3.2m. US buyers were said to have contributed significantly to that total, with rumours that Quantum Fund was in the market for stock. Quantum, which is owned by Mr George Soros, the billionaire investor, recently established a property vehicle with British Land and talk in the market suggested that this could be the recipient of any deal with P&amp;O. British Land shares finished 9 better at 352p.</p>

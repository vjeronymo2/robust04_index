			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WE ARE READY, DISASTER TEAMS IN L.A. ASSERT  </P> <P> In August, 1987, a little-known commission issued a scorching indictment of Los  Angeles County's preparedness for a major earthquake: The county for years had  neglected its obligation to coordinate the countywide response to the  long-awaited Big One.  </P> <P> Planning had been left to mid-level bureaucrats, the commission said. Some  county departments had no emergency planners at all. The county Disaster  Council rarely met, and most cities took no part in the county's, or even their  neighbors', earthquake drills.  </P> <P> "We just found tremendous gaps in the preparedness . . . and a tremendous lack  of coordination," George A. Morrison, a member of the Emergency Preparedness  Commission, said. "We really couldn't get the attention of the supervisors."  </P> <P> The report -- and the October, 1987, Whittier earthquake -- rattled the county.  The new chief administrative officer, Richard Dixon, began making preparedness  a high priority. Over the last two years, Morrison and others say, Los Angeles  County has made up for lost time.  </P> <P> But the Oct. 17 Bay Area quake has refocused attention on Los Angeles: Would  this county have risen to the occasion as the Bay Area apparently did? Or have  this region's reputed powers of self-delusion left it ill-equipped to face down  a massive disaster?  </P> <P> Los Angeles County and city officials say they are optimistic. They say the  county is as well prepared as the Bay Area -- perhaps better.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, emergency-management specialists have traveled north on  reconnaissance missions in recent weeks, searching in Northern California's  experience for weaknesses in Southern California's plans and how those plans  might be improved.  </P> <P> Among their findings:  </P> <P> * Emergency communications systems in Los Angeles County need to be upgraded to  allow for the possibility that not only telephones but radio systems may fail  in a major quake. Satellite systems may be the only way to avert a  communications breakdown, officials say.  </P> <P> * The Bay Area experience underlined the need for a state-of-the-art "emergency  operations center" from which to coordinate the countywide response. Los  Angeles County is currently without an adequate facility; construction of one  is scheduled to begin in 1991.  </P> <P> * The phenomenon of liquefaction, or ground failure, must be restudied in light  of the collapse of San Francisco's Marina District. Los Angeles city officials  intend to consider whether new controls are needed on the kinds of buildings  constructed on loose soil.  </P> <P> * Southern California cities and counties must develop plans to accommodate the  legions of volunteers who can be expected to offer their services in a  catastrophe. Officials say they had not anticipated the degree of  public-spiritedness that surfaced in the Bay Area.  </P> <P> * Los Angeles County has failed to achieve the degree of cooperation among  cities that will be needed in a catastrophe, several officials said. Without  that coordination, there can be no speedy assessment of damage after a quake,  and no rational allocation of resources.  </P> <P> "Mutual aid is greatly lacking as far as these smaller cities in Los Angeles  County," said Lloyd J. Wood, the Azusa police chief and a member of the  Preparedness Commission. "They just haven't pulled together. It's just, I  think, general apathy on the part of the cities."  </P> <P> "There's an old adage in business that people do well what they believe the  boss is interested in," said one official who asked not to be identified.  "Government people react to elected officials. Elected officials don't care.  (Preparedness) doesn't get them elected."  </P> <P> But many city, county and public utility officials insisted that they came away  from the Bay Area not only impressed by its response to the 7.1-magnitude  quake, but confident that Los Angeles County is equally ready to handle an  emergency of even greater proportions.  </P> <P> "I came away feeling that Los Angeles County is very well prepared," said  Constance Romero, assistant manager of the county's Office of Emergency  Management. "This county has done a great deal of work in the past two years. .  . . I felt good."  </P> <P> "What you will see are spots of brilliant staff work and excellent  communication and . . . spots of poor staff work and poor communication,"  predicted Harry S. Hansen, another Preparedness Commission member, speculating  on how Los Angeles County would respond to a major earthquake. "When they  average out, what you will see is some successes and some problems. It's like  any other kind of emergency."  </P> <P> The gospel guiding each region's earthquake response is its emergency plan -- a  series of massive, multivolume documents required by law and outlining who does  what, and when, in the face of disasters ranging from a tsunami to a nuclear  attack.  </P> <P> San Francisco's plan was last updated Sept. 29. The phone list of vital numbers  was updated in October. Federal and state agencies, utility companies and the  Red Cross have copies. So do all city and county agencies -- from the War  Memorial trustees to the grand jury.  </P> <P> The 5-inch-thick document details the duties of every city department in an  emergency. It includes all laws and regulations that can be invoked. There are  drafts of orders, copies of mutual aid agreements and details for setting up  shelters and assessing damage.  </P> <P> It even includes a checklist for mass burials: Officials are reminded to remove  teeth and collect and tag jewelry for later identification. Instructions on how  to embalm a body quickly, and the importance of covering it before burial, are  also included in the plan.  </P> <P> The plan is tested in a full-scale earthquake drill every April -- marking the  anniversary of the city's 1906 quake. The Fire Department, the lead  emergency-response agency, has been testing its communications system every two  months.  </P> <P> The plan appears to have worked well, San Francisco officials say.  </P> <P> For example, within five minutes of the Oct. 17 quake, every piece of San  Francisco Fire Department equipment was out of its garage. Within three hours,  400 off-duty firefighters living outside the city had checked in and were  reporting for duty.  </P> <P> So many off-duty firefighters reported to work that every fire truck was  carrying at least double its normal complement of workers within hours. That  allowed the department to handle the Marina District fire and 26 others without  calling in extra help.  </P> <P> The average number of fires in the city is 13 in 24 hours.  </P> <P> "Clearly we were tested and the response was magnificent," Mayor Art Agnos said  in an interview. He said the public may be skeptical that government could  design and carry out such a plan. "But it worked," he insisted.  </P> <P> Even so, there were contingencies that the plan failed to anticipate.  </P> <P> Among them, the onslaught of reporters at times created a distraction from the  immediate crisis, Agnos said. City officials ended up calling newspapers and  radio stations and asking that reporters and crews not interview workers  engaged in rescue operations.  </P> <P> City officials also found themselves forced to ban helicopter traffic over the  Marina District after it appeared that vibrations from the innumerable choppers  surveying the damage might increase the likelihood of damaged buildings  collapsing.  </P> <P> The city's plan also did not take into account the anger and desperation of  residents informed that they could not return to damaged homes -- a reaction  that Agnos describes as the "need to re-establish a connection with a house  that is standing but yet is unsafe."  </P> <P> "A person will say, 'My wedding ring is on that table by the window,' and  they're ready to crash through a police barricade to get it," Agnos said. "What  do you do? Shoot them down?"  </P> <P> Some seat-of-the-pants decisions made after the quake will be part of future  plans.  </P> <P> Building-safety officials improvised a now-notorious system of issuing colored  tags to identify safe and unsafe structures. That colored "pass system" will  become a part of San Francisco's emergency plan -- and may make its way into  Los Angeles County's as well.  </P> <P> "That impressed me as a reasonable approach," Ken Weary, disaster services  coordinator for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, said in an  interview. "I've asked people to add that to our plan. That could possibly be a  lesson learned."  </P> <P> But there were far more significant lessons for Los Angeles County, some  officials say.  </P> <P> San Francisco County consists only of the city of San Francisco, but Los  Angeles County includes 85 incorporated cities. Although each city and town may  have emergency-response plans, the county is responsible for overall  coordination and for unincorporated areas.  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles has an elaborate, two-volume plan like San Francisco's,  outlining each department's responsibilities. It also has its own emergency  operations center, mobile communications equipment and regularly scheduled  drills.  </P> <P> Los Angeles city officials say their equipment is far superior to that of San  Francisco and Oakland: They cite tractor-trailers, mobile command posts, and  helicopters equipped with video cameras capable of transmitting pictures  directly to the emergency operations center.  </P> <P> Even so, Shirley Mattingly, director of emergency management for the city,  said, "We will be reassessing our entire plan, every area of it." She said the  Bay Area quake has raised in particular the question of how to restore city  services when city administration buildings are uninhabitable.  </P> <P> "That's going to be a major problem," Mattingly said. "We had considered it,  but we need to spend more time on it. We're not ready. The more that you have  planned and practiced your plan ahead of time, the easier the response comes."  </P> <P> Los Angeles County, meanwhile, has its own 574-page plan outlining a system  that has been upgraded dramatically in recent years. The Board of Supervisors  recently approved funding for a new county emergency operations center to  replace an inadequate, interim center.  </P> <P> There are also plans to replace the county's existing disaster communication  service -- a network of amateur radio volunteers -- with a system of computers  capable of transmitting messages via portable radios in the event that  telephone lines are down.  </P> <P> Other improvements will include video cameras for Sheriff's Department and Fire  Department helicopters, said Capt. Gary Snelson, commander of the sheriff's  emergency operations bureau. Department communications are being improved, with  new frequencies being added to the system.  </P> <P> "We're heading in the right direction," said Snelson. "We've improved so much  over the last three years that there isn't a lot else that we could do."  </P> <P> But George Morrison, one of the architects of the county's emergency-operations  ordinance, said the Bay Area's experience underlined the need for cooperation  between political jurisdictions -- something many say has long been lacking in  Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Without cooperation and mutual aid, it is impossible in an emergency to  efficiently assess the extent of damage and to dispatch limited resources where  they are most needed -- at freeway interchanges, bridges, petrochemical  facilities and other crucial areas.  </P> <P> "The media pretty well determined the focus of the earthquake response in  Northern California because of their ability to get out and assess the damage,"  said Morrison, who stressed that he was not faulting the Bay Area's handling of  the quake.  </P> <P> "As a result, resources were committed on the basis of media reports rather  than the government's assessment of where the need was greatest," he said. Less  populous but badly damaged areas, like Santa Cruz, attracted attention  relatively late.  </P> <P> Others said the Bay Area quake showed them the need for satellite  communications systems in the event that telephone lines and radio towers are  knocked out. Others suggested Los Angeles County could benefit by more heavy  rescue equipment for search-and-rescue operations.  </P> <P> Petty cash must be kept in the gas company's operating districts for covering  expenses in the event of a massive quake, one gas company official said. One  fire official said he was struck by how rescue efforts in the Bay Area strained  Fire Department resources.  </P> <P> Mattingly, director of emergency management for the city of Los Angeles, said  the Bay Area quake reinforced in her mind the need for plans for long-term  economic recovery as well as a new look at the risks of liquefaction.  </P> <P> "We have done a lot in this city on unreinforced buildings," she said. "But I  think we need to reassess what kind of construction is being allowed in the  city on areas that we suspect may be subject to ground failure."  </P> <P> In the end, officials concede, they can only guess how Los Angeles County will  fare.  </P> <P> "You have to understand that in Los Angeles County, you have an immense area,  immense population and over 80 political jurisdictions, each with its own  responsibilities," said Hansen of the county Preparedness Commission.  </P> <P> "To try to meet the immediate effects of a major earthquake, in my opinion, is  going to be extremely difficult no matter how well prepared we are," he said,  "because the complexity of it exceeds anything I am aware of."  </P></p>

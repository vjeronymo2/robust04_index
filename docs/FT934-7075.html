			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Irish PM willing to hold referendum on Ulster Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday gave his clearest assurance yet that he was prepared to submit Dublin's territorial claim over Northern Ireland to a referendum in the republic. But he stressed that such a step, aimed at removing the claim from the Irish constitution, could only be taken in the context of an overall settlement. If put to the electorate now it would be turned down, he warned. In a generally upbeat assessment of the prospects for peace in the province, Mr Reynolds said there was a need for a balanced approach to the Irish problem 'taking on board all the widespread views'. It was for London and Dublin to 'take the initiative and run with it,' he said, stressing the possibility of achieving peace before a political settlement. Interviewed on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Reynolds spoke of his 'excellent rapport' with Mr John Major, who he had always found 'a very reasoned, reliable, competent and commonsense person'. On the referendum question, Mr Reynolds said the 'nationalist identity' as represented by Dublin's territorial claim over Northern Ireland would 'not be thrown away unless we found a new accommodation for both traditions and both identities and both cultures'. If the referendum were put and failed, Mr Reynolds's Fianna Fail party would be handing over the banner of nationalism to Sinn Fein and the IRA who would be seen as the only organisations standing firm on national identity. In a veiled criticism of Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party, Mr Rey-nolds said many unionists understood that fact, but some did not. The DUP is insisting that Dublin's territorial claim be dropped before it returns to the negotiating table. The 200-strong Ulster Unionist Councillors' Association yesterday agreed unanimously its total opposition to any new arrangement that would involve the Dublin government or its agencies in matters of local government in Northern Ireland.</p>

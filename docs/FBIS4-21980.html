			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahim 'Ali] </F>   [Text] Forty-five armed units from Tanta, al-Mansurah, and  Alexandria and 16 armored vehicles have arrived in Asyut and six  vehicles have arrived in al-Minya to strengthen the security  measures against the escalation of the Islamic groups'  activities in the two governorates.    In the first armed confrontation between the people and  terrorism, the inhabitants of Manfalut exchanged fire with three  terrorists who were on their way to hiding on al-Ma'abidah  Island. The three terrorists -- Khalid Quraysh, Muhammad  'Abd-al-'Al, and Sahsah al-Manfaluti -- were killed.    In the ongoing struggle between the governor, the security  organ, and the popular leaderships in the governorate, the  latter are saying that the security organ has set up vigilante  [al-matarid] groups and armed them with modern weapons to chase  and kill the terrorists. They added that the Manfalut operation  was the first one carried out by these groups.    The Islamic Group in al-Minya last Sunday distributed its  first statement in four years. Masked youngsters carrying  swords and axes distributed the statement which declared an end  to the truce agreed on by the Islamic Group and the security  forces. AL-AHALI had published on 26 December 1993 the  agreement between the Islamic Group and the security organ in  al-Minya and Suhaj. Sunday's statement warned that the Islamic  Group will resume the struggle.</p>

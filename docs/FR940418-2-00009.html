			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Calculation Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining the benefits to the subject merchandise from the programs described below, we used the following calculation methodology. We first calculated the benefit attributable to the POI for each countervailable program, using the methodologies described in each program section below. For those subsidies received by ILVA that were allocated over time, we then performed the pass-through analysis discussed in the GIA at 37269. The pass-through analysis accounts for any reduction in ILVA's subsidies that resulted from the sale of several productive units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the subsidies remaining with ILVA, we divided the benefit allocable to the POI by the sales of ILVA or the sales of the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA, depending on which company had received the benefit. (The program sections below indicate which denominator has been used for each program.) Next, we added the benefits for all programs, including the benefits for programs which were not allocated over time, to arrive at ILVA's total subsidy rate. Because ILVA is the only respondent company in this investigation, this rate equals the country-wide rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Programs Determined To Be Countervailable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Benefits Associated With the 1988&hyph;90 Restructuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above under the ``Corporate History'' section of this notice, the GOI liquidated Finsider and its main operating companies in 1988 and assembled the group's most productive assets into a new operating company, ILVA. In 1990, additional assets and liabilities of TAS, Italsider, and Finsider went to ILVA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the preliminary determination, we found that a countervailable benefit was provided to ILVA through the 1988&hyph;1990 restructuring. In reaching this determination, we did not look at the transformation of Finsider as a whole into ILVA. Instead, we focused on the restructuring of TAS into the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA. We found that although TAS' net worth was negative prior to the restructuring, ILVA received a division with assets in excess of liabilities. In effect, TAS' balance sheet was rewritten so as to change its equity from negative 99,886 million lire to positive 317,836 million lire. For the preliminary determination, we treated the difference (417,722 million lire) as a countervailable benefit to ILVA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have reconsidered the methodology employed in the preliminary determination and have revised it for the final determination. We now believe that the approach taken in the preliminary determination understated the benefit to ILVA from the restructuring. It failed to take into account a portion of the liabilities not assumed by ILVA, that would otherwise have had to be repaid, and the losses incurred by TAS in connection with a write down of its assets in the restructuring process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the 1988&hyph;90 restructuring was to create a new, viable steel company (ILVA) by having it take over most of the productive assets of Finsider's operating companies like TAS, but only some of the liabilities. In April 1990, after all of TAS' manufacturing activities had either been transferred or shut down, TAS was nothing but a shell company in the process of liquidation, with liabilities exceeding its assets. ILVA, on the other hand, had received most of TAS' assets without being burdened by TAS' liabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The liabilities remaining with TAS through the restructuring process had to be repaid, assumed, or forgiven. We have identified one specific instance of forgiveness. This occurred in 1989 when Finsider forgave 99,886 million lire of debt owed to it by TAS. Even with this forgiveness, TAS retained a substantial amount of liabilities after the 1990 transfer of assets and liabilities to ILVA. While no specific act eliminated this debt_indeed some of it is still outstanding_we believe that ILVA (and consequently the subject merchandise) received a benefit as a result of the debt being left behind in TAS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we learned at verification that losses had been left behind in TAS, because the value of the assets transferred to ILVA had been written down. TAS gave up assets whose book value was higher than their appraised value. As a result, TAS was forced to absorb losses. The loss from the first transfer was reflected as an extraordinary loss in TAS' 1988 Annual Report. With respect to the 1990 transfer, TAS had created a reserve in 1989 for the anticipated loss. At verification, we found that this loss was included in the liabilities that were left in TAS after the 1990 transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, in restructuring TAS into the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA, liabilities and losses due to asset write downs were left behind in TAS, a shell company. Although there was only one specific act of debt forgiveness, which only covered a portion of the liabilities in TAS, we believe that ILVA received a benefit when it was able to leave the debt and losses remaining in TAS. Because this benefit was specific to ILVA, we find a countervailable subsidy to ILVA in the amount of the debt and losses that should have been taken by ILVA when it took on the assets of TAS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

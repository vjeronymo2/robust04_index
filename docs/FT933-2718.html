			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Venables hits out at BBC Spurs claims MR TERRY VENABLES, the former chief executive of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, last night criticised the BBC over its decision to run a special edition of its Panorama programme which alleged that he improperly obtained Pounds 1m to help him buy shares in the club. The programme also claimed that he and his advisers engaged in a series of business malpractices including nightclubs, printing and boardgames, and that there were irregularities in the transfer of England soccer star Paul Gascoigne from Spurs to the Italian club Lazio. Mr Venables, who was sacked by Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Spurs and of the electronics company Amstrad, is suing for wrongful dismissal. Last night Mr Venables said: 'It is most regrettable that despite being in discussion with the producers of Panorama, they failed to inform me of their decision to broadcast this programme tonight.' The Panorama investigation claimed that Mr Venables had raised Pounds 1m by using one of his former companies, Transatlantic Inns. Two months after resigning as a director he used its assets in a sale and lease-back operation with another company, Landhurst Leasing. The assets were the fixtures and fittings of three pubs leased by Transatlantic Inns. They, together with another public house, which cannot be traced, raised Pounds 1m. The programme claimed this money was paid to Mr Venables' company Edennote and some of it then used for the purchase of shares in Spurs. The programme also investigated the Gascoigne transfer. Mr Venables has said he pushed up the transfer price from Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 6.3m with the help of Mr Gino Santin, a London restaurateur. However, Mr Giancarlo Guerra, Lazio's finance director, told Panorama that the deal was reached six months before Mr Santin was involved and the offer was not increased. The fee of Pounds 200,000 to Mr Santin was paid to a Swiss company. Late last night Mr Mark Stephens, Mr Venables' solicitor, issued a statement condemning the Panorama programme as 'wickedly ill-informed' and 'screened with reckless haste'. 'The programme failed to comply with the BBC's own guidelines to producers and did not provide Mr Venables with the opportunity to respond to the partisan and flagrantly untrue allegations,' he said. 'Nor did it broadcast the statement given by him to the BBC.' The BBC said: 'Panorama asked Terry Venables to comment but he declined the programme's normal conditions of interview.'</p>

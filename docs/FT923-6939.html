			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Bush tax pledge to spur economy PRESIDENT George Bush last night dangled the prospect next year of tax cuts before the Republican party convention, many of whose members have been demanding radical action to get the economy moving. But the president is also insisting that tax cuts be tied to commensurate reduction in federal spending, so as not to increase a budget deficit currently approaching Dollars 400bn (Pounds 207bn) a year. Mr Bush set out the tax cut initiative in a speech that was billed as the climax of the four-day convention and as the launching pad for his fight to save his presidency. His address coincided with opinion polls suggesting he has narrowed the lead held by Mr Bill Clinton, his Democratic challenger in the November 3 presidential election. One poll showed he was lagging just 11 points behind, against 18 last week. Mr Bush's proposals were outlined to reporters just before the president went to the podium. He accused the Democrat-controlled Congress of frustrating his attempts to spur the economy along. He also warned voters of the dangers of electing 'a rubber cheque congress and a rubber stamp president'. Mr Bush drew a sharp contrast between the vision offered by the Democrats and the vision offered by his own party. 'Theirs is to look inward and protect what we already have,' he said. 'Ours is to look forward - to open new markets, prepare our people to compete, to restore the social fabric, to save and invest so we can win.' Beyond the qualified commitment to cutting taxes the president also revived three earlier proposals - a cap on mandatory spending, a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and the right to veto specific congressional legislation that meets his disapproval. Mr Bush made it clear he would not act until Congress reconvened in January. His tax cut initiative is therefore dependent on his re-election and, assuming the Democrats retain control of Congress, cannot even then be assured of passage in the form Mr Bush would like. The final two days of the convention have been devoted to building up the image of George Bush as a man of unquestioned integrity and experience. Mr Clinton, meanwhile, again took exception to Republican attacks on his wife. But polls released last night suggested the incessant attacks on Mr Clinton and his wife were having some effect. A CBS News poll taken on Tuesday and Wednesday showed Bush creeping to within 11 points of Mr Clinton compared with an 18-point gap last week. A nationwide survey by the Hotline political newsletter and the Houston Chronicle showed Mr Bush trailing Mr Clinton by just five points, compared with a 16 per cent deficit when the Republican convention got under way. A Washington Post/ABC survey, concluded on Tuesday night, had Mr Clinton ahead by 57 per cent to 32 per cent among registered voters, a margin that had changed little over the past month.

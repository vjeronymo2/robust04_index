			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Carmakers diverge as Germany loses impetus - How Daimler and Volkswagen characterise the change in Frankfurt sentiment It was only in January this year that Prof Ekkehard Wenger, a professor in business studies at the university of Wurzburg in northern Bavaria and a noted shareholder activist, launched a wholly unsuccessful attempt to get rid of Mercedes Holdings. At the company's annual meeting, the full might of the German corporate and financial establishment combined to prevent the dissolution of MAH, a company which had no raison d'etre but to hold a 25.23 per cent stake in Daimler-Benz and act as a block to an unfriendly takeover. Prof Wenger may have lost the vote; but he won the argument. Eleven days ago, Daimler said it had reached agreement to get rid of MAH by the end of the year. Shares in MAH - which has a separate stock-market listing and has nothing to do with the Mercedes-Benz car manufacturing company - are to be converted into Daimler-Benz shares on a one-for-one basis. The move was clearly connected with the announcement earlier in the week that Daimler had reached agreement with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission over the terms of a listing for its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. In future, Daimler will present its accounts according to US rules, thereby publishing more financial information than is usual for German companies. The first effect of the announcement was to cause a sharp drop in the Daimler share price and a correspondingly sharp increase in the MAH price. MAH shares have traditionally had a 20 to 25 discount to the Daimler shares, reflecting MAH shareholders' lack of a direct vote in Daimler. This discount shrunk significantly over the course of a few days, while the Daimler share price was unsettled on fears that some large holdings in MAH were now up for sale. But Daimler moves can still be interpreted as positive for investors in the German market. By abandoning an antiquated ownership structure, which was put together in 1975 to prevent the Shah of Iran buying the bulk of the 39 per cent Daimler stake owned by the industrialist, Mr Karl Friedrich Flick, Daimler is responding to the expectations of international, performance oriented investors. It may thereby set a trend which may encourage other German companies to pay more than lip-service to the notion of 'shareholder-value'. As Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the board director of Deutsche Bank responsible for corporate finance, commented a few weeks ago, 'shareholder value' ought to mean aggressive management of assets according to strict financial criteria - not just public relations designed to talk up the share price. Similarly, the New York listing should ensure that management action will become more open to market scrutiny than ever before. Other German companies will be obliged to follow suit, if they want to raise equity capital on as favourable terms as Daimler, with direct access to the investment resources of US institutions, may one day achieve. For Daimler, this means that financial performance may take on a higher priority than in past years when a massive expansion programme coincided with earnings stagnation, and worse. How much worse became clear on Tuesday this week when Daimler announced its expected drop in profits from DM1.94bn in 1991 to DM1.45bn for 1992  - and Mr Edzard Reuter, chief executive, said that they would fall as low as DM1bn in the current year as the downturn in the automobile industry gathers pace. 'The company is on the verge of ruin,' commented Mr Roland Fieber, German equities analyst at Rhine Securities in Frankfurt. 'It is facing its biggest challenge in its post-war history.' Other companies are facing equally severe challenges, including Volkswagen, Europe's largest car manufacturer. The difference for investors is that VW's shares have risen by 6 per cent since the group announced a collapse in group earnings in the middle of last month, whilst Daimler's shares, down nearly 10 per cent over a similar period, are still reeling from bad earnings news and the initial effects of the Mercedes merger. VW's appointment of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, snatched from arch-rival General Motors, has helped to persuade investors that chief executive Mr Ferdinand Piech is deadly serious about cutting costs, the only way to restore the group to prosperity. At VW, investors are taking a lot on trust - an observation which holds true for the market as a whole. Even after its recent correction, the DAX index has climbed by 16.6 per cent since last autumn, from a low of 1,420.30 on October 6, through a peak of more than 1,717.30 last month, to 1,655.73 last Thursday. It has achieved this with little support from corporate fundamentals. Interest rates have indeed fallen steeply over this period, but any impact that this may have on the corporate sector is likely to be long delayed: at present all indications are that the recession is likely to be deeper and to last longer than expected. UBS in Frankfurt predicts that earnings at the industrial companies within the DAX 30 index will fall by 17 per cent this year after a drop of 16 per cent this year. At current levels the market is on a prospective multiple of around 20 times current year earnings. This compares with a long-term market multiple of around 11 per cent and a five-year average of 15 per cent. Assuming earnings rebound next year by a quarter, the market is still on 16 times earnings. 'There is a danger that all the stimuli expected for 1993 as a whole have been played out in the first quarter,' cautions Mr Sy Schluter at CSFB in Frankfurt. 'It has become entirely a stock-picking market.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 9 (XINHUA) -- China's leading  industrial center has made progress in industrial technology.    A municipal official in charge of industry said that  Shanghai's pillar industries are burgeoning.    The city recorded a motor vehicle sales volume of 30.6  billion yuan-worth last year, and its telecommunications  services generated 1.667 billion yuan in profits and taxes.    Last year Shanghai produced power station equipment  totalling  three million kw.    While developing new- and high-tech products, enterprises  speeded up the pace of their technical transformation.    A survey shows that the investment in this field last year  was 73 percent more than in the previous year.    The upgraded projects generated an additional of 585 million  yuan in output value and 100 million yuan in profits and taxes  and helped save foreign exchange worth 6.65 million U.S. dollars.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] While political parties have been engaged in the  final coordination of selecting a successor to outgoing Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted a  nationwide opinion poll on 16-17 April to sound out the trend of  public support for "Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata" and the  people's view on various issues, including Hosokawa's  resignation announcement. A majority of the respondents  indicated support for "Prime Minister Hata." For example, 61  percent said they would "support" Hata if he becomes the next  premier, while only 21 percent said they would "not support"  him. As for Hosokawa's resignation announcement, 60 percent of  the respondents said "he is irresponsible"; this number exceeded  the proportion of those who said "he acted with good grace in  announcing his intention to step down." These results indicate  the people's strong criticism of Hosokawa for suddenly giving up  the administration. At the same time, 57 percent of the  respondents said they "wanted Hosokawa to remain in power."  This number exceeded by 20 points the 37 percent of respondents  who said "there was a good reason for him to step down,"  indicating Hosokawa is still popular among people. In addition,  65 percent spoke highly of the achievements made by the Hosokawa  administration during the past eight months.    The 61 percent support rate for Hata is high, exceeding the  nonsupport rate by 40 points. We cannot compare it with the  support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet because the figure is not  an actual support rate for a Hata cabinet. However, it is  higher than the support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet (55.1  percent) in the survey conducted last March. Thus, the poll  revealed the strong hopes the people place on "Prime Minister  Hata."    Moreover, regarding the question of "who is the most  appropriate person to be the next prime minister?" Hata ranked  highest with a 37-percent approval rating. This compared with  12 percent for former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe of  the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], who was regarded as a  probable candidate at the time of the poll. These ratings are  followed by 7 percent for former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu  and 4 percent each for Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura, LDP Policy Research Council Chairman Ryutaro  Hashimoto, and LDP President Yohei Kono.    As for the most desirable composition of the next  government,  respondents answered as follow: 1) an administration composed  of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, the Japan New  Party, and a portion of the LDP (28 percent of the respondents);  2) the same administration led by the current coalition,  excluding the LDP and the Japan Communist Party (21 percent);  3) an administration composed of the Social Democratic Party of  Japan, the Democratic Socialist Party, Sakigake [Harbinger], and  a portion of the LDP (15 percent); and 4) an administration  composed mainly of the LDP (14 percent).    In response to Hosokawa's resignation announcement, 60  percent said "it was irresponsible" while 35 percent said "he  acted with good grace."    Regarding accomplishments made during the past eight months  of the Hosokawa administration, 65 percent of the respondents  said "it can be highly evaluated" while 31 percent said "it  cannot." As specific achievements to be noted, 37 percent said  "the Hosokawa government put an end to the LDP one-party  administration"; 34 percent cited "it raised people's political  consciousness"; and another 34 percent said "it enacted  political reform-related bills."    On the other hand, the poll also revealed the people's  negative attitude towards the Hosokawa administration.  Criticism was mostly centered on Hosokawa's lack of decisive  policies and power struggles within the administration. For  example, 35 percent of the respondents said "Hosokawa often  retracted his decisions on important issues"; 33 percent noted  "Shinseito coleader Ichiro Ozawa had too much influence upon the  administration"; and 32 percent said "there were too many  discords and conflicts within the administration."</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> GERMANY TO FIGHT SPORTS DOPING  </P> <P> Top German sports officials said today that drug testing will be radically  stepped up in all sports, following allegations of massive doping by German  athletes.  </P> <P> Hans Hansen, president of the German Sports Federation, outlined a 12-point  program to combat drug use following a more than three-hour meeting of sports  officials in the German capital.  </P> <P> Hansen told a news conference that the federation would not wait for  international recommendations to fight the use of drugs, but would seek to play  an active role in cleaning up German sports.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a prominent judge was appointed to head an independent commission  that will investigate published allegations that many top stars in former East  Germany, as well as some track and field athletes from former West Germany,  regularly took performance-enhancing drugs. Heinrich Reiter, the 60-year-old  president of the federal social court, will head the commission.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Personal savings continued  growing slowly amid lower incomes and interest rates, with the  end-March outstanding balance rising 4.8 percent from a year  earlier, the Bank of Japan [BOJ] said Friday [24 June] in a  preliminary quarterly report.    The balance came to 882.44 trillion yen, an increase of 3.23  trillion yen in the January-March quarter, compared with the  2.56 trillion yen gain for the same period a year earlier, the  central bank said.    The 4.8 percent yearly growth was marginally higher than a  record low growth of 4.7 percent at the end of the previous  October-December quarter.    The March figure brought to an end the  eight-straight-quarter  streak of slower growth, a bank official said.    But it is still hard to say if the trend has turned upward,  the official said, noting the growth remained relatively small,  compared with the 6.6 percent annual increase at the end of  March 1992 when the current weak trend began.    Asked about the outlook for the April-June period, the  official said only that the balance may not decline further but  is also unlikely to grow rapidly.    The balance of personal savings at banks rose 3.6 percent  from a year earlier to 215.85 trillion yen with a decrease in  the reporting quarter of 1.94 trillion yen, compared with the  year-earlier fall of 2.63 trillion yen.    The postal savings balance rose 7.7 percent to 183.10  trillion yen with a quarterly increase of 2.22 trillion yen,  down from a 3.01 trillion yen increase the previous year.    Savings in products offered by trust banks declined 20.1  billion yen during the first quarter of 1994, compared with a  295.4 billion yen rise a year earlier, while the balance grew  3.3 percent to 49.67 trillion yen.    Investment in public and corporate bonds gained 1.6 billion  yen, up from the year-earlier decline of 2.43 trillion yen, but  the balance posted a 3.4 percent fall to 39.51 trillion yen.    Investment trusts dropped by 1.05 trillion yen, compared  with  the 1.02 trillion yen fall a year earlier, and the balance  declined 6.9 percent to 34.27 trillion yen.    The balance of insurance savings climbed 8.7 percent to  204.70 trillion yen with an increase of 4.58 trillion yen in the  quarter, down from the year-before 5.30 trillion yen gain.</p>

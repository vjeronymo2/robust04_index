			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON STING TAPE, CARPENTER TELLS OF PUSHING BILL  </P> <P> In secretly recorded conversations with an undercover FBI agent, then-state  Sen. Paul B. Carpenter describes playing a crucial role in Senate passage of a  1986 special-interest bill that was the centerpiece of a federal sting  operation, according to transcripts obtained by The Times.  </P> <P> On the tapes, the onetime Democratic lawmaker from Norwalk talks of  orchestrating the movement of the measure through the Senate, picking the state  senator who carried the bill on the floor and prodding to get action before  time ran out on the 1986 legislative session.  </P> <P> Carpenter, who received $20,000 in campaign contributions from a phony company  set up by the FBI for the sting, is scheduled to go on trial next month on  federal extortion, racketeering and conspiracy charges.  </P> <P> Three of the four counts against him are based on allegations that in return  for payments he used his office to help the bogus company, which was seeking  passage of a bill to secure financing for a shrimp-processing plant near  Sacramento.  </P> <P> Both state and federal laws prohibit lawmakers from accepting payments in  exchange for official actions. A legislator may accept campaign contributions  from private companies and individuals with an interest in legislation, as long  as there is no understanding that the contribution is a payment for the  lawmaker's action.  </P> <P> The tapes, which are likely to be part of the evidence presented at Carpenter's  trial, record the former senator describing an extensive, behind-the-scenes  role in support of the bill.  </P> <P> The tapes alone do not show that Carpenter acted in return for payment, but  they do portray the undercover agent seeking Carpenter's assistance as an  influential lawmaker -- and Carpenter responding.  </P> <P> At one point, when the agent expressed concern that another senator's  unexpected interest could impede passage of the shrimp bill, Carpenter  reassured him, "Every time a little fire like that, ah, comes up, we try and  stamp on it."  </P> <P> Carpenter, now a member of the powerful State Board of Equalization, could not  be reached for comment.  </P> <P> But Carpenter's press aide, Jerry Goldberg, said, "Never even once did  Carpenter speak to a (Senate) member or to a staff person in support of the  bill." But the same spokesman acknowledged that Carpenter had talked to the  Assembly author of the bill and that Carpenter did speak with one senator,  Leroy Greene (D-Sacramento), who presented the bill in the Senate.  </P> <P> Goldberg also denied that Carpenter played any role in choosing Greene to carry  the legislation.  </P> <P> But in conversations with undercover agent John E. Brennan II -- who pretended  to be businessman Jack Gordon -- Carpenter often spoke of being an active  participant, shepherding the bill along once it reached the Senate. As Gordon,  Brennan was posing as president of Gulf Shrimp Fisheries Inc. of Mobile, Ala.,  which was seeking legislative help to finance a processing plant near  Sacramento.  </P> <P> In one conversation on Aug. 14, 1986, Brennan expressed concern about who would  carry the measure when it reached the Senate floor for a vote, and Carpenter  assured him that he would take care of it.  </P> <P> Asked Brennan: "Ah, do you have an opinion yet on who'd be the best to manage  it on the floor, take it up?"  </P> <P> Replied Carpenter: "Ah, no, but ah, let me work on that this afternoon."  </P> <P> On a later tape, after the bill passed the Senate, Carpenter told Brennan that  Greene had given him "some concern" because he was slow to move the bill and  was "hard to push."  </P> <P> "He finally told me to get off his ass," Carpenter said.  </P> <P> But Greene said in an interview Friday that he had no recollection of a  conversation "at any time . . . with Paul Carpenter or anything in connection  with the 'shrimp-scam' measure."  </P> <P> Carpenter's attorney, Gerard J. Hinckley, said that the tapes are deceiving  because his client was often responding out of politeness to Brennan's  unrealistic concerns.  </P> <P> "Carpenter doesn't want to say, 'Hey, you're full of crap,' " Hinckley said,  when in fact the bill had virtually no opposition and was likely to pass easily  without any intervention.  </P> <P> In the past, Carpenter has pointed out that he did not even vote for the  measure, which was authored by Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> Hinckley said that the tapes should prove useful in convincing a jury of his  client's innocence.  </P> <P> Nowhere in the transcripts of six meetings between Carpenter and the undercover  agent did the lawmaker solicit payments or indicate that his support of the  bill required contributions.  </P> <P> And the tapes show that on Sept. 23, 1986, Carpenter pointedly refused to  accept a campaign contribution from the undercover agent in the Capitol, which  would be a direct violation of state law. "I can't take the check in the  building," the lawmaker said.  </P> <P> He also spurned a cashier's check, contending that the payment was tantamount  to cash. Cash contributions of $100 or more are prohibited, but cashier's  checks are permitted as long as the donor is clearly identified.  </P> <P> After refusing to take a check in the Capitol, Carpenter accompanied Brennan to  lunch at Frank Fat's, a popular bar and restaurant a few blocks from the  Capitol. Both on the way and in the restaurant, Brennan continued his secret  recording of their conversation, much of it idle chit-chat.  </P> <P> After the meal, just before ordering a piece of banana cream pie, "Gordon"  wrote out a check to Carpenter for $5,000 -- the last of three checks totaling  $20,000 to the senator, who was then campaigning for a seat on the Board of  Equalization, which administers business taxes in the state. Later, Carpenter  reported the payments from the company to his campaign committee, as required  under the California Political Reform Act.  </P> <P> But in an earlier conversation, on Aug. 11, 1986, Carpenter appeared to be  receptive to a suggestion from the phony businessman that contributions be  laundered through a cousin living in Los Angeles. Hiding a contribution by  sending it through another party would have violated the state campaign  reporting law.  </P> <P> Said the FBI's Brennan: "Um, I'd like to make a contribution at a later date,  but I'm gonna . . . if, just, so I don't get identified. Have that come through  uh . . . a separate entity. Uh, I have a cousin from Los Angeles and I'll just,  uh, if that's OK with you. Do it that way. So there's no problem."  </P> <P> Carpenter: "Whatever uh . . . "  </P> <P> Brennan: "Let you know this, that I'm . . . "  </P> <P> Carpenter: "Sure."  </P> <P> Hinckley said that Carpenter was again only replying politely and would never  have gone along with such an arrangement, nor was such a contribution ever  made.  </P> <P> Earlier in the same conversation, recorded on the street outside the Capitol,  Carpenter told Brennan that the bill could run into difficulty if then-state  Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh became aware of it.  </P> <P> Said Carpenter: "Our, our problem, I think, is gonna be with uh, Unruh . . .  and we're gonna have to go over . . . and stroke him and . . . "  </P> <P> Brennan responded by saying that he hoped the treasurer's office didn't  represent "a great problem."  </P> <P> But Carpenter assured him, "That, that's what I do. I solve problems."  </P> <P> In a subsequent conversation, the two men discussed amendments that would have  delayed the bill but, according to Carpenter, "would have made the, uh,  treasurer a lot happier."  </P> <P> But Carpenter offered the supposed businessman hope for passage without waiting  for amendments. " . . . I get it off the floor and get it onto the governor's  desk before, uh, Jesse Unruh knows what is happening," Carpenter said.  </P> <P> Throughout the tapes, Brennan played to the hilt the part of the gregarious  Southern businessman trying to win a special break to help finance the  shrimp-processing plant, but constantly worrying about complications that would  sink the legislation.  </P> <P> On the day the bill reached the Senate, just before its first committee vote,  Brennan expressed concern about problems from Senate Democrats and talked of  having "to do something" for members of the Senate Democratic caucus.  </P> <P> Carpenter responded: "Well, I thought I would take care of that." Then he  pointed out, "Uh, there are a number of different, uh, individuals that uh, uh,  who are, have races that uh and . . . fortuitously sit on the committee."  </P> <P> A few days later, after the bill has been unanimously approved by the Senate  Banking and Commerce Committee, Brennan learned that Sen. Alan Robbins' office  had made an inquiry about the bill.  </P> <P> "Ah, that's something you're taking care of, isn't it?" Brennan asked  Carpenter.  </P> <P> "Right," Carpenter assured him.  </P> <P> In a recent interview, Robbins said he cannot recall inquiring about the 1986  Gulf Shrimp bill.  </P> <P> The Tarzana Democrat is himself a subject of the ongoing federal investigation  of political corruption in the Capitol, according to several sources familiar  with the probe. That investigation has already led to the conviction of former  state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who recently began serving a 6  1/2-year sentence at the federal prison camp near Boron.  </P> <P> But Robbins has pointed out that, unlike Montoya and Carpenter, he took no  payments from the undercover investigators.  </P> <P> The Carpenter transcripts provide insights into the FBI sting operation as well  as the inner workings of the Legislature.  </P> <P> After the measure had been approved by both houses of the Legislature, Brennan  told Carpenter that until he paid $1,000 to attend a lavish fund-raiser for  Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), Gulf Shrimp had trouble  getting its proposal before lawmakers.  </P> <P> "I was told I had to go to that," Brennan tells Carpenter on the tapes. "The  next week a bill was found that I could use, so it worked out very well."  </P> <P> A month after the Brown contribution, a previously introduced bill was stripped  of its contents and Brennan's bill was put in its place.  </P> <P> Brown's campaign committee reported receiving a check for $1,000 from Gulf  Shrimp Fisheries Inc. for two tickets to his May 12, 1986, fund-raiser. Brown  has never been identified as a subject of the federal sting operation.  </P> <P> The sting bill received final legislative approval on Aug. 29, 1986, only to be  vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian, who had been tipped off by the FBI. A similar  bill by Assemblywoman Moore won passage in 1988 and was also vetoed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Former Sen. Paul Carpenter (D-Norwalk) is the second state elected official to  be indicted as a result of an elaborate federal sting operation, in which  undercover FBI agents posed as Southern businessmen seeking favors from the  Legislature. The sting -- code-named BRISPEC (Bribery -- Special Interest) --  came to light in August, 1988, when about 30 federal agents armed with search  warrants raided several offices in the state Capitol. Ex-Sen. Joseph B. Montoya  (D-Whittier), who was caught up in the sting, has begun serving a 6 1/2-year  prison sentence while appealing his conviction on seven counts of extortion,  racketeering and money laundering. Sources familiar with BRISPEC say that  indictments of other elected officials are likely after Carpenter's trial,  scheduled to begin Aug. 13.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A LITTLE FIRE'  </P> <P>  This is an excerpt from a secretly recorded telephone conversation between  undercover FBI Agent John E. Brennan II and then-Sen. Paul Carpenter on Aug.  14, 1986. Brennan, posing as Alabama businessman Jack Gordon, is discussing the  progress of a bill he is sponsoring and Carpenter is supporting. The bill was  authored by Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> Brennan: Ah, I was down in, ah, Assemblywoman Moore's office and talking to her  chief of staff and he indicated there has been an inquiry from Sen. (Alan)  Robbins' office about my, maybe needing to do something there. Ah, that's  something you're taking care of, isn't it?  </P> <P> Carpenter: Right.  </P> <P> Brennan: OK. I don't need to respond to that then.  </P> <P> Carpenter: Right.  </P> <P> Brennan: Very good. Things are looking good, huh?  </P> <P> Carpenter: So far so good. Every time a little fire like that, ah, comes up, we  try and stamp on it.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> DEATH ROW INMATES -- GROWING NUMBERS STRAINING THE SYSTEM  </P> <P> As the warden of San Quentin prison, Daniel Vasquez has the legal  responsibility to carry out all sentences of death in California.  </P> <P> Toward that end, he has tested the 51-year-old gas chamber to make sure it  works and selected an execution team. He even has a good idea of who is most  likely to die in California's first execution since 1967.  </P> <P> But despite a state Supreme Court that regularly affirms death sentences,  Vasquez has no idea when he will be called upon to follow through on a death  sentence. It could be later this year. It may be years from now.  </P> <P> After spending half a dozen years as San Quentin's warden and therefore in  charge of California's condemned population, Vasquez is philosophical about it  all. "What is imminent?" the warden asked. "Does such a word exist for  condemned inmates?"  </P> <P> The reality is that executions remain a "far-off concept" in California, he  said. California is not alone. Nearly all states with a Death Row face the same  situation: People are being sentenced to death at a rate of 250 a year  throughout the country, yet fewer and fewer executions are taking place.  </P> <P> As a result, an unprecedented 2,200 condemned inmates are straining prisons in  most of the 34 states that have a Death Row. Questions of morality and fine  legal points aside, some prison experts have started to wonder whether capital  punishment is more trouble than it is worth.  </P> <P> "From what I can tell, the courts, whether right or wrong, aren't allowing the  states to enforce it. The issue is: If it's not going to be enforced what is  the point?" asked Scott M. Wallace, a death penalty expert at the American  Correctional Assn., which represents prison officials and staff.  </P> <P> Opponents of capital punishment long have used the argument that the death  penalty should be abolished because it clogs the criminal justice system. Now,  a National Institute of Justice-funded report prepared by the American  Correctional Assn. may bolster that argument.  </P> <P> The report does not take a position on the death penalty. But it cites an array  of problems wrought by the growing number of Death Row inmates:  </P> <P> * The rising condemned population is "the primary concern of the 40 wardens  surveyed" in the report. Several states plan to move condemned inmates to  expanded rows at new or remodeled prisons to ease overcrowding.  </P> <P> * Wardens believe that there will be more executions in future years, making  Death Row prisoners more desperate. In response, officials have tightened  security to protect their staffs and to guard against escapes.  </P> <P> * At the same time, the number of executions has dropped in every year since  1981, when there were 21 state-sanctioned killings. There were 11 last year.  Eight executions so far this year suggest that another year will pass with the  logjam firmly in place.  </P> <P> * Acting on behalf of prisoners who are spending increasing numbers of years on  Death Row, prisoners' rights lawyers have filed at least 23 major lawsuits over  prison conditions.  </P> <P> Inmates have litigated over the right to marry, receive visits from wives that  include limited physical contact, have more access to better law libraries,  spend more time on exercise yards and to not undergo body cavity searches.  </P> <P> To fend off such suits, correctional officials create procedures to deal in the  most minute detail with the condemned inmates' lives, specifying everything  from the number of showers they may take to the number of blankets issued.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Housing Standards  </P> <P> Condemned prisoners have won court orders that establish housing standards in  six states, including California. Violations of the court-enforced agreements,  generally called consent decrees, can result in contempt citations against the  states.  </P> <P> "Consent decrees add a great deal of work and trouble to the staff because they  give more rights to the inmates. It increases their workload. They have to be  more careful," said Wallace, who was editor of the American Correction Assn.  report titled "Management of Death Row Inmates."  </P> <P> In California, Department of Corrections officials represented by the state  attorney general have launched a broad attack to dismantle this state's Death  Row consent decree. The decree, signed in 1980, sought to settle a sweeping  suit over conditions on San Quentin's Death Row.  </P> <P> San Quentin's Death Row meets all "minimum" constitutional requirements, Deputy  Atty. Gen. John Donhoff argues. The settlement that was struck when there were  40 condemned inmates no longer applies, he says, now that there are 259  condemned men.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Request Being Considered  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Stanley Weigel, who oversees the decree, is considering the  request. It's "not highly likely" Weigel will set aside the Death Row  settlement, said Deputy Atty. Gen. Kristofer Jorstad, in charge of the prison  law section in the attorney general's office. But he said the state intends to  pursue the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.  </P> <P> "It places restrictions on them (the prison). They'd prefer to not have any  restrictions," said Sallyanne Campbell of the Prison Law Office, which filed  the Death Row suit in 1979 on behalf of six original Death Row inmates and  attempts to force the state to comply with its provisions.  </P> <P> As it is, each new condemned inmate receives a copy of the decree upon his  arrival. Officers assigned to the row go through training courses that cover  points in the settlement.  </P> <P> The 20-page document specifies the amount of time inmates may spend out of  their cells, the educational opportunities available, the types of clothing  they can wear, the furnishings their cells must have and all other aspects of  life on Death Row.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Broad Authority  </P> <P> Weigel in 1985 appointed Robert Riggs, his former law clerk, to act as monitor  of the decree. Riggs has broad authority to visit the prison, convene hearings  to investigate conditions, and he makes recommendations to Weigel. At Weigel's  direction, the state pays Riggs $100 an hour, a raise over the $75 an hour he  received when he started.  </P> <P> The state signed the agreement hoping to end what promised to be drawn-out  litigation. Instead, there has been continuous wrangling. The case fills 20  volumes in the federal courthouse in San Francisco.  </P> <P> As the condemned population grows, Vasquez is chafing under the settlement. He  said that while many of its provisions are reasonable, "the safety of this  institution" would be threatened if he followed each aspect of the decree.  </P> <P> The question of restraints continues to rankle the warden. When he became San  Quentin's warden in 1983, officers, as the settlement mandated, could not place  handcuffs on prisoners when they escorted inmates to the visiting room.  </P> <P> But Vasquez is convinced that when voters ousted Chief Justice Rose Bird in  1986, prisoners concluded that they had a worse chance of winning reversals and  became more of an escape threat. He decided that his officers should start  using restraints whenever they moved prisoners.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deal Was Reached  </P> <P> But first, he had to negotiate with prisoners' lawyers. A deal was reached:  Vasquez could use restraints, but inmates who had the money could buy electric  typewriters with enough memory to store about 10 pages of material.  </P> <P> The typewriters pose no particular security threat. Still, Vasquez does not  believe that he should have to had to negotiate over what he sees as a basic  safety measure.  </P> <P> "That is how dangerous and ludicrous that kind of a system is," he said.  </P> <P> More recently, prisoners' lawyers asked that Riggs recommend that the state be  held in contempt of court for failing to let them out of their cells to mingle  inside their cellblock. At the time the consent decree was signed, San Quentin  still used the original Death Row. Its design allowed for out-of-cell time. But  the population long since has outgrown that tier.  </P> <P> The cost of creating a similar design in East Block, where most condemned  inmates are housed now, would be $100 million, officials say. Inmates' lawyers  contend that the figure is vastly inflated, and that it could be done with  minimal cost.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prisoners Moved  </P> <P> Corrections officials acknowledge that San Quentin's turn-of-the-century design  is less than ideal for housing the highest-security inmates, those on Death  Row.  </P> <P> The department has moved maximum-security prisoners who are not condemned to  new prisons in the state. About 2,800 medium- and minimum-security inmates are  imprisoned at San Quentin now.  </P> <P> With the condemned population nearing 300, the Department of Corrections is  considering alternatives to San Quentin and East Block. Vasquez submitted a  proposal to the department in February. The department hopes to come up with a  plan later this year, said Deputy Director Robert Denninger, in charge of  institutions.  </P> <P> If all of East Block were used for the condemned, there would be cells for 500  inmates. But the consent decree requires that the prison give prisoners 29 3/4  hours of outside exercise time a week. And with 500 inmates in East Block,  there could be a shortage of exercise yards, noted James L. Park, consultant to  the joint legislative committee on prison construction and former associate  warden at San Quentin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suggestions Offered  </P> <P> Some planners have suggested building a prison specifically for condemned  prisoners on vacant land at San Quentin. Some have suggested moving them to one  or more of the recently built high-security prisons.  </P> <P> Before Death Row can be moved, state law, which mandates that it be at San  Quentin, would have to be changed. Such a change in the law would result in  hearings likely to elicit an emotional debate over capital punishment.  </P> <P> "Are we willing to budget a million dollars to relocate the gas chamber?" Park  said. "Imagine the environmental studies. When the thing is vented, it vents  cyanide gas. It's supposed to be neutralized by the time it leaves, but I  wouldn't want to be up there sniffing it."  </P> <P> The housing issue will not go away any time soon. California courts will  sentence as many as 40 people to death this year. While the Bird court reversed  the bulk of the death penalty cases to go before it, the court of Chief Justice  Malcolm Lucas upholds more than twice as many sentences as it reverses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Long-Term Residents  </P> <P> But because inmates have a right to pursue appeals in habeas corpus actions in  the state and federal courts, most of the condemned prisoners will remain on  the row for years to come.  </P> <P> "The logjam has never broken and probably never will break, because this  society is simply not equipped to kill people without due process," said  Michael Lawrence of the NAACP death penalty project in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Vasquez, more familiar than most with the implications of the logjam, was among  the few people who noticed that an anniversary passed on Death Row on March 14.  On that date, Robert Alton Harris had been on the row for one decade.  </P> <P> Harris has used more appeals by far than any other condemned inmate in this  state. Many people believe that he will be the first to be executed in  California since 1967.  </P> <P> "That's what we say to each other. The attorney general says that to me. I say  that to the attorney general. But nobody really knows," Vasquez said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Death Sentence Affirmed  </P> <P> In each of the last three years, California's top law enforcement officials  have predicted that Harris would be executed. The state Supreme Court affirmed  his death sentence in 1981 for the killings of two teen-age boys in San Diego  in 1978.  </P> <P> His case has been in the federal courts ever since, most recently before the  U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. With the year more than half over, it is  unlikely that Harris will die in 1989.  </P> <P> Even if Harris is executed this year or next, no one will follow him on the  long walk for years, unless an inmate drops all appeals or there is a dramatic  change in the criminal justice system. No other condemned inmate is within two  years of completing the judicial steps to the gas chamber, attorneys who handle  death penalty appeals say.  </P> <P> "In a sense, we get the best of all worlds," former San Quentin Associate  Warden Park said. "The vicious, terrible criminal is sentenced to death. Then  he never gets killed, so nobody has to feel bad about it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Preparations Continue  </P> <P> Still, the man who by law must carry out the sentences continues to prepare.  </P> <P> "What I tell my staff," Warden Vasquez said, "is that there's one person who is  not to survive the ritual of the execution, and that is the condemned inmate.  We have to survive. We have to go back to our families, our children, our loved  ones, intact, emotionally and physically healthy."  </P> <P> To that end, Vasquez fights any attempt to make lethal injections or the  electric chair the method of execution in California. Workers would have to get  too close to the condemned man to find a usable vein or shave his head in  preparation for a fatal electric jolt. In the gas chamber, contact is minimal.  Inmates are strapped down, and the heavy steel door is shut.  </P> <P> "I'm not an executioner," the warden said. "I wasn't born with a little black  hood over my head with the eyes cut out. My mother didn't give birth to an  executioner. I carry out the law and so do my staff."  </P></p>

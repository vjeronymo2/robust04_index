			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Reuters to build US presence on back of Quotron purchase Reuters Holdings said its recent decision to purchase Quotron, the US data services business, was a crucial step in building the UK group's presence in North American equity markets. Mr Peter Job, Reuters chief executive, acknowledged that the business was 'not in a happy state' and said cancellations already in the pipeline would reduce its customer base from 40,000 terminals to the mid-30,000s - about 20 per cent of the market. However, Mr Job was confident that Quotron could be improved by injecting Reuters services and infrastructure into the network, and that an increasing number of US users would also be interested in the European share information. Including revenue from Instinet, Mr Job said the US now outweighed the City of London as Reuters' biggest single market. Excluding Instinet, the group said the revenue and profit contribution by the Americas grew rapidly in 1993. Profits trebled from Pounds 12m to Pounds 37m. Revenue grew by 32 per cent to Pounds 285m and by 12 per cent at comparable rates. The profits contribution from Europe, Middle East and Africa grew by 6 per cent to Pounds 353m and revenue by 10 per cent to Pounds 1.08bn, which was 5 per cent at comparable rates. The Asia/Pacific contribution rose by 27 per cent to Pounds 175m with revenue ahead 26 per cent to Pounds 385m, a 3 per cent increase at comparable rates. Net cash of Pounds 450m was down from Pounds 710m, reflecting last year's Pounds 350m share repurchase, accelerated capital spending and increased spending on acquisitions. Operating profit before interest grew by 20 per cent to Pounds 380m. Interest income declined by 9 per cent to Pounds 60m following the share repurchase, and would decline further next year. Capital expenditure increased by 35 per cent to Pounds 268m,influenced by a stronger dollar while expenditure on subscriber equipment rose 40 per cent to Pounds 143m.</p>

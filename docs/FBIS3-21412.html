			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ze'ev Schiff] </F>   [Text] The Military Advocate-General's report on the  accident at Tze'elim-2 has broken the bottleneck in appointments  to the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] senior ranks. It has  removed the reason--a pretext, really--for the artificial delay  in appointing new generals to the general staff. Unless, that  is, things are not as simple as they appear on the surface. When  the government approved extending the chief of staff's term of  service for an additional year, Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq  announced that he intends to complete his duties on January 1,  1995. Thus, he still has about 10 months in his post.    What this means is that Baraq, in the final stages of his  term, is about to decide who will make up most of the generals  to serve on the general staff of his successor, who already is  standing on the threshold. If this had been done a year or two  ago--well and good. The custom has been to permit every chief of  staff to choose some of the generals with whom he is interested  in working as a team. This time, the next chief of staff will  not have any possibility of influencing many key appointments.  The face of his general staff will be set now for many years to  come.    The next chief of staff apparently will be Gen. Amnon  Shahaq,  currently the preferred candidate of Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin, who is also the Defense Minister. It would be worthwhile  for Shahaq to have as much say as Baraq does on the next round  of senior appointments. The Defense Minister will need advice on  them from the man who will be the IDF's chief of staff in  another 10 months, too.    The prolonged delay in appointments because of the Tze'elim  accident was excessive. The longer the Advocate-General's work  took, the more onerous the delay seemed. The error lay not in  the extended service of the current generals in their posts but  in the connection that Rabin and Baraq formed between the  Tze'elim accident and the appointment of new generals, which  were completely unrelated. The problem is that this linkage has  not been severed even now.    In fairness, the Chief of Staff did not want to appoint Gen.  'Amiram Levine to a senior post immediately after he received an  administrative reprimand. Accordingly, it was suggested that  only a small round of appointments be made in the first stage. A  "small round" of appointments could have been made only a while  ago, before the Adjutant General presented his findings. The  current round apparently will include appointments to Central  Command, the National Defense College, and Ground Forces  Command. If Baraq truly wants to appoint 'Amiram Levine to OC  Northern Command, he will have to put off further exchanges in  that command. That means that the "small round" is again  delaying appointments. Once again, it will entangle officers who  have no connection to the Tze'elim incident.    Shortening the final year of service of the chief of staff  has put an end to the possibility that another senior officer  will fill the post of deputy chief of staff before the decision  as to who will succeed Baraq is put into effect. Baraq has tried  in recent weeks to convince Shahaq to take a year off, on leave  or at study, which would permit another officer to perform his  duties. Although Shahaq was not enthusiastic about that idea, he  left the decision to the Defense Minister. Rabin is not  accustomed to making drastic decisions in such personal matters,  however, and because Shahaq has not asked to go study, the  situation remains as it was.    This plan has gone off the agenda, meanwhile, because there  is no reason to appoint a chief of army intelligence and a  deputy chief of staff for just nine months. Such an appointment  must be made for a period of years; and if it is made, the  general who wins it will also be the next deputy chief of staff.    Appointments have always been a bumpy road for Baraq. Some  of  the senior appointments made during his term were done without  his approval, as in the appointment of Yitzhaq Mordekhay to OC  Northern Command. Others are not considered successful.    In the next 10 months, not only will a new chief of staff be  appointed but also three regional commanders, a deputy chief of  staff, and a chief of military intelligence; and there may yet  be new officers in other senior posts. There is no escaping the  fact that two veteran generals will be disappointed. A new  generation of brigadier generals, some of them very good and  some of them less so, stands on the threshold.    It is important to ensure that the next general staff is  composed not only of talented officers, outstanding  professionals, and men with a strategic-political grasp of the  world; also, care must be taken so that the next general staff  will be truly balanced. Reserve Gen. Yisr'ael Tal was correct in  arguing long ago that above all else, the general staff must  always be made up of men experienced in managing the large  command structures that naturally develop from armored  formations. The one who must oversee the job of this balancing  is the Defense Minister, who has to see the appointment picture  in its totality.</p>

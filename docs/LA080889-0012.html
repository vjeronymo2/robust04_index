			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER CAPITAL GAINS  </P> <P> In response to "Six Democrats Backing Capital Gains Tax" (Part I, July 25):  </P> <P> I do not see this as a partisan issue, nor should it be played as a Bush vs.  Foley issue. Certainly it is not an "unnecessary giveaway to the rich."  </P> <P> As a retired middle-class professional in my 60s, I would like to sell my house  (purchased in 1972) and move to a less expensive area. I have not done so  because of unjust, high capital gains tax. I'm sure there are many, many people  in my position.  </P> <P> It has been demonstrated that it would generate revenue by encouraging many  people like myself to sell.  </P> <P> N.M. MYERS  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

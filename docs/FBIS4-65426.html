			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 12 (AA) -- Ankara State Prosecutor  Nazmi Sarvan on Thursday [12 May] said that an investigation was  started following the telephone conversation between Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller and two ministers from her cabinet was  taped and leaked to the press.    He said the investigation will be conducted to determine  whether there were any premeditations, or whether the  conversation was heard and taped by chance.    Sarvan said that if it was determined that it was  premeditated, the investigation will be conducted by Ankara  State Security Court.    He said that there have been no initiatives undertaken by  the  Prime Minister's Office or the Chief of Staff's Office on the  issue, adding the State Prosecutor's Office has used its power  to start the investigation on its own authority.    The Turkish Constitution's Resolution No. 132 on crimes  against the personal identity of the states [as received] and  No. 195 on crimes on divulging state secrets would be considered  during the investigation, he said.    A scandal broke out last week when a man listened to a  three-way telephone conversation between Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller, and two cabinet members. The conversation was recorded  because one of the ministers was using his phone car.    In the conversation Ciller was asking her ministers to make  necessary arrangements to extend the duty of the chief of staff,  General Dogan Gures, for another year.</p>

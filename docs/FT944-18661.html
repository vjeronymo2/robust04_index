			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Shell turns the tide on its sea of paper Shell UK will today move to save motorists from drowning under a sea of paper every time they buy fuel by announcing a scheme to replace trading stamps and tokens with 'smart cards'. Shell Smart will be the first nationwide scheme to use such cards. It hopes to distribute up to 3.5m cards throughout the UK following a limited test in Scotland. It said it had already received more than 1m applications for the cards. Shell Smart is a development of the company's existing reward programme, where vouchers given with petrol purchases can be redeemed for goods or services. Customers will be able to claim a point for every Pounds 6 they spend on fuel which can be exchanged for gifts, donations to charity and air miles. A new catalogue offers a wide range of gifts - from a blank cassette tape costing five points to a video recorder worth 6,085 points. Shell sees the card as a way to get rid of the expensive and time-consuming paper-chase necessary to run existing loyalty schemes. The cards, which contain a microchip, cost Shell about Pounds 1 each, and the company has installed about 2,000 card readers at a cost of about Pounds 600 each. Mr Ian Sutcliffe, Shell forecourt marketing manager, said: 'Whilst the scheme has cost millions of pounds to develop, the cost of handling electronic transactions is far cheaper than handling paper.' Mr Gary Anderton of Shell Smart said that once a base of smart cards was established there would be many possibilities for extending the scheme.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Upturn 'bringing workplace unrest' More than one in five of Britain's largest unionised companies have experienced industrial unrest during the past 12 months, according to a survey published yesterday by Dibb Lupton Broomhead, a firm of solicitors specialising in employment law. The survey of disputes, based on replies from about 100 unionised companies among the top 500 UK companies, found that 22 per cent had experienced industrial unrest in the past year and that 16.7 per cent expected unrest in the next 12 months. Most of the cases were in the north of England's manufacturing sector. 'Our survey suggests that there is considerably more industrial tension bubbling beneath the surface than the simple 'days lost' government statistics showing that in 1992 just over 0.5m working days were lost as against 29m working days lost in 1979,' said DLB., Mr Paul Nicholls, lead employment partner, said recovery seemed to be bringing back industrial unrest but was partly disguised by the fact that it took forms other than the all-out withdrawal of labour. 'Employees are not yet sufficiently confident to forgo the whole of their pay to support their claims and union coffers post-recession are not able to meet strike pay liabilities,' said the firm. Employers' greater readiness to use the law was another factor in restraining traditional industrial action. The union-funded Labour Research Department found recently that there have been 189 legal cases brought by employers against unions since 1985, most of them in the form of injunctions over balloting or picketing. The DLB survey said: 'As many as 95.6 per cent of employers said the option of using legal action in disputes gave them a powerful bargaining weapon. As many as 88.8 per cent of employers said they would be prepared to take action against individual strikers by dismissing them.' However, some union officials said privately that some of the legal changes of the past decade had also helped to increase union leverage in the process of industrial conflict. 'Strike ballots are often a very useful extra pressure on employers,' said one official.</p>

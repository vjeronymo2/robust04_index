			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MARMONTE BASKETBALL ROSTERS BOLSTERED BY TRANSFER STUDENTS  </P> <P> Five basketball players have transferred to Marmonte League schools, adding  depth to the rosters of the league's top teams.  </P> <P> Simi Valley High, which has won or shared the league title the past five years,  added 6-foot-4 senior Michael Crawford and Ecuadorean exchange student Diego  Cabezas, a 6-2 forward.  </P> <P> According to Simi Valley Coach Dean Bradshaw, Crawford never has played  organized basketball and has attended a handful of schools in the San Fernando  Valley. Crawford's uncle, Marty Wilson, was the league's most valuable player  as a Pioneer in 1984 and was an assistant coach at Simi Valley last year.  Wilson is an assistant at Pepperdine this season.  </P> <P> "Crawford is a very talented basketball player," Bradshaw said.  </P> <P> Royal, which shared the league title with Simi Valley last season, lost  high-scoring Russell Myers to graduation but gained transfer guard David Tyner  from Rim of the World. Tyner (6-3) made 44 three-point baskets last season.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks, which lost only three players from a team that finished third in  the league last year, bolstered its roster with 6-foot senior guard Don Clinton  from St. Agnes in St. Paul, Minn.  </P> <P> Matt Cummings, who played at the junior-varsity level at Ventura last season,  might start at Newbury Park this season. Cummings is a 6-2 junior.  </P></p>

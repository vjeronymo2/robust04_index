			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, December 22--The minister for petroleum  and natural gas, Capt. Satish Sharma, today emphatically denied  that he had received remittances from abroad from "questionable  sources" or "made substantial investments abroad in various ways  in violation of the country's laws."    In similar statements in both houses of Parliament, during  zero hour the minister also refuted the allegation that he had  been involved in banking investigations in the U.S. regarding  questionable investments abroad or had disclosed government  policy to unauthorised people before any official announcement.    Capt. Sharma, however, stated that he had received  remittances valued at about Rs[rupees]43 lakhs from his younger  brother, Mr Girish Kumar Sharma, who is settled in United States  since 1972 and is now a citizen of that country. The funds were  received through regular banking channels between 1986 and 1992  and reflected in his income-tax returns, he added. He pointed  out that his brother had his own professional management  services in the United States and had no business in India.    The statement came at the end of persistent demands from the  opposition for two days for a clarification from the minister.  The opposition, which had been clamouring for a detailed  discussion on the charges, was not satisfied with the statement.    In the Rajya Sabha, Capt. Sharma's explanation triggered off  a prolonged uproar as opposition members sought clarifications  from the minister, a demand which was turned down by the deputy  chairperson, Ms Najma Heptulla, on the ground that rules did not  permit a debate on a personal explanation.    Angry opposition members persisted, claiming that Capt.  Sharma's explanation was bereft of facts and contained nothing  but a string of denials. They said it could not therefore be  categorised as a "personal explanation" and instead should be  treated as a suo moto statement, on which they had a  right to ask questions. Congress members were equally vociferous  as they banded together to shout down the opposition members,  insisting that Capt. Sharma's explanation did not call for a  debate.    Ms Heptulla, however, remained unmoved. She cited the case  of  Ms Maneka Gandhi, who as environment minister, had made a  personal explanation in the Rajya Sabha following certain  allegations by the Congress party, which was then seated in the  opposition benches. Ms Heptulla reminded the members that even  at that time, she had given a similar ruling and disallowed a  debate. There cannot be different sets of rules for different  persons at different times, she added.    The entire drama lasted nearly 40 minutes as both sides  stuck  to their views. Mr S. Jaipal Reddy (Janata Dal) pointed out that  since Capt. Sharma's statement was in response to notices  submitted by members it could not be treated as a personal  explanation. He argued that since the minister's clarification  was sought on record, it is implied that the matter is before  the council for consideration.    The Lok Sabha speaker Mr Shivraj Patil also disallowed any  discussion. There was a procedural wrangle, with Mr George  Fernandes (Janata Dal) demanding a debate. Mr P.K. Bansal  (Congress), rising on a point of order, quoted rule 357 and said  no discussion could be held on the statement. It was upheld by  the Speaker.    Mr Fernandes referred to his letter on the subject addressed  to the speaker and to the minister and asserted that the later  had to reply to all the 32 points raised by him. The speaker,  however, stuck to his ruling, pointing out that most of the  points in any case did not relate to the minister.    Earlier the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] president, Mr K.L.  Advani, pointed out that while members of the Rajya Sabha could  seek clarifications on such statements, members of the Lok Sabha  could not do so. He suggested that an exception be made in this  case in view of its importance.    When Mr Jaswant Singh, deputy leader of the BJP, started  reading our part of a document to "establish the nexus" between  the minister and the NRI [nonresident Indian] concerned, the  speaker restrained him, saying he had to go by the rules. The  BJP member stated that not only the transfer of funds but also  the acquisition of major companies was involved. A reference by  him to the Congress party evoked strong protests from the  treasury benches.    Capt. Sharma's clarification was in response to the charges  levelled by Mr Jaswant Singh in the Lok Sabha and by Mr J.P.  Mathur (BJP) and Mr Ashis Sen (CPM [Communist Party of  India-Marxist]) in the Rajya Sabha on the basis of certain  documents and reports in a Delhi daily.    Replying to Mr Jaswant Singh's charge about disclosure of  policy decision, Capt. Sharma said the member had not cared to  point out which particular policy was disclosed to unauthorised  persons. "I may take this opportunity to point out that the  allegations published in the INDIAN EXPRESS related to some fax  communication regarding the disclosure of the 'discovered oil  field programme' ... This programme was approved by the  government as early as July 2, 1992 which was then announced  globally by means of booklets. Hence there is no question of my  disclosing it to any person unauthorisedly," he stated.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / BBC urges support for move into global market The BBC last night appealed to the ITV companies and the Independent Television Commission to support the corporation's move into the global marketplace. Mr Bob Phillis, deputy director-general, said that if the BBC was unable to supplement the licence fee either programme quality would suffer or there would be a revival of the argument that the BBC should carry advertising. 'I do not believe this would be in the interests of British audiences, the British programme-making industry - or perhaps even the ITV companies, Channel 4, Channel 5 or the cable and satellite service,' Mr Phillis told a Royal Television Society dinner. He said he was convinced the corporation could serve the UK audience and compete worldwide. To ensure that commercial activities were consistent with 'the BBC's special qualities' and brand values, staff would today receive copies of new commercial policy guidelines. The guidelines will set out the sort of commercial activities which the BBC can focus on and also give guidance on sponsorship, co-productions and promotional activity. Mr Phillis said: 'Producers and editors throughout the BBC must have a clear understanding of what they should and should not do when faced with commercial opportunity.' He also called for co-operation with the rest of the television industry on the introduction of digital terrestrial television.</p>

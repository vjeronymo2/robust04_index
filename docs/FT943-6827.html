			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Hutchison surge surprises market Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, yesterday surprised the market with a 48 per cent rise in first-half earnings to HKDollars 3.7bn (USDollars 480m), up from HKDollars 2.5bn in the same period last year. Only the most bullish forecasts anticipated the rise, which has perked up what had been, by Hong Kong terms, a disappointing results season. Analysts attributed the performance to strong, focused management under Mr Canning Fok, group managing director, who has shaken up divisions and overseen a return to traditional interests, namely China, ports and property. Hutchison was helped by the closure of the loss-making Rabbit telepoint system in the UK and last year's disposal of stakes in Star TV. Half-year figures were lifted by a higher contribution from Hongkong Electric, an associate company whose six-month profits rose 33 per cent to HKDollars 1.73bn, and the increased interest in Hongkong International Terminals (HIT). HIT's facilities were expanded over the period, and traffic rose 27 per cent year-on-year. The ports in Shanghai and Zhuhai, in which Hutchison has stakes of 40 per cent and 50 per cent respectively, are in profit. Profits grew at Felixstowe, the UK port wholly owned by the group. A letter of intent has been signed to take a 50 per cent stake in the construction and operating of a three-berth deep-water container terminal in Freeport, Grand Bahama. The profits rise came on a 22 per cent improvement in turnover, up to HKDollars 14bn from HKDollars 11.5bn. Taken on a per share basis, earnings rose 39 per cent to HKDollars 1.03 from HKDollars 0.74. The interim dividend is increased to 26 cents from 19 cents last year. Mr Li Ka-shing, chairman, said the company had progressively built up a portfolio of joint-venture property development projects in China. 'In time these should enhance the group's development profit and recurrent income.' Hutchison plans to open its Park'N Shop supermarkets in Shanghai later this year and is testing its Watson's chemists in Malaysia. Cheung Kong ahead, Page 19</p>

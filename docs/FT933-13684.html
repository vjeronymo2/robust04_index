			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Markets: Dow climbs through corporate wreckage - Wall Street PROCTER &amp; Gamble battens down the hatches for a war of attrition with rival consumer products groups. Apple Computer takes a Dollars 320m charge and announces plans to slash costs. Merck, the country's biggest pharmaceuticals company, reels from the loss of its next prospective head. Corporate disaster stories have littered the ground on Wall Street this week: but that has not stopped share prices from scraping against their all-time highs. It is not difficult to see where the support for share prices has come from. The threat of renewed inflation, which haunted Wall Street earlier this year, retreated further this week as figures for June brought the second consecutive month of reassuring news. This drove the bond market still further ahead during the week, cutting a further 10 basis points (0.1 percentage point) off the yield of the benchmark 30-year bond. That brought the yield to within a whisker of the magic 6.5 per cent level of which fixed income investors have been dreaming. With long-term interest rates continuing to fall and no sign of the Federal Reserve moving to tighten short-term ones, the equity market continued to act as a magnet for investors' cash. The Dow Jones Industrial Average powered ahead to 3550 on Thursday, close to its May all-time high, driven by the bond market rally, though by midday on Friday it had eased back to 3537 on profit taking. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 had a less scintillating week, easing up to break through 450 before slipping back slightly. Where, though, is the earnings growth to lift share prices from their current trading range and take the bull market on to new highs? While equity prices remain in thrall to the bond market, there is little to excite equity investors. The early signs from the second-quarter results season offer scant hope of a new surge in share prices. Earnings figures so far have been much in line with market expectations, reinforcing the expectation of slow but steady growth as the US economy picks itself up out of recession and exporters continue to struggle against the twin handicaps of a strong dollar and economic weakness in Europe and Japan. And then there were the disaster stories. Procter &amp; Gamble's announcement that it planned to shed around 13,000 of its 106,000 jobs around the world took Dollars 2 off its share price during the week. The shares were trading at Dollars 50 1/4 at midday in New York yesterday. News of the restructuring at Apple Computer wiped no less than Dollars 7 5/8 from the share price, taking it down to Dollars 28 1/4 . Such news continues to act as a reminder that the climb out of recession will be a slow and painful one for some of the biggest companies in the US. At current levels, the prospective price / earnings ratio of stocks in the broad-based S&amp;P 500 index stands at an ambitious 22.5, according to Birinyi Associates, a research firm. That may be lower than the 24.1 market p / e at the start of the year, but it still represents demanding expectations of earnings growth. And with share prices rising faster than dividends, the average dividend yield on stocks in te S&amp;P 500 has fallen to below 2.8 per cent. Falling bond yields at least offer support for the market at that level: as yields on bonds have plummeted faster than those on equities, the gap between the two has dropped to less than 4 per cent, well below its average for the 1980s. Any fall in the differential below this level would hark back to the 1970s and 1960s, before investors learned to fear inflation, and would require considerable confidence that low inflation was really back to stay. While Wall Street continued to wait for news that would give a new momentum to share prices, perhaps the general tone of buoyancy during the week was accounted for by something altogether different. Given the chunky bonuses they are likely to receive this year, it should not be surprising if traders are feeling optimistic. Merrill Lynch recorded second quarter profits up by a half, to a record Dollars 354m. JP Morgan, which has managed the switch from commercial bank to trading house faster than most, saw profits in the same period climb by a third. The share prices of brokerage companies are around their all-time highs, back from the depths of the late 1980s. The markets may still be trying to decide whether the latest bull phase has further to run, but the boom times have certainly returned for New York's financial district.  -------------------------------------- Monday         3524.38  +  3.32 Tuesday        3515.44  -  8.94 Wednesday      3542.55  +  27.11 Thursday       3550.93  +  8.38 Friday         3528.29  -  22.64  --------------------------------------</p>

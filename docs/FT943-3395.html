			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Remixed Caradon pleases City - Underlying growth of almost a fifth after purchase of Pillar The share price of Caradon, one of Europe's biggest building materials groups rose by almost 4 per cent yesterday after the company announced an increase in underlying profits of almost a fifth in the first half of 1994. Operating profits of Caradon's new mix of businesses, following last year's Pounds 809m purchase of the Pillar building products business from RTZ, rose from Pounds 79.8m to Pounds 94.2m. The comparable figures have been restated to include Pillar's results. Mr Peter Jansen, Caradon's chief executive said that operating margins at Pillar, which had significantly increased the group's exposure to the sharply recovering US construction market, had risen from 5 per cent to 8 per cent since it was acquired. The improvement was due mainly to increased sales volume and cost reductions. Prices also had risen but mostly in line with raw material costs, said Mr Jansen. Turnover rose from a restated Pounds 926.9m to Pounds 981.7m, including Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 3.9m) from discontinued activities. Caradon manufactures a wide range of building materials including windows, doors, central heating boilers and electronic control systems for buildings in the UK, US and continental European markets. It also has interests in automotive and aircraft components as well as a cheque printing business in the US. The shares rose 11p to 298p in spite of a 41 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 90.8m, against Pounds 152.8m which included an exceptional Pounds 100.3m profit from the sale of its CarnaudMetalbox interests. Earnings per share fell from 26.4p to 8.9p reflecting last year's Pounds 334m rights to help fund the Pillar acquisition. Excluding exceptional items earnings rose from 6.8p to 8.9p. The interim dividend is increased from 2.83p to 2.9p. Profits rose fastest in the US increasing by 30 per cent from Pounds 27.3m to Pounds 35.7m in spite of a 20 per cent cent fall in operating profits to Pounds 20.4m from cheque printing. Mr Jansen said that US building materials sales had been strong in the first half in spite of bad weather disrupting construction activity. UK profits rose by 22 per cent from Pounds 38.6m to Pounds 47.3m. Building materials sales, however, were mixed due to the failure of repair, maintenance and DIY work to recover in line with the increase in new house building. Profits in continental Europe, where recovery in construction demand has occurred later than in the US and UK, fell from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds 11.2m. See Lex</p>

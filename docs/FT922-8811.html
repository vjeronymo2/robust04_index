			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Central Asian talks fail THE former Soviet Union's five central Asian states, plus Turkey, Iran and Pakistan, failed at the weekend to agree on a framework for their economic integration at a summit meeting in the capital of Turkmenistan. A central obstacle was the political rivalry between Turkey and Iran in the area. The proposals under discussion included the construction of road and rail links between Turkmenistan and Iran which would link the newly-independent central Asian states with their neighbours in the south. Other items on the agenda were a united customs policy, various trade agreements and proposed oil and gas pipelines from central Asia to Turkey and Iran. The most controversial proposal was the plan for an oil pipeline between Kazakhstan's Tengiz oilfields and the Gulf port of Bandar Abbas. This was blocked by both Kazakhstan and Turkey, which fears it would give Iran a potential stranglehold over central Asian oil exports. The participants did, however, reaffirm their commitment to the less concrete goal of political co-operation.</p>

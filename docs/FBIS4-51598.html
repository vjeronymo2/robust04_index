			<p>BFN     [Text] Government officials yesterday met informally in  Aranyaprathet District with their Cambodian counterparts to  discuss the reopening of the border closed late last month  following a rocket attack which wounded two Thai civilians.    The Cambodian delegation led by Fifth Army Region Deputy  Commander Gen Duong Sokhon crossed the border from Poipet to  Khlong Luk in Aranyaprathet where they met with the commander of  the Burapha Task Force Maj-Gen Niphon Pharunnit.    The meeting ended inconclusively but talks are expected to  resume after the peace negotiations in Phnom Penh from May 2-7.    Gen Duong told Thai reporters his troops commanded by Gen  Lai  Virak had successfully repulsed Khmer Rouge guerrillas from  Highway 5. The highway is still closed to the public however.  The general said guerrillas were grouping close to the Thai  border at Ban Khok Sabang and Ban Nong Iam villages.    Gen Duong promised to investigate if the mortar shell which  landed at Rong Kula black market on March 26 leaving two Thai  traders injured was fired by government troops or guerrillas.  He said he was willing to offer compensation to the victims if  it could be proven his troops were responsible for the shelling.  The general insisted his forces did not fire deliberately on  Thailand.    Cross-border shelling is accidental, he said, and promised  to  instruct his troops to be more careful in the future. He also  said he was willing to hold talks with the Thai military to  resolve any border problems.    General Duong complained the price of consumer products in  Poipet had risen sharply since the closure of the border at  Khlong Luk-Poipet. He said officials were trying to solve the  problem.    Poipet, he said, is now almost deserted with the majority of  the people having fled elsewhere for fear of attack by the Khmer  Rouge.    Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday made clear that  Thailand would decline any request for it to be the venue of  talks among Cambodians.    "Cambodia has a government of its own. The roundtable is an  internal matter. There should be no need for (Cambodians) to  meet in Bangkok. If they ask, it is not our affair," he said.    The minister had been asked whether Thailand might be a  venue  if the Khmer Rouge refused to go to Phnom Penh. The guerrillas  have cited security reasons for wanting the talks, set to start  on Monday, to take place somewhere else. The Khmer Rouge  regarded security as important, Squadron Leader Prasong said.    "I think the Khmer Rouge should participate in the  roundtable." But security measures should be well prepared, he  said.    The minister maintained that "preparedness" and  compatibility  in systems would be important to Vietnam's becoming a full  member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).    As a socialist country, Vietnam would need time to adjust,  notably in terms of financial systems, including taxation and  banking, he said.    The minister was commenting on reports that Indonesia had  expressed support for Vietnam's membership of ASEAN. Vietnamese  President Le Duc Anh yesterday was winding up a visit to  Indonesia.    Asked about the prospects of competition, Sqn Ldr Prasong  said this should not be an obstacle to Vietnam's membership of  ASEAN. To beat the competition, the Thai private sector should  improve quality and service, he said.    "We have come a long way. Vietnam needs time, perhaps  another three or five years."    Sqn Ldr Prasong was reserved on reports that Indonesia is in  favor of Vietnam becoming an observer to the Asian Pacific  Economic Co-operation (APEC) forum.    "It is a good idea to have friends in the Asia-Pacific  region  become observers," he said. But he noted that the APEC meeting  in Seattle last November agreed not to receive new members for  the next three years.</p>

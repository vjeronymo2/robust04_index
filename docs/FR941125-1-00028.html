			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The design specification testing requirements assume that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apparatus used to conduct demonstrations is proper. Adequately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rugged apparatus will assure the accuracy and rigor required at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the specification frequency. The testing requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrating conformance with the design specifications assume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the testing apparatus, used to conduct such tests, were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly chosen, adequately rugged, and sufficiently accurate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1989&hyph;1990 evaluation of procedures, conducted by the COMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers, found a broad spectrum of sophistication in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration apparatus. The detection limits of some equipment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in the manufacturers' procedures, were found to be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limiting factor in the conduct of some tests. If manufacturers'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations are not sufficiently precise, accurate, or permanent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluations may indicate problems in repeatability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1983 monitor selection process for design demonstration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing did not clearly specify how to select a monitor if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing operation was not continuous or did not include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large inventories. Most COMS manufacturing operations are likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to use off-the-shelf or imported components, and the COMS's are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constructed and shipped as orders are received. Large inven <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tories generally do not exist, and production is demand-based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposed monitor selection process revises the 1983  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process to recognize some of these typical manufacturing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations. The proposal requires that each COMS installed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to the requirements of an applicable standard, have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serial number assigned by the manufacturer. (Note: If a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zero-jig is manufactured and provided for the COMS model type, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unique serial number for the zero-jig, corresponding to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installed COMS serial number, is required.) The proposed model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selection process of section 6, Design Specification Verification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedure, specifies that the COMS (per model) selection will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on a randomly-selected COMS produced during the month or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> randomly-selected COMS per 20 such monitors produced, whichever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is more frequent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If 20 or more COMS's of a particular model are produced in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> month, the manufacturer shall randomly select a COMS of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model from that month's production for conducting the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformance tests in sections 6.2 through 6.6. Otherwise, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer shall select a COMS with a serial number in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinct lot of 20 monitors of that model produced, or to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced, and shall test that COMS for demonstrating conformance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the design specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed specification does not require additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sampling and testing upon the finding of nonconformance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design requirements. Upon such finding, however, the specifica <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tion requires the manufacturer to notify all sources who have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchased that model of COMS if the COMS was manufactured since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the model's last successful demonstration of conformance. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer must send a copy of all such notifications to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The design specification demonstration incorporates other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. An outline of an example of a MCOC is provided to give  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direction on the presentation of supporting documentation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance demonstration tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The current specifications do not require verification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of supporting COMS component conformance documentation, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lamp emissivity, which is used for the construction of a spectral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response curve. Also, the 1983 specifications did not put any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit on the valid time period for certain supporting demonstra <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tions such as development of the spectral response curve. As a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result, some MCOC's now reflect 5-year old data. The 1989&hyph;1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluations of the COMS manufacturers identified incorrect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation procedures as well as inclusion of a component that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused an unacceptable COMS response. The manufacturer in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> latter case, who calculated the response curve, was unaware that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the component's characteristics had changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed PS's require the manufacturer to measure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spectral response curve of the COMS. The specifications will no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer allow the manufacturer, or source owner or operator, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculate the spectral response curve from lamp emissivity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detector response, and filter characteristics. The EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified two acceptable systems and procedures for measuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the COMS spectral response curve at 10 nm intervals from 300 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 800 nm. Information, provided by the manufacturers, indicates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this requirement is not overly burdensome. This information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is necessary because, from this information, both the peak and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mean spectral response can be accurately determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV MAY GET FILM CAMEO  </P> <P> Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev may soon follow former President Ronald  Reagan onto the silver screen.  </P> <P> Unlike Reagan, however, Gorbachev will portray himself in an Israeli-Soviet  film based on the true story of a Soviet plane hijacked to Israel by armed  robbers, the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported.  </P> <P> The film's scriptwriter, who also serves in the Soviet Parliament, told  Gorbachev he was looking for a double to portray him in the film.  </P> <P> "Why look for a double? If I am free, I will play myself," Yedioth quoted  Gorbachev as responding.  </P> <P> The Soviet president will have only one line in the film titled "Direct  Flight":  </P> <P> "Do everything to protect the children."  </P> <P> Last December, five Soviet robbers seized a busload of schoolchildren before  hijacking a plane to Israel, believing it had elected an anti-communist  government.  </P> <P> Israel immediately sent the thieves back, paving the way for improved ties with  the Soviet Union.  </P></p>

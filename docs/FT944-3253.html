			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: European telecoms The protagonists in the future European telecoms war are taking up positions. Yesterday's joint venture between AT&amp;T and Unisource is the latest move. As a sign of their seriousness, the partners have earmarked roughly Dollars 1bn for investment over the next few years. Though the venture's initial focus will be on supplying multinationals, it will be positioned to serve the European long-distance market when that is opened to competition in 1998. The same is true of BT's venture with MCI and France Telecom's alliance with Deutsche Telekom. With margins on long-distance calls high throughout much of Europe, a price war is only a matter of time. BT looks set to adopt an aggressive strategy. It has relatively little to lose from rivals invading its turf, since it already faces competition, and much to win from poaching business from continental groups. By contrast, the continental operators may play it defensively, seeking to protect their patches. But such strategies are unlikely to pay off in the long run.</p>

Are Western Democrats Really Capable of  Stooping to Crimes Against Humanity? French General Pierre  Gallois Asks"]    [Text] Paris, 16 Feb -- These days official France is  somewhat reminiscent of a hypnotized person. Domestic policy  has been put on the back burner. All thoughts and discussions  in both the ruling right-wing parties and the opposition are  associated with Bosnia, or to be precise the NATO ultimatum to  the Serbs. It seems that everything revolves around this. This  situation involuntarily prompts many people to reflect on the  situation's preprogrammed nature.    First of all, people here are pondering whether the NATO  ultimatum is itself in France's national interests, and likewise  Paris' entire policy in Bosnia and the way it forms a bloc  against the Serbs exclusively with the Muslim side or more  rarely with the Croatian side.    Second, alarm is also being aroused by Washington's attempts  to supplant the United Nations with the NATO bloc and with its  help to mete out punishment to the world's peoples in the name  of a "new world order."    Third, every day there are more and more press items  questioning the official version of the mortar attack on the  market in Sarajevo.    General Pierre M. Gallois, the eminent French strategist,  shares his thoughts with PRAVDA readers:    "NATO is now completely subordinate to the United States.  The Atlantic alliance's military organization has become a most  powerful instrument in establishing a `new world order.' It is  meant to punish and does not take the trouble to find out  exactly who is really guilty.    "That was the case in June 1993, when the United States  decided to 'punish' Iraq for 'attempting to assassinate  President Bush.' B. Clinton sent cruise missiles to Baghdad even  before the Iraqis' guilt had been proved. It was only later  that the U.S. press admitted that there had been no attempt on  Bush's life. But dozens of completely innocent people's lives  had already been sacrificed to U.S. democracy.    "Washington and NATO Secretary General Woerner, a German,  have just issued an ultimatum to the Serbs in order to punish  them for the bloody massacre in Sarajevo, of which they are  accusing only the Serbs. Without even waiting for the results  of an investigation by a special commission.    "Something similar also occurred in Bosnia 27 May 1992, when  the Serbs were accused of gunning down a peaceful bread line in  Sarajevo. The Serbs were not guilty of this, but the  investigating commission concealed the facts, including the fact  that most of the people killed in this line were Serbs.    "Nevertheless, at the time this incident served as grounds  to  impose economic sanctions, as a result of which thousands of  peaceful Serbian inhabitants who were just as completely  innocent as those killed in that bread line suffered.    "What happened in the market in Markala is also strange in  terms of both its presentation to the public and consequences.  Just a single round from a mortar -- a rather inaccurate weapon  -- could not, if fired from Serb positions, have hit a  40-by-30-meter [m] target the first time. Nobody could have  seen a mortar shell in flight, as certain 'witnesses' claimed.  Alas, all they could have seen was the result of the explosion,  not the mortar shell itself. Finally, the haste with which  Western powers hurried to adopt sanctions against the Serbs  without even having convened a commission of investigation looks  highly suspicious. It is no less suspicious than the adoption  of sanctions after the events of 27 May 1992. The Serbs were  not responsible for that crime, as was later proved.    "What does this conspiracy mean? Surely Western  governments did not deliberately hurry to make fools of  themselves? Or is the German mark so strong and the desire for  oil so overwhelming that because of this Western democracies are  capable of stooping to crimes against humanity? In addition,  they have started using unworthy methods of warfare: shooting  at their own troops and accusing the enemy of this, so that it  is condemned by the public for doing this."    In his own way Admiral Jacques Lanxade, French Armed Forces  chief of staff, supplements Gen. Gallois' analysis. Speaking at  a seminar in Munich, he said that in Bosnia it is impermissible  to adopt any one side in such a complex conflict. "I also do  not believe," he said, "that we can declare war on any one of  the sides." Disagreeing with "simple solutions," the admiral  spoke out against, in particular, calls for a unilateral lifting  of the arms embargo in favor of the Bosnian Muslims. He noted  that most of the 18 French soldiers killed and 300 wounded in  Bosnia have died at the hands of Muslims and not Serbs. But  these facts are being carefully concealed, and the press  practically kept quiet about Adm. Lanxade's speech; only  L'HUMANITE risked quoting it.    Material sent to PRAVDA's Paris office from Switzerland  notes  that, according to an analysis by certain military specialists,  what was used at the market in Markala was not a mortar shell  but a new type of antipersonnel ball-bearing mine developed at  the "Slavko Rodic" Bosnian military plant in the city of Bugojno  and taken into the Bosnian Muslim army's arsenal. This mine  contains up to 5,000 steel balls 4-5 mm in diameter and has a  casualty radius of 60-80 m. The nature of the effect on people  and buildings confirms this. Especially as not a single mortar  shell in the Yugoslav Army arsenal could have had this effect.    Another curious detail: The market in Markala is mainly  Serbian and Croatian; it is practically not visited by Muslims.  Even on the newsreel it could be observed that those killed at  the market were buried in a Christian cemetery with crosses and  not in a Muslim cemetery. Hence the Swiss authors conclude that  this was a repetition of the provocation against Serbs based on  the method of 27 May 1992.    There is a good Russian proverb: "Look before you leap."  Russia, in the name of its historical friendship with Serbs and  its common fate with them, must resolutely advise the world  community to act according to this very principle in Bosnia.  Before something irreparable happens in the Balkans. Before  hundreds if not thousands of innocent people are killed. After  all, the conflagration of a world war has erupted there twice  already. A third must not be allowed.</p>

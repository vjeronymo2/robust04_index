			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> CURRAN LOSES SUIT IN LOSS OF TEACHING JOB  </P> <P> District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Frederick Weisberg rejected  dissenting theologian Charles E. Curran's suit against Catholic University of  America, ruling the school was within its rights in barring him from teaching  theology there. Curran, a priest criticized by Vatican officials for his  positions on abortion, homosexuality and other matters of sexual ethics, had  argued in court that the school breached his contract by removing him as a  teacher of moral theology courses. He said he would not appeal. Curran, who had  taught at Catholic University since 1965, was suspended in early 1987 and was  formally told last year that he could not return as a theology teacher. After  his departure he taught as a visiting professor at Cornell University and is  currently teaching at USC.  </P></p>

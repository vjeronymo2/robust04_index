			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Madrid awaits a key interest rate decision - But the authorities are cautious Next week could be the one that the Spanish bolsa has been waiting for. Not for a long time has there been such a strong feeling that domestic interest rates will come down. Hopes went on hold this week, especially yesterday when the general index fell 3.04 to 237.41 on profit-taking, declines in other bourses and after 0.2 per cent negative GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 1992. However, underlying sentiment has been lifted by the prospect of lower domestic inflation figures, due at the beginning of next week, and by the expected easing of key rates in Germany. What the market is looking for is a cut of perhaps a half-point in the current 13 per cent benchmark intervention rate when the Bank of Spain holds the repurchase tender of its certificates on March 22. The forecasts of a rally coincide with what appears to be a key change in foreign perceptions about the domestic market. Foreign institutions which, demonstrably, had underweighted Spain last year, seem to have cottoned on to the fact that the bolsa is relatively inexpensive. With the general index hovering at around 240, the bolsa has put on just over 12 per cent in value since its nadir at the beginning of this year. By the end of 1992 the Madrid market was undervalued by perhaps as much as 40 per cent and by the end of this year, in the present bullish mood, professionals have estimated that the bolsa could climb to 280. 'People are not selling Spain now,' says Mr Juan Bastos of the Madrid brokers Ibersecurities. 'Investors are not asking whether they should come into but when they should come in. That's a very important switch in perception.' What seems to have occured is a general decision that the bolsa has hit rock bottom, and that it is time to change positions. If the sentiment in 1992 was to sell in order to come back in at a later date, the mood now is that the later date has more or less arrived; any delays could make the return more expensive. The upcoming partial privatisations of Repsol, the state-controlled energy group, and of Argentaria, the state-controlled banking corporation, have created an opportunity for investors to correct the underweighting that marked the past months. Both placings are very likely to have a knock-on effect on the rest of the bolsa, simply in the enthusiasm that they generate. Ahead of either flotation, however, all eyes are expected to focus on how the financial authorities will move. The Bank of Spain is extremely cautious and conservative about easing the interest rates, but, observers ask, can it resist for much longer the growing clamour to ease? The inflation figures are more important than usual, in part exceptionally so because they will cover two months, January and February - the January figures were not released last month because the statistics office was overhauling the CPI price base - and in part because they are expected to show a strong improvement in the inflationary trend. The expectation is that year-on-year inflation will be shown to have eased to around 5.0 per cent or 5.1 per cent in January from the 5.4 per cent rate in December, and that the National Statistics Institute will show a further drop to as low as 4.7 per cent in year-on-year headline inflation in February. Figures like that should be good for the bolsa. A subsequent cut in German rates would give the Bank of Spain considerable room to manoeuvre. 'Money in Spain is far too tight, the rates have to come down but Germany has the last word,' says Mr Alvaro Villacieros of the Madrid office of James Capel. The Bank of Spain, of course, has a last word, too. It will have until the week after next, and its repo auction, to gauge exactly what signal the Bundesbank is giving and what the best response might be. It will certainly be looking for a differential of at least 400 basis points against the German rates. For all the bullishness in the air, wise market analysts are extremely wary of overplaying it. The Bank of Spain has every reason to be as tight as it possibly can: wage settlements, which are coming in at between 6.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent, are not showing the desired restraint and the government deficit in 1992, according to the latest figures filtering through, could be closer to 5.4 per cent of GDP instead of the 4.4 per cent claimed by the economy ministry. The Bank, moreover, is fully aware that fresh assaults on the peseta within the ERM are all too likely. There is a 'risk assumption' among foreign investors that the ERM could fall apart or, more exactly, that the peseta will abandon its battle to remain at the heart of the hard core of the monetary system. Everything that the government and the Bank of Spain has said to date, however, emphasises that the British option, with its plunging currency and interest rates, is not an option for Spain. The Spanish bulls will be at best cantering, never galloping.</p>

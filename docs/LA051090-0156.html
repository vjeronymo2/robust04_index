			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL NEWS: TWINS RAISE FUNDS FOR 'AMBASSADORIAL' TRIP  </P> <P> Joann and Talolo Lepale, 16-year-old twins selected to tour Europe and Moscow  as part of the People to People High School Ambassador Program, have raised the  $8,000 needed for their summer trip, just making their May 10 deadline.  </P> <P> The twins have spent the last four months raising money for the 31-day trip,  said their mother, Yonneta Lepale.  </P> <P> They collected cans and newspapers, held a carwash and a yard sale. They also  sent out 110 letters to clubs and organizations in the San Gabriel Valley  asking for donations.  </P> <P> Pledges came in from neighbors, local doctors, pharmacists, shop owners, and  their friends and co-workers. The largest donation came from the American  Legion.  </P> <P> The Lepale twins, juniors at Bassett High School, were selected on the basis of  their academic achievement, community involvement and recommendations from  teachers and counselors. The People to People program is a nonprofit  organization founded during the Dwight D. Eisenhower Administration to  encourage international student exchange.  </P></p>

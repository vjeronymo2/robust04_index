British Lieutenant Colonel Simon Shadbolt, military  assistant  to Rose, said Bosnian forces have at some sites advanced their  front-line positions against besieging Serbs by 10 metres  (yards). He said Rose would ask the Bosnians to return to their  original positions.    Shadbolt said UNPROFRO has guaranteed the Serbs that the  Moslems will not advance their lines, or mount an infantry  attack, while it enforces a NATO exclusion zone that required  Serb troops to pull their heavy artillery away from Sarajevo.  The meeting is to be at Sarajevo airport at about noon (1100  GMT), Shadbolt said.    UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Canadian  Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman had said earlier Tuesday that  while a ceasefire was generally holding in Sarajevo there were  reports of trench-digging by Bosnian troops in attempts to  advance their lines. He said violations on the Serb side  consisted of sniper fire and that there had been small-arms  shooting on both sides.</p>

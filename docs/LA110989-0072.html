			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> YMCA ASKS FOR BICYCLES  </P> <P> The Hollywood YMCA is asking for the public's help in replacing $10,000 worth  of bicycles and equipment destroyed in a Malibu fire last month.  </P> <P> The bicycles, tools and helmets would have been used in the Hollywood Y's  Adventure Trails program, which exposes inner-city children to nature in the  Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> "We have these mountains that ring our entire city, and a lot of these kids can  see them in the distance but that's about it," said Larry Shaw, director of the  Hollywood YMCA Counseling Center.  </P> <P> Each year between 45 and 50 groups and agencies, such as Youth Gang Services  and the Boys and Girls Club of Venice, bring at-risk and developmentally  disabled young people to participate in the program.  </P> <P> Thousands of children, many of whom have never seen more than a few trees in  their neighborhoods, have gone on the bike rides, Shaw said.  </P> <P> A loss of funding last year forced the program to shut down, but with a grant  from the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and a private donation the program  was due to start again this month.  </P> <P> The fire has left the Hollywood YMCA uncertain if it can resume the rides this  year.  </P> <P> One organization, the Kiwanis Club of Hollywood, has pledged three bicycles to  the group, but much more is needed.  </P> <P> "We still have 20 bikes to go, and a storage shed and helmets and a lot of  equipment," Shaw said.  </P> <P> At least $10,000 is needed to get the program on its feet again.  </P> <P> The YMCA is asking bicycle shops, corporations, businesses and individuals to  make tax-deductible donations of money or equipment.  </P> <P> If the program does not receive enough donations to start by the end of the  year, it will have to return the grant money.  </P></p>

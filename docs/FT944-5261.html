			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Industry supports pro-EU Tories Some of Britain's leading industrial companies - including Glaxo, Grand Metropolitan and Enterprise Oil - have given financial backing to a new pro-European pressure group inside the Conservative party. As Tory Euro-rebels continue to challenge Mr John Major's government over European Union integration, the new group, called Action Centre for Europe, is to lead a fight-back by Conservatives committed to British membership of the EU. The group was founded by Lord Howe, the former cabinet minister, earlier this year. Among senior politicians who have joined its advisory council are Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr David Hunt, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and Sir Leon Brittan, one of the UK's EU commissioners. A group of banks and business organisations have already pledged about Pounds 50,000 to set up the organisation, which will argue the pro-European case within the Tory party in the run up to the EU's inter-governmental conference in 1996. The list of sponsors includes Salomon Brothers, the merchant bank. It is understood that strong interest in the organisation has also been shown by NM Rothschild, the merchant bank, De La Rue, the bank note printer, Pirelli, the Italian tyremaker, and the Andersen Consulting group. ICL and General Utilities have also shown interest. Representatives of some of these organisations attended a lunch in London last Friday hosted by Sir Leon Brittan and Lord Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey National bank. According to Conservative party sources, the centre will provide information to MPs and public figures about European issues. It is to launch a series of high-profile conferences next year outlining how the UK can develop in the EU. It aims to counter the role of the European Foundation, an anti-Maastricht think-tank. 'The anti-Europeans get lots of information and help from the European Foundation,' said one of the centre's leading figures. 'I would hope that pro-Europeans would get the same from us.' The development of the group is being seen by senior Conservatives as another indication that the pro-European wing of the party is preparing to wage a tough fight for its principles. Last week it was reported that the party as a whole had suffered a big fall in cash gifts from companies. The Labour Research Department, an organisation funded mainly by unions, said its researchers could find only 168 companies that had made donations in the year to March to the Conservative party - the lowest such figure its annual survey had ever found.</p>

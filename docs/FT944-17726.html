			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals rally peters out - Market report A burst of speculative buying and short-covering that lifted all London Metal Exchange contracts at midday yesterday vanished in the afternoon and prices drifted back. COPPER'S renewed strength, which saw the three months price top Dollars 2,530 a tonne at one stage, helped ALUMINIUM reach its medium term target of Dollars 1,650 a tonne before being hit by the inevitable bout of profit-taking. This saw last business at Dollars 1,640, unchanged from Tuesday. Investment funds were reported to be active again in the ZINC market, still considered a laggard compared with the impressive rises seen in some other metals this year. At the close of the afternoon ring three months zinc stood at Dollars 1,063.50 a tonne, up Dollars 6 on the day and Dollars 34 on the week so far. London COCOA futures plunged late in the day following the New York market, which fell to a new 5-month low at midday. The GOLD market returned to its bullish track after fund buying emerged in New York. The London price found support at Dollars 392 a troy ounce and closed at Dollars 392.70, up 30 cents. 'There is feeling that the recent sell-off. . . was really just consolidation and profit-taking,' one trader said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

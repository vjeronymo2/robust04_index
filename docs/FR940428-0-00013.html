			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Northeast also recommends that the Commission amend the rule to permit an acquisition of up to 10% of the voting securities of a local enterprise. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under Northeast's proposal, a regulated company could become an affiliate or a holding company of a local business, without the need to apply for or receive Commission approval. The Commission declines to follow this recommendation. Rule 40(a)(5) requires that an acquisition not result in an affiliation with the issuer. This requirement is intended to ensure that the rule is not used to circumvent the requirements of sections 9, 10 and 11, consistent with the limited scope of section 9(c)(3). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission declines to expand the scope of the rule, as requested by Northeast. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 40(a)(5) provides in pertinent part that the exemption will not apply where ``by reason of such acquisition, [the local enterprise] will become an affiliate of the company acquiring the securities.'' The Act defines an affiliate to include any company of which 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities are owned by a specified company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Michigan Consol.

Rule 41(c): Exemption of Public-Utility Subsidiaries With Respect to Limited Acquisition of Utility Assets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 9(a)(1) of the Act, companies in a registered system generally require Commission approval, by order upon application, before acquiring utility assets. Rule 41(c) provides a limited exception to this requirement for the acquisition by a system public-utility company of electric utility assets that are, or immediately following the transaction will be, connected with electric utility assets that the acquiring company already owns and operates, or gas utility assets that are located in, or adjacent to, the service area in which the acquiring company already owns and operates gas utility assets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The existing rule limits the amount of such acquisitions to the lesser of $100,000 or 5% of the acquirer's gross utility revenues in a given calendar year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 250.41(c). Compare section 9(b)(1) (a system company can acquire an unlimited amount of utility assets if the acquisitions have been expressly authorized by a state commission). Rule 41(c) was adopted under section 3(d), which authorizes the Commission to make rules exempting companies from the obligations, duties, or liabilities imposed on them as ``subsidiary companies'' or ``affiliates,'' as defined by the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment would increase the annual limit to the lesser of $5 million or 5% of the gross annual revenues that the acquiring company derived from its operations as a public-utility company during the preceding calendar year. The commenters uniformly supported this amendment. The Commission is adopting the rule as proposed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Item 2 of Form U5S generally requires a registered holding company to disclose any acquisitions of ``utility plant in service or under construction of any electric utility company or retail gas utility company for the production, transmission or distribution of electric energy or distribution of natural or manufactured gas.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Rule 42(b): Acquisition, Retirement and Redemption of Securities by the Issuer Thereof  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Transactions by which a company in a registered system acquires, retires or redeems a security of which it is the issuer (or which it has assumed or guaranteed) generally require Commission approval by order upon application under sections 9(a), 10 and 12(c), and rules thereunder. At present, rule 42(b) provides a limited exemption to this requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed amendment would expand the rule to exempt all transactions in which a system company acquires, retires or redeems a security of which it is the issuer (or which it has assumed or guaranteed).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (b) of the present rule exempts: (1) the retirement of treasury securities; (2) the acquisition, retirement or redemption of any evidence of indebtedness, at maturity or otherwise, for the consideration specifically designated therein; (3) the acquisition, retirement or redemption of any security pursuant to a conversion privilege; (4) the acquisition, retirement or redemption of any evidence of indebtedness in accordance with any indenture requirement then applicable, or in an aggregate amount estimated not to exceed the amount of any sinking fund or other periodic requirement for the following twelve months; (5) the acquisition, retirement or redemption in any calendar year of not more than two percent of the amount of a given class of securities; and (6) the acquisition, retirement or redemption of any securities, other than common stock, at a cost not exceeding $50,000 in any calendar year. 17 CFR 250.42(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the amendment, system companies could more easily adjust their capital ratios in response to changing economic conditions. Commenters, citing the important role of the capital markets in regulating the capital structures of publicly-held corporations, uniformly support expansion of the exemption. The Commission recognizes that rating agencies, financial institutions and state regulators play important roles in ensuring appropriate capital ratios for public-utility companies. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In other matters, the Commission has recognized the role of rating agencies in analyzing structured financings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Exclusion from the Definition of Investment Company for Structured Financings, Investment Company Act Release No. 19105, 57 FR 56248 (Nov. 27, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To forestall potential abuse, the exemption remains unavailable for affiliate transactions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  CNG asks the Commission to modify this exclusion to exempt the acquisition of shares of common stock pursuant to the exchange and tax withholding provisions of an employee benefit plan. The commenter states that the modification is necessary because the rule, at present, does not exempt transactions with the officers and directors of system companies, who are affiliates of such companies within the meaning of the Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission declines to adopt this recommendation.

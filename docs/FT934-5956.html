			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (8): 'Preferable to the M25' - Relocation / employers tell Richard Evans their reasons The smart entrance lobby to the Laurentian Life headquarters outside Gloucester was buzzing at two o'clock, as dozens of employees returned by coach from a shopping expedition to the city centre. Coaches leave at noon and 1pm each working day, to enable the financial group's staff to shop during their lunch break; and buses are also laid on each morning and evening, to and from the city centre. It is part of the company's package of policies to keep the workforce happy in a purpose-built headquarters two miles from the city centre, following a move from Guildford in 1986. The financial sector has appreciated the benefit of relocating away from city centres and the expensive south-east more than most, but Gloucestershire has managed to persuade a wide range of organisations to set up headquarters in the county. Among them are Colt Cars, Spirax-Sarco Engineering, Nuclear Electric, Kraft General Foods, and the Countryside Commission. Laurentian traces its origins back to 1896 and the formation of Imperial Life Assurance of Canada. UK offices were opened in 1931, and in 1977 Imperial merged its operations with Laurentian Group Corporation of Canada. In 1987, the size of the UK operation was doubled when Imperial acquired Trident Life, to form Laurentian Life. Imperial was based in Guildford and Trident life in Gloucester, so the management had to decide where to base the combined operation. Three options were considered: locating everyone in either Guildford or Gloucester, or choosing a new base such as Bristol, Southampton or Bournemouth. 'It was quickly decided that an entirely new site would involve too great a commercial risk, and there was only so much disruption the company fabric should be asked to take. It became a straight choice between Guildford add Gloucester,' says Mr lain Tweeddale, managing director of Laurentian Life. It was not an easy choice, however. The Guildford building could have accommodated all the staff, but overheads were much higher. Office space in Guildford in 1986 was Pounds 12 a square foot, compared with Pounds 5 in Gloucester. A move to Gloucester would entail building a new headquarters, but salary differentials and a much lower staff turnover would bring substantial benefits. The decision went in favour of Gloucester, to the irritation of many former Imperial employees who thought they should have called the shots as the senior partner in the merger. Around 150 of the 450 Guildford staff decided to relocate to Gloucester, and a further 200 people were recruited locally in a hectic six-month initial training period. The original intention had been to relocate when the new headquarters was built, but it was then decided to move immediately, because of the danger of flagging morale in a long rundown period. Temporary offices were taken at Mitcheldean, in the Forest of Dean, in premises made vacant by a Rank Xerox cutback, and staff were bussed to and from Gloucester for two years. The landscaped new headquarters in the Gloucester suburb of Barnwood now houses not only the administrative staff but also the whole investment team, who manage the Pounds 1.5bn investments from a purpose-built dealing room. Among the factors that tipped the balance in favour of Gloucester were: housing, with an average house Pounds 25,000 cheaper than in the south-east; education, which was seen as being at least as good as in Guildford; and availability of staff. 'We have had no difficulty in recruiting high calibre people, happy to live in this part of the world . . . anything to get away from the M25,' says Mr Tweeddale. One advantage of Gloucester for financial services is that it is within easy motorway range of both Birmingham and Bristol, with their well developed financial sectors, and this makes specialist recruitment easier. Another company that has found little difficulty in recruiting technical staff in what has traditionally been regarded as a rural county is Spirax-Sarco Engineering, specialists in the control of fluids. The company moved to Cheltenham from central London in 1939, because of apprehension about the outbreak of war, and now employs 1,000 at its headquarters and 3,000 worldwide. Mr Tim Fortune, group managing director, has found no employment problems, partly because of skills acquired in the local aerospace and defence industries. 'We find the workforce is particularly stable and loyal,' he says. The Colt Car Company, importers and distributors of Mitsubishi cars, did not make quite such a calculated decision as Laurentian to set up head- quarters in the county. It happened largely because a couple of the directors lived in the area when the company was launched, and it seemed a more desirable and cheaper base than London. The company was founded in 1974, as a joint-venture partnership with Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan, and thefirst office was in four rented rooms in Dollar Street House, a converted mansion in the heart of Cirencester. The historic market town was chosen partly for its convenience for the directors, and partly because of its more general convenience as a natural crossroads since Roman times. It has ready access to London and the south-east, Wales and the south-west, the Midlands and the north. By 1976 the company had outgrown the small offices, and moved to new purpose-built accommodation in nearby Spitalgate Lane. A second move followed 10 years ago, when the expanding company moved to its present headquarters on a six-acre freehold site at Watermoor on the outskirts of Cirencester. Because of Cirencester's historic past, and the fact that the building is the first the visitor sees when travelling from London and the M4, planning restrictions were stringent. The main building, next to an old coaching inn on the Roman Fosse Way, is restricted to two storeys and shaped like a W to hide a big industrial warehouse. The complex houses all the company's sales, parts, marketing, accounting and computer functions. Colt ran its own dock and shipping compound at Newport, in south Wales, from 1974 until last August, but the operation has just been transferred to the Royal Portbury Dock in Bristol, where larger vessels can be berthed and unloaded. Colt tries to make the most of its local connections, and uses local legal, technical and support services as much as possible. It is currently sponsoring the locally-based Badminton horse trials.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WHAT FARM WORKERS NEED IS A LONG-TERM HOUSING SOLUTION  </P> <P> Periodically, the plight of farm workers, especially migrants, is brought to  the public's attention with great force. Such has been the case at Valle Verde,  a Carlsbad encampment that is being torn down by order of the county Department  of Health Services.  </P> <P> Living there and in other North County camps -- in "spider holes" or shacks  made of sticks, cardboard boxes, plastic bags and twine -- are farm workers  whose literally backbreaking labor helps return millions of dollars in  agricultural profits.  </P> <P> Such pockets of misery can be found throughout California's farmlands, but  North County -- from North City West up to Rainbow and across to Pauma Valley  -- is incomparable in terms of sheer numbers of homeless workers and the  stunning juxtaposition of mansions and hovels.  </P> <P> Moreover, nowhere else in the state -- and perhaps even the country -- do the  living conditions of farm workers so consistently outdo those exposed in Edward  R. Murrow's classic "Harvest of Shame" broadcast nearly 30 years ago.  </P> <P> Although brutal awareness of this problem alone will not resolve it, publicity  can help create a political atmosphere in which positive steps can be taken.  </P> <P> Valle Verde cries out for short-term solutions, such as emergency shelter for  those displaced. It also raises questions about the county's role in  aggravating an already critical situation by triggering mass evictions from  relatively isolated encampments unlikely to pose an immediate threat to the  larger community's health.  </P> <P> However, Valle Verde also underscores the need to build decent and affordable  farm-worker housing. Two North County realities serve to drive home the  inescapable need for this long-term solution.  </P> <P> One is that the majority of North County's farm workers now have temporary work  permits and are on their way to obtaining permanent residency. Increasingly,  their families are following them here. The U. S. Border Patrol itself  calculates that documented laborers make up about 65% of the migrant work  force. Living in encampments can no longer be dismissed as a deliberate choice  by workers who need to "hide out." The truth is that these minimum-wage (at  best), seasonal and often underemployed workers simply cannot afford the area's  high rents -- much less the many deposits that renting entails.  </P> <P> The other fact is that, despite the heavy pressures of urbanization,  agriculture is here to stay. For the foreseeable future, the year-round demand  for agricultural laborers will remain fairly stable. It may come as a big  surprise that San Diego County ranks 12th among California's 58 counties in  volume of agricultural production -- having recently raised its standing from  13th.  </P> <P> According to state Department of Food and Agriculture reports, the production  of highly labor-intensive crops has increased markedly over the past 15 years.  Only vegetable production experienced a decline, of 20%. Strawberry production  has doubled. Avocado acreage has nearly tripled and citrus acreage has expanded  18%. Nursery crop production has grown so much that San Diego County is now the  state's leading producer of horticultural products.  </P> <P> Data from the San Diego Assn. of Governments suggest that agricultural  employment will remain essentially unchanged through the year 2010 (the  farthest date of projection). A study commissioned by my organization,  California Rural Legal Assistance, examined crop acreage due for development  and expects only an 8% reduction in agricultural employment for the foreseeable  future. If forecasts on the growth in demand for horticultural products are  correct, such employment may actually increase.  </P> <P> To put this into some perspective, the most conservative estimates -- based  only on wages paid subject to withholding and Social Security taxes -- is that,  in any given month, San Diego County employs about 11,400 workers in  agriculture.  </P> <P> What this adds up to is: San Diego County will continue to have many  agricultural workers, most of whom will not earn enough to secure decent and  affordable housing.  </P> <P> The first concrete step toward providing that housing these workers need has  been taken by Assemblyman Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad), who is reintroducing a  bill to provide state seed money for the construction of a 500-unit  migrant-labor center. Under the Frazee bill, the remaining money must come from  other sources, such as the federal government (the Farmers Home Administration,  for example), local government (such as funds from redevelopment and community  development block grants) and private sources.  </P> <P> The state has built 26 migrant labor centers in 14 counties to house farm  workers and their families at subsidized rates of $2 to $4 a day. Typically,  growers or local governments donated the land.  </P> <P> None of the centers is south of Kern County. Such lopsided distribution is  largely the result of resistance from local governments. For instance, the  less-than-eager reception given last year by San Diego County to a similar bill  provided the governor with a "lack-of-local-support" excuse to kill it. A  couple of years ago, through the efforts of Assemblyman Bill Bradley  (R-Escondido), $1.4 million was made available for a farm labor center here.  The funds were lost to Riverside County because of little interest on the part  of San Diego County's Department of Housing and Community Development.  </P> <P> A migrant labor center only begins to touch the need. There are many other  efforts that can be launched at the same time -- ranging from the  rehabilitation of badly substandard houses and trailers in grower-owned farm  labor camps, to the construction of "self-help" homes for year-round workers  for whom subsidized homeownership is feasible. These are the subjects of a  working group of county and city representatives recently convened by Frazee.  </P> <P> To find lasting solutions, it will take a united commitment by the county and  cities. This is also an opportunity for agribusiness, nonprofit developers and  local lending institutions to join in.  </P> <P> If there is not a failure of will, solutions are possible.  </P></p>

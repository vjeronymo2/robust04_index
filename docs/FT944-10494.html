			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Leading Article: The new US prospect Voting against government is one thing: making it work better is another. The Republican party won its landslide in Tuesday's Congressional elections by campaigning against President Clinton, and against a Democrat-controlled Congress. The fear must be that the new rulers of Congress will bring the same negativism to the job of government. Come January, Republicans will have control over both Houses of Congress, for the first time in over 40 years. For many, the results of the election are a recipe for two years of unrelenting legislative gridlock. It was certainly difficult to see the seeds of bipartisanship in the campaign. However, the very size of the Republican victory provides grounds for optimism. With control in their hands, party leaders such as Senator Bob Dole risk finding it is their turn to suffer from electors' frustrations in 1996. Mr Dole claims to want to use his new position as Senate majority leader to forge coalitions rather than frustrate them. But his own presidential ambitions - and his more stridently partisan colleagues - may prevent him from translating this noble aim into practice. Thankfully, the medium-term outlook for the economy relies more on Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, than it does on Mr Dole. As Mr Clinton has discovered, the US economic and political cycles are currently little correlated. To judge by yesterday's rally in the dollar, investors believe the Republicans' victory has strengthened Mr Greenspan's hand in his efforts to keep a lid on inflation. But the arguments favouring a rise in US interest rates are no stronger  - or weaker - than they were before the vote. Important casualties For the rest of the world, the more important potential casualties of Congressional gridlock would be in US trade and budgetary policy. Mr Dole will face a test on the first of these on November 29, when the 'lame-duck' 103rd Congress will finally vote on the ratification of the treaty agreed in the Uruguay round of the Gatt. Mr Clinton will doubtless use his upcoming trade talks in Asia and Latin America to reassure America's trading partners that the country's commitment to free trade has not been dented by recent events. But it is up to Mr Dole to ensure that the treaty gets the required number of Republican votes. Since the 'fast-track procedure' for voting on the agreement applies only to the current Congress, a failed vote could signify the death of the treaty altogether. It would, moreover, be the ultimate signal that the US is set to turn inward in the coming years. America first Republicans co-operated with Mr Clinton to get the Nafta treaty passed in 1993. For all the 'America first-ism' of many a recent Republican campaign, there must be at least even odds that they will do so with regard to Gatt. The odds on a serious attempt to reduce the budget deficit over the next two years must be considerably slimmer. The Republicans' election manifesto in this area, the 'Contract with America' published in September, does not bode well. Like many of the party's past fiscal proposals, it is highly specific on popular policies like middle-class tax cuts and a balanced budget amendment, but vague, to say the least, on how the one is to be combined with the other. President Clinton shares the ambition for a middle class tax cut. But he too has shied away from specifying the cuts in entitlement programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid which would be necessary to pay for such a tax cut. The Kerrey Commission on entitlement reform, which will report in December, will point to the drastic reforms needed, even on current tax rates, to stop the deficit rising in future. A Congress born of a campaign less steeped in political opportunism than this one, might - just might - have used the commission's proposals as a basis for constructive legislation. It is up to the Republicans to decide whether they can transcend the negativism which brought them victory.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- China is taking steps  to intensify its auditing supervision over government revenues  and expenditures by legal steps.    In the process it will retreat from overall examinations of  all financial accounts of state-owned enterprises, but focus on  key industries and aspects relevant to government interests.    This was revealed by Guo Zhenqian, auditor-general of the  State Auditing Administration (SAA), at the Eighth Standing  Committee meeting of the National People's Congress, which  opened here today.    He was submitting the country's first draft auditing law for  deliberation.    These measures are intended to safeguard the soundness of  the  state treasury and promote the establishment of a modern  corporate system as the nation pursues a drive toward a market  economy, he said.    Currently, auditing organizations only supervise and audit  treasury accounts of government branches or subordinate local  governments.    In the new draft law they are entitled to examine the  treasury accounts of government branches of their same rank.    Guo said this will help safeguard government budgets by  strengthening control and supervision over their implementation,  and will make it easier for governments at various levels to  locate financial problems and solve them. The draft auditing  law, with seven chapters and 46 clauses, also makes stipulations  on other aspects of China's auditing system, auditing  organizations, auditors' rights and duties, auditing procedures,  legal responsibilities and others.    Guo said that the draft law conforms to the relevant item in  China's Constitution. It is based on the experience of the  country's auditing work, with reference to foreign auditing  legislation experience.</p>

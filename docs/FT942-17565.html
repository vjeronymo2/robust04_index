			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Wall Street blues Judging by the price falls of recent days, fear has a head start over greed in the minds of US investors at present. Wall Street falls on Mexican assassinations, Wall Street falls on trade worries with Japan. Behind the excuses, Wall Street falls because once the prop of 6 per cent bond yields is removed, the yield on shares looks very meagre indeed. The vertigo and price falls are made worse by the heavy flow of speculative money into capital markets last year, which is now starting to reverse. In the face of such psychology, this year's earnings recovery is small consolation. It may take some stability in the US Treasury bond market to restore confidence to equities. The fear that short term interest rates may rise above 5 per cent next year in an effort to bring growth down to a non-inflationary rate has sparked a rise in bond yields to 7 per cent. Yesterday's employment data, showing the strongest monthly job creation since 1987, reinforce the impression of strong economic growth. While rising inflation is not yet obvious, a lack of surplus capacity means that it may not be far away. Once the scale of the problem is better gauged, a gap between short and long interest rates of 2 percentage points should be perfectly sustainable. Before then, however, uncertainty and natural over-reaction may force long rates higher. US equities may well suffer too, since there is little incentive to buy and speculative hedge funds are being forced to sell. There is fundamental value in shares, but until the immediate pressures start to moderate, that may pass unnoticed.</p>

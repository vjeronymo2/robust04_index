The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments from interested persons on the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I.

The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In mid 1993, NSCC determined that the initially established fee structure for providing Mutual Fund Services Networking position files was no longer appropriate. On August 18, 1993, NSCC filed a rule change <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  which consisted of a waiver of $99 of the $100 fee charged to members for excess Networking position files. That filing indicated that the waiver would continue while NSCC determined a more appropriate fee. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to establish a revised fee for the Networking position records. The new fee structure is based on the number of records received by a participating broker and the number of subaccounts the broker maintains on the system. Effective January 1, 1994, for billing in February 1994, the new fee is $1.50 per thousand records received by a broker in excess of the number of subaccounts the broker maintains on Networking. NSCC will not assess a charge when the difference between these numbers is 5000 records or less in a month. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32912 (September 16, 1993), 58 FR 49536 [File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;93&hyph;12]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed fee change will provide for a more equitable allocation of fees among members, so the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

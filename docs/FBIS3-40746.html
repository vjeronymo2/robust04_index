A reverse process is occurring there and the Arab  majority is growing significantly.    Numerous links were formed between the city and its environs  in a series of known areas. Greater Jerusalem is a metropolis  whose borders spread north to Ramallah, south to Gush Etziyon,  east to Ma'ale Adumim, and west to Bet Shemesh.    Many settlements in this area have in fact become Jerusalem  neighborhoods. The jurisdictional area of Jerusalem, on the one  hand, and the autonomy settlements between Israel and the PLO,  which are supposed to also apply to the metropolitan area of the  city, on the other hand, are creating an area of hundreds of  thousands of dunams, which is, in fact, a gray area, not really  Jerusalem, at least not according to the definition of  jurisdictional borders, and not really the autonomy, at least  not according to the reality on the ground.    This gray area now requires an updated definition. There is  no lack of functional solutions as such or other solutions that  can apply to this region. It is possible to annex an additional  area to the municipality of Jerusalem without annexing it to the  State of Israel. This issue was previously examined and an  opinion on the matter was submitted to the director general for  Jerusalem affairs. The metropolitan area can also be included,  or part of it, in the planning borders of the urban planning  committee (without annexation). It is also possible to draft  various models of joint functional administration in the  metropolitan areas which will enable the continuation of Israel  supervision of what goes on there.    There has already been an Israeli interest in defining the  metropolitan boundaries and its status in the future and, even  more, the fixing of facts is clear, principally against the  background of the Palestinian goal of accelerated building to  the south, east, and north and the migration of Palestinians  from the Hebron area to the periphery of Jerusalem. The  Palestinians are not concealing their plans to build  peripherally around the city in order to close Jerusalem in on  three sides and return the city to the status of a city without  an exit.    Ramallah has already quickly expanded toward Jerusalem. In  the eastern part of the city is a neighborhood continuum  northward with the Old City to the south. And even Bethlehem  and Bayt Jala are being connected to Jerusalem on the south.  The relation of Jews to Arabs in the metropolitan area  (including Jerusalem) is 50 percent-50 percent.    The forecast for the year 2000 is 40 percent-60 percent  with an Arab majority. The different orientations of the two  sectors--the Arabs building mainly on the north-south axis and  the Jews on the east-west axis--adds another dimension of  competition on the ground. Against this reality, at least for  the meantime, areas west of Jerusalem that have recently been  annexed to the city must be granted, and emphasis must also be  placed on development of the eastern side, and not only for  political reasons. On the west, forest areas have been  designated as large reserve lands for west Jerusalem. The  urbanization of the western area will indeed damage the green  health of the city and many agricultural areas in `Emeq  Ha'arzim. It will be very expensive to build on these lands.    Against the expense of building and the ecological damage,  which would be caused on the east, is a desolate rocky area of  land that is not suitable for anything except an urban  settlement. The proof of this is that there are thousands of  young couples and others seeking to live in Jerusalem  neighborhoods who are finding Ma'ale Adumim a solution for cheap  housing. Most of the area between Ma'ale Adumim and Pisgat  Ze'ev is uninhabited, but if settled immediately becomes de  facto annexation, not de jure, which is not now possible.    Another area adjoining the city that is sought and has a  sparce Arab populace is located to the north and west of the  city in the area between Ramot and Giv'at Ze'ev. The  urbanization of this area west toward Mivaseret and Sha'ar Hagay  does not alter the fact that the central area around which  Jerusalem has grown is the area of the Old City. Ma'ale Adumim  is located only 5 km (by air) from the Old City. The new areas  that have been annexed to the city on the west are much further.    Rabin's government, which continues to populate metropolitan  Jerusalem (Ma'ale Adumim, Efrat, Gush Etziyon, and Giv'at Ze'ev)  needs to operate in coordination with the Jerusalem municipality  in order to expand the city eastward. Both have a clear  interest in separating the defined area as metropolitan  Jerusalem from the area of the Palestinian self-administered  territory, and the appropriate time for doing this is now.</p>

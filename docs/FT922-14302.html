			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Technology: Promoting use and development of Inmos transputer AN INTERNATIONAL body has been formed to promote the use and development of the Inmos transputer, the UK-developed 'computer on a chip', writes Ian Holdsworth. The Transputer Consortium (TTC) picks up the baton from an earlier scheme, the Transputer Initiative, which ended last week after providing Pounds 2.9m of government funding to six regional transputer centres at British universities over the last five years. The new body, no longer funded by the government, will be a forum for national user groups and suppliers of the transputer, a chip which is used as a building block for making powerful parallel-processing computers. The consortium aims to carry forward the earlier project's achievements. 'It's all about sharing experience and knowledge,' says Mike Jane, the scheme's co-ordinator. TTC will develop and promote standards among users and provide a mechanism for influencing funding agencies. TTC has five founding members. Parsys, Parsytec, Transtech and 3L are companies that sell transputer-based processors or software. The fifth member is the chip's inventor, Inmos, a once-British company bought by the French-Italian group SGS-Thomson in 1989.</p>

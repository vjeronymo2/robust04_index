			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EDISON RECOVERS AFTER SLOW START  </P> <P> You could excuse the Edison High School fans gathered at Orange Coast College  Friday night for taking a quick check of their programs in the first quarter to  make sure that Crespi star Russell White had indeed graduated.  </P> <P> When Leonice Brown sprinted up the middle for a 65-yard touchdown -- leaving  Edison defenders farther behind with each stride -- it looked as if the  Chargers might be in for a long night. The kind of night Crespi's opponents  endured for the past four years facing White, who holds the Southern Section  career rushing record with 5,998 yards.  </P> <P> But the Edison defense ended Brown's impersonation of White in a hurry, holding  the Crespi back to five more yards in his next eight carries. And the Edison  offense, which had been giving a clinic in self-destruction during the early  going, righted itself and the Chargers came away with a 20-10 victory in the  first round of the Southern Section Division I playoffs.  </P> <P> They meet Eisenhower Friday night.  </P> <P> Actually, the star back on this night was Edison's Shane Sherman, a sure-footed  5-foot-11, 175-pound senior who picked his way through the Crespi defense for  153 yards and both Charger touchdowns.  </P> <P> "There were some big holes out there tonight," Sherman said. "I just tried to  read the blocks and make the right moves."  </P> <P> The Chargers started out making all the wrong moves. Mostly on the line of  scrimmage . . . before the ball was snapped. A pair of illegal procedure  penalties ended their first drive. And early in the second quarter, they drove  to the Crespi one-yard line, where they were whistled for back-to-back illegal  procedure calls and had to settle for a 28-yard Doug Merlino field goal.  </P> <P> Edison finally put together an error-free, 80-yard drive, with quarterback  Donnie Smith completing passes of 12, 33 and then a 22-yard shovel pass to  Sherman. Sherman popped through for a nine-yard touchdown run with 1:18 left in  the half and Edison led, 10-7, at the intermission.  </P> <P> "We thought we should have had more points at halftime," Edison Coach Dave  White said. "We were killing ourselves."  </P> <P> Crespi tied the score on a 29-yard field goal by Bill Canalez midway through  the third quarter, but Sherman and the defense took over after that. Sherman  capped another 80-yard drive with a two-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> And defensive back Mike Cunningham ended Crespi's final scoring threat when he  picked off a Danny LaCava pass in the corner of the end zone. Merlino's 27-yard  field goal put the game out of Crespi's reach with 2:11 left to play.  </P></p>

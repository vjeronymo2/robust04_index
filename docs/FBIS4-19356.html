			<p>BFN     [Text] Helsinki, April 18 (AFP) -- Finland will join NATO's  Partnership for Peace [PFP] Programme aimed at improving  military cooperation with the former Soviet bloc, the Finnish  president said Monday [18 April].    President Martti Ahtisaari's statement came after the  governmental committee on foreign affairs recommended that  neutral Finland should be associated with the North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation programme.    Finland will, however, restrict its participation to  peacekeeping operations, search, rescue and humanitarian  functions and environmental protection.    A government statement stressed Monday that Finland was not  seeking any new defence solutions by way of the NATO Partnership  for Peace.    The government has not decided when the documents will be  signed, but foreign ministry sources said that Foreign Minister  Heikki Haavisto is likely to sign the programme in Brussels  early next month.</p>

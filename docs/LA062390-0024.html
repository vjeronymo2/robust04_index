			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON VITAMINS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN  </P> <P> The headline ("Skip Vitamins, Pregnant Women Told") and the lead in your  front-page article were not fully in sync with all the information presented in  the rest of the article -- including legitimate viewpoints favoring supplement  use by pregnant women because of deficiencies in their diets.  </P> <P> Many dietary surveys show a high frequency of deficient diets in the United  States, with young women some of the worst offenders.  </P> <P> Indeed, supplement use prevents certain birth defects. A recent signed  editorial comment in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. stated, "The  biggest challenge . . . about the benefits of taking vitamins is to get women  of childbearing age to hear and follow this simple advice."  </P> <P> The National Academy of Sciences committee members whose report you cited are  not omniscient. Nutritionists with credentials equal or superior to theirs  differ greatly over the benefits of supplement use by pregnant women. The  committee is not even consistent -- concern with possible nutrient interaction  (iron's interference with zinc absorption) was not reflected in its advice to  take iron supplements during pregnancy.  </P> <P> Even though the committee admits to "considerable variation in nutrient  requirements among individuals," its report failed to identify how physicians  can determine their patients' requirements. In fact, no method that is both  inexpensive and reliable is available.  </P> <P> BURTON KALLMAN  </P> <P> Director, Science and Technology  </P> <P> National Nutritional Foods Assn.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

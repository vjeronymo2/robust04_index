			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Sharp fall in Genentech earnings GENENTECH, the California-based biotechnology company that was taken over in 1990 by Roche Holdings of Switzerland, yesterday reported net profits of Dollars 20.8m, or 18 cents a share, for 1992. Earnings were less than half the Dollars 44.3m, or 39 cents, achieved in 1991, but in line with market expectations. Genentech had previously forecast profits of more than Dollars 18m for 1992, saying the year-on-year decline was due to an anticipated increase in research and development expenses. Net profits for the fourth quarter of 1992 were Dollars 6.2m, compared with a break-even result in the same period of 1991. The decline in full-year earnings occurred despite a 6 per cent rise in total revenues, to Dollars 544.3m. Fourth-quarter revenues were up 19 per cent at Dollars 142m. Research and development spending in 1992 was 26 per cent higher at Dollars 278.6m.</p>

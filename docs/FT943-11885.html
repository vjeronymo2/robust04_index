			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Acas rail talks still only about talks Delicate behind-the-scenes talks were going on yesterday with the conciliation service Acas in an attempt to establish an agreed framework for a return to the negotiating table in the signalling staff dispute. Both Railtrack and the RMT transport union were holding bilateral discussions with Acas officials, but it was unclear last night how quickly the two sides could restart formal bargaining on a settlement of the seven-week conflict. A Railtrack official said: 'We do not want to resume negotiations formally if we find this simply leads once more to a dead end.' Last time the two sides met there were 13 exhausting hours of talks, ending in breakdown at 3am on July 12. Neither Railtrack nor the RMT negotiators want to endure a repetition of those negotiations. Yesterday Acas officers were trying to discover whether enough movement had taken place on both sides to justify a resumption of formal talks. A Railtrack official said: 'We have to clear up the ambiguities.' The company is prepared to negotiate flexibly on its current pay offer, with early improvements in wages for signalling workers before completion of the whole restructuring package. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT general secretary, said his union was ready to negotiate on restructuring as a whole, although until now it has insisted on an interim pay rise for past efficiencies. Railtrack yesterday said that one in seven signalmen was working normally in defiance of the 48-hour strike that ends at noon today. It said that 162 signallers out of a possible 1,200 covering a normal shift were working alongside supervisors at noon yesterday, enabling Railtrack to open 236 signal boxes, 21.3 per cent of the total. The company added that 34 per cent of the network was opened as a result, with services operating for the first time on several important commuter routes in south-east England. Mr John Ellis, Railtrack's production director, said: 'The situation is looking good for a smooth return to normal operations from midday today.' The next strike will be for 24 hours from noon on Wednesday to noon the following day. The RMT is due to announce the result of its strike ballot of its 550 supervisors on August 4. If they back the dispute, it could lead to a sharp escalation of the conflict after August 11, the first day the supervisors could be lawfully involved.</p>

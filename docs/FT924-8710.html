Mr Baker said the reorganisation of the UK electricity industry had shown there was no 'immutable law which says electricity prices can only go up, not down.' Competition was already providing significant impetus towards lower prices when in Europe as a whole real prices tended to remain stubbornly high. 'One reason is that a number of European countries have preferred a policy of subsidising uneconomic domestic energy sources to buying more competitively prices fuel in open world markets,' he said. Mr James Hann, chairman of Scottish Nuclear, speaking at the same conference, called on the government to take a longer term approach to energy planning and to move more rapidly towards a coherent energy policy for the UK.

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / German GDP figure lifts recovery hopes: Rexrodt gives cautious welcome to upturn THE German economy's downward slide appears to have bottomed out, with the latest figures for west German gross domestic product showing a 0.5 per cent recovery in the second quarter. While the year-on-year figure still shows a decline of 1.9 per cent in GDP compared with the same period in 1992, the 0.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter advance is the first sign of recovery after four periods of negative or zero growth. The figure, released by the Economics Ministry yesterday, comes on top of industrial order figures for German manufacturing industry published on Monday, which showed a 3 per cent recovery in July compared with June, reflecting primarily a 4.5 per cent pick-up in domestic orders. The latest statistics were greeted with cautious optimism yesterday by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, although he admitted it was 'premature to interpret the recent slight upward movement as a clear signal that we have reached an economic turning point. 'It shows that the first rays of light indicating the end of the recession are now unmistakable,' he said. Year-on-year, the figures published by the federal statistics office in Wiesbaden still show some dramatic declines in economic activity. In constant prices, capital investment was down 17 per cent in the second quarter, compared with the same period in 1992, and exports of goods and services fell by 8.3 per cent. In contrast, construction investment advanced by 1.6 per cent in constant prices. Mr Rexrodt said caution was still necessary because of the unchecked decline of both private sector investment and exports. He warned that the stabilisation would not mean an immediate slowdown in unemployment growth. Unemployment in west Germany reached 7.5 per cent, or 2.3m, in July. The latest figures provided welcome relief for the German government to coincide with the first reading of the 1994 budget in the Bundestag yesterday. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, launched a strong defence of his plans for spending cuts of more than DM20bn (Pounds 8bn), to be made in the DM478.4bn budget. He said that without strict savings and consolidation the government would have become unable to defend itself either nationally or internationally. He pointed to the D-Mark's strengthening since mid-summer as a sign of international confidence in German fiscal and monetary policy.</p>

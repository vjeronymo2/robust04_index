			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Lonrho Mr Tiny Rowland may have the disadvantage of the black pieces in his battle with his co-chief executive Mr Dieter Bock, but he is clearly still playing to win. Until last week Mr Bock seemed to be developing unstoppable momentum. He is Lonrho's largest single shareholder and has assiduously courted such institutional investors as the company could muster. His drive to open up the company, sell the Observer, and realise value for the Western Platinum and Ashanti holdings has won applause. Yet it never does to underestimate Mr Rowland, and he has now upstaged Mr Bock twice in three days. The compromise over non-executive directors will make it harder for Mr Bock's camp to vote through changes. And the jaw-slackening peace deal with the Fayeds means that Mr Rowland does not have to fight on two fronts simultaneously. He has other advantages, most notably a hard core of support among small shareholders, intimate knowledge of Lonrho's African businesses and an ability to come up with genuinely surprising deals. Worse for Mr Bock, recent developments suggest that Mr Rowland can still dictate Lonrho's strategy without even bothering to inform his business associates. Attempts to take Lonrho out of Mr Rowland's hands have failed before, as Mr Alan Bond can ruefully confirm. While the odds favour an eventual victory for Mr Bock, it is not secure yet. Lonrho's share price will probably bounce now the cash flow to the lawyers has dried up. But if a protracted trench war is in the offing, the two men could still damage what is left of Lonrho's prospects.</p>

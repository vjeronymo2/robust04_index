			<p>BFN     [Text] Joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols began operating  today in the areas of Khan Yunus and Gaza city. According to  the agreement, the patrols will travel on three routes along the  Netzarim, Morag, and Qatif Bloc roads.    Each patrol will include two jeeps. A Palestinian officer  and three policemen will ride in one vehicle, whereas the other  jeep will carry an Israeli Border Police officer and three  soldiers.    Our Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that  the length of each route five to seven kilometers and the units  patrolling it will be responsible for maintaining security in  the area. There will also be a joint Palestinian-Israeli foot  patrol in the vicinity of the Erez checkpoint and at the  entrance to the Gaza Strip.</p>

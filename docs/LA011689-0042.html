			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga, the Reagan Administration's closest ally  in the Caribbean, announced a parliamentary election for Feb. 9. Seaga, 58, who  is seeking an unprecedented third consecutive four-year term, criticized his  main rival, Socialist opposition leader Michael Manley. Seaga, at a Kingston  rally, berated Manley's record and took credit for restoring political  stability, economic recovery and international relations. Critics, however, say  Seaga's economic restructuring and austerity measures have neglected social  services and that his popularity has continued to fade. It will be Jamaica's  first contested general election since 1980.  </P></p>

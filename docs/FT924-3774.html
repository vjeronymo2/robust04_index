			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / International Company News: Philips to sell 12.5% of property space PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, aims to sell more than 12.5 per cent of its buildings and office space in the next three years under a new asset management programme. Mr Willem de Kleuver, chairman of the components division, told an in-house magazine that 25 per cent of Philips's office and building space was surplus to its needs and that the company expected to sell more than half of this amount over the next three years. In July, Philips said it planned to reduce working capital by cutting the amount of money tied up in inventories and receivables and that it would be pruning the size of its property portfolio. Both moves would raise 'several billions of guilders'. Philips's fixed assets of land and buildings total some Fl 6bn (Dollars 3.33bn). Mr de Kleuver, identified in the article as the head of Philips's property task force, said proceeds raised from the sale of property must be put back into the business and not be diverted in large quantities to pay for moving staff or amalgamating offices. He said Philips aimed to achieve both real estate reduction - the sale of office buildings - and real estate management, which he described as making efficient use of property in terms of costs and effectiveness. 'Our core business is the development, production and marketing of electronic products. That's where we should be putting our money, not in concrete and cement,' he said.</p>

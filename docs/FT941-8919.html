			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Book Review: Heady brew of tycoons and tradition THE BRITISH BREWING INDUSTRY 1830-1980 By TR Gourvish and RG Wilson Cambridge University Press, Pounds 50, 690 pages The UK's brewing industry, beers and pubs are firmly established elements of the national culture. They have survived - as this sweep through 150 years of history shows - persistently high taxation, frequent ham-fisted government intervention, periodic bouts of temperance, and constantly shifting consumer demands. They have endured recession, uncertainty and upheaval - not least in the past five years - and, by and large, have done so profitably. In the process, the industry has changed substantially, and at an ever-increasing pace. But its basic importance in the social and economic life of the country remains unaltered. So do its problems. Complaints about the price of beer, brewers' profits and control of pubs stimulated government action in 1830, just as it did with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the industry in 1989. In 1830, Wellington's Tory government courted popularity by repealing the duty on beer and allowing any ratepayer prepared to pay a 2 guinea licence fee to brew and sell beer. More than 24,000 beer houses were opened within six months. Eight years later, nearly 46,000 had been added to the 51,000 previously licensed premises. The beer houses were a fertile source for many an anti-drink sermon over the next 40 years, but their proliferation did little to increase competition. Commercial brewers were soon supplying them and later took over almost any house they wanted. There is little evidence in this dense book to suggest government intervention has ever had any significant, lasting effect on the industry. Licensing laws and duty imposts did create conflict and uncertainty from time to time. The Licensing Bill of 1907, introduced by a 'teetotal-ridden' Liberal government, caused uproar. Investment in breweries was cancelled and dividend payments suspended. Sir Gilbert Greenall, the Lancashire brewer, resigned as master of the Belvoir hunt, saying 'if (the bill) became law, he could not continue the heavy expense of his office'. But social and market forces have been more influential in shaping the industry, as the authors' meticulous research and analysis confirms. It was not the government's creation of beer houses that fuelled the rapid growth in consumption and commercial brewing between 1830 and 1880. Instead, it was rising real wages, increasing urbanisation and lack of leisure alternatives. Those were the glory years of the industry, when brewing was the occupation of gentlemen and, the authors note, 'no other business venture, save perhaps banking, provided a surer route to a fortune'. Brewing, it was estimated, made 33 millionaires and 50 half-millionaires, many of their names as familiar now as they were a century ago: Guinness, Bass, Courage, McEwan, Younger, Charrington, Watney, Worthington and Whitbread. The death knell of many of the family partnerships that dominated Victorian brewing was sounded in 1886 with the public flotation of Guinness. The Pounds 6m share issue attracted Pounds 130m worth of applications. Though a number of brewers determinedly held on to their independence into the 20th century - and some, like the Brain, Pope and Young families still do - the Guinness flotation pointed the way for others to convert assets to cash and to raise more funds to enlarge their pub estates. A scramble among brewers to buy pubs also helped to restructure the industry. The value of Whitbread's properties, estimated at Pounds 26,000 in 1886, had risen to Pounds 2m by 1907. Many smaller brewers could not keep pace and, in the difficult trading years to 1914, fell to bigger, better-managed rivals. The number of brewers halved to 1,100 between 1881 and 1914. The quest for economies of scale in a static or declining market reduced numbers to 428 by 1940. Then, most remaining vestiges of the brewers' old clubby world were shaken out in the merger mania of the late 1950s and 1960s, with the rise of the corporate economy. There were many reasons for the spate of nearly 200 mergers, which reduced the industry to the six or seven dominant national brewers and a few regional operations. But the authors give due recognition to the impact of two outsiders: Charles Clore of Sears, who coveted the brewers' under-utilised properties; and EP Taylor, the brash Canadian brewer, who, in pursuit of a market base for his Carling Black Label lager, drove around the UK 'bursting in upon startled (brewery) directors . . . with only the slimmest of introductions, suggesting mergers with the eloquence of a carbon paper salesman'. Among the most potent influences on the industry identified in the book, however, are the generations of anonymous consumers. 'It is the customer who ultimately decides,' said Thomas Buxton, the London porter brewer, in 1811. And what awkward customers they have proved to be. Their tastes changed frequently: from porter to mild ale; then to the light, sparkling bitters which for a time made Burton-upon-Trent the brewing capital of the nation; to keg bitters and lager; and then back to real ales. Beer drinkers have also resisted threats to nationalise pubs and attempts to turn them into uniform chains. They stood firm against reformers who tried to 'improve' pubs and drinking habits by abolishing bars and introducing waiter service - until a Royal Commission, no less, was forced to concede that 'perpendicular drinking is an ingrained national custom'. Such defiance of the prescriptions of economists, accountants and social reformers may be the reason why beer drinking remains such a feature of the British way of life.</p>

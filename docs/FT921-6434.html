			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: A costly year at Barclays FT-SE Index: 2,565 (+18.2) It is just as well that South Africa has regained some international respectability. Otherwise Barclays Bank would not have been able to release a full Pounds 100m of South African provisions, and its pre-tax profits would have fallen by even more than the reported 30 per cent to Pounds 533m. Even with that sort of flattery, however, there is no disguising a dismal underlying performance. It has produced operating income of Pounds 2.03bn - only Pounds 6m more than that of National Westminster - even though total assets are 13 per cent higher. This would matter less if Barclays' steeply rising overheads really were largely the product of investment spending for the future. Strip out the Pounds 90m of extra costs from the acquisitions in France and Germany and around Pounds 45m of restructuring charges (which are carried as an exceptional by NatWest), and overall costs still rose by 10 per cent. That suggests some pretty deep-rooted pressures which will be hard for a juggernaut like Barclays to slow. Unlike National Westminster, Barclays cannot expect to benefit from falling provisions this year. If anything its UK provisions of Pounds 1.31bn look a little on the low side. Certainly they will be high again this year. It is thus not surprising that its shares fell 5 per cent to 374p. The chances are that the bank will have little scope for increasing its dividend in 1992. In profit terms its recovery potential looks the least attractive of the three large clearers which have reported to date.</p>

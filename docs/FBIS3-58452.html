			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Hans-Ulrich Klose, Social Democratic Party of </F> Germany [SPD] Bundestag Group chairman, to the Bundestag debate  on NATO on 13 January -- live]    [Text] Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen! It is to be  welcomed that immediately after the NATO summit in Brussels, the  chancellor is informing parliament of its results and is giving  us his assessment. This is the right way to deal with  parliament, Mr. Chancellor, this is how it should be done.  [applause] The fact that you, Mr. Chancellor, have given a  positive assessment of the summit is no surprise. Perhaps it  will come as a surprise to you that we, the opposition,  contradict you, how shall I put it, in only muted terms, or even  actually agree with you. [applause] We also regard the result,  apart from individual questions and points of criticism, as  generally positive.    This also applies, Ladies and Gentlemen, to the question of  NATO's expansion, on which most interest as been focused. You  know, Mr. Chancellor, that we Social Democrats back the  expansion of NATO toward Central and East Europe, that we are in  principle, in favor of it. In principle, this means that NATO  expansion makes sense if it helps to develop a new European  security structure that, and I stress this point, serves to  stabilize the continent as a whole. We believe this can only  happen if NATO: (a) retains its character as a collective system  of defense and (b) helps by means of its existence and policies  to create or support a collective European security system.    The point of this statement is to formulate an objective  and,  at the same time, a condition. We cannot support a security  structure that offers Europe as a whole, not more but less  security because it becomes the source of new tension.  [applause] And for this reason an expansion of NATO is not  possible at the moment.    I am well aware, Ladies and Gentlemen, that the countries  that now wish to join, the Baltic states, Poland, the Visegrad  states as a whole, take a different view. They see themselves  in a specifically threatening situation that they would like to  avert by speedy NATO accession. Whether this will prove  successful is a matter for debate. However, I understand their  position, and I also understand the fact that there is a degree  of disappointment in the countries I have mentioned. Polish  politicians and others have expressed this disappointment and I  understand it. But it will be very wrong if in Poland or  anywhere else, the impression emerged that the West did not want  them, or was once again leaving them to their fate. [applause]  This is not the case. For one thing, the decisions taken at  the NATO summit retain the option for accession, or rather, they  actually open up this option. For another, the approval of the  Partnership for Peace represents an offer of cooperation that,  depending on the practicalities, is a far-reaching one,  particularly when viewed in the context of subsequent accession.  And third, no one should have any interest in adding grist to  the mill of those forces in Russia that are stirring fear of  encirclement, in reality to prepare a new imperial role for  Russia. [applause]    We know that such forces exist, Ladies and Gentlemen. They  did not win the elections in Russia, but they are menacingly  strong. Everything that we know about them, and what we hear  from their representatives, worries us, [it worries] us and  others whose concern is of course even greater than ours for  sheer geographical reasons. We do not want to strengthen these  forces in Russia, which is why the West in fact, is taking  Russian concerns into account. But that does not mean, to put it  quite clearly, that we concede to the Russian leadership, the  Russian president, a kind of right of veto over NATO expansion.  However, since we want the democratic reformers to be  strengthened and to succeed, we should avoid anything that makes  their position in their own country any more difficult. We are  at one with the government on this.    I would add that in the current [Russian] Government and  within the Russian military there are isolated voices that  betray a hegemonical stance with a kind of Monroe doctrine, at  least with regard to the countries of the former Soviet Union.  Ladies and Gentlemen, anyone who behaves as if Zhirinovskiy has  already taken power possibly helps to bring this about.  [applause]    We welcome the invitation to a Partnership for Peace  addressed to the members of the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council, and to other CSCE countries, as an offer of achieving  expansion of NATO to the east through practical cooperation, in  what is termed an evolutionary process. It would be desirable  for cooperation with the invited countries to develop in such a  way that, in the end, the eastward expansion of NATO will become  superfluous, because a functioning collective security system  had already developed. That is pie in the sky at the moment, I  know, and you would have to be quite optimistic to think such a  development probable, but nothing is possible without optimism.    At least we, the opposition in the German Bundestag, also  ask  our neighbors to the East to get involved in this cooperation.  We Germans want this cooperation, because we have a vital  interest of our own, in overcoming the situation in which we  find ourselves of being a frontier country. From our point of  view, it is desirable that our neighbors should be in the same  system of cooperation and security that we have entered into.  That this cooperation should not be restricted to military  issues, Ladies and Gentlemen, should be especially stressed  here. There will be no security in Europe if economic problems  are not also solved, if we do not succeed in giving the people  in East Europe the hope that economically things will improve.    The suitability for NATO, if I may put it that way, of an  East European country does not depend, first and foremost, on  whether the equipment of its Army is NATO-compatible. What is  decisive is progress in efforts to improve people's  opportunities in life. [applause]    Only if, Ladies and Gentlemen [applause], only if this  proves successful can we create stability, without which there  can be no lasting peace in Europe as a whole. Partnership for  Peace must therefore, be accompanied by a partnership for  development -- in economic, social, and democratic terms.  Making this partnership reality and offering concrete aid is  the proper way, and the only one that offers the promise of  success. [applause]    Germany on its own has done much, and we are not criticizing  this, on the contrary. However, Mr. Chancellor, I cannot see  any integrated security and development policy ideas for East  Europe.    The German Government has repeatedly described itself as the  advocate of the countries of East Europe, I recall statements to  this effect especially from you, Mr. Kinkel. And it is true  that the government never tires of constantly assuring as many  East European countries as possible that Germany will support  them in every possible objective, above all, in their wish to  join the European Community, or rather the European Union.    I believe the government means what it says, but we should  not forget that Germany on its own cannot possibly deliver the  support that is expected. I repeat, what is needed is an  integrated concept for security and development that is  supported and materially backed by all our Western partners, if  possible by Japan as well. [applause]    Security, Ladies and Gentlemen, is not only, not even first  and foremost, a military problem. Mr. Chancellor, you know this  as well as I do. However, I cannot detect any willingness on  your part to take the correct foreign policy decisions that  follow from this. At any rate, I have heard nothing to this  effect in your statement today. You could, Mr. Chancellor, say  in your defense that this was not, and could not have been, the  subject of the NATO summit. However, I take a different view.    Have we not always stressed, not least yourself, that NATO  is  more than an alliance with just a military purpose. Is NATO not  also a forum for political debate and agreement, as well as a  policy tool? We at any rate take this view, Mr. Chancellor, and  for this reason we would have liked the alliance's heads of  state gathered in Brussels to have taken a wider understanding  of the concept of partnership than they in fact did. Once  again, security is not just a military problem. But  unfortunately, it is the case that in the unstable current  situation, in view of the numerous conflicts and brutal wars,  that military calculations have moved to the fore, in the face  of the high hopes many people had after the fall of the Iron  Curtain and the collapse of Communism.    We dreamt of a peaceful, free, economically flourishing  Europe, of a Europe that could return to its roots in unity once  again. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am still hopeful, but I admit  that my hope is now mixed with concern, fear, and anger. The  peoples of East Europe have returned to Europe from Communist  imprisonment, it is true. But how have we, who so praised their  role in the liberation of East Europe, how have we accepted them  here? Europe is in fact still divided and will remain so for a  long time unless there is a great joint effort. And there will  be no secure peace in Europe so long as this practical division  remains. [applause]    It is quite correct, that with the collapse of the Soviet  empire, the danger of a great apocalyptic war has diminished.  That Ukraine, which is after all numerically the third nuclear  power in the world, finally seems prepared to dismantle its  nuclear potential, further reduces the danger. Nevertheless,  nasty and brutal conventional war has returned to Europe and we  can apparently find no strength to act preventively, that is to  prevent war. We have as yet no effective strategy for curbing  or ending war. Yugoslavia is a frightening example.    I have read the statements at the NATO summit on Yugoslavia,  on Bosnia. The Serbs and the other peoples who are killing each  other in the former Yugoslavia believe, I am afraid, not a word  of them. I am, Mr. Chancellor, in agreement with the  organizational decision concerning the relationship between NATO  and the WEU [Western European Union]. The recognition of the  European Union as an equal partner with the United States on  foreign and security policy issues, the definition of the WEU in  the communique as the defense and security instrument of the  European Union -- we can accept that. I am however, not in  agreement because action here is once again more on the level of  military organization, without any progress being discernible in  the formulation of a joint foreign and security policy.  [applause]    The WEU is to become capable of independent military action  but without double military structures arising -- we accept  that. But is there -- quite apart from the German nonclarities  -- clarity about what is to be achieved with this military  operational capacity of the WEU? You know that I think that  military precautions, including a realistic component of  deterrence, which in my view helps to prevent war, are right and  necessary. But, that once again the military aspect is to be  organized first without previously gaining clarity about  political strategies, worries me more and more. And it makes me  suspicious not least because you, Mr. Chancellor, have not  spoken here today about this group of decisions by the summit.  I definitely want the joint European defense and security  identity, with the Bundeswehr as an alliance army. But I am  opposed to even giving the impression that Europe is striving  for the role of an intervention force acting on its own  prerogative. [applause]    That NATO or the WEU could and should take on roles within  the framework of the United Nations or the CSCE is controversial  here only to the extent that we are talking about the range and  nature of such tasks. You know the different positions. We all  of us [in the SPD] object if it is a matter of laying claim to  an independent military role for the WEU, the European Union,  beyond defense and outside the alliance area. We have already  done that in the case of NATO, and we do it even more decisively  in the case of the WEU, thus without the United States and  Canada.    Allow me, Ladies and Gentlemen, an aside here. I find it  astonishing that the government insists on expanding the radius  of action of the Bundeswehr, and that it insists on this so  strongly. That extends right to the suggestion by Mr. Schaeuble  that the Bundeswehr should be deployed more within Germany.  This is a suggestion that I find, if I may say so, a  politically absurd idea. [applause]    At the same time, Ladies and Gentlemen, they are carrying  out an endless debate on the numerate strength of the  Bundeswehr. Are you not at all aware that the fitness of action  of the Bundeswehr, that has just undergone the greatest  restructuring in its history, will be seriously endangered by  that. You yourself, Mr. Chancellor, began this debate at the  defense conference in Munich -- please note I have nothing at  all against the strength of the Bundeswehr being discussed --  but I beg you not to come up with new figures every two to three  months and not just to consider this with regard to budgetary  considerations. The security position and the task of the  Bundeswehr must also be included somewhere [in this debate].  Only then can this be called a rational debate. [applause]    In any case, I find it a total contradiction that the tasks  of the Bundeswehr are now being expanded by means of the WEU  plans, but that its possibilities in real terms are to be  constantly reduced. This is not how a responsible defense and  security policy functions. That, Mr. Chancellor, is a stop-go  policy. [applause]    One final observation. We were, Mr. Chancellor, not very  happy with the result of the summit meeting of the heads of  state and governments of the European Union in Brussels in  December. We had wanted to see greater determination to fight  mass unemployment in the European Union. The unemployment  figure of 18 million in the European Union makes this an urgent  priority. The Federal Government acted particularly  obstructively here. The proposals of the [European] Commission  to finance job-creating infrastructure measures were shelved, as  were the proposals to reduce incidental salary costs, to reduce  the burden on labor, and to compensate for this by means of an  energy tax. We regret this and we will use this opportunity  here in parliament today to say this, there was no earlier  opportunity. Although we are discontented with your European  achievements in a specific case, I will confirm that we take  your European involvement: (a) seriously and (b) do not believe  it is illusionary. [applause]    We Germans need Europe, because, for one thing, Europe -- in  addition to NATO -- has fundamentally contributed to the fact  that we have lived in peace in West Europe for 48 years. This  cannot -- you also said that today -- be taken for granted but  is a result of political creative power over many, many years.  It is important to particularly point this out again today  because it is more fashionable in your ranks, Mr. Chancellor,  than in ours, to not only criticize European development but to  even question it. We also have some criticism to make, we are  certainly not in agreement with everything that is done or not  done by the Commission in Brussels or by the Council of  Ministers. However, we will adhere to our commitment to Europe.  We do not believe convinced Europeans are illusionists: They  can produce solid instead of emotional arguments to show their  commitment, both peace and economic arguments. The people we  think are illusionists, even gamblers, are those who set the  national state against Europe and thus, for whatever reasons,  want to take Europe back to the 19th century. [applause]    We are also patriots. We love our country. But we are and  remain, convinced Europeans. And we will not stop dreaming of  the dream of the United States of Europe and working on bringing  it about. [applause]</p>

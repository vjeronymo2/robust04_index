			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: News Corp preference shareholders fear losses Holders of exchangeable preference shares issued by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation fear they may incur a considerable financial loss due to a legal wrangle over rights to new shares. In 1989, News Corp raised the equivalent of Dollars 375m (using current exchange rates) in sterling, guilders and D-Marks through the preference shares, which were convertible into shares in Pearson, the media, banking and industrial group. In the late 1980s, News Corp built a stake in Pearson which reached a high point of 20.5 per cent. It has subsequently cut its holding to 4.9 per cent. Last year, Pearson de-merged Royal Doulton, the fine china manufacturer, and Pearson shareholders were offered one Royal Doulton share for every 10 held in the parent, which owns the Financial Times. A notice published in the FT on December 13 advised holders of News Corp's preference shares that they were entitled to the Royal Doulton shares as part of the exchange property when they exercised their exchange right. As a result, many holders decided to exchange and traders adjusted the price of the preference shares to reflect the value of the Royal Doulton shares. However, the market was thrown into confusion by a notice in Monday's FT which said that News Corp was taking legal advice over whether the Royal Doulton shares were part of the exchange property. News Corp has declined to elaborate on the notice. The notice has serious financial implications for both traders and investors since many have made sales of Royal Doulton shares in anticipation of receiving them as part of the exchange property. They also face foreign exchange losses if they have to unwind their hedging positions. Traders said that News Corp's efforts to improve its relationship with the international investment community would be damaged if it kept the Royal Doulton shares.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Laporte strong Specialist chemicals group Laporte saw its shares jump 35 to 655p after the company announced a 15 per cent increase in first-half profits to Pounds 51.3m and a raised dividend. UBS maintained its buy recommendation and its forecast of Pounds 107m for the full year on the basis that debt was coming down, the proposed restructuring would cut costs, and there had been a significant boost from its Evode subsidiary. However, Hoare Govett feels the share price already reflects any improvement the company has made and, while nudging its full-year estimate Pounds 3m higher to Pounds 103m, believes the company is overvalued. The telecoms sector rebounded after its recent bout of weakness, most of which was caused by last week's launch of Mercury's One-2-One cellular service amid worries that the market would be too competitive. Cellular telephone group Vodafone, particularly badly hit by the offer from Mercury of free off-peak calls to private subscribers in the London area, saw some recovery yesterday. Vodafone shares have dropped by 17 per cent in the last two weeks and yesterday Henderson Crosthwaite was among brokers deciding that the fall had been overdone. Analyst Mr Patrick Hickey said the threat from Mercury had been exaggerated. 'The One-2-One launch takes the cellular market into a new stage of development,' he said. 'Far from losing market share, we believe Vodafone will benefit from an expanding market.' He added that the company's overseas expansion plans also left it well placed in other markets. Vodafone rose 14 to 493p, Cable and Wireless, owners of Mercury, gained 8 at 828p and BT put on 3 1/2 at 417 1/2 p. RMC Group, the building materials company, delivered dull results and the shares slipped 6 to 793p in steady trading. Its profits declined to Pounds 61.6m from last year's Pounds 62.1m and the dividend was held at 6.6p. Building specialists had forecast between Pounds 62m and Pounds 69m, with the dividend expected to rise to 7.1p. Other building materials groups fell in sympathy. Redland lost 12 to 535p, Spring Ram 2 to 62p, Hepworth 8 to 377p and Heywood Williams 7 to 347p. In a dull property sector, Moorfield Estates gained 4 at 45p after announcing a rights issue to help fund a Pounds 13m deal with British Land. The latter shed 7 to 380p. Glaxo climbed 12 to 636p on talk of an upgrade by Salomon Brothers. However, the house said it had raised forecasts earlier when the results were announced last week. New Frontiers Development Trust moved ahead 11 to 100p after Credit Lyonnais Laing placed the 75 per cent stake - some 75m shares - owned by the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund at 94p a share with institutions. The main buyer was Foreign and Colonial, which took 30m. A positive annual meeting at Tomkins continued to boost the shares, with a BZW recommendation also helping the stock add 9 at 237p. Among transport issues, SG Warburg was said to be positive on British Airways, which improved 3 to 358p. Figures at the top end of expectations from Associated British Ports sent the stock 16 ahead to 452p. British Aerospace was back in favour yesterday after the previous day's slide of 26p which followed the disappointing interim figures and sharp profits downgrades. The change of mood started with Wednesday evening's meeting with institutions at Hoare Govett, the company's broker. Bargain hunting was also in evidence and BAe shares bounced 15 to 409p, with volume reaching 2.9m. TI Group, which retreated on Wednesday in sympathy with BAe, recovered 4 to 344p. APV shed 1 1/2 to 97p as analysts downgraded full-year expectations after it reported a 59 per cent fall in interim profits to Pounds 4.9m. NatWest Securities was among houses that reduced profits expectations, cutting its forecast for the full year by Pounds 7m to Pounds 15m. Tyre and exhaust group Kwik-Fit added 4 1/2 at 172 1/2 p on bumper interim profits. USM-quoted Bluebird Toys rose 13 to 451p after leaping nearly 90p earlier in the week. The market was enthused by a promotional deal with MacDonalds, the hamburger chain, and a sharp rise in profits.</p>

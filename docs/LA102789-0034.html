			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> Gillian Lynne, the choreographer/director of "Cats," "Phantom of the Opera" and  the recently opened "Aspects of Love," among other hit shows, will put on her  dancing shoes to perform for the first time in 20 years at a Royal Command  Performance Nov. 20 in London. For the performance, Lynne has been "commanded"  to stage excerpts from her award-winning tribute to painter L. S. Lowrey, "A  Simple Man," which she devised, directed and choreographed. But ballerina Moira  Shearer, who danced a leading role in the work, has other commitments and  cannot appear at the command performance, so Lynne will take over. She was a  soloist for several years with the Royal Ballet and later staged numerous  ballets at Covent Garden. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

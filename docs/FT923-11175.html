			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / A desperate call to order: As Clinton surges ahead in the polls, Jurek Martin looks at the collapse of morale in the Bush camp What a difference a week can make in politics. Seven days ago, a successful Democratic party convention in New York could not dispel the prevalent sense that this presidential election was still as much George Bush's to lose as it was Bill Clinton's to win. Now the feeling is that the governor of Arkansas is going to have to screw things up very badly (or be screwed by a ruthless negative campaign) not to end up in the White House. Three factors lie behind the changed perception. First, the polls put Mr Clinton 20-30 points ahead of Mr Bush nationally, the biggest convention 'bounce' in history. They show that supporters of Ross Perot, the defunct independent candidate, much prefer Mr Clinton's newly refined semi-populist message of change. Some state surveys now find Mr Bush weaker than anticipated west of the Mississippi, where he stood to gain most from Mr Perot's withdrawal. Second, Mr Clinton and Senator Al Gore, his running mate, embarked on a 1,000-mile bus odyssey through small towns from New York to St Louis that drew fabulous crowds and rave political reviews. The ticket looked sharp, impressive in its youthful energy, consistent in its themes. Comparisons were drawn with Harry Truman's 'whistle stop' train tours of 1948 by those not old enough to remember them. But finally, and potentially far exceeding any ephemeral qualities in the first two, Bush had a truly terrible week, unsure of himself and looking ratty and his age. The return of James Baker from the State Department to run the White House and the campaign next month was suddenly seen not merely as desirable but as the last, perhaps only, hope of salvaging re-election. As pundit after pundit pontificated, the problem was no longer Vice-President Dan Quayle (though he is not an asset when matched against Mr Gore), no longer the faltering economy (though, as Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, implied, it is unlikely to come good enough to benefit Mr Bush greatly by November), no longer the defiance of Saddam Hussein or the tragedy of what was Yugoslavia (though both undermine the president's record in foreign policy). The problem, put simply, is George Bush himself. He did campaign this week, contrary to his promise to keep his powder dry until the convention in Houston next month. Two excursions were disastrous. In New Jersey, he got plain wrong his own education grant proposal for the less well-off; in a Washington suburb he was impaled, in front of the cameras, by a local teacher complaining of his distortions of traditional family values. He had a crack at Mr Clinton's economic policies, which should have been fruitful because it is not clear how his opponent would simultaneously finance his investment programme and reduce the budget deficit. But Mr Bush could only warn yet again of the dangers of 'liberal' and 'tax and spend' Democrats running the country. That worked in the Reagan campaigns and still had mileage in 1988. But the economy is now Mr Bush's responsibility and sloughing the blame for its plight on congressional Democrats does not suggest a way out of the impasse. Ross Perot is not the only American to believe it would help to have the president and the Congress working together for a change - and it is a stone cold certainty that the Democrats will still be running Capitol Hill after November. Other atmospherics around the president were also depressed. The White House had to fight off endless rumours that Mr Bush was unwell (or that Barbara Bush or Marilyn Quayle were ailing.) Some Republicans in Congress, led by the acerbic Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, said they might not even go to Houston. Jack Kemp, the housing secretary and once again, with the Los Angeles riots a fading memory, semi-detached from the government, let it be known that he was proposing to be in Colorado since no speaking slot had been assigned to him. The 'dump Quayle' movement, possibly artfully stoked from a distance by Mr Baker, gathered such force that Mr Bush was obliged to state that his vice-president's future was 'certain,' whatever that meant, and Mr Quayle to declare that he would step aside if he thought he was hurting his president. He may have then done precisely that by getting into a public disagreement with his wife over what to advise their daughter if she were unmarried and pregnant. Mr Quayle, sounding like a father and not an anti-abortion zealot, said he would support any decision she took; Mrs Quayle, who has strong opinions on many things, stated flatly any baby would be carried to term. Even Mr Clinton sounded sorry for the vice-president. But to dispose of him for anyone other than General Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs and, never forget, a black, would smack of desperation. Other good candidates exist - Dick Cheney, the secretary of defence, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, Governor Pete Wilson of California, even, improbably, Mr Kemp - but all are potential rivals of Mr Baker, whose own longer-term ambitions can probably best be served by the return of Mr Bush and Mr Quayle in tandem, unless he runs the campaign himself from second slot on the ticket. But this would make Mr Bush too obviously a puppet and is probably too crude a ploy for a man of Mr Baker's sophistication. Foreign policy offered no relief, apart from Mr Baker's satisfactory sessions in Israel. Saddam Hussein presents Mr Bush with a very real dilemma. Military action against Iraq might be seen as too transparent an attempt to boost domestic political popularity, whereas failure to do so could be taken as a further abdication of US leadership. The fear of Americans coming home in body bags or civilian targets bombed in error is also real. Mr Clinton's own warning to Saddam Hussein was both statesmanlike and designed to minimise any advantages accruing to Mr Bush should air strikes be launched. He was also quick to insert the knife with his comment that the imminent transfer of Mr Baker ('the best we've got') showed that Mr Bush cared less about foreign policy than about re-election. Mr Baker is also not inheriting the best campaign team in the business. Lee Atwater, the hard-nosed tactical foil to his own strategic sense in 1988, is dead. Sam Skinner is considered to be out of his political depth as White House chief of staff: Rich Bond, Republican party chairman, compares poorly with Ron Brown, his Democratic counterpart; Clayton Yuetter, domestic policy adviser, still has his heart more in trade and agriculture; Robert Teeter, nominal co-chairman with Mr Skinner, is perhaps too easy with Bush. It goes beyond mere personalities. The Quayle team of conservatives is never averse to leaking its disaffected thoughts to the media, while others in the Republican party are pursuing separate agendas, including their own re-elections. The calls this week for Mr Bush to ditch his economic policy team - Nicholas Brady, the treasury secretary, and Richard Darman, the budget director - came from one, or both, of these quarters. Thus Mr Baker has to impose order where it is lacking. But mostly he somehow has to take Mr Bush in hand and give shape and purpose to his re-election effort. The way things went this week, he will find the Middle East a cakewalk in comparison.</p>

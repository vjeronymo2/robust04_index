			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Management: Women on the move - Michael McCarrey gives his view on why the number of female directors in the UK has fallen The number of women at the top of business appears to be falling. This week a survey by the Institute of Management showed that the number of women managers and directors in the UK's biggest companies fell by 6.9 per cent last year. The trend in the US and Canada is also downwards. Given that many large organisations have affirmative action programmes for women, this situation may seem surprising. Following research in North America I would argue that it has come about because of two filtering biases: sex-based stereotypes and performance management or appraisal. A sex stereotype consists of ideas concerning ability, skills and preferences which are based on the sex of a person rather than their behaviour and job performance. Stereotypes are short-cuts to decision making because they use the obvious - for instance, is someone male or female? - rather than judging a person's knowledge or evaluating what they have done in their work. Many people in general believe that women have more 'expressive' skills (more relationship-oriented, helpful, emotional, supportive, consensual) and that men have more 'instrumental' skills (more autonomous, independent, assertive, take greater risks, are more focused on attaining objectives). Some psychologists would push our acceptance of the biological differences to believing that these are the basis for different abilities, motivation and personality. Stereotypes are easy-to-use views of people in general, having a grain of truth. The point is that they are based on men and women non-managers in the general population. Our research asked women and men managers (matched on socio-economic status, salary, position, years of work experience and months of supervisory experience) to describe the meaning of the motivational components of their jobs. The stereotypes would suggest that male managers would primarily offer 'instrumental' motivators - for example: 'I'll exceed my sales quota'; while the women managers would give 'expressive' motivators such as: 'I'll feel better.' We found no differences whatsoever. Our results offer no support for the argument that the work motivators for women versus men managers lie in two different worlds. Critics might still argue that even if their motivations are similar, the behaviour of the sexes - the way they go about realising those motives - is different: that is, 'expressive' for women managers and 'instrumental' for men. No doubt promotion and selection board members can selectively recall some candidate behaviours that do fulfil their biased expectations. But this is an example of the self-fulfilling prophesy. Performance management is the most blatant smoking gun to sex inequity in management jobs. The basic problem is the lack of weight given to the task by CEOs and executive cadre who, in spite of saying the opposite, feel performance appraisal is good for their subordinates, but not for themselves. Most managers in a group of top US Fortune 500 Companies, for example, did not feel that performance management was a legitimate part of their job as a manager. In their corporate cultures the implication is that the assessment process really belongs to the human resources department, which is seen as complicating the manager's job with armloads of cumbersome, time-consuming forms (in whose design they have had very little involvement). Consequently, line managers are rewarded for tasks which do not include real steps towards the development of their subordinates. Performance management works to the detriment of women managers because of the way it combines with the aforementioned sex-based stereotypes. It is precisely because performance management is time consuming, difficult and seen as peripheral, that supervisors are too often tempted to use sex-based stereotypes to accelerate or simplify the appraisal process. For example, our research found that compared with egalitarian supervisors (identified as those who had few sex-based stereotypes), traditional supervisors (who had many stereotypes) devalued the work of their women subordinates. They appraised them as less able to direct their subordinates autonomously, promote their career development, or effectively monitor their day-to-day results. Little wonder then that an increasing number of women managers react, not so much against the tough demands of modern management regimes as against biased performance management outcomes. Some women managers have been leaving to run their own companies where stereotyped performance management evaluations will not work to their disadvantage. Companies that insist on real results in reducing gender inequity in their managerial workforce need to examine their corporate culture and determine the role given to performance management, by comparison with their (other) strategic goals. If the same weight is not given to the improvement of human capital as to market share, profit and other organisational priorities, small wonder the human resources function is often viewed as unrelated to the 'real' goals of the company. The acid test here is: do the job descriptions of all staff (board of directors, executive, administration) include meaningful percentages of weights and time spent in subordinate development with examples of what this means in practice? Many younger companies in fast-moving, high-tech fields have no job descriptions, nor do many self-directed work teams. They need procedures such as weekly or monthly scrutiny of the team 'job' description with action statements when indicators show poor outcomes across team goals. Second, companies insisting on real results in reducing managerial sex inequity need to examine the corporate culture of their board of directors, executives and administration for the less overt instances - attitudes, prejudice, defensiveness, posturing, territoriality - of sex bias in recruitment, selection and performance management. Almost 20 years ago a prominent bank's chairman in Canada reported that the bank was unable to appoint a woman to the board. In response to public outcry and, one suspects, a drop in retail banking market share, the bank appointed an outstanding woman who met the criteria for board membership.

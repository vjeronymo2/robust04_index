			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Independent to consider refinancing Directors of The Independent newspaper will decide next week on a comprehensive business plan for the future which will involve a 'redefinition' of the paper and a multi-million-pound refinancing. One strand of the redefinition would be to take the target audience of 20 to 40-year-old ABC1 and produce 'a paper that looks at their lives from their perspectives as consumers'. The business plan, which will cover the next three years, has been put together by Mr Patrick Morrissey, the new chief executive of Newspaper Publishing, publishers of both The Independent and the Independent on Sunday. Mr Morrissey said yesterday: 'The key is to protect the independence of the titles. If the independence of the titles is compromised I don't think there will be a business in the long term.' The statement by the chief executive, who joined the company on October 1, would appear to rule out a takeover by either Associated Newspapers or Mirror Group Newspapers, both of which have expressed an interest, unless the company's financial position worsens. It is believed that Mr Morrissey and Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper Publishing, have been visiting the company's institutional investors and found them broadly sympathetic to a refinancing if a viable business plan is produced. This makes it possible that existing shareholders, including El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, could finance the plan without the need for a drastic change of ownership. El Pais and La Repubblica are believed to be keen to introduce a new UK minority shareholder from the national newspaper industry. The plans will go before a board meeting on Tuesday against a background of falling circulation - The Independent is only just keeping sales above 300,000 - and a move into loss. In the year to September 26 the company suffered pre-tax losses of Pounds 486,000, although Pounds 350,000 of this resulted from the failed Observer takeover attempt. Mr Morrissey declined to say how much money the company will need to raise but it is unlikely to be less than Pounds 10m and could be much more. Asked whether the company would now review the policy of charging 50p for The Independent while The Times sold at 30p, Mr Morrissey said he would not comment on revenue matters before the board meeting. He refused to discuss personnel matters, such as rumours that one of the founders, Mr Matthew Symonds, would lose his seat on the board.</p>

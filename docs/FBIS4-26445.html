			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yuan Yang (6678 3152): "Commenting on Taiwan </F> Leader's Visit to Four Countries"]    [Text] Between early and mid May, the Taiwan authorities'  top leader made a visit to four countries in Central America and  Africa. What image has Taiwan conjured up in the international  community? What impact will it exert on cross-strait relations?  People might size up the situation and make a judgment on it by  linking it to the Taiwan authorities' past behavior.    The deepest impression the four-country trip left us is  precisely that this Taiwan leader "tossing silver dollars along  his way" -- was giving dollar-alms to some economically  underdeveloped impoverished and small countries to buy their  popular support for Taiwan's "return to the United Nations."    Last year, the Taiwan authorities' attempt to "return to the  United Nations" met with the opposition and resistance of the  international community and went bankrupt, but they would not  let the matter drop. Since the beginning of this year, the  Taiwan authorities have stepped up their activities, with some  prominent figures made frequent trips to visit some foreign  countries to demonstrate Taiwan's status as a "sovereign state."  During the spring festival this year, the Taiwan authorities'  leader went to some Southeast Asian countries on "holiday  calls"; an important purpose of which was precisely to rely on  its "strength in economy and trade" "to expand its international  living space," in an attempt to become a dialogue partner with  ASEAN countries so as to obtain its status of a political body  and thus squeeze itself into this regional international  organization, thereby laying a foundation for its future "return  to the United Nations.". To achieve this purpose, the Taiwan  authorities have provided several Southeast Asian countries with  $150 million low-interest loans in the form of aid.    During his four-country visit this year, he was playing the  same old trick, and continued to buy popular support with huge  sums of money. In Nicaragua, he forgave its $17 million loan,  in addition to providing it with a $30 million low-interest loan  in exchange for Nicaragua's support for Taiwan's "return to the  United Nations." In Costa Rica, he provided the country with a  $15 million low-interest loan in exchange for the country's  guarantee to support Taiwan's "return to the United Nations."  In South Africa, he provided the country with $15 million to  consolidate "diplomatic relations" between the two sides. In  Swaziland, he also provided the country with a considerable loan.    To accomplish certain political aims, the Taiwan authorities  also provided funds for the candidates in some countries'  general elections, which can be likened to placing bets on those  who had greater probabilities to win, aside from giving alms in  public. Such improper practices already have aroused reproaches  and repugnance from political circles and the masses in some  countries. The Taiwan people have long expressed their  resentment of the authorities' squandering money. They  indicated that "dollar diplomacy" was like taking a stimulant  that had only a brief effect, but would not effect permanent  cure." A major Taiwan newspaper expressed doubt as to what role  such countries' accepting aid could play in Taiwan's "return to  the United Nations." The paper said, compared with over 100 UN  members, the strength of the friendly Central and South American  countries was limited, even insignificant.    The important task in the four-country visit by the Taiwan  leader was to consolidate "diplomatic relations" with South  Africa through the swearing-in ceremonies for newly elected  South African President Mandela. For this reason, aside from  providing the loan, he expected the new South African  administration would develop its relations with Taiwan and PRC  according to the "dual recognition" pattern. In coordination  with this, some Taiwan officials, media, and hired scholars once  again raised a hubbub concerning the theory of "dual  recognition." Some high-ranking responsible persons openly  asserted that Taiwan was ready to accept "dual recognition,"  regardless of the one-China principle.    In fact, reviewing the various tricks to which the Taiwan  authorities have resorted since the 1960's in their fight for  "international living space," it is not difficult to see that  the "dual recognition" attempt has never succeeded, but some  decision-makers among the Taiwan authorities have failed to  realize their errors and mend their ways, while increasingly  distancing themselves from the "one-China" principle.    In the 1960's, France, the Congo, and Dahomey established  diplomatic relations with PRC; at that time, Taiwan's embassies  tried to stay in those countries and would not leave. At last,  they had to lower the flag, remove the embassies, and leave  those countries.    In late 1980's, the Taiwan authorities set out the principle  of "pragmatic diplomacy," and changed from "swearing not to  coexist with the enemy" to "staying put when the enemy comes."  Regarding "dual recognition at that time, the Taiwan  authorities adopted the practice of doing it, but not saying it  aloud.    In the early 1990's, the Taiwan authorities dished up the  "Program for National Reunification," announcing that "under the  prerequisite of one China, Taiwan and Mainland China should show  respect for one another without rejecting each other in  international affairs." When this program was presented, it  came under fire from Mainland China and form figures who showed  concern for the reunification of the motherland, while  indicating that in the program the adherence to one China was  false, the truth was to deepen the split between Taiwan and the  motherland.    Under such circumstances, the Taiwan authorities dare not  announce openly that their pursuit in promoting "dual  recognition" is the goal of their "diplomatic policy"; in  practice, however, they have never given up the opportunity and  attempt to promote it.    Recently, a responsible person of Taiwan's "Executive Yuan"  stated: By "dual recognition" we mean a sort of parallel  relation, not one of opposition. Therefore, he had to admit  that Mainland China would by no means agree to such a concept.  It follows that Taiwan is to face lots of difficulties in  "diplomatic work."    Obviously, the resolute opposition to "dual recognition" on  the part of Mainland China is based on the fundamental interests  of the entire Chinese nation, and on firmly safeguarding the  "one China" principle. As adherence to the "one China"  principle is an important tie to maintain the fresh-and-blood  relations of the compatriots in Taiwan and China Mainland, any  speech or action deviating from or shaking this important  principle will seriously affect the healthy development of  interactive cross-strait relations.    An increasingly growing number of facts demonstrated that in  handling foreign relations or relations with the mainland, some  decision-makers among the Taiwan authorities are dangerously  moving further from the path of the "one China" principle.  Recently, a person in office representing the Taiwan  authorities said that the concept of "China" is vague. It would  not be strange if this statement had been made by some Taiwan  Democratic Progress Party member, but it was made by none other  than a person in office representing the Taiwan authorities, and  that has given us much food for thought. How can he adhere to  the "one China" principle? What position has he placed himself  in before the righteous cause of the Chinese nation and history?</p>

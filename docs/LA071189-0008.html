			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RAPE CONVICTION PRESENTED IN LUCAS' PENALTY PHASE  </P> <P> The prosecution opened the penalty phase of David Lucas' murder trial Monday  and then promptly rested after introducing evidence of his 1973 rape  conviction.  </P> <P> No witnesses were called by prosecutors, but the defense put on a daylong  parade of witnesses to try to persuade the same jury that convicted Lucas of  three throat-slashing murders to spare his life.  </P> <P> The only choices the San Diego Superior Court jury has is to recommend whether  Lucas, 34, of Spring Valley should die in the gas chamber or spend the rest of  his life in prison without the possibility of parole.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. George Clarke introduced the evidence of the 1973 conviction  for raping a 22-year-old waitress at knifepoint when he was 18 years old.  </P> <P> The defense attorneys and prosecution agreed to a stipulation that Lucas had  been found guilty on Aug. 16, 1973, of rape.  </P> <P> The defense put on testimony by Lucas' sister and brother, who described their  father as a cold man who was cruel to Lucas and sometimes hit him.  </P> <P> Many family friends testified, all urging the jury to choose life without  parole.  </P> <P> Catherine McEvoy, Lucas' sister, pleaded with the jury to spare her brother.  </P> <P> "If you put him to death, we can't write him any more or see him any more. I'm  pleading. Save him," McEvoy said. She began crying and Superior Court Judge  Laura Hammes called a recess.  </P> <P> Lucas was convicted June 21 of first-degree murder for killing University of  San Diego student Anne Swanke, 22, on Nov. 20, 1984, and Suzanne Jacobs, 31,  and her 3-year-old son, Colin, on May 4, 1979, in their Normal Heights home.  </P> <P> Jurors acquitted Lucas of one murder and deadlocked after voting 11-1 for  guilty in two other slayings.  </P> <P> He was also convicted of the kidnaping and attempted murder of Jodie Santiago  Robertson, 34, as she left an El Cajon restaurant June 8, 1984.  </P> <P> The trial continues today.  </P></p>

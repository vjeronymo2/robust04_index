			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin met with Acting Chief Justice Nikolay Vitruk on Monday  to discuss the draft law on the Russian Constitutional Court  finalised by a conciliatory commission.    The commission included members of the State Duma Committee  for Legislation and Judicial Reform, presidential  representatives in the parliament, experts from the presidential  state and law department and Constitutional Court judges.    Yeltsin gave a positive assessment to the work done, noting  that no one who could have done it better than the  Constitutional Court. He stressed that from the very outset he  had considered disputes about the Constitutional Court's right  to initiate legislation as groundless.    Yeltsin told Vitruk that he will instruct his representative  in the State Duma to convey his assessment and proposals to the  deputies.    The president and Vitruk also discussed candidates for  judges  in the Constitutional Court. Yeltsin regretted that the  suggested list practically does not represent subjects of the  federation.    He stressed that the final list to be approved by the  Federation Council, upper house of Russia's new parliament, can  be submitted only after the adoption of the law on the  Constitutional Court which will determine the requirements for  judges, including age limit, terms of office and others.</p>

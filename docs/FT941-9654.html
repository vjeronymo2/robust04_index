			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Republicans' turn at the wheel: The next moves in the Northern Ireland peace process depend on Sinn Fein and the IRA declaring their hands Lasting peace - or the threat of descent into a paramilitary-led bloodbath? With the British and Irish governments keeping up the pressure on Sinn Fein and the IRA to declare their hand in the push for a 'new beginning', the people of Northern Ireland await the next decisive turn of events in their troubled history. Try as they may to convince the republican movement that no group will be allowed to hold to ransom those searching for progress in Northern Ireland, both governments have to acknowledge that the movement also holds the key to a real breakthrough. Impatient politicians north and south refuse to set deadlines, although they have been trying gently to push for a republican decision on the Downing Street declaration by the time of Sinn Fein's annual conference in two weeks. Yesterday, however, Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, slapped down the idea of an early response. In Ulster there are those who believe that, whatever his movement does or does not say in the short term, the historic tide has turned and that the peace process is now unstoppable. But others invoke history to predict failure and an unprecedented armed struggle. But if Sinn Fein's holding position becomes untenable and it is forced into making the next move, what are its options? If it were able to deliver an unequivocal 'yes' to the joint declaration - regarded as the least likely scenario by both governments - the immediate path ahead is clear. After a three-month ceasefire, Sinn Fein can join an exploratory dialogue covering security questions, participation in the political talks process and a start to demilitarisation in the province. But a 'yes' would require the British government to move quickly to reassure moderate unionists - who have accepted but never endorsed the declaration - that their position within the union remains secure. Their stance might certainly be tested to breaking point as Sinn Fein paid its first official call on Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. For its part, Dublin would at once invite Sinn Fein to join the proposed all-Ireland Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Mr Ian Paisley and his hardline Democratic Unionists would be even further out on a limb, maintaining their boycott of the talks process and standing aside from a 'treasonable sell-out'. The DUP is demanding that Mr John Major, the prime minister, abandons the declaration, although its attempt last week in a Belfast by-election to seek a mandate for its uncompromising stand failed badly. A more probable development, however, is that Sinn Fein might deliver qualified acceptance of the declaration, perhaps involving a temporary ceasefire. The gesture would switch the political initiative back to the two governments, again casting Sinn Fein as the party set on the search for peace and further probing any fault lines in the relationship between Dublin and London. Although both administrations have insisted that only a permanent ceasefire will do, there have already been hints that Dublin might see a respite in violence as sufficient grounds for allowing Sinn Fein to join the proposed forum. Sinn Fein would then have prised open the door marked 'concessions' a little further. But if Sinn Fein, for the sake of retaining republican unity, says 'no', Dublin - which has wanted the joint declaration to take priority over the talks process until Sinn Fein declared its hand - will be obliged to join London in pursuing the widest possible dialogue on the political way forward. The Irish government has set itself firmly against a return to the 'the bad old days of Stormont domination'. The unionists' priority will be for a devolved assembly along the lines set out during the 'three-stranded' talks. Mr James Molyneux, the Ulster Unionist leader, now says it could be up and running before the end of next year. The Social Democratic and Labour party, however, is deeply suspicious of what it can expect from an assembly. Sir Patrick and Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, would have to work hard on relationships between the people of north and south in order to get the party to participate in a new chamber. The chances of making much progress, however, against a background of continuing violence might not be high. But while the political options ahead are aired, it is the reaction of those who have engaged in the tit-for-tat war of atrocities which is least predictable and most critical. Some believe that, if the latest initiative fails, the IRA will not be able to return to the old levels of violence without alienating many republicans brought to the brink of peace. 'They might be content to give people an occasional reminder, maybe on the mainland, that they are still in business', said one security source. But another warned: 'Any IRA 'no' in the form of new atrocities will see the loyalist paramilitaries go berserk. It could be the bloodiest year ever. And if republican violence ends, will loyalists put away their own arms and watch Sinn Fein at the negotiating table? They have their own agenda as well'. In spite of the talk of a security 'crackdown', the reality is that there are no secret weapons in the security forces' locker and they know they must be careful not to give the IRA any new opportunities for building fresh support. On Saturday, Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, will meet before watching the England-Ireland rugby match at Twickenham and declare that the peace process continues. The reality will be that, off the pitch, the waiting game goes on.</p>

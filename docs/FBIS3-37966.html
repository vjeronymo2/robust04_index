Anton Buteiko, the president's foreign affairs adviser, told  Interfax-Ukraine that this message, the third of this kind in as  many years, presented new arguments in favor of joining the  treaty that follow from the trilateral communique of the U.S.,  Ukrainian and Russian presidents and the Western response to it.  That communique provided for the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine.    "The president says that parliament should speed up making a  decision," the adviser said. He emphasized that a speedy  decision would be in Ukraine's interests.    The Ukrainian parliament ratified START-1 and Article 5 of  the Lisbon protocol whereby Ukraine undertakes to join the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state.  Parliament did not, however, join the treaty immediately. Its  Speaker Ivan Plyushch told journalists in early February that  "joining the 1968 Treaty will be debated by a new parliament."</p>

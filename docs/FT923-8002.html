			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Canada 'committed' to trade accord MR Michael Wilson, Canada's trade minister, said yesterday that his government was 'absolutely committed' to securing parliamentary approval for the North American free trade agreement, despite public scepticism about the benefits of liberalised trade with the US and Mexico. Mr Wilson also said in an interview that any other country wishing to accede to Nafta would have to accept the basic framework of the trilateral deal which was unveiled earlier this week. Chile has already expressed an interest in joining Nafta, and Mr Wilson predicted that other countries were unlikely to need much persuading to follow suit. But he said that they 'will have to accept the disciplines and have in place a trade policy regime consistent with the agreement'. The US, Canadian and Mexican governments are likely to submit the Nafta agreement simultaneously to their legislatures either in December, or early next year. The US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA), which came into force in January 1989, was the most divisive issue in Canada's 1988 general election campaign. Recent opinion polls show that a majority of Canadians are still opposed both to the FTA and Nafta. The FTA is widely blamed for worsening the recession by encouraging manufacturers to centralise their oper-tions in the US, at the expense of Canadian jobs. Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, is expected to call the next election in either summer or autumn 1993, but Mr Wilson said he expected the free trade debate to be less heated than it was four years ago. 'People have come to realise that liberalisation of trade is happening everywhere,' he declared. The Canadian government is likely to base its case on improvements in Nafta compared to the bilateral free trade agreement, and on the general benefits to consumers of liberalised trade. Among the improvements cited by Mr Wilson are a two-year extension of the duty drawback for foreign motor manufacturers in Canada, along with the retroactive resolution of a highly-charged dispute with the US over the local content of Ontario-built Honda cars. Another improvement cited by the minister was the inclusion of environmental and financial services issues in the mechanism for settling disputes. The Nafta agreement provides for environmental experts to be included in the bi-national panels which will review trade disputes. Mr Wilson also noted that Canada's exports to Mexico almost doubled in the first five months of 1992. The Canadian embassy in Mexico City had handled more commercial inquiries in the first three months of this year than in the whole of 1991, he added.</p>

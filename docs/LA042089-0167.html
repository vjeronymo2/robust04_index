			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER COMPANY TELLS IT TO THE MARINES  </P> <P> The Way Off Broadway Playhouse can't be accused of pulling any punches.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the Santa Ana-based company traveled to the El Toro Marine Corps  Air Station to present four short vignettes, collectively titled "Temporary  Sanity," which portray domestic violence among military families in brutal and  profanity-laced terms.  </P> <P> "Temporary Sanity" will be presented for civilian audiences on Friday and  Saturday at the company's theater in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Wednesday at El Toro, the 45-minute production was part of a larger program  focusing on child and spousal abuse, sponsored by the base's Family Service  Center. The high-stress military life style, which can include long hours on  duty, frequent and lengthy family separations and low pay, was cited by several  speakers as causing a high incidence of domestic violence.  </P> <P> "Temporary Sanity" portrayed four examples of violent situations: a husband who  verbally and physically abuses his wife and young daughter; the aftermath of a  wife-beating in which the husband is implored to seek counseling; an instance  where the wife of a Marine takes her frustration out on her young son, and a  staff sergeant who verbally and physically abuses his teen-age stepson.  </P> <P> The vignettes employ harsh language and violent actions, and all portray some  degree of alcohol abuse. Allison Gappa, who wrote the production, said there  was some pressure from the military to tone down the language and the violence,  and to play down references to alcoholism, after officials saw the play in  rehearsal.  </P> <P> She said they were also unhappy with the first vignette, which ends in blackout  with the Marine husband pinning his wife to the floor and beating her. The  other skits offer some measure of resolution: A wife stands up to her husband  and convinces him to seek counseling; a Marine couple reports the abuse of a  neighbor's child; a stepfather and son come to a reconciliation.  </P> <P> "They haven't said, 'Don't do this,' " Gappa said Wednesday after the first of  two performances. But "they squirmed a little."  </P> <P> Gregory Bach, director of the production, and producer Tony Reverditto were in  on discussions with the military. "If we go and soften it for the military, we  can't get the message across," Bach argued.  </P> <P> In the end, the vignettes were performed as originally written, and Way Off  Broadway members said the Marines were largely cooperative.  </P> <P> Gappa, for instance, received help in learning military jargon from the staff  of the Family Services Center, and another group of Marines helped the actors  portraying military men to prepare for their roles, and even took them to the  base barber to get military haircuts.  </P> <P> Way Off Broadway became involved in the event after officials of Parent Help  USA, a nonprofit group that organized Wednesday's event, read a feature story  about the theater company in The Times. The theater company was asked to  participate just 4 weeks ago; Gappa was asked to write the production on a  Sunday, and had to have a script ready for the actors on the following  Saturday.  </P> <P> Reverditto, founder and president of the Way Off Broadway Playhouse and Acting  Studio, became the producer of Wednesday's entire 2 1/2-hour program. "They've  helped us in every way they can. They've been wonderful," said Sally Nava  Kanarek, executive director and co-founder of Parent Help USA. "They've gone  beyond their play."  </P> <P> Gappa brought a special perspective to her involvement in the production -- she  was herself abused as a spouse, and has written about domestic violence for  Ladies' Home Journal, Cosmopolitan and other publications.  </P> <P> "I was a battered wife 17 years ago," she said. Legally, little could be done  then about an abusive spouse: "I had the police tell me I should kill him."  </P> <P> Portraying situations of domestic violence in the vignette format, with only  about 10 minutes per section, provided a special challenge for Gappa and Bach.  "A full-length production has a kind of arc," Bach said. "We had to get right  to the point."  </P> <P> Bach said he plans to change the main characters in three of the vignettes to  civilians for this weekend's performances, mainly to stress the point that  domestic violence is not restricted to any segment of society.  </P> <P> Ruth Mushallo, deputy director of the base's Family Service Center, said she  doesn't believe that domestic violence is any more prevalent among military  families than among other social groups. "The essential difference is that we  can count them" because the military community is relatively self-contained,  she suggested.  </P> <P> She worried that the harshness of the scenes in "Temporary Sanity" might put  off some members of Wednesday's all-military audience but agreed that "for the  drama of it, all the bad things have to be exposed."  </P> <P> Sgt. Wesley Sanders, who watched the Wednesday morning program, said he has not  encountered the issue of domestic violence directly through neighbors or  friends.  </P> <P> "It's like anything. It can get hectic," Sanders said of the military life  style. But he added that he can see how incidents of abuse arise for  individuals who must take orders all day. "You come home," Sanders said, "and  you have that liberty of giving orders yourself."  </P> <P>  "Temporary Sanity" will be performed Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. at the  42-seat Way Off Broadway Playhouse, 1058 E. 1st St., Santa Ana. There will be  musical performances in addition to the dramatic production. Tickets are $25,  with a percentage of the proceeds going to benefit Parent Help USA.

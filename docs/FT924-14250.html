			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Columbus - the flawed legacy: Five hundred years on, Stephen Fidler assesses the impact of the famed explorer FIVE HUNDRED years after his fateful voyage to the new world changed the shape of history, Christopher Columbus is still stirring things up. To some, he is the daring and far-sighted navigator of legend who brought civilisation and the Christian religion to a new world; to others, a greedy and small-minded opportunist whose actions wreaked devastation on a continent. There is no agreement even on what he looked like. None of the thousands of likenesses being produced for the coming week's celebrations of the 500th anniversary of his first landfall in the Americas was produced in his lifetime. Authorities cannot even agree about where he first set foot on land. The Columbus story is permeated by myth. The traditional image, as the fearless explorer, was espoused by the north Americans who 100 years ago celebrated the anniversary of his 'discovery.' At this time, the US thought of itself unequivocally as a European society, and European self-confidence was at its height. From the other side, the view of Columbus as a greedy fortune-hunter often is accompanied by the idea of pre-Columbian America as an idyllic state. In fact, it was subject to periodic and violent upheavals, with cannibalism and human sacrifice an important part of some societies. The politically correct also condemn Columbus based on a set of values of which he could not have known. It is undeniable, however, that the term 'discovery' for Columbus's voyage is loaded with Eurocentricity. The 57m people living in the Americas - this is one serious estimate, but the numbers could have been much higher or lower - were there long before Columbus tipped up. As one observer has pointed out, it was rather like President Nixon's 'secret' bombing of Cambodia: to a lot of Cambodians, it wasn't much of secret. Authoritative accounts suggest Columbus was not a wonderful navigator. He appears to have believed throughout his life that he had discovered a new route to Asia, and his trip arose out of a miscalculation about how far it was to Japan. It is hard to question his bravery, but his navigational feat was modest. His second voyage in 1493 took a mere three weeks: he took the prevailing east winds over and the westerlies back. Once you knew it was there, it was easy. If Columbus had not sailed, the Indian 'idyll' would undoubtedly have been destroyed by other Spanish adventurers soon after. The Spanish monarchy was in a desperate search for capital: after centuries of fighting, the Arabs were expelled from the Iberian peninsula in 1492. During the same year, Jews who refused to convert to Christianity were ordered out. Not surprisingly, they took their money with them. Although Columbus had touted his idea to other royal courts, only at the Spanish was he able to make an impact. The impact of this was to be devastating: some estimates suggest the native population of Latin America was reduced by 90 per cent within a century. Although the indigenous people often were treated with horrific savagery by the new settlers, most of them died through disease. Their pathetic revenge: syphilis. Although it existed already in Europe, the American strain was highly virulent. The returning adventurers brought it back and the great pox swept the continent. Columbus and his successors over the next 30 years paved the way for the development for the first time of the 'global' economy. With the silver dug out by hapless indians from the mines of Spain and Mexico, Europeans paid for the spices and other goods which were being brought from Asia. Moreover, tobacco, potatoes and other products from the new world were to change the habits of the European people. The interaction of the Spanish and the various Amerindian cultures differed from region to region, the consequences of which can still be seen. The urban cultures of the densest population - in Mexico, and of the Andean societies - were easier for the conquerors to force into the colonial economy. In Brazil, however (colonised by the Portuguese), and other regions, the semi-nomadic natives could not be made to work. As a result, large numbers of Africans were transported to the region as slaves. The nature of medieval Spanish society was to make a permanent mark on Latin America. It was also to permeate the north, becoming tied up with the myth of the wild west. Spanish cattle farming techniques of the 12th century - such as branding, lassoing and round-ups - were taken to the plains of South America before they migrated north. More fundamentally, the relationship between the Spanish ruling elites in Latin America and the Spanish monarchy reflected that which existed between the monarch and the Spanish baronies. This gave the colonial elites great discretion to run their affairs, and to control indigenous populations, as they pleased. The rulers of the newly-independent Latin nations continued this tradition in the 19th century, viewing the Indians as a threat to their emerging nationhood. The consequences of all this can still be seen in the sharp racial divisions in countries such as Peru, where the ruling elite still largely considers itself European. Another reason why Columbus manages to arouse such high emotions, five centuries after his voyage, is that the issues raised by the European colonisation of the Americas, and the subsequent transport of huge numbers of Africans to work there, have yet to be resolved. America's poor are overwhelmingly black or Indian, and the social injustices of the European entry to the new world have not yet been addressed. Following a decade which has seen a growing gap between rich and poor in North America (because of the Reagan years) and in Latin America (because of the debt crisis), this has hit a chord. Columbus set in train a clash of three cultures: European, Amerindian and African. The Indians and Africans did not voluntarily become adjuncts to the European economy: they were forced to participate and, in its name, they suffered agonies The collision between the Indians and Europeans was inevitable. Historian Edwin Williamson points out that the two groups had incompatible expectations: Spain had a monetary economy in which gold was a scarce resource and power was determined by control over labour. The people of the Caribbean islands first encountered by Columbus lived in a subsistence barter economy in which gold had an ornamental role and the idea of labour service had not developed. The difference confirmed the European prejudice, still to be heard in Latin capitals today, that Indians are 'lazy.' The anniversary of Columbus appears, however, through media coverage, to have raised consciousness in many parts of the world about the lot of the American Indian. The prospect of celebrating the event, which many view with horror, has made the Indians themselves more conscious of their own identity, and encouraged some to use the mechanisms of Latin America's young democracies to assert their rights. Five hundred years after his voyage, Columbus might have performed a belated service for Latin America's native cultures after all.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Bright outlook for the Budget The UK chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, seems to have been born under a lucky star. For it is difficult to remember when the economic and budgetary outlook seemed better or when mainstream economists have looked more uncomfortable. The real hero of the hour is, however, our old friend 'self-correcting economic forces'. The new National Institute Economic Review is disarmingly frank about how conventional expectations have been confounded: The rate of increase of wages and prices has remained low despite the 1992 post-ERM devaluation. The current balance of payments has improved despite a recovery in domestic demand faster in the UK than in its main trading partners. Indeed, as cautious an economist as Andrew Sentance asks in the rival London Business Economic Outlook: 'Is the UK current account moving into surplus?' It probably is in surplus already if overseas assets are valued properly. Consumer spending continues to rise despite the tax increases announced in two 1993 Budgets, some of which have still to come into effect. Unemployment continues to fall despite the earlier conventional view that 'even' resumed economic growth would not make a dent in it. The NIESR cautions us against assuming another economic miracle, but does so for interesting reasons. It suggests that the pressure of demand in both goods and labour markets 'may have a more marked effect on wage and price setting than we had realised'. You can say that again. The improvement in trade performance is rightly said to date back to the 1980s. But the recent narrowing of the trade gap has taken place despite favourable movements in the terms of trade - the opposite of what is supposed to happen after devaluation. Cynical readers should note that it is not the tradition of political economy from Adam Smith onwards that has been discomforted; nor has the subsequent analysis of the main causes of both market and government failure. The discomfort has been felt at two extremes - the mainstream short-term economic modellers and those who believe financial markets are always right. If the economic prospect is good, the budgetary outlook is 'brill' (upper-class female shorthand for brilliant). It is only a year and a half ago that the Pounds 50bn UK public sector borrowing requirement, originally estimated for 1993-94, was the one economic number everybody knew. Indeed, it was thrown at one by the most surprising people and quite often soon followed by demands that more should be done to stimulate the economy. The Pounds 50bn figure always seemed an exaggeration, and has now been revised down to Pounds 46bn. The Treasury projection of a contracting deficit all but disappearing near the end of the decade was almost universally derided. Yet the latest projections show the deficit has been contracting ahead of schedule. Borrowing in 1994-95 is turning out at little more than Pounds 30bn, and at Pounds 20bn in 1995-96, according to updated Green Budget projections. Goldman Sachs, which originally made the projections for the Green Budget in October, has since revised downwards by Pounds 8bn its projection of next year's public sector spending. For it now believes that the chancellor will try to get the full benefits of lower-than-expected inflation in a cut of Pounds 6bn in the public spending control total and that there will be further savings in cyclical social security spending and in debt interest. We can then expect a learned and inconclusive debate about whether the chancellor has tightened fiscal policy and can thus afford to pause before raising interest rates again, or whether the Exchequer finances are simply benefiting from the economic upturn. Hoare Govett has made an illuminating analysis of the improvements in the fiscal outlook over the three years between 1993 and 1996, estimated at 4 1/2 percentage points of gross domestic product. Business cycle factors are said to account for 2 1/2 percentage points, pre-announced tax increases for 2 1/4 points and tighter spending control for a further 1 1/4 points. Falling asset sales are an influence in the opposite direction. The point, however, is that tighter fiscal policies are already in place. The chancellor will mainly allow events to take their course and introduce a so-called neutral Budget. Much past experience, from President Lyndon Johnson's 1960s tax increase to pay for the Vietnam war onwards, has suggested that fiscal tightening - whatever its other virtues - does little on its own to slow down a rapidly expanding economy. The NIESR estimate of an increase in non-oil GDP of 3 per cent in 1994 may not have adequately taken into account the very recent upward revision in the national income estimates. Some 3 1/2 per cent is a more likely guess - well above the most optimistic estimates of the trend growth of output. Now that the capacity gap looks near to closing, a slowdown will be necessary. The argument from growth and capacity estimates is clinched by the signs that business is looking for an opportunity to pass on in higher prices the increase in costs in components and materials already in the pipeline. The rapid and unforeseen revival of nearly all other economies, including the continental European ones, will add to demand pressures in the UK, as will the rise in investment taking place despite the third-quarter blip. The interrelated problems which non-inflationary growth on its own will not solve are structural unemployment and widening pay differentials. The most important aspect of the Budget - one which financiers are bad at judging - is what Clarke does to improve work incentives. Improvements have to be made both in the incentives for workers to move off the dole and for employers to offer jobs to less skilled workers. These problems were analysed by Stephanie Flanders in yesterday's FT. The distinctions that need to be made are between kick-start changes, such as relieving newly employed workers from National Insurance and/or income tax for a limited period and more permanent top-up payments which continue as long as needed. Meanwhile the puzzle remains why the economic upturn still leaves so much of the electorate in such a sour mood. A brave attempt at an answer has been made by Peter Spencer and John Curtice in a Kleinwort Benson paper. They themselves identify the missing ingredients as the absence of increases in working hours normally experienced at this stage of recovery, saying that higher demand has been met from productivity instead. They believe this absence makes workers insecure about their jobs. It is a brave try, but unconvincing and old-fashioned. Paid overtime is largely a blue collar phenomenon. Fears over job security are felt much more widely among white collar and professional workers. There is, however, a traditional type of economic explanation to hand. This is that real disposable income has been under pressure for several years. It stagnated during the recession and has now fallen again, against a long-term upward trend of 2.7 per cent per annum. The fall in real disposable income is partly the mirror image of the shift of resources into exports and investment for which economists have been crying out for decades. But it is also a mirror image of the increase in the tax burden imposed to improve government finances. Consumer spending is still doing pretty well, but at the expense of a steeply falling savings ratio, which averaged 12 1/2 per cent in 1992-93 and is expected by the NIESR to fall to 8 1/2 per cent next year. Increased spending financed from reduced saving no doubt does not feel as good as increased spending financed by higher real post-tax incomes. But there are clearly more deep-seated factors, such as the trend away from 'jobs for life' which is being experienced in all countries. Solutions will not be found in traditional party political 10-point programmes which imply that all change must come from government.</p>

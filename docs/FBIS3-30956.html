			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, Feb 12 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan  Karadzic confirmed in Geneva Saturday [12 February] that his  forces would withdraw their heavy artillery from Sarajevo, but  he also that said Moslem infantry must be controlled. NATO has  issued an ultimatum for all heavy weapons to be withdrawn from  Serb-besieged Sarajevo by February 21 or its warplanes will  destroy the guns. The NATO demand issued last Wednesday does  not include infantry or light weapons.    Karadzic said the Serb agreement to withdraw its heavy  artillery was not in respect of the NATO ultimatum but according  to a previous agreement reached with the UN envoy for Yugoslavia  Yasushi Akashi. "On 5th of February I agreed with Mr. Akashi a  settlement for long-lasting ceasefire in Sarajevo and this  agreement envisaged on-site control of heavy weaponry of both  sides Serbian and Moslem," Karadzic said.    "We are not members of NATO. We do not live with NATO. We  have agreed this ceasefire with Moslems brokered by Mr. Akashi  and this agreement envisaged control of Moslem infantry,"  Karadzic said.</p>

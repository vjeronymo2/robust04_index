			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / M and S acts on Sunday trade NEW PROPOSALS for re-forming Sunday trading laws in England and Wales, put forward by Marks and Spencer and other leading retailers, are under consideration by the government. The so-called M and S proposals, presented this week to Mr Peter Lloyd, Home Office minister, combine a plan to deregulate weekday shopping with a call to permit convenience stores of up to 3,000 sq ft to trade on Sundays with-out restrictions on hours. It would also allow do-it-yourself stores, garden centres and other leisure-related outlets regardless of size to open on Sundays. To forestall opposition from large food retailers, it is suggested that they should be permitted to trade on the four Sundays before Christmas. Backers of the proposals are believed to include C&amp;A, Burtons, Next, Sears, Gateway Food Markets, The Co-operative Wholesale Society, and Open, a group of smaller convenience stores jointly promoting their interests. Mr Morton Middleditch, chairman of Open, said the proposals were designed to maintain a distinction between weekdays and Sundays while recognising weekend shopping needs. Prospects of early legislation appear to be receding, with senior government figures suggesting that moves to bring forward a potentially divisive bill would meet resistance while the question of Europe tops the agenda.</p>

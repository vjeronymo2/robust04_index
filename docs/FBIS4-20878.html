			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Charles Miller, Press Association Defence </F> Correspondent]    [Text] The Government tonight insisted it had no plans to  test nuclear weapons following the United States' announcement  of an 18-month extension to its testing moratorium until  September, 1995.    President Bill Clinton's decision was based in part on the  restraint other nuclear powers have shown in resisting pressure  to resume testing in response to China's test last October.    White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said Mr. Clinton was  concerned about the impact resumed U.S. nuclear tests would have  on comprehensive ban talks which opened in January.    Britain, which has traditionally relied on testing its  nuclear warheads in the Nevada Desert, said the moratorium  extension was not unexpected.    "We reaffirm we have no intention of testing while the  United  States' moratorium continues," said a Foreign Office spokesman.    "And we would also reaffirm our commitment to working with  energy and speed towards the completion of an effective nuclear  test ban treaty."    When President Clinton first slapped a ban on nuclear  testing in 1992, Britain fiercely resisted the move as three  tests were planned on Trident warheads "for safety reasons".    But the Government has reluctantly accepted that world  opinion is set against testing and is striving to develop  computer modelling to simulate the effect of nuclear blasts.    The need for testing in any case has eased after the  Government's decision to scrap plans for a new sub-strategic  nuclear missile.    Instead, Britain is to use a number of Trident missiles  fitted with single warheads.    Thus it is not necessary to develop a new warhead as all the  Trident missiles -- both strategic and sub-strategic -- will be  fitted with the same warhead.    However, Britain is retaining its capability to design,  develop and produce new nuclear weapons in the future.</p>

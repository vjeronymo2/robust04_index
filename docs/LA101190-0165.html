			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK ;  </P> <P> GLENDALE TO TEST 5-0 MARK AGAINST LEAGUE FOES  </P> <P> The Glendale High football team just keeps on rolling.  </P> <P> Behind tailback Pathon Rucker and a swarming defense, the Dynamiters are off to  a 5-0 start heading into their Pacific League opener Friday against Arcadia,  the defending league champion.  </P> <P> Rucker, the only sophomore on the Times' All-Glendale team last year, has  rushed for 800 yards and scored 14 touchdowns. In last week's 29-0 victory over  Burbank, Rucker gained 128 yards in 20 carries despite running against a  nine-man front.  </P> <P> Glendale's defense has also been impressive. The Dynamiters surrendered two  touchdowns against Alhambra in the season opener, but have allowed only one  since in bolting to their best start since 1982.  </P> <P> Hoover (2-3), which lost to La Canada, 41-7, last week, opens Pacific League  play Friday against Pasadena.  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley (3-2), a 7-6 winner over Burroughs last week, opens Pacific  League play against Muir on Saturday.  </P> <P> Dazed and confused: Crescenta Valley's Jason Steinlight staggered from the  locker room before the Falcons' game against Burroughs on Thursday.  </P> <P> "He looked as a pale as a ghost," Crescenta Valley Coach Jim Beckenhauer said.  </P> <P> However, the senior emerged as the unlikely hero in a 7-6 victory.  </P> <P> "I had been sick and I got too pumped up before the game," Steinlight said. "We  were waiting and all of a sudden I got dizzy."  </P> <P> Steinlight, a starting tight end and defensive end and a back-up kicker, didn't  play in the first half, but was called upon late in the third quarter to kick  the go-ahead extra point after regular kicker Jason Rountree was sidelined by a  nagging thigh injury.  </P> <P> "I was tempted to tell the coach to go for two points instead," said  Steinlight, who had never kicked in a varsity game. "I felt all this pressure  and I didn't want to look up after I kicked it. I just listened for the crowd.  </P> <P> "It was an interesting night."  </P> <P> Little big man: Bobby Webster, a 5-foot-5 running back for Glendale College  continues, to have a big impact on the offense.  </P> <P> Webster, a freshman, gained 186 yards in 33 carries and scored four touchdowns  in Glendale's 37-27 Western State Conference victory over Valley on Saturday,  improving the Vaqueros to 2-2 overall and 2-1 in WSC play.  </P> <P> Webster, who gained 143 yards and scored two touchdowns in Glendale's 21-12 win  over L. A. Southwest two weeks ago, scored on runs of four, two, one and six  yards against Valley.  </P> <P> Glendale will continue its WSC schedule Saturday at Pierce.  </P> <P> Exciting newcomer: Occidental College, which unveiled an explosive freshman  last year in running back Gary Little, and again this season in running back  Brian Madlangbayan, is seeing another exciting newcomer develop.  </P> <P> Quarterback Derrick Williams, a freshman from Crenshaw High, scored on a  45-yard run and connected with Charles Jordan for a 95-yard touchdown pass in a  22-10 nonconference victory over Trinity (Tex.) University last weekend.  </P> <P> Occidental (3-2, 2-2), the three-time defending Southern California  Intercollegiate Athletic Conference champion, meets a surprisingly competitive  Pomona-Pitzer (2-2, 2-0) on Saturday.  </P> <P> Staff writer Kirby Lee contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

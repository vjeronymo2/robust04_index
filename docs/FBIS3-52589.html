David Levi, head of the  Jordan Rift Valley Regional Council, said that the bypass road  would be built east of Almog junction near Bet Ha'arava up to  the settlement of Na'ama. Our settlement affairs correspondent  Gil Litman has learned that a permanent road closer to Jericho  will be built later. The length of the permanent road will be  17 km. It will have two bridges and will cost 40 million  shekels.</p>

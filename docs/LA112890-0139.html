			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MICROPROCESSOR INVENTOR TARGET OF BROTHER'S SUIT;  </P> <P> LITIGATION: THE MAN CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE COMPUTER ON A CHIP AND A  SIBLING, AN ENGINEER WHO FILED A "WHISTLE-BLOWER" SUIT AGAINST NORTHROP, ARE  INVOLVED IN A FAMILY SQUABBLE.  </P> <P> Gilbert P. Hyatt, the La Palma inventor who last July won a 20-year legal  battle to be recognized as the inventor of the computer on a chip, is now  facing litigation from another front: his brother.  </P> <P> Michael A. Hyatt, a 50-year-old Cerritos resident, is suing his older brother,  Gilbert, for allegedly failing to turn over property that belongs to him.  </P> <P> Like his brother, Michael Hyatt also has achieved some degree of fame. In 1986,  the former engineer for Northrop Corp., also known as Brian Hyatt, filed a  "whistle-blower" lawsuit against the Century City-based defense contractor for  alleged contracting fraud.  </P> <P> Michael Hyatt said in an interview that his brother, Gilbert, has refused to  turn over funds held in a family trust and various collectibles. Michael Hyatt  said the delay is jeopardizing his own costly legal fight against Northrop.  </P> <P> Gilbert Hyatt said that his brother's suit, which was filed Nov. 14 in Orange  County Superior Court in Santa Ana, is unnecessary. He said he would turn over  the trust fund once probate on his mother's estate closes. The probate has not  closed, he said, because unrelated litigation involving the trust is pending.  </P> <P> Gilbert Hyatt also said he would return the property to his brother if he is  willing to sign a release and receipt and pay for the cost of returning the  property.  </P> <P> "He has his temper up and he tends to get stirred up about things," Gilbert  Hyatt said. "He is out of work and is trying to find a way to get cash to  support his activities. I can't distribute money until probate closes."  </P> <P> Michael Hyatt said his brother has refused to surrender about $90,000 in a  trust set up for the Hyatt children and one cousin after their mother died.  Michael Hyatt also said that Gilbert has refused to allow him access to the  collectibles that he asked his brother to store for safekeeping in 1987.  </P> <P> Though Gilbert Hyatt said his brother is jealous of his recent patent award for  inventing the microprocessor, which could net him hefty royalty payments from  computer-chip manufacturers, Michael Hyatt said his suit has nothing to do with  the patent.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Yvette Hyatt, Gilbert's and Michael's older sister, said she is not  a party to the suit, though she believes that she is entitled to a share of her  mother's estate.  </P> <P> "It's close to three years now (since she died) and nothing has happened," she  said. "The money was part of my mother's estate, and I wish she had spent it  and enjoyed it herself."  </P> <P> Michael Hyatt said he needs money from the family trust to live on while he  pursues his suit, which seeks millions of dollars in damages against Northrop.  He claims that he has been blacklisted by the defense industry and has been  unable to find work since Northrop fired him.  </P> <P> In his suit against Northrop, which is pending, Michael Hyatt alleges that the  company knowingly manufactured defective parts for the MX missile guidance  system.  </P> <P> Les Daly, a Northrop spokesman, said Tuesday that the company denies the  charges and noted that the federal government has declined to join Hyatt's  lawsuit.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report from the "NHK News" program] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Federal Reserve Board [FRB] decided late  last week to tighten the money market for the first time in five  years.    Commenting on the FRB's decision, Bank of Japan Governor  Yasushi Mieno, said: I believe FRB Chairman Greenspan, who has  asserted that interest rates have remained too low during the  months of economic recovery, has concluded that it has become  necessary to raise interest rates to keep the U.S. economy  growing longer. I believe that the tight monetary control in  the United States will have no major impact on international  financial markets.    In this way, Mr. Mieno indicated that tight monetary control  in the United States will not bring about any drastic change to  foreign exchange and stock markets.</p>

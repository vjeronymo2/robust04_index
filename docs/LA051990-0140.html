			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS BLAST COMMISSIONERS' AID TO CANDIDATE  </P> <P> Two Orange County supervisors expressed outrage Friday over the actions of two  planning commissioners who reportedly solicited funds for an Assembly candidate  by hosting a dinner with representatives of South County developers who have  projects before the commission.  </P> <P> "I would have grave views about my planning or airport commissioner using their  county titles to solicit campaign funds on behalf of an Assembly candidate or  any candidate," Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said. "I don't think they would do  it, but if they did we would sit down and have a very stern talk about it."  </P> <P> On Friday, The Times quoted several people who attended the dinner as saying  that Planning Commission Chairman Stephen Nordeck and fellow Commissioner Roger  Slates encouraged the developers to contribute to 58th Assembly District  candidate Peter von Elten. The dinner took place at Nordeck's Trabuco Oaks  Steak House and was attended by about 15 people.  </P> <P> Nordeck, who strongly denied that he solicited any contributions or had any  role in the dinner, was appointed to the commission last year by Supervisor  Gaddi H. Vasquez.  </P> <P> Slates, who has declined to comment, served on the commission from 1972 to 1975  and was appointed last year by Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder.  </P> <P> In his first public comment on the dinner, von Elten confirmed that he was  introduced to guests at the affair as a friend of Nordeck and Slates, and that  he went to the dinner in hopes of raising campaign contributions.  </P> <P> "I needed to get some people to contribute," von Elten said. "Roger said, 'Do  you mind if we put a little dinner together?' He said he had no idea how much  money we were looking at. He said he would make the introductions and I could  take it from there."  </P> <P> Wieder reacted on Friday, saying, "This is the '90s; this isn't the 70s  anymore. . . . It was one of the things I cautioned (Slates) about. . . .  They've really tightened up on laws having to do with avoiding the appearance  of any wrongdoing or anything illegal in trying to take advantage of a public  office."  </P> <P> Wieder said she questioned Slates about the dinner when contacted earlier this  week by the Times and was disturbed by discrepancies between his account and  those of others quoted in the newspaper.  </P> <P> "He gave me a completely different story from what's in the newspaper," Wieder  said. "I'm going to talk to Roger and get to the bottom of this."  </P> <P> Vasquez said he spoke by phone on Friday with Nordeck, who is out of town, and  that Nordeck maintained that he spent the evening working at the restaurant and  did not participate in the dinner.  </P> <P> "I'm going to chat with Steve when he gets back to get more perspective,"  Vasquez said. "I would reserve judgment until then."  </P> <P> Both von Elten and his campaign manager Dave Ellis said they do not remember  the names of all who attended the dinner.  </P> <P> Von Elten also said no per-plate price had been set, and that neither he nor  Ellis know for certain who paid for the affair, which he described as modest.  </P> <P> "I assumed someone paid for it," von Elten said. "It was steak and French  fries, not veal and caviar."  </P> <P> State law bars members of public commissions or boards from soliciting campaign  contributions of $250 or more from individuals who have matters pending before  them, according to a spokeswoman for the California Fair Political Practices  Commission.  </P> <P> Among the guests at the dinner, according to interviews with several of those  present, were Kevin A. Canning and Irwin R. Schatzman, both representatives of  Arvida Corp. In addition to the Coto de Caza subdivision near Trabuco Canyon,  Arvida is planning the Rolling Hills residential development near San Clemente.  Expansion plans for Coto de Caza are pending before the commission.  </P> <P> Also at the dinner, according to others present, was Lyle A. Overby, a  prominent lobbyist who represents the Santa Margarita Co. The firm is proposing  the Las Flores residential development, east of Mission Viejo. The project is  expected to go before the planning commission in the coming months.  </P> <P> Overby has declined to comment on the dinner or to confirm his presence there.  Schatzman and Canning acknowledged that they attended.  </P> <P> Earl Wooden, a 15-year planning commissioner most recently appointed by  Stanton, said reports of the dinner at Nordeck's restaurant raise serious  questions.  </P> <P> "I would never have a fund-raiser," Wooden said. "Even if I had a friend who  wanted a fund-raiser I would have to turn him down."  </P></p>

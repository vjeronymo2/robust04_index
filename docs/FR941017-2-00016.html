This program provided compensation to a company based upon the number of hours worked by employees over 50 years of age. A company participating in the program had to agree not to dismiss or release redundant employees of any age for any reason other than normal attrition. Payments were calculated on the basis of 28 Swedish kroner per hour for employees over age 50 who were involved in production. The payment could not exceed 15 percent of the company's total labor costs. In prior administrative reviews of this order, this program was determined to be countervailable because the program was available only to certain companies within the textile and apparel industry.

In January 1983, the Swedish government excluded the rayon fiber industry, including Svenska, from this program. We have calculated the benefit stream using the declining balance methodology. We allocated the benefits from the grant received in 1982 over the 10-year average useful life of assets in the rayon fiber industry, according to the ``Asset Guideline Classes'' of the Internal Revenue Service. As in prior reviews of the subject merchandise, we used Svenska's 1982 weighted cost of capital as the discount rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We divided the benefit attributable to the review period by the value of Svenska's total revenue during the review period. On this basis, we preliminarily determine the benefit from this program to be 0.26 percent  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad valorem. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preliminary Results of Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the net subsidy to be 0.26 percent ad valorem <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991.

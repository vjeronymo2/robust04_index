			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Greenwich Resources loses Pounds 0.7m GREENWICH Resources, the Worcestershire-based gold mining company, reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 697,000 for the 12 months to September 30 1992, against a profit of Pounds 108,000. The result was struck after an exceptional Pounds 337,000 cost resulting from the financial restructuring of the Australian subsidiary, United Goldfields, and redundancy costs. The operating loss amounted to Pounds 749,000 (Pounds 28,000). Losses per share rose from 0.2p to 1p. In spite of the sharp reversal, Mr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the year had been a positive one for the group. Highlights included the award of the Konos Concession in Greece and the completion of a joint venture agreement with Newcrest Mining to explore and exploit it. He added that during the last 18 months the group had been restructured and overheads had been significantly reduced.</p>

During his meeting with  Colonel Joseph Komisarz, commander of the 18th Logistics Group  of the 18th Wing at Kadena Air Base, Mayor Arakawa strongly  protested the accident, saying: "If anything went wrong, the  crash could have resulted in a terrible disaster. The crash is  a serious issue that threatens the lives of Okinawa citizens."  During the meeting, the mayor also asked the commander to work  for the prevention of future recurrences, stating: "The recent  crash was not the first accident involving U.S. military bases  on Okinawa.

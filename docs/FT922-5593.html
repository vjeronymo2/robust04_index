			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: What Now For Docklands - Political line raises hopes THE FINANCIAL collapse of Canary Wharf does not necessarily spell the end of the Jubilee Line underground extension or the government's plan to move civil servants to a Docklands site. In spite of the government's insistence that there was no prospect of a publicly funded rescue to bail out the development, the message emerging yesterday from Westmin-ster's corridors was more hopeful. The calculation behind it was informed both by hard-nosed pragmatism and an assessment of the political fallout that any decision will bring in its wake. On the Jubilee Line, the government has repeatedly emphasised that the extension would not be built without the Pounds 400m private-sector contribution that Olympia &amp; York had promised to put up. Although that remains the position, the hurdle is not as formidable as it at first appears. Only Pounds 100m of the money is due while the extension is being built. The balance does not even begin being paid until after completion, with instalments stretching more than two decades into the future. On that basis, the effective present value of the Pounds 300m shrinks towards insignificance. If the failure to lure private money leads to the extension's being scrapped, the government may face charges of cutting off its nose to spite its face. In terms of political capital, however, the government has a huge amount staked in Docklands' success. It might receive as much flak for deciding not to proceed with the extension  -hence placing a question mark over its future urban regeneration policies  -as for pumping in a relatively small amount of additional money. A cross-party motion calling for a parliamentary inquiry to reassess future policy in this area reinforces that impression. Such considerations will strengthen the hand of those within the cabinet, such as Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who may be expected to lead calls against fierce Treasury opposition for an active role in preserving confidence. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, contrived yesterday to reinforce the tough government line towards new public money while expressing confidence that the extension would be built. In terms of relocating civil servants, the government faces a fait accompli in that the Marsham Street premises housing thousands of environment and transport department officials are to be vacated. As Mr Howard admits, there are strong arguments for moving to Docklands. The department had been advised that 'the best value for money currently available' was in the area, he said yesterday. The prospect of Department of Transport employees being moved to the development does appear somewhat diminished, however, after the commissioning of an internal review into how many of its staff should remain in London. Some 1,300 transport employees are to be relocated.</p>

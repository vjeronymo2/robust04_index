			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / The US Goes To The Polls: Republican governors on the charge President Bill Clinton spent years as governor of Arkansas, and he often looks happiest when he is discussing policy with his former colleagues in the National Governors Association. But the club may be a little less friendly after the elections tomorrow, with Republican candidates poised to make a significant dent in the Democrats' long dominance of state politics. It is not just in the congressional elections that Democratic incumbents are threatened with dismissal by a disgruntled voting public. Prominent Democrats such as Governor Lawton Chiles in Florida, Governor Ann Richards in Texas and Governor Zell Miller in Georgia are in grave danger of losing their bids for re-election, while Republican Governor Pete Wilson, once a prime target for Democrats, now seems much safer in California. In New York, Governor Mario Cuomo now seems better placed to win a fourth term in office as his Republican challenger, Mr George Pataki, loses steam. But the Democrats still face the alarming possibility that they could wake up on Wednesday morning controlling only New York and North Carolina among the 10 largest states. In all, 22 incumbent governors are running for re-election tomorrow, and elections are also being held in 14 more states, many of which allow only one or two terms as governor. With the exception of Arizona and Maine, all the states which seem likely to change hands are held by Democrats. Some pollsters believe the Republicans could end up with more governorships than the Democrats  - which they last did in 1970. Low turnout among Democratic voters is also expected to bring Republican gains in the state legislatures. In the 10 biggest states, Republicans already control six state senates and need to pick up only one more seat to win control in Florida. They trail by a much bigger margin in the lower state chambers, but seem sure to take over the Michigan House. And the vote-drawing power of Governors John Engler of Michigan and George Voinovich of Ohio, both cruising to easy re-election, is expected to provide a strong boost to Republican candidates for open Senate seats in both states. State governments are not only the 'laboratories of democracy', as Mr Clinton and most other US politicians are fond of saying, in echo of Justice Louis Brandeis; they are also formidable political power bases. Governors can be a president's most potent allies in lobbying their state congressional delegations in favour of legislation. They could also be a crucial source of strength for presidential candidates in 1996. It is certainly possible to win in any state without the governor's help - Mr Clinton won California in 1992 despite Governor Wilson's backing for former President George Bush. But most state governors control their state party machinery, and this can be critical in primaries - as then vice-president George Bush found in New Hampshire in 1988, when Governor John Sununu rescued his candidacy after he had been thrashed by Senator Bob Dole in the Iowa caucus. All is not yet lost for the Democrats. Besides Mr Cuomo, who trailed his Republican opponent for months but recently seems to have opened a lead in the opinion polls of as much as 16 percentage points, Governor Roy Romer of Colorado has also shed earlier worries and established a comfortable margin. In Florida, Mr Chiles has also fared better in recent weeks against a strong challenge from Mr Jeb Bush, a Miami businessman and son of former President Bush, but even though some polls show him with a wafer-thin lead he is still reckoned to be in the 'endangered' category. So too is Ms Richards in Texas. Her folksy one-liners and general popularity in the state have done nothing to shake off the challenge of Mr George Bush, co-owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team and another son of the former president. Although national trends still seem to favour the Republicans, at the local level the individual candidate can still be more important. In Maine, for example, the Senate seat left open by the retirement of Democratic majority leader George Mitchell appears to be swinging to Republican Congresswoman Olympia Snowe. But in the election for the governorship vacated by retiring Governor Jock McKernan, Ms Snowe's husband, the Republican candidate is running a distant third; if Democrat Joe Brennan loses, it will be to independent businessman and television presenter Angus King.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Graduate science scheme 'helps cut company costs' YOUNG science graduates working for companies under the Teaching Company Scheme have helped to reduce costs substantially, according to a report published today. Under the scheme, set up in 1975, universities and companies form groups of recent graduates as 'associates', based full-time with the company. The scheme, which last year distributed Pounds 12m in grant to 393 companies, aims to encourage industrial investment in training, research and development. Companies received an average grant of Pounds 100,000, which led to average annual savings in costs of about Pounds 220,000, according to the report compiled by Sussex University's Science Policy Research Unit. Ms Jacqueline Senker, one of the report's authors, said the finding showed that the criticism of school science teaching over the sharp drop in the number of pupils taking science A-levels this year may have been misplaced. 'The failure is on the industrial side. There is very little policy to encourage employers to use and apply scientific methods and theories,' she said.

			<p>CSO     [Text] India is in the agonising process of an evaluation  whether the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, should  call-off or postpone his proposed visit to the United States,  sometime in summer. The Ministry of External Affairs itself is  sharply divided on the issue with one section strongly  advocating the visit, while the other group pleads that in the  vitiated atmosphere nothing tangible will emerge, which would  help consolidate the ties between the two countries and remove  growing misunderstandings on a host of issues.    If one were to analyse the tone and tenor of recent remarks  by the American President, Mr Bill Clinton, and his aides, it is  evident that they do not see India requiring any high-level  attention. Probably, this has been the trend for well over two  decades. No American President visited India since Mr Jimmy  Carter, nor for that matter has any Secretary of State come in  the past decade. There do not seem to be any plans for any  visits in the near future either.    The Americans have even managed without an Ambassador to  India. Basically, there is a love-hate relationship between  India and the United States. But all the loving and hating is  done by India only.    Be that as it may, there are those who feel that the recent  spate of provocative statements from the White House and the  State Department makes it all the more imperative for Mr  Narasimha Rao to meet the top U.S. leadership and other opinion  makers in the country. They point out that such  misunderstandings can only be sorted out at the highest  political level and the Prime Minister would be making a mistake  if he did not do so because of false prestige.    If indeed, as is widely believed here, certain key aides of  President Clinton were responsible for pushing this  administration towards a hostile position vis-a-vis India, a  personal encounter between him and Mr Rao may well restore the  balance. Moreover, Prime Minister Rao would also have the  opportunity in Washington to meet influential Congressmen,  Senators, officials, academics and journalists to explain New  Delhi's case on Kashmir, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty  (NPT) and a host of other contentious issues.    Those who support Mr Narasimha Rao's going to Washington are  convinced that he would get strong backing from the business  lobby there which is keen to invest in this country because of  the economic liberalisation. The Prime Minister himself is  perceived as the chief sponsor of the reform policy and this  should enable him [to] project a progressive image of India in  the United States as a counter to anti-Indian propaganda about  human rights violations in Kashmir and Punjab as well as on  nuclear proliferation in the sub-continent.    Comparisons are being drawn with the political leadership in  Beijing which has managed to deflect criticism on the human  rights front by luring big American business with tempting  investment prospects in China. A similar gambit by Narasimha  Rao, it is argued, could yield handsome dividends with U.S.  businessmen pressurising the Clinton Administration to stop  making provocative statements and gestures against this country.    The other argument in favour of the proposed visit by Mr  Narasimha Rao is that if he refused to go to Washington out of  pique with the Clinton administration, it would only allow  Pakistan--its Prime Minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, is also  scheduled to visit the United States within a few months--a free  propaganda run. It is felt that Ms Bhutto would then use this to  project New Delhi as inflexible and recalcitrant on issues like  Kashmir and NPT.    Those who are against the Prime Minister going to  Washington,  however, turn these arguments on their head. They point out that  in diplomacy, timing is almost everything and at a time when  there is so much suspicion and misunderstanding between  Washington and New Delhi, a Prime Ministerial visit could be  counterproductive with only the differences between two  countries getting articulated.    Conventional wisdom would suggest that the overall impact on  bilateral relations of the sustained barrage of negative  pronouncements on India from the Clinton Administration,  including the President himself, cannot be healed by a mere  visit to Washington by Mr Narasimha Rao. In fact, there is a  possibility of both sides being unduly sensitive about working  out a compromise at the moment.    There is also the question of personal vibes between Mr  Narasimha Rao and the U.S. President. Both leaders come from  different generations and cultures with clashing styles and  world views.    While it is possible that a leader like Rajiv Gandhi may  have  hit it off with President Clinton, this appears to be far more  unlikely in the case of Prime Minister Rao. Even if there are no  open hostilities, there is every chance that a personal  encounter between the two would be lacklustre and per-functory,  resulting in no diplomatic breakthrough.    Mr Narasimha Rao's mild professorial style, however  impressive to the knowledgeable on India affairs, is also  unlikely to attract much media attention in the United States.  This may lead to unfavourable comparisons with Ms Bhutto's visit  which is bound to cause more flutter in the U.S. media.    In any case, the flamboyant young Harvard educated leader  has  many more personal friends in the U.S. establishment,  particularly in the Clinton Administration. Under the  circumstances, Mr Narasimha Rao, if he goes to Washington, would  be running a patently unequal race with his Pakistani  counterpart.    Significantly, most officials both in the Foreign Office and  the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) are palpably unenthusiastic  about Mr Narasimha Rao visiting Washington at this point. While  the Foreign Office is worried about the risk of an unsuccessful  Prime Ministerial visit to the United States further  complicating the already vexed triangular relationship between  New Delhi, Washington and Islamabad, the PMO is apprehensive  about the political repurcussions at home in the event of Mr  Narasimha Rao failing to pull off a public relations coup with  President Clinton.    There is a vast body of opinion-makers in this country  today,  including the national media, which closely follows the progress  of Indo-U.S. ties under a microscope. Not surprisingly, the  success or failure of Mr Rao's visit in all probability would be  exaggerated beyond its real implications for the relationship  between the two countries.    While in the long run, whether the Prime Minister goes ahead  or not with his trip to the United States may have far less  impact on bilateral ties than other factors. Mr Rao would have  to carefully weigh the pros and cons before agreeing to fix  dates for the proposed visit.    This has posed a serious dilemma for the Prime Minister who  has been pressing for a visit to Washington for the past many  months. A successful trip, besides restoring balance to  Indo-U.S. ties, would add yet another diplomatic feather to Mr  Rao's cap already embroidered with recent breakthroughs in  Beijing and Tehran and Davos.    A failure or even a damp squib in Washington, on the other  hand, would not only mean a personal loss of face for Prime  Minister Rao but also further add to the mounting strident  anti-U.S. chorus in this country.</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YANKEES SHOCKED BY NEWS;  </P> <P> GAME: AFTER A 6-2 VICTORY OVER DETROIT, THEY EXPRESS SURPRISE AT THE SEVERITY  OF STEINBRENNER'S PUNISHMENT.  </P> <P> New York Yankee players and coaches got their first clue about George  Steinbrenner's fate when they heard the crowd. They knew the cheers meant  Steinbrenner had been given a stiff penalty.  </P> <P> Those cheers from the crowd of 24,037 came in the fourth inning when the  announcement of the Commissioner Fay Vincent's decision was made on the radio  as Yankee starter Dave LaPoint was pitching to Detroit's Cecil Fielder.  </P> <P> The game was delayed by the 90-second standing ovation, and when it resumed,  LaPoint gave up two-run homer to Fielder, his 33rd homer of the season.  </P> <P> "It looked like the fans were charging the mound before Fielder hit the home  run," said La Point, who ended up getting the victory in a 6-2 win over the  Tigers. "That's a terrible bunch of fans to react that way. It's a shame that  the fans who were out there erupted and made a joke out of it.  </P> <P> "It upset a lot of us."  </P> <P> After some players ventured into the clubhouse to listen to radio reports and  relayed the news of the decision, they reacted for the most part not with  sadness or glee, but with shock. They could not believe The Boss would be gone.  </P> <P> "We were prepared for a suspension, but this is way beyond what we were  expecting," pitcher Andy Hawkins said.  </P> <P> Pitcher Greg Cadaret grew speculative. "This place is going to be a zoo again  for a couple days. Who knows if they're going to have a fire sale? The trading  deadline is (today). They might define jobs better. The club's been in turmoil  all year. You get tired of all the off-field distractions around here."  </P> <P> After the game, Stump Merrill talked to his troops for about 10 minutes, then  emerged from the clubhouse.  </P> <P> Merrill seemed a bit choked up; Steinbrenner had given Merrill his greatest  professional moment when he named him Yankee manager on June 6.  </P> <P> "Obviously for me, as a proud Yankee, it's a sad day," Merrill said. "The man  has been great to me. He's meant a lot to me, and a lot to my family. I have  nothing but respect for the guy. I have to go by the way he treated me. He has  treated me with respect for 14 years."  </P> <P> Coach Mike Ferraro, a longtime Yankee employee, said, "I didn't think it would  be this bad. I was thinking in terms of him possibly not being suspended or  suspended for one year, but never being out of baseball.  </P> <P> "I feel badly for him. I know how much he wanted to win. I know how much he  loved being a Yankee."  </P> <P> Interestingly, no players expressed glee, despite the Yankees' recent problems.  </P> <P> LaPoint went so far as to criticize the commissioner. "I think it's pretty  severe," he said. "I think it's too harsh. (Steinbrenner) made some strange  moves and signed some high-priced players. I think that had a lot to do with  it."  </P> <P> Second baseman Steve Sax and longtime Yankee relief ace Dave Righetti were  sympathetic.  </P> <P> "I was hoping it wouldn't be that severe," Sax said. "He has been great to me  and it started with my negotiations. When I hurt my leg he wouldn't let me  drive my car. He sent a driver. Nobody did that, not the Dodgers. This is a  drag."  </P> <P> Said Righetti: "He tried to portray himself as the bad guy. But he's a man and  he has feelings, too."  </P> <P> Jesse Barfield and rookie Oscar Azocar knocked in three runs.  </P> <P> Barfield hit a solo homer off Steve Searcy (1-2) and added a two-run double.  </P> <P> Azocar hit his fourth homer in 14 major league games, a two-run shot in the  fourth to give the Yankees a 3-2 lead.  </P></p>

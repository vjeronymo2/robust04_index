			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: The capacity to recover Manufacturing industry could hardly be doing better, according to the CBI. Demand is growing, albeit slowly. Export prospects have taken only a limited knock from sterling's rise against the D-Mark. The strength of the US economy helps, especially since sterling is weaker against the dollar than when the last survey was taken. But export optimism also reflects the steepest fall in unit costs since 1958 which is helping to boost margins despite weak price rises. Less clear is the extent to which cost cutting has resulted in capacity being scrapped. A striking feature of the survey is the speed with which capacity use has risen. Only 57 per cent of respondents are now operating below capacity compared with 73 per cent a year ago. One reason could be that the official figures understate the true level of output and demand, but that sits badly with weak prices. Another may be that a slimmed-down capacity is being used more efficiently. Operational gearing would then be mainly responsible for the downward pressure on costs. Capacity use cannot continue to grow at this rate without running up against constraints. Though not an immediate problem, it would be comforting to see stronger evidence of investment growth. The survey suggests most new investment is still designed to improve efficiency rather than add capacity. Worry about inadequate return is a deterrent. That could be because real rates of interest are still too high. But many managers may still not have adjusted expectations of nominal return to the new low inflation environment.</p>

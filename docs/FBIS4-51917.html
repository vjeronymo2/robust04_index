			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- After 10 years of effort,  Korean physicists are close to launching a world-class  theoretical physics center together with their Asia-Pacific  counterparts.    The national university alliance of basic science center  headed by Kim Chae-wan, a physics professor at Seoul National  University, hosted a two-day meeting of the preparatory  committee for the Pacific theoretical physics center in Seoul  Monday and agreed to set up a research base in Korea, Japan or  China.    Six Korean representatives from the world of physics  including Kim, who chairs the committee along with Tokyo  University President Arima Akito, Melbourne University Dean B.  Mckellar and physics scholars from China, Taiwan, Malaysia,  Thailand and Vietnam attended the meeting.    Korea is said to be the leading candidate for the center,  but  as an international institute must have the approval and support  of the participating countries, the center is expected to open  no sooner than in two years' time.    The center will be the second international theoretical  physics research body after a similar one in Italy.</p>

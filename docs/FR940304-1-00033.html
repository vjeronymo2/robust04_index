			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Customs agrees and has determined to eliminate proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;146.98(b) from the revised proposed rule; and proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;146.98(c) is now redesignated as &sect;146.93(e). In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as previously emphasized, revised &sect;&sect;146.93, 146.95 and 146.96 now provide for consumption within the subzone. Moreover, Customs has decided to add an Appendix to proposed subpart H as revised in order to give detailed examples of attribution as well as the relative value calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After careful consideration of the comments received and further review of the matter, it has been determined to republish the proposal with the modifications noted and to allow interested persons an additional opportunity to submit comments on the proposal. Also, Customs has determined to add definitions in the revised proposed rule for ``feedstock factor'', ``petroleum refinery'', and ``refinery operating unit'', and to eliminate the definitions for ``protection of the revenue'' and ``stock in process'' formerly set forth in proposed &sect;146.92(m) and (o), respectively. Commenters on the original proposal need not resubmit their comments. They will be considered along with any new comments received in response to this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In developing the final regulations, any written comments (preferably in triplicate) that are timely submitted to Customs will be given consideration, along with the comments already submitted in response to the August 10, 1992, notice of proposed rulemaking. Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), &sect;1.4, Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and &sect;103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)), during regular business days between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., at the Regulations Branch, 1099 14th Street, NW., suite 4000, Washington, D.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons explained in the peamble to the prior notice of proposed rulemaking and to this document, pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .), it is hereby certified that the proposed amendments set forth in this document, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

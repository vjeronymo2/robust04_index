			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["BS-Press" report under rubric "According to Reports From </F> Correspondents and Information Agencies": "According to  Information From the Chamber of Control, a Large Part of  Humanitarian Aid Is Not Reaching Its Destination"]    [Text] Referring to violations connected with receiving  and distributing humanitarian aid, Revaz Shavishvili, chairman  of the Chamber of Control, stated today in an interview given to  the "Alioni" [television] program that the Chamber of Control  has simply confirmed something that was already known to the  population. According to Shavishvili, a significant part of  humanitarian aid given by countries to Georgia in the form of  medicines and food products either does not leave the warehouse  for a long period of time or, after being allocated its place of  destination, ends up in the hands of commercial structures. As  an example, he mentioned 58,000 ampules of insulin and two dozen  tonnes of cheese that could no longer be used as their  consumption date had expired.    Shavishvili also pointed out that, despite a multitude of  similar facts exposed by the Chamber of Control during the  course of recent checks, they still do not reflect the real  state of affairs. Shavishvili believes the reason for such chaos  lies in the lack of a single coordination center for the  distribution of humanitarian aid.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Appointments: Record of sales growth Retix, a Californian company specialising in networking systems that enable otherwise incompatible computers and software to talk to each other, has chosen Gareth Buchanan-Robinson to be managing director of its non-US activities, Retix UK, which covers Scandinavia, Benelux, the Middle East, and Africa as well as the UK. For the past two years he had been in charge of Retix General International, a subsidiary now merged into Retix UK. Buchanan-Robinson, a 35-year-old Englishman, who also speaks Italian, is poised for an aggressive marketing push within Europe of the so-called Open Systems Interconnection products of which Retix claims to be a leading supplier. 'We expect Retix to become a Dollars 200m corporation by 1995,' he says. Sales last year amounted to Dollars 60.5m. An economics graduate from Aston University, Buchanan-Robinson does, however, have a record of sales growth. In his previous capacity at Retix, he claims to have increased turnover by 60 per cent in the space of 12 months; he was previously international sales manager at an Eastman Kodak subsidiary, International Systems Corporation, where he also presided over a rapid expansion. Previous employers included Norsk Data Computer Systems, where he helped set up subsidiaries in Germany and the UK.</p>

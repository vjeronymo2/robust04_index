			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Visa head quits after coup by big US banks MR Charles Russell, head of the Visa International payments organisation for nearly a decade, was dethroned yesterday after a quiet coup by some of the world's biggest card issuers. Mr Russell, 63, helped cement Visa's position as the world's biggest payment-card brand name, taking the number of Visa cards around the world to 318m by the end of June. More than Dollars 500bn was billed on Visa cards in the 12 months to June, compared with Dollars 4bn in 1984, when Mr Russell took over. But against a background of intensified competition in the credit card industry and inroads made in the US market by Visa's smaller rival, Mastercard, some of the biggest US banks had become impatient for new leadership at the payment group. 'It's a big bureaucracy: they don't manage with an eye on the bottom line,' said one US bank which issues Visa cards yesterday - while paying tribute to Mr Russell's success. Mr Russell will be replaced as president and chief executive at the start of next year by an out sider. The appointment of Mr Edmund Jensen, 56, vice-chairman and chief operating officer of Oregon-based US Bancorp, represents a move to bring in new blood to the senior management, one bank said. In an apparent concession to his stature in the industry, though, the Visa board has agreed that Mr Russell will continue to work on strategic issues until the company's annual general meeting next June. Mr Russell's departure is the latest in a series of high-level changes at the San Francisco-based payment group, which is owned by more than 18,000 banks around the world. In August, Mr Carl Pascarella - a protege of Mr Russell - was brought in to head the US card business in preference to Mr Robert Heller. The US has experienced the most intense competition in the credit card business, leading to lower fees and lending margins for card issuers. A Visa spokesman, meanwhile, denied the decision over the timing of Mr Russell's retirement had been taken out of his hands. 'Chuck has had an extremely good relationship with the board,' he said. At a press conference Mr Edmund Jensen, his successor, praised Mr Russell's contribution in building up the world's biggest payment services group. A press release quoted Mr Russell as saying earlier this year that no chief executive should stay in the job for more than 10 years. Mr Jensen said Mr Russell's legacy was such that he did not envisage making any major organisational changes.</p>

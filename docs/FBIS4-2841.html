			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 13 (CNA) -- Responding to the  "southern strategy" launched by the government last August to  cool the Mainland investment fever among local business people,  271 local companies have shown a willingness to invest in  Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia, the Ministry of  Economic Affairs reported Wednesday [13 April].    According to a survey made public by the ministry, 132 of  the  companies said they have plans to invest in Vietnam, 83 want to  go into the Philippines, and 56 are aiming for Indonesian  expansion.    The Industrial Development Bureau said those businesses  interested in investing in the three countries are largely from  the electronics, machinery, yacht-building, plastics, and  foodstuffs industries. And aiming to further promote trade and  economic ties with those countries, the bureau said it has set  up several ad-hoc groups to provide the latest trade information  on the countries to local businesses.    Additionally, the industrial development and investment  center under the Economics Ministry will hold intensive  week-long seminars for local investors, starting April 20,  focusing on the investment climates in the three countries,  along with information regarding government incentives on offer  from those countries and relevant regulations.    Opinions and suggestions aired by local businessmen at the  seminars will be collected and compiled by the government as a  guide to future policy-making, the bureau added.</p>

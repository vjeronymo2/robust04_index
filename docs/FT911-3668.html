			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Slovak premier forced to quit MR Vladimir Meciar, prime minister of the Slovak Republic, was ousted by parliament yesterday and replaced by Mr Jan Carnogursky, his deputy and chief rival, writes Leslie Colitt in Prague. Slovakia faced the prospect of intensified political conflict after Mr Meciar threatened to march on the government in Bratislava. Nearly 1,000 of his supporters gathered outside parliament last night demanding his reinstatement. The presidium of parliament also forced out of government all but one of the members of Mr Meciar's Public Against Violence (PAV) movement which formed a coalition with Mr Carnogursky's Christian Democrats. Several had supported Mr Meciar's new breakaway nationalist group, PAV-Platform for a Democratic Slovakia. He won more than 80 per cent support in recent opinion polls in Slovakia. Mr Meciar opposed Prague's free market economic reforms because the Slovak economy stands to lose most jobs. Mr Carnogursky has been ambivalent about Slovak independence. He favours a treaty with Prague on continuing the federation. President Vaclav Havel rejects this.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK accounting The UK business community is divided on the thorny issue of accounting for goodwill. The Accounting Standards Board is no exception. Today's discussion paper offers two methods of treating goodwill, the premium to net assets paid by companies on acquisition. Half the board's members believe that goodwill is not a measurable asset and should be written off to reserves. The rest maintain that it should be capitalised in the balance sheet. Rather than writing off all goodwill over a fixed period, though, companies would depreciate only if the investment falls in value. The second approach might have the virtue of capturing companies which overpay for acquisitions, since big depreciation charges should result. But that assumes a watertight method of valuing companies can be found. The discounted cash flow test suggested by the ASB depends on assumptions about margins and overheads, which are highly subjective. The ASB hopes to prevent abuse by insisting on a second test, based on the past performance of the acquired company. Whether that would be sufficient to prevent over-optimistic valuations remains, at best, unproven. Still, if the method is shown to be sound, the approach deserves a fair hearing. The wider danger is that companies and accountancy firms might come to dominate the debate. Two-thirds of written responses came from these parties during the last attempt to find a solution. The onus is on shareholders and other users of accounts to make their views known. A politically acceptable solution which detracts from transparency is not a desirable outcome.</p>

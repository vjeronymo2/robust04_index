			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / 'Green' project at Consett steel site PLANS WERE unveiled yesterday for the Pounds 100m transformation of the former Consett steelworks site in County Durham into environmentally friendly parkland, comprising 1m sq ft of industrial and commercial premises, houses and leisure amenities amid woodland and open space. The 700-acre hilltop site has stood empty since the works closed in 1980, costing Consett its final 3,600 steelmaking jobs and turning the town into a symbol of the last manufacturing recession. Yesterday, after years of preparation, Derwentside District Council announced it had chosen Dysart Developments, developer of Newcastle's Pounds 140m Business Park, to undertake the seven-year scheme. The council hopes Project Genesis will create 4,000 jobs and confirm Consett's new 'green' identity. Reclamation of the site cost Pounds 10m in government money. The council is transferring ownership to a charitable trust, which will lease the land to Dysart. The Pounds 100m project cost includes Pounds 13m in UK and European Community funds with the rest coming from the private sector.</p>

Yang Yongliang, Wang Yang, Lu Shengdao,  and Wang Sheyun spoke at the meeting.    Our province achieved marked results in public security work  in 1993. The struggle of cracking down on crimes continues to  develop. The number of criminal cases resolved increased by a  great margin over the number in 1992. Public security and  prevention work have obviously been strengthened. We have  achieved step by step results in the anticorruption struggle.  The overall quality of police and cadres has been enhanced.  [passages omitted]    In his speech at the meeting, Deputy Secretary Yang  Youngliang pointed out: Public Security organs at all levels  should place the work of maintaining political stability and  social security high on the agenda. It is necessary to  unswervingly adhere to the principle of cracking down on  criminal activities in accordance with the law and deal with  them quickly and severely. More efforts should be made to  strengthen the building of the public security contingent so as  to meet the needs of the situation as it develops. He urged  party committees and governments at all levels to  conscientiously strengthen and improve their leadership over  public security work and create good conditions for public  security organs to enforce the law. In this way, public  security organs will be able to better play their important role.    Wang Yang, provincial CPC committee standing member and vice  governor, also spoke at the meeting.</p>

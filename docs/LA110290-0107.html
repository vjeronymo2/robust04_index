			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER FILING FOR FREE AGENCY, DOWNING SAYS HE STILL PLANS TO SPEAK WITH RADER  </P> <P> Brian Downing filed for free agency Thursday, fearing that he might run afoul  of the Sunday midnight filing deadline if he postponed filing until he was able  to reach Angel Manager Doug Rader.  </P> <P> But the 40-year-old designated hitter said he won't pursue a job with other  teams until he can talk with Rader and determine whether there's even the  smallest possibility that he might return to the Angels for a 14th season.  </P> <P> Rader is expected back this weekend from a Latin American scouting trip.  </P> <P> "Tom (Reich, Downing's agent) did it," Downing said. "He said we might as well  just go ahead and file because we might have had a time problem if I don't talk  to Doug Saturday. But I'm still not going to try and search around until I talk  to Doug. This was really a clerical move. Step 1, that's all. Nothing else has  changed."  </P> <P> In other news, Angel reliever Greg Minton, who had announced his intention to  retire, also filed for free agency. HELENE ELLIOTT  </P></p>

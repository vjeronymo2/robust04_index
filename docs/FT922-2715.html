			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Venture financing recovers slowly THE VENTURE capital market in the west Midlands is slowly recovering, but most finance is directed at corporate restructuring, particularly management buy-outs, fund managers have reported. Mr Alan Lewis, regional director of County NatWest Ventures, said higher demand for development capital as companies sought equity to finance expansion out of recession - a trend expected since the general election - had not taken place to any marked degree. That indicated 'the recovery is a slow and painful process at best'. 3i, the UK's largest venture capital group, has seen its activity decline since the pre-election period, although it is committing more funds to management buyouts. Mr Chris Rowlands, Birmingham director of 3i, said in financial terms that meant 'our activity is very strong, but it is not an accurate reflection of underlying economic activity'. Fund managers explained that the low demand for development capital reflected nervousness not only about the state of order books but also about strict bank policies. Only 10 per cent of a Pounds 20m fund set up last August by 3i for small inner-city businesses in the west Midlands had been taken up, Mr Rowlands said. Mr Brian Blakemore, regional director of Barclays Development Capital, said the main emphasis had been in two categories - 'groups divesting of subsidiaries because they have a need for cash, and family businesses where outside management has been brought in and which now wants to buy'. Nevertheless, whereas some venture capitalists did no deals in the first quarter of last year, now they are bringing to fruition schemes put on ice in the months before the election.</p>

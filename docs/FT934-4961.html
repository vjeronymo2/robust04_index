			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: France to offer Erap certificates when Elf is sold The French government will offer to exchange non-voting investment certificates in Erap, the government agency which controls Elf-Aquitaine, when the oil group is privatised at the beginning of next year, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister said yesterday. The offer for the certificates in Erap is aimed at simplifying the privatisation issue. The issue, which is expected to raise about FFr50bn (Dollars 8.5bn), is the biggest so far in the government's plan to sell 21 publicly-owned groups. Mr Alphandery said terms of the offer for the Erap certificates would be decided on the basis of recommendations from the privatisation commission, an independent body which advises the government on the terms and pricing of privatisation issues. Trading in the certificates will be suspended until the terms have been fixed. At the time of their suspension yesterday, the investment certificates were trading at FFr361.1 compared with the Elf share price which stood at FFr411.7. Individual investors in the privatisation issue of Rhone-Poulenc, which was completed last week, will receive an extra share, the economy ministry said yesterday. Investors will receive 17 shares in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group. Those who applied for a separate allocation, in which payment was made with Balladur bonds, will receive 16 rather than 15 shares. Investors were originally offered 60 shares, and a further 60 if they paid with Balladur bonds - a government debt issue launched last summer. The decision to raise the amount followed a final calculation of demand for the shares. The issue was three times over-subscribed.</p>

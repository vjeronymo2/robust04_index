Responding to a question by our special  correspondent Yeoryios Kharvalias, the Skopjean president  explained his reservations about the name Slavomacedonia but  left open the possibility of accepting a compound name.    [Begin recording] [Gligorov] "I said that we are prepared to  discuss all unresolved issues and I believe that the best  solution will emerge as a result of such a dialogue. Let us  examine all the arguments. Concerning the name Slavomacedonia,  I must stress that we are a multinational state. A name that  would define us nationally must be accepted by all the residents  of the country and not intensify problems between the  minorities. However, I repeat once again that everything must  be put on the negotiating table."    [Kharvalias] This important statement by Kiro Gligorov,  which  outlines his intention for a discussion of all the issues,  including the name, was made to ET-1 and moves the stagnant  waters after many months of Skopjean intransigence, which led  the Greek Government to proceed with the blockade. Is this a  tactical maneuver or a substantial turn in Gligorov's policy?  Time will tell. However, it is interesting to hear what Mr.  Gligorov said when we asked him what he expects from the meeting  Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will have with UN  mediator Cyrus Vance in Geneva on 10 March.    [Gligorov] "According to my information, the Vance-Papoulias  meeting in Geneva is to make preparations for a bilateral  meeting. I am not in a position to say when this meeting will  take place. Everything will depend on what happens in Geneva.  However, within the framework of protecting peace, a friendly  settlement of the differences between Greece and Skopje depends  on goodwill, and the resumption of talks under the UN auspices  appears as the only reasonable solution. I think that it is  time for the measures to be lifted and for us to proceed with  open discussions on all issues. On our part, we have nothing but  goodwill, and I hope that with mutual understanding the problems  can be solved."    [Kharvalias] The Skopjean president was for the first time  relatively conciliatory when asked about the three Greek  conditions for the resumption of the dialogue. He said: There  is goodwill on our part to discuss all the pending issues  including the three Greek prerequisites. He added: However, it  is not right for these to be set as conditions. If we accept  everything in advance what would be left to discuss? The  Skopjean leader expressed his displeasure at the recent Greek  measures. However, his statements were made in a relatively  mild tone.    Mr. Gligorov said indicatively: I believe this is not a  creative approach for two neighboring countries such as Greece  and Skopje that are not facing major problems. Instead of  understanding, we have an embargo on a bilateral basis without a  Security Council decision, as was the case with Serbia.    Mr. Gligorov's position on relations with the neighboring  countries was also important. He said: We must have friendly  relations with states such as Albania, Bulgaria, and the  Yugoslav Federation. As for Turkey, relations are good but  nothing special, Mr. Gligorov added. The Skopjean president  also commented on the aid granted to his country by neighboring  Albania. He said: We were using and will continue to use  Albanian routes to transport goods to our state, but I do not  see the reason why preconditions should be set concerning the  Albanian minority living in Skopje.    Finally, we asked the Skopjean president about his country's  relations with the United States in the light of U.S.  recognition, which has not been accompanied by the establishment  of diplomatic relations.    [Kharvalias, in English] The United States recently  recognized your country as FYROM but it has declined to  establish diplomatic relations. Does Mr. President think that  this is a matter of time?    [Gligorov] "Usually, when a country recognizes another  country it intends to establish diplomatic relations. So, I  believe that the opening of an American embassy in Skopje is  merely a matter of time." [end recording]</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Solvency rules set to be diluted The government is planning to make significant concessions to employers in its pension reform legislation by watering down solvency requirements that could have forced schemes to sell shares and buy UK government securities. It is understood that a reference to the legislation will be contained in the Queen's Speech later this month and that a bill will be presented in the second week of December. In a white paper issued in June, it was proposed that each occupational pension scheme hold enough assets to be able to provide members with the 'cash equivalent' of their accrued pension entitlements. The amount of cash needed to provide future benefits is dependent upon the rate of interest earned in the years before retirement. Actuaries use returns on gilts as the basis for such calculations because, unlike equity investments, the return on a particular gilt can be calculated with some certainty over time. Employers, who on average hold 80 per cent of their portfolios in UK and international equities, feared the white paper proposals would involve their schemes switching from equities into gilts. They could also involve making significant cash injections into the schemes. The government now intends to allow returns on equities to be used for calculating cash equivalents for people within 10 years of their retirement date. Only holdings of UK equities will count for this purpose. A source familiar with the proposals said yesterday that although the changes represented current government thinking, they had not yet been etched in stone. The government also intends that returns on equities be used to calculate the value of assets needed to pay cash equivalents to existing pensioners.</p>

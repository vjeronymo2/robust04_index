			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISQUALIFICATION ENDS COUNCIL RACE  </P> <P> What began as a dull campaign has evolved into no contest at all after local  officials this week canceled what would have been the first election since the  Crescenta Valley Town Council was formed.  </P> <P> One of two candidates competing for the council's only contested seat has been  disqualified, leading the council president this week to declare the sole  candidates for the three open seats as automatic winners. "There will not be an  election," said council President Thomas M. Johnston.  </P> <P> "Personally, I was looking forward to an election to demonstrate community  support for the council," said Johnston, who has served as president since the  council formed last March. "I feel like a radio disc jockey: You know you're  talking but you don't know if anyone out there is listening."  </P> <P> There were six seats up for election: one with a two-year term in each of the  council's three districts, and one non-voting, one-year alternate position in  each district. No candidates filed for the three non-voting seats. Johnston  said the empty positions on the 12-member council will be filled by appointment  after new council officers are seated in April.  </P> <P> Council members Judy Tejeda and Bill Beavers are not being challenged in their  reelection bids. Johnston last week declared them the winners and canceled the  election in their districts.  </P> <P> The incumbent in the third district, Councilman Anthony P. Hurtado, is not  seeking reelection. Two newcomers, Robert E. Yanez and Marjorie R. Koerber, had  filed for that seat.  </P> <P> After the two competitors appeared at three public forums, Koerber said, she  learned late Thursday that she lives outside the unincorporated county  territory the council represents.  </P> <P> Koerber, an office manager who has lived in the area for 21 years, said, "I  never thought of my home as other than La Crescenta," which is the mailing  address she uses.  </P> <P> However, her home in the 2900 block of Piedmont Avenue is three blocks inside  the northeastern boundary of Glendale. She said officials of the Town Council  and Chamber of Commerce failed to notice the discrepancy when she filed as a  candidate.  </P> <P> "If the council didn't know it and the chamber didn't know it, how was I  supposed to know it?" she said.  </P> <P> Koerber said the error was discovered by Councilman Don Hogue after she gave  Hogue directions to her home.  </P></p>

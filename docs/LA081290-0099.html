			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'PAIR DIED AS THEY LIVED -- METHODICALLY': WERE COUPLE'S LIVES TOO STERILE TO  BEAR?  </P> <P> After reading with great interest about the suicides of Douglas and Dana  Ridenour ("Pair Died as They Lived -- Methodically," Aug. 3), I'm left with  some unanswered questions about their life together, a well-ordered life to be  sure.  </P> <P> While they climbed the ladder to apparent success, did it lean against any kind  of supportive system in their emotional and personal lives? The word "friends"  is glaringly missing as "co-workers, relatives and neighbors" gave their  impressions of the couple.  </P> <P> The Ridenours' preference seemed not to encourage relationships outside  themselves.  </P> <P> Is it possible that despite their attempt to lead excessively controlled,  sterile lives, they came to the conclusion it lacked real meaning?  </P> <P> Were they very lonely in spite of their dependence on each other?  </P> <P> Where did they go for holidays?  </P> <P> What made them laugh?  </P> <P> What did they give?  </P> <P> The article stated they were not religious. While a lot of people do not  prescribe to an organized affiliation, they are still enhanced by a spiritual  life, an inherent desire to reach out to others in need, and they are rewarded  with an enrichment that the pursuit of materials goods cannot replace.  </P> <P> Today's society encourages us to be status conscious, independent in direct  contrast to our basic human needs for interdependence, and support for each  other in the community.  </P> <P> It is my opinion that it was not really a fear of growing old that prompted  their decision to die together, but perhaps realizing the possibility of a  meaningless life ahead of them.  </P> <P> They worked hard for society's stamp of approval that announced them as  successful, in control of their lives.  </P> <P> None of this seemed to bring them the happiness that seemingly eluded them.  Love does not kill.  </P> <P> PEGGY DARNELL  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P></p>

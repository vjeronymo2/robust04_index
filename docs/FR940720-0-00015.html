			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Amendments to 10 CFR Part 171: Annual Fees for Reactor Operating Licenses, and Fuel Cycle Licenses and Materials Licenses, Including Holders of Certificates of Compliance, Registrations, and Quality Assurance Program Approvals and Government Agencies Licensed by NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Six amendments have been made to 10 CFR Part 171. First,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;171.11(a)(2) is amended to provide that State-owned research reactors used primarily for educational training and academic research purposes will be exempt from the annual fee. The NRC believes that this change is consistent with the legislative intent of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 that government-owned research reactors be exempt from annual fees if they meet the technical design criteria for the exemption and are used primarily for educational training and academic research purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, &sect;&sect;171.15 and 171.16 are amended to revise the annual fees for FY 1994 to recover approximately 100 percent of the FY 1994 budget authority, less fees collected under 10 CFR Part 170 and funds appropriated from the NWF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, fee Category 2 of &sect;171.16(d) is amended by establishing two new fee categories, 2.A.(3) and 2.A.(4), relating to the disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material as defined by the Atomic Energy Act. The current fee Category 4.D. has been eliminated. This action recognizes that (1) part of the budgeted costs for the uranium recovery class of licensees should be allocated to source material licenses that authorize receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) material because some of these budgeted resources are used to regulate these licensees and (2) a further distinction should be made between those licenses whose primary purpose is to authorize receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material requiring the establishment of a new mill tailings pile and those non-operating mills that accept 11e.(2) byproduct material for disposal incidental to tailings piles created by mill operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, fee Category 18 of &sect;171.16(d) is amended to assess fees to the Department of Energy (DOE) for its general license in 10 CFR 40.27. The general license fulfills a requirement of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA) (Public Law 95&hyph;604) that the perpetual custodian of reclaimed uranium mill tailings piles be licensed by the NRC. The general license provided for in the regulation covers only post-reclamation closure custody and site surveillance. Based on NRC's acceptance of DOE's Long Term Surveillance Plan for the Spook, Wyoming, site on September 21, 1993, the site is now subject to the general license in 10 CFR 40.27. Because DOE now holds an NRC license, it is subject to annual fees. The NRC had previously indicated its intent to bill DOE for UMTRCA costs once post-closure was achieved and the sites were licensed by the Government (56 FR 31481; July 10, 1991). As a result, DOE will be billed for the costs associated with NRC's UMTRCA review of all activities associated with the facilities assigned to DOE under UMTRCA. As with other licensees, the annual fee for this class of licensees (DOE UMTRCA facilities) will recover the generic and other regulatory costs not recovered through 10 CFR Part 170 fees. Because DOE, as a Federal agency, cannot be assessed Part 170 fees under the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 (IOAA), the result is that NRC will assess annual fees to DOE for the total costs of DOE UMTRCA activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, 10 CFR 171.17 is amended to add a proration provision for materials licenses and to revise the proration provision for reactors. The annual fee for materials licensees is prorated based on applications filed after October 1 of the fiscal year to terminate a license or obtain a POL. Those materials licensees who file applications between October 1 and March 31 of the fiscal year to terminate the license or obtain a POL will be assessed one-half the annual fee stated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;171.16(d) for the affected fee category(ies). Those materials licensees filing applications on or after April 1 of the fiscal year to terminate a license or obtain a POL will be assessed the full annual fee for that fiscal year. Those licensees who file for termination or POL must also permanently cease operations of relevant licensed activities during the periods mentioned for the fees to be reduced. Similarly, materials licensees who were issued new licenses during the fiscal year will be charged a prorated annual fee based on the date of issuance of the new license. New materials licenses issued during the period October 1 through March 31 will be assessed one-half of the annual fee stated in &sect;171.16(d) for the applicable fee category(ies) for that fiscal year. New licenses issued on or after April 1 will not be assessed an annual fee for that fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proration provision in &sect;171.17 applicable to reactors is amended to provide that, for licensees who have requested an amendment to withdraw operating authority permanently during the FY, the annual fee will be prorated based on the number of days during the FY the operating license was in effect before either the possession only license was issued or the license was terminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fifth, Footnote 1 of 10 CFR 171.16(d) is amended to provide for a waiver of the FY 1994 annual fees for those materials licensees, and holders of certificates, registrations, and approvals who either filed for termination of their licenses or approvals or filed for possession only/storage licenses prior to October 1, 1993, and permanently ceased licensed activities entirely by September 30, 1993. All other licensees and approval holders who held a license or approval on October 1, 1993, are subject to FY 1994 annual fees. This change is in recognition of the fact that since the final FY 1993 rule was published in July 1993, licensees have continued to file requests for termination of their licenses or certificates with the NRC. Other licensees have either called or written to the NRC since the FY 1993 final rule became effective requesting further clarification and information concerning the annual fees assessed. The NRC is responding to these requests as quickly as possible. However, the NRC was unable to respond and take action on all of the requests before the end of the fiscal year on September 30, 1993. Similar situations existed after the FY 1991 and FY 1992 rules were published, and in those cases NRC provided an exemption from the requirement that the annual fee is waived only where a license is terminated before October 1 of each fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Proposed IRP/EIS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> An ``IRP'' is simply a plan which broadly identifies the actions a utility anticipates undertaking to meet demands for electric service and to achieve its long-term objectives or goals. The most important objective for TVA's IRP is to maintain and enhance its competitiveness. TVA views ``competitiveness'' broadly and believes it has a number of components, including charging rates for the electricity it generates that will be among the lowest in the Nation, providing reliable service that meets its customers' needs, ensuring that its activities are cost effective and produce value for its customers, promoting sustainable economic growth in the TVA region, and accomplishing all of the above consistent with TVA's goal of being an environmental leader. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, TVA expects the IRP/EIS to address the demand for power on the TVA system (how much electricity TVA will be called upon to provide in the future), the value of various resource options to TVA's customers, the means of meeting that demand (alternatives), and the potential environmental, economic, and operating effects of those means. The IRP/EIS will project future energy demands over at least a 25-year period. These projections will be made through ``load forecasts'' and the IRP/EIS will explain how these are conducted. In addition, the IRP will include a short-term action plan that will identify actions or activities which should be undertaken to meet IRP milestones or preserve energy options. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IRP/EIS will identify and address the energy resources on the TVA system including existing resources and those which are currently under construction. Based on the results of the IRP/EIS, TVA may, for example, decide to operate an existing resource differently or not operate it, or may decide to accelerate, modify, or cancel ongoing energy resource construction projects. In the interim, TVA will continue to serve its customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time, we anticipate that the IRP/EIS process will focus on at least three important areas: (1) Demand-side management measures and electrotechnologies that will promote more efficient use of energy; (2) generating resources, including restart of Browns Ferry Unit 1, completion of TVA's Watts Bar Nuclear Plant Unit 2 and Bellefonte Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2, and major improvement projects at fossil and hydro plants; and (3) new technologies on both the supply and demand side such as clean coal technologies, biomass generation, improved lighting, more efficient motors, and electric vehicles. The IRP/EIS will consider such things as the potential effects of non-utility generation and dispersed power, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and other significant legislation, fuel prices, and conservation penetration rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental effects of a range of alternative energy strategies will be addressed in the IRP/EIS and compared to one another. Because of the programmatic nature of the proposal and review process, TVA anticipates that the environmental effects which are examined will be those that are regional national, or global in scale or which are generic. This would include such potential environmental effects and issues as emissions of greenhouse gases, acid rain, other air quality concerns, water quality effects, waste generation and disposal, and pollution prevention. Socioeconomic impacts within the region that may result from alternative energy strategies would also be considered. The more site-specific effects (those which depend on the specific location of a proposed action such as the construction of a new generating facility) will not be addressed in detail or not at all. This would include such things as potential effects on wetlands, floodplains, prime farmlands, threatened and endangered species, and cultural resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Scoping Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> TVA is interested in receiving comments on the areas and issues identified above, and the scope of the IRP/EIS. TVA specifically requests comments on: (1) TVA's overall approach to the IRP process, (2) the kinds of alternatives which should be evaluated in the IRP/EIS, (3) the significant environmental impacts and issues which should be assessed in the IRP/EIS, and (4) the environmental impacts and issues which should be considered unimportant or insignificant for the IRP/EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important the TVA's customers and all of those interested in planning the energy future of the Tennessee Valley region participate in the IRP/EIS process. As part of both the scoping and draft EIS review processes, TVA intends to seek out the views of and meet regularly with representatives of ``stakeholder'' groups interested in the energy and environmental future of the Valley. In addition, numerous opportunities will be made available to the general public to provide input into and comments on the IRP/EIS as it proceeds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following completion of scoping, a Draft IRP/EIS will be prepared and released for public review and comment. Notice of the availability of this draft will be announced, comments on the draft solicited, and information about additional public meetings/hearings will be published at a future date. TVA contemplates releasing a Final EIS and IRP in late 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Dated: January 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=2 --> Ronald L.

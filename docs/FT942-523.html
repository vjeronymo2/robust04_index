			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Germany sends home Effenberg Germany have sent home midfielder Stefan Effenberg from the World Cup finals after he made an obscene gesture to the crowd during the world champions' 3-2 win against South Korea on Monday. Effenberg did not train with the team and soccer federation press chief Wolfgang Niersbach simply said: 'He is no longer part of the squad.' Effenberg is the second German player to be sent home from a World Cup. Goalkeeper Uli Stein was sent back from the 1986 finals after he criticised coach Franz Beckenbauer.</p>

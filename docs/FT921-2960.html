			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Several base metals were testing support levels at the end of a quiet day on the LME. Traders pointed to the continued lack of fundamental news dampening recent bullish sentiment. COPPER ignored the strike by Peruvian copper workers and three-month metal continued to edge into the support area between Dollars 2,220 and Dollars 2,225 a tonne from which the market bounced last week. Three-month ALUMINIUM, having failed to break up through resistance in the Dollars 1,315 to Dollars 1,320 band last week, eased throughout the day under liquidation and light sell stops. Traders now see a test of the Dollars 1,280 to Dollars 1,285 support level. Three-month ZINC, attempting to consolidate last week's sharp gains, was aided by developing support which absorbed liquidation on any dip to Dollars 1,230 a tonne. Traders said if the consolidation is successful then a rise to test resistance around Dollars 1,260 is possible near term. London's robusta COFFEE lost morning gains by the close as New York failed to gather enough support to break through the 74.50 cents resistance level in near May, traders said. The New York arabica market was awaiting news of a meeting between Central American producers and US trade officials on renewed export quotas. Compiled from Reuters</p>

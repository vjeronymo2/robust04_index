MLVP II, a limited partnership organized under the laws of Delaware, is a business development company under the Act. MLVP II has five general partners, consisting of four individuals (the ``Individual General Partners'') and one managing general partner, MLVP II Co., L.P. (the ``Managing General Partner''). The Individual General Partners include three independent general partners (defined to be individuals who are not ``interested persons'' of MLVP II within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act) (the ``Independent General Partners'') and one general partner who is an individual and who is an affiliated person of the Managing General Partner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Management Company is an indirect subsidiary of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. (``ML &amp; Co.''). The Management Company performs or arranges for management and administrative services for MLVP II. MLVP II, the Managing General Partner, and the Management Company have retained DLJ Capital Management Corporation (the ``Sub-Manager'') to provide management services in connection with the venture capital investments of MLVP II. The Sub-Manager is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DLJ Capital, which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, Inc. (``DLJ''). DLJ is a subsidiary of the Equitable Companies Inc. The Managing General Partner, the Management Company, and the Sub-Manager are registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. The Corporate Express Transactions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Corporate Express is a privately held distributor of office supplies and products. In 1991, the Management Company, on behalf of MLVP II, and certain entities managed by DLJ Capital (the ``DLJ Companies'') acquired shares of Corporate Express. MLVP II could not hold shares of Corporate Express at that time since co-investments with the DLJ Companies may have violated certain provisions of the Act. In 1992, the SEC issued an exemptive order (the ``Blanket Order'') <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  that permitted co-investments between MLVP II and the DLJ Companies. After receiving the Blanket Order, MLVP II made its initial investment in Corporate Express by acquiring from the Management Company the Corporate Express shares held on its behalf. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Investment Company Act Release Nos. 18652 (Apr. 13, 1992) (notice) and 18700 (May 11, 1992) (order). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

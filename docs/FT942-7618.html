			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Cotton supply crisis alarms Beijing: Tony Walker reports on how the boll worm threatens thousands of jobs China's political leaders are being obliged to take seriously a cotton supply crisis that has forced a slowdown in production or closure of dozens of textile mills and is threatening the livelihood of thousands of employees in the textile sector - one of the country's biggest employers. Such is the concern that Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice premier in charge of the economy, in meetings with provincial officials recently identified countering the disastrous drop in cotton production as a main priority for the government. People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, reported this month that the crisis was particularly severe in central Henan province, which is both a big producer and consumer of cotton. Disorderly markets are affecting the textile sector throughout the country. China's legal daily newspaper yesterday identified another serious problem facing the textile industry. It quoted a government survey which showed that in 220 large state cotton mills, the quality of cotton supplied had droppeddramatically over the past year or so. 'That in such a short period of time, the quality of cotton should drop to such a degree is unprecedented,' the paper said. China's experiment with pilot free markets in two provinces and the decentralisation of cotton marketing nationwide - cotton is the one commodity whose supply and price is still controlled - appears to have failed, and the authorities have moved to re-assert central control. In Wuhan in central Hubei province, the city's No 1 Cotton Mill, one of China's most modern mills, is beset by chronic supply problems. Its manager, Mr Zhang Bao Xin, says he is never certain from one week to the next whether it will be possible to maintain production. In Sichuan province in the south-west of the country, one third of cotton mills have been closed because of lack of supply, according to newspaper reports. This touches the issue of labour unrest in the provinces, which is also of concern to Mr Zhu. Consumers are facing difficulties on two fronts: first, domestic production is flagging because of cotton disease in its northern producing areas, and second, prices are high internationally. The price has rocketed from some 52 cents a pound last year to the present price of about 80 cents a pound. Poor crops in India, Pakistan and China are forcing the price up. People's Daily, under a headline 'Where on earth has the cotton gone?' reported a widespread leakage into the open market of cotton earmarked for textile mills from state warehouses. The newspaper did not allege directly that corruption among state officials had caused supply problems, but hard-pressed textile factory managers are in no doubt that unscrupulous officials are profiting personally from the worsening shortage. Mr Zhang of the Wuhan No 1 Cotton Mill called for a freeing of the cotton market to enable 'fair competition' for scarce supplies. He described his dealings with the provincial supply depot which operates under the Ministry of Internal Trade as a source of 'daily frustration and daily anger'. He said officials of the local 'Cotton and Jute Corporation' were 'overlords' of the cotton trade. The problems can be traced most immediately to the slide in land planted to cotton. In 1993, about 5m hectares were planted, compared with 6.5m hectares two years earlier. That in turn had a big impact on production, with 3.7m tonnes harvested last year, compared with 5.6m tonnes in 1991. Infestation - especially in the northern regions which account for about 75 per cent of production - of the cotton boll worm (no relation to the weevil) has been one of the main causes of lost cotton acreage. Farmers have been turning to grain and soya beans to avoid the risk of losing all to this worm, which is reportedly beyond the control of pesticides. Estimates of land sown to cotton this year are around the same as 1993; although Xinjiang in China's far west is continuing to extend areas under cotton by about 17 per cent a year. Xinjiang expects to plant about 670,000 hectares this year. Chinese officials have until now been loath to admit the extent of the crisis and have not been beyond inflating production figures. Western agricultural attaches say attempts to paint a 'rosy picture' of cotton production reflect concerns that the extent of the debacle might serve to add further to pressures on international cotton prices. The crisis is certain to be fuelling discussion in Beijing about alternative ways of bringing order to the market and ensuring adequate supplies to the textile sector, one of China's main exporters. In the longer term the establishment of a genuine free market would seem to be the best solution, but in the meantime, and with demand far outstripping supply, the authorities need to find ways of encouraging farmers to sow greater areas. If China is to maintain its output of textiles, it would seem to have little choice but to begin increasing imports. See Editorial Page feature</p>

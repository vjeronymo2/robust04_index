			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: JW Spear jumps to Pounds 4.51m JW Spear &amp; Sons, maker of Scrabble and other indoor games, is proposing to lift its full-year dividend by 36 per cent on the back of a substantial increase in profits for 1993. The pre-tax figure rose by 22 per cent from Pounds 3.71m to Pounds 4.51m. Earnings per share increased from 47.3p to 56.55p. The recommended final dividend of 16p (11.5p) lifts the total pay-out for the year from 14p to 19p. Turnover increased by nearly Pounds 6m to Pounds 38.7m. The figure contains Pounds 4.49m from acquisitions, including a contribution from the games division of Murfett Regency (Australia) acquired last May for Pounds 1.8m cash. The purchase brought with it the rights to Scrabble in Australia. Scrabble is made in more than 20 languages and accounts for about 30 per cent of turnover. This year sees the introduction of versions in Turkish and Hungarian. Mr Michael Bucher, managing director, said 1993 marked the sixth successive year of increases in turnover and profits 'in spite of generally poor market conditions for traditional games in comparison with video and computer games.' The company has fought back with the introduction of board games linked to video cassettes and compact discs. Overall, it has introduced 121 new and revised items this year. Last year reduced UK sales were offset by strong growth in France and the addition of the Benelux countries and the Australian markets.</p>

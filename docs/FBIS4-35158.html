			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Lourdes Osorio; from the "National </F> Newscast" -- passages within quotation marks recorded]    [Text] Two groups of alleged members of the Nicaraguan  Resistance [RN] unexpectedly this morning invaded the offices of  the CIAV-OAS [International Commission of Support and  Verification-OAS] to demand that the government fulfill its  agreements.    [RN leader Leonardo Zeledon, alias Chispero] "The CIAV-OAS,  as guarantor of the verification of the agreements signed with  the RN, take us out of here, gentlemen."    Simultaneously, six persons led by Luis Arguello Ortiz,  known  among the former RN members as 02 [Cero Dos], entered the  Colombian Embassy to demand political asylum.    [Arguello] "We are requesting political asylum because the  approval of the military code would lead to the total  extermination of the RN."    Colombian diplomatic authorities are reviewing the situation  of the six persons, who remain at the South American diplomatic  mission.    [Colombian Ambassador Jorge Villamizar] "We are evaluating  everything, the information given to us and the request they are  making. There are six persons. They entered peacefully, there  has been no act of violence. Everything is normal inside the  embassy. We can come and go as we please as you can see. There  is no repressive action at this time. Everything is peaceful."    In view of the situation, Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal said  that in Nicaragua there is freedom of expression.    [Leal] "I believe that if they are members of the RN party,  the party will be able to make its demands civically. If they  are from the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN], the  FSLN will be in charge. I believe we Nicaraguans must begin  learning how to do things. We do not see any need to request  political asylum because there is and there will be no political  persecutions here at least while the government of President  Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is in power."    Luis Arguello Ortiz, who is now at the Colombian Embassy,  has  a case pending in the justice system.    [National Police Chief Fernando Caldera] "One of the  persons,  who is now at the Colombian Embassy, had been arrested for  committing a crime. These people are really not [word  indistinct]. I believe there are dark elements in this  organization. There are dark interests that must be [words  indistinct] so that we can have an idea of [passage indistinct]."    It all seems to indicate that the occupation of the CIAV-OAS  and the Colombian Embassy is part of a plan and that is why the  National Police have conducted operations in certain parts of  the capital.    How does the National Police chief view this situation?    [Caldera] "There is obviously an attitude against the  Nicaraguan Government, but it is not only against the Nicaraguan  Government. We must remember that the Colombian Embassy and the  CIAV-OAS offices have been occupied and that the next secretary  general of the OAS will be the current Colombian President,  Cesar Gaviria, who will replace Joao Baena Soares. There is  obviously a manipulation [words indistinct]."    [Unidentified speaker] "What measures will be taken  to...[words indistinct]?"    [Caldera] "We are currently conducting measures aimed at  preventing further incidents from taking place. We have adopted  measures. We have already taken to the streets. We have set up  checkpoints, and we are patrolling the streets."    Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said the individuals who  entered the Colombian Embassy and the CIAV-OAS are citizens who  are violating the country's laws and international agreements.  They cannot be members of the former RN because the former  members of that organization have their dialogue channels with  the government open.    [Lacayo] "The members of the RN have their legitimate  representatives. These are Nicaraguan citizens who are  violating the law. I do not see any RN member there. The young  man called Luis Arguello was apparently not even a demobilized  member of the RN. He is the one called Chispero. You know him.  I do not think they have to [words indistinct] within the  framework of the law. We have contacted the Colombian Government  and the OAS to take coordinated action. They are Nicaraguan  citizens, who are violating international agreements. No one  has the right to occupy a diplomatic mission [words indistinct]."</p>

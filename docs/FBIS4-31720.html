			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mladen Bosnjak on news conference by Croatian </F> President Franjo Tudjman and Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, with unidentified correspondents  in Sarajevo on 14 June; live, with portions recorded]    [Text] [Studio announcer] Some 10 minutes ago, Presidents  of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina [as received] Alija  Izetbegovic and Dr. Franjo Tudjman held a news conference at the  end of Mr. Tudjman's visit to Sarajevo. Croatian President  Franjo Tudjman's visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina will continue with  a tour of several places. We now go to our correspondent Mladen  Bosnjak at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency [words indistinct].  Good day.    [Bosnjak] Good day. The news conference was very brief and  actually consisted of two parts. In the first part, Mr. Kemal  Muftic, adviser in the Presidency, read out the joint statement  signed by both presidents, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic.  Following this, Mr. Tudjman answered a mere one or two  questions and that is how this meeting with the press corps  ended. I suggest we listen to both; first the joint statement  of the two presidents, and then the part, the two brief answers  given in response to the correspondents' brief questions. Let  us listen.    [Begin recording] [Muftic] Ladies and gentlemen, state  delegations of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Bosnia-Herzegovina [as heard], headed by Croatian President Dr.  Franjo Tudjman and President of the Presidency Alija  Izetbegovic, [words indistinct] on 14 June, today in Sarajevo  (?held) official talks on furthering relations and areas of  possible cooperation between the two neighboring countries,  particularly in the area of defense from the mutual aggressor,  and several [words indistinct] issues pertaining to the  economic, traffic, humanitarian [words indistinct] the process  of establishing the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, and the  establishment of the future confederation with the Republic of  Croatia. The two presidents held long talks behind closed  doors, and were later joined by the president and vice president  of the Federation, Messrs. Kresimir Zubak and Ejup Ganic. The  official talks between the delegations were attended on the  Croatian side by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Dr.  Mate Granic, Deputy Prime Minister Borislav Skegro, Defense  Minister Gojko Susak, the president's National Security adviser,  Hrvoje Sarinic, presidential advisers Ivic Pasalic and Slobodan  Lang, and the Republic of Croatia's ambassador to  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mr. Zdravko Sancevic. For the host country,  the delegation was comprised of Prime Minister Dr. Haris  Silajdzic, Deputy Prime Minister Edib Bukvic, Defense Minister  Hamdija Hadzihasanovic, Foreign Minister Dr. Irfan Ljubijankic,  Minister for Industry Faruk Smajlbegovic, Minister for Refugees  and Social Welfare Dr. Arif Smajkic, Justice Minister Dr. Kasim  Trnka, and Information Minister Ivo Knezevic.    In the spirit of friendship, mutual understanding, and  respect, and keeping in mind the wider international  implications of the aggression on both countries, the two  presidents expressed the belief that the mutual recognition of  all the states created after the disintegration of Yugoslavia  and the international monitoring of Serbian and Montenegrin  borders toward Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in accordance with  UN Security Council Resolutions 787 and 838 [Muftic is  interrupted by an unidentified voice that says 769] and 769,  (?is) a necessary step for establishing lasting peace in this  part of the republic. On this occasion, the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia again confirmed  their commitment to peace and a negotiated solution to all  conflicts, but their highest representatives consider it  necessary that the international community should provide clear  guarantees for the cessation of the aggression and occupation,  and the full observation of human rights and the territorial  integrity of both countries in order to further the relations  between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In this sense, they agreed that the following be  accomplished through the work of joint commissions:    a) The liberalization of the transit of the citizens of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as the transit of goods  through the Republic of Croatia, according to the laws of the  Republic of Croatia.    b) Joint [words indistinct] the return of the refugees and  displaced persons according to the principle of all to their  homes.    c) The opening up of all communications and  telecommunication links, particularly (?between) Split, Mostar,  Sarajevo, Zenica, and Tuzla.    The Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina supports the Republic of  Croatia in all its legitimate efforts and attempts aimed at a  peaceful reintegration of the temporarily occupied territories  into its state, legal, and economic system. The Republic of  Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina will jointly  build two bridges on the Sarajevo-Ploce railroad. The money,  project, and supervision will be provided by Bosnia-Herzegovina,  while the work will be carried out by construction companies  from Croatia. The stands on the use of the Ploce port have been  agreed on in principle.    Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia will agree on the joint  strategy of approach in the talks on the succession with the  Islamic countries, especially Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and  the United Arab Emirates.    An agreement was also reached on the joint appearance in  third countries through mixed commissions. In order to  rationalize the diplomatic network, the embassies of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in some countries will represent the  interests of the Republic of Croatia and vice versa, where this  is proves to be useful.    It was also agreed that the problems of the property of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in the Republic of Croatia and vice verse be  solved without delay, in accordance with the interstate  agreement. The two presidents agreed that [words indistinct]  the individuals who are against the spirit and practice of the  established federation and the future confederation be removed.    The talks between the highest state delegations of the  Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina were  held with the intention to remove all misunderstandings through  the constant and direct cooperation of official representatives  of the two countries.    Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of Croatia, has  invited Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Kresimir Zubak, president of  the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to visit the Republic of  Croatia. The invitations have been accepted with pleasure. The  visits will be arranged through the usual diplomatic channels.    This was the joint statement by the two delegations (?led  by)  Presidents Izetbegovic and Tudjman.    [Izetbegovic] Ladies and gentlemen, we do not have much time  considering that President Tudjman should (?travel further) and  that we spent a bit more time on agreeing this statement.  Before we start with questions and answers, I would  particularly like to draw your attention to the part of this  statement that represents the message of President Tudjman and  me, a message that consists of two proposals, namely that of all  states that emerged on the territory of the former Yugoslavia  start recognizing one another. This is our first message. The  second message is that the control of borders be secured, of  course, [words indistinct] the Croatian-Serbian border, up in  the north, then the Serbian-Bosnian border, and the  Montenegrin-Bosnian border. This is what I particularly wanted  to draw your attention to. This is our message to the world.  The rest more or less concerns our [words indistinct]. This is  all. We are ready to answer your questions. Of course, we will  not spend (?much time).    [Tudjman] I would like to say that the Croatian delegation  came to Sarajevo, and not only to Sarajevo as we are, our  delegation will continue journey through Bosnia-Herzegovina, in  order to contribute to the realization of the Washington  agreement on the creation of the Federation and confederation.    [Unidentified speaker] We have five minutes.    [Correspondent] (?I would like to ask) Mr. Tudjman. Does  the Croatian community of Herceg-Bosna exist?    [Tudjman] It exists. Since the Croatian community of  Herceg-Bosna was created during the resistance against Serbian  aggression, it will exist until the Federation comes into life  and until the foundations have been laid for the confederation.    [Correspondent] Mr. Tudjman. What is the first [word  indistinct] Will you go to Kiseljak and (?on from there)?    [Tudjman] Leave that for subsequent reporting.    [Correspondent] Is there a chance of you visiting some other  places, like Mostar [word indistinct] try to help the  implementation of the [word indistinct] federation.    [Tudjman] Herceg-Bosna does not need to die, but it must be  incorporated into the Federation as an essential basis for (?the  Federation) and the confederation.    [Izetbegovic] The question that you asked has been regulated  by the constitutional law very clearly, namely, that the  existing authorities continue functioning until the federal  authorities are set up. This is the so-called temporary  arrangement and that is how it is regulated.    [Muftic] (?If there is nothing else) [words indistinct]  Thank you for your time. [end recording]    [Studio announcer] We have our reporter Mladen Bosnjak  with us. Therefore, Mladen, what else was included in the  program of the visit by Dr. Tudjman?    [Bosnjak] As we have already reported, Croatian President  Mr. Franjo Tudjman arrived at Sarajevo Airport at approximately  0930. At approximately 1000 he entered the Presidency building,  where we was received by his hosts -- Mr. Izetbegovic, President  of Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation Zubak, Vice President of the  Federation Ejup Ganic, the Bosnia-Herzegovina prime minister and  several ministers in the government, and the Sarajevo mayor.  After the ceremonial welcome, the official talks started, which  resulted, as we have just heard, in an announcement, that is to  say, a statement of the two (?presidents) and also this  impromptu news conference.    To the surprise of, I would say, his security service, Mr.  Tudjman decided to stroll through the streets of Sarajevo from  [words indistinct] to the Embassy of the Republic of Croatia,  which was ceremonially opened today. On that occasion he met  with several Sarajevo residents. It seems to me that these  contacts have surprised the Sarajevo residents themselves,  however, a certain intimacy and happiness about these contacts  could also be sensed, because this is also one of the signs that  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, the federation of the Croats  and the Muslims-Bosniaks, is springing into life.    After his stay in the embassy building, Mr. Tudjman [word  indistinct] the Presidency building where Bosnia-Herzegovina  President Alija Izetbegovic held a ceremonial lunch in his  honor, and afterward they held the news conference -- we have  already heard the recording that we have broadcast unedited to  be able to report promptly about the most important event in  Bosnia-Herzegovina today.    That's it from the Presidency building about Mr. Tudjman's  visit in Sarajevo.</p>

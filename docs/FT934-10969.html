			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Inflation outlook loses its gloss THE Bank of England's latest inflation report provides little comfort for advocates of an early and substantial easing of UK monetary policy. It also implies that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would face economic as well as political problems if he chose to raise or widen significantly the net of indirect taxes in his November 30 Budget. The Bank believes that on present policies, both 'headline' inflation, as measured by the retail prices index, and the underlying rate of RPI minus mortgage-interest payments will rise until the middle of next year. 'There is,' the Bank says, 'a slight possibility that in the first half of next year inflation will briefly rise above the top of the target range' of 1 per cent to 4 per cent for underlying inflation in the life of this parliament. Both underlying inflation and headline inflation have risen since the summer. Underlying inflation (dubbed RPIX by the Bank) was 3.3 per cent in September, having been 2.8 per cent in June. Over the same period headline RPI increased to 1.8 per cent from 1.2 per cent. Information available since the last inflation report in August has led the Bank to revise upwards slightly its forecasts of the 12-month inflation rates to be expected over the next few months. The most likely path for RPIX is a small rise until the first quarter of next year, 'peaking at an annual rate above 3.5 per cent'. The Bank's central forecast is for inflation to stay within the target range provided earnings growth stays moderate and does not feed through into higher prices. If inflation does break through the target ceiling this will partly be because of changes in indirect and local authority taxes. It is largely for this reason that the Bank would like commentators and wage bargainers to look at another underlying measure of inflation which it calls RPIY. This measure, which excludes value added tax, local authority taxes and excise duties as well as mortgage interest payments, is expected to start falling early next year and could be close to the middle of the target range in 1995. But it is unclear whether wage bargainers will be persuaded by such a measure. Headline inflation, which is the rate that employers and employees notice most, is expected to rise particularly sharply as past reductions in mortgage-interest payments fall out of the 12-month comparison and mortgage interest relief is restricted from next April. By laying stress on RPIY, the Bank is indicating that it would not press for an increase in base rates if inflation rises through 4 per cent next spring. However, it could quickly change its mind if higher prices fed through into wages. It believes that 'sustaining the credibility of anti-inflationary policies' will be important for ensuring that there is no inflationary wage-price spiral, and that the government must steadily reduce the budget deficit to achieve this. It draws comfort from a flattening of the yield curve for gilt-edged stock since the summer which, it says, suggests that longer-term inflation expectations now lie within the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent range. This last observation could leave open the possibility of an interest rate cut in the event of fiscal tightening in the November 30 Budget. The Bank of England Inflation Report.

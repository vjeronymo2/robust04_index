			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Talks are to be held soon on the possible extension  of tomorrow's midnight deadline for the submission of election  candidate lists. This follows a meeting between the ANC  [African National Congress] and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  in Johannesburg today and a proposal made to the Transitional  Executive Council in Pretoria this afternoon.    At the closed-door meeting between the ANC and the IFP, the  two parties agreed to meet the chairman of the Independent  Electoral Commission, Mr. Justice Johan Kriegler, tonight to  discuss postponing the deadline tomorrow.    The ANC and the IFP held the meeting to discuss proposals  that international mediation be used to break the constitutional  impasse. IFP National Chairman Dr. Frank Mdlalose said the IFP  had not yet compiled its list of candidates. Dr. Mdlalose added  that progress had been made in today's talks and that the party  delegates to the meeting will report back to their leaders  before meeting again on Saturday [12 March].    Meanwhile Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi has urged  President F.W. de Klerk to endorse his proposals for  international mediation. Dr. Buthelezi said it appeared that Mr.  de Klerk was not happy with the idea of mediation.</p>

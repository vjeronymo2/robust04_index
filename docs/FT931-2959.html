			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japan anger over Cocom 'breaches' AN ADVISORY body to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has accused European and US companies of violating restrictions on the export of sensitive technologies to China. The Centre for Information on Strategic Technology, comprising industry representatives, said investigations of Chinese factories had identified a range of sophisticated machine tools, exports of which were prohibited by the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom). In recent years, Japanese technology producers have admitted exporting equipment illegally to the former Soviet Union and Iran, but the industry is angry that Japanese companies should be thought less ready than others to respect Cocom regulations. The confidential Cistec report describes the results of visits to factories in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities by member companies, which claim to have found a range of banned equipment apparently provided by US and European producers. Delivery of the confidential report to Miti coincides with a debate within the Japanese government over exports of sensitive technologies to China. Miti has supported an easing of technology export restrictions, but officials in Japan's Foreign Ministry are concerned that some equipment could be used to help the Chinese army in its ambitious plans to develop high-tech weaponry. The ministry's concerns are shared by Washington. A Pentagon official said the US was concerned that China would use sophisticated technology to upgrade advanced military aircraft and other hardware acquired from Russia. A Japanese ministry official said the government was torn between wanting to cultivate ties with Beijing by providing sophisticated technology and longer-term fears that political instability in China could make the People's Liberation Army a volatile force in the region. The US and European technology identified by Cistec members included a sophisticated machining centre, laser equipment, and advanced numerically controlled machinery, all of which could be applied to the manufacture of military hardware.</p>

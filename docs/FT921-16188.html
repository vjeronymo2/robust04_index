			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Bidding for BTG ends today BIDS CLOSE today for consortia hoping to buy the state-owned British Technology Group (BTG), with offers expected from management and staff, trade unions and universities. Potential foreign buyers are expected to feature among the bidders, none of which will be permitted to own more than 15 per cent of the group. The government decided to rule out a sale to a single buyer after fears from universities that BTG, which plays a key role in commercialising their research, would neglect the long-term needs of the academic world. BTG, which makes its money on patents, saw profits fall 32 per cent last year to Pounds 6.5m on revenues of Pounds 30.7m. Among organisations that have expressed an interest in BTG are 3i, the UK venture capital group, and a group of contract research organisations headed by Sir Ronald Mason, former Ministry of Defence chief scientist.</p>

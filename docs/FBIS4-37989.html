			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Aden, Yemen, June 26 (AFP) -- Aden has enough oil  stocks to last several weeks despite being cut off from its  refinery, a senior southern Yemeni official said Sunday [26  June].    "We have lots of oil tanks in Aden," said Muhammad Raji,  secretary-general of the Oil Ministry of the self-proclaimed  Yemen Democratic Republic. "The supplies can last several  weeks."    Oil reserves at the Little Aden oil refinery, 18 kilometres  (12 miles) west of the southern stronghold, were moved to Aden  after northern warplanes attacked the refinery, causing a major  fire, Raji told AFP.    Northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih were  trying to advance on the refinery Sunday after cutting the coast  road west of Aden.    Electricity has been rationed in Aden for the past three  days  since the city's main power station at al-Hiswah, about 10  kilometres (six miles) away, was damaged by fire following a  northern bombardment.    Northern troops were occupying the power station Sunday.    But Raji said the southern authorities were using two other  power stations, in the northern suburb of al-Mansurah and Khur  Maksar, near the airport. They had enough fuel for up to two  weeks.    Queues of cars formed at Aden petrol stations Saturday, but  tanker trucks were unable to get through roadblocks barring the  route to the refinery.    Raji said the authorities could still bring oil into the  city  by sea from the al-Mukalla oil terminal in the Hadhramaut  region, 700 kilometres (434 miles) east of Aden.    "The situation is manageable," he said.    Petrol stations had instructions only to fill up vehicles'  tanks, not jerry cans. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by State Duma Deputy Boris Fedorov: "The </F> Government Has Been at a Standstill for Two Months. Which Way  Will It Go?"]    [Text] It is exactly two months since the elections. The  first results can be summed up. The main one is that for two  months now the government has been undergoing reorganization,  rushing about aimlessly, and essentially doing no work. Not a  single decision that could be described, even if you stretch the  point, as reformist has been adopted.    On the other hand we have had a reorganization which dragged  out over many weeks and culminated in the departure of three  people and the demotion of Shokhin and Shakhray. Some members  of the "new" government have been beating their breasts for  weeks and loudly trying to persuade everybody, themselves  included, that they are reformers. Others are saying day in,  day out that they will not wind up but will deepen and  expand the reforms. At one moment the goal is to combat  inflation, at the next it is to repay debts. It is symptomatic  that Soskovets and Grachev in concert are now criticizing A.  Zaveryukha.    The premier did not think that by "reacting" to the election  results by making gestures toward the sectorial lobbies he would  be opening a "Pandora's box" whereby a wave of demands would  threaten to sweep aside absolutely everything. Many people have  now gone crazy on hearing talk of "payment of debts." They have  decided: The time has come, we must extract everything we are  entitled to and more. Coal industry workers, oil industry  workers, agrarian workers, and communications workers are  threatening to strike. Give us mutual offsetting of debts and  indexation of circulating capital, cheap loans and selective  support for bankrupts, the country must feed agrarian workers!    The government is running scared. On the one  hand, the reaction to the government changes is  forcing it to swear loyalty to the former course. On the other,  its instincts are pushing it in the other direction. The  debt problem caused by the lack of financial discipline, the  constant adoption of more and more new expenditure decisions,  and the lack of the political will to cancel nonpriority  spending is gradually finding expression in an orgy of  hysterical demands, and beneath the hail of demands Moscow is  losing its ability to calculate and is hoping to change things  by means of partial sops. The agrarian lobby had only to flex  its muscle and the decision on duties was revoked. They  are promising everything to everyone, but they are afraid to  deliver.    The delay in making public the guidelines of the  government's  economic policy, the frantic conferences and statements -- all  this is out of place and going on for an intolerably long time.  The diagnosis is clear: The government has no clear  line, has lost its bearings, and is aimlessly rushing about.    The quarterly session of the enlarged government that has  been postponed until 24 February will resolve nothing. Clearly,  they are expecting a speech by the president so as not to make  fools of themselves. But only the submission of the budget to  the Duma will dispel the doubts. Unless they make fools of us.    The government can save face only if it obtains results that  are better than those in 1993. Initial reports about the budget  have not increased optimism: expenditure of around 170 trillion  rubles [R] and income of R120 trillion. Given that a month ago  the Finance Ministry was estimating income at R80-90 trillion,  there is a clear attempt to embellish the picture. It is  doubtful that the government will be able to approve expenditure  of R170 trillion unless the measures to revoke expenditure  decisions that have been proposed for seven months are taken.  Is there the political will for this?    In reality it is a question of a deficit not of R50  trillion, but of R100 trillion, which will destroy the economy.  Add to that the so-called united monetary system with Belarus  and other countries, and financial disaster is inevitable. If  the figures are "massaged" for the IMF and you and me, the  result will be more chronic underpayments from the budget. We  should also fear methods of decreasing the deficit like the sale  of precious metals and gems by the government to the Central  Bank without notifying parliament and the channeling of  so-called Central Bank "profits" into budget needs -- all this  is sheer emission, the deficit figures go down but inflation  increases.    The new year began with the loss of one-third of the Central  Bank's currency reserves in order to maintain the ruble exchange  rate for purely political purposes -- to prove that the  departure of one or two people does not mean a U-turn. That way  it won't be long before all the reserves have been wasted and  then an exchange rate fixed, which is something they are already  talking about.    The government should prove its social orientation by  setting  tough targets for economic parameters such as inflation, the  ruble exchange rate, the population's real income, average wages  in dollar terms, real retail trade turnover, housing  construction, and food consumption. These indicators were  better in 1993 than they were in 1992, and they are the ones  that determine living standards and social orientation. Is the  government prepared to give specific pledges and to report back  in January 1995? It remains only to place your bet.    By the beginning of 1994 a situation had emerged where it  had  become impossible to move forward with the same "quality" of  government. It was even impossible to hold on to the position  that had been achieved -- it was possible only to lose ground.  Because a reorganization had been launched that substantially  worsened the "quality," a U-turn was inevitable. The premier  was scarcely seeking this, but a fundamentally new situation  emerged.    There is no alternative to the policy pursued in  1993. Having said that, there is a need for greater consistency  and unity on the part of the government and the whole of the  executive branch. It is especially sad to hear academicians  whom the premier's volte-face has roused to produce another opus  setting out "conceptual approaches" but lacking specific  prescriptions or any hint of knowledge of the real state of  affairs. Does this stem more from a sense of being unwanted or  from honest delusion?    What is happening today was probably inevitable. The proud  "red directors" probably have to have an opportunity to show  everybody what they are actually capable of. Otherwise the myth  that there is a real alternative, that there is an alternative  road to the market whereby you can ignore macroeconomic  realities and stage pseudocommunist experiments on living  people, will remain forever.    My hope is pinned on the president. I do not believe that B.  Yeltsin, who began real political and economic reforms after 70  years of stagnation, can turn back. But I would like to believe  that the prime minister, who for a year pursued, albeit  inconsistently, a particular course, also will not venture to  head for disaster. It is better to think again in time than to  carry out more experiments on Russia.</p>

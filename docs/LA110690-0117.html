			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> S&amp;P Lowers Citicorp Debt Rating: Standard &amp; Poor's said it lowered  ratings on about $22 billion of debt and preferred stock of the nation's  largest bank and various units, a move that analysts say could reignite concern  about the financial state of the nation's banks. Citing Citicorp's rising  credit problems, the rating company downgraded the bank's senior debt to single  A-plus, from double A-minus. S&amp;P said "the lower rating reflects S&amp;P's  expectation that asset quality will continue to deteriorate, albeit at a slower  pace than that of the past year."  </P></p>

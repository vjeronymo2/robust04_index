			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN HANGS HIMSELF ON TREE NEXT TO FREEWAY  </P> <P> Authorities were trying to determine the identity of a man in his late 20s who  hanged himself Saturday night from a tree along a freeway in Garden Grove.  </P> <P> Garden Grove Police Sgt. Frank Hauptmann said there was no evidence of foul  play.  </P> <P> The man apparently fashioned a noose out of rope, climbed the tree, tied the  rope to a branch and jumped off, police said.  </P> <P> He was spotted dangling about 15 feet above the ground by several passing  motorists, who called police, Hauptmann said. When paramedics arrived at the  spot on the north side of the Garden Grove freeway near the Harbor Boulevard  exit, the man was already dead, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Australia rises after election date is set Australia and the Nordic region of Europe showed strong gains last week, but currency volatility in Japan and a feeling that the rally in US equities since the start of the year might have been overdone left the FT-Actuaries World Index slightly depressed. Senior European bourses also enjoyed a positive week, with Germany extending its gains throughout the five days to finish at a seven-month high. Many analysts now expect the DAX index to break through the 1,700 level this week as overseas buying strength continues. Australia took heart from the announcement that the federal election will be held on March 13, thereby removing an element of uncertainty, and by Thursday had reached a six-month peak. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, also promised a series of economic measures designed to stimulate business investment, including a reduction in the company tax rate. Other reasons for the market's fresh impetus included good results from News International and Commonwealth Bank, and solid gains in the resources sector, encouraged particularly by the strength of gold on the world markets. Sweden came to life after Ericsson issued better than expected 1992 results, with the 'B' shares advancing 9 per cent on the day of their release. A stronger dollar and expectations of lower interest rates also lifted sentiment. Norway, its eyes firmly fixed on last weekend's Opec meeting, anticipated a cut in oil production and marked up the sector accordingly. Among other soft currency markets, Italy was gripped by further political intrigue as, first, the justice minister resigned as investigations were begun on possible corruption charges, and then, a day later, Mr Bettino Craxi, the former prime minister, quit as leader of the Socialist party because of his alleged involvement in the same scandal.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change   % change in                   % change in local currency**   sterling** US Dollars**              1 Week   4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of  Start of     Start of                                          1993      1993         1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -0.18     +8.97  -19.87    +2.87     +7.75        +0.92 Belgium      -0.63     +6.28   +2.57    +7.52    +11.78        +4.69 Denmark      -0.40    +10.15  -19.73   +10.85    +16.63        +9.24 Finland      +5.54     +4.59   +6.51   +12.43     +6.95        +0.19 France       +0.28     +4.63   +2.65    +3.90     +9.01        +2.09 Germany      +1.26     +8.04   -4.18    +8.26    +12.61        +5.47 Ireland      -4.96     +1.79  -12.76    +5.38     +1.66        -4.79 Italy        -2.55     +3.31   -2.03   +12.84    +14.81        +7.55 Netherlands  +0.72     +4.64   +5.24    +5.54     +9.55        +2.60 Norway       +3.31     +2.46   -8.71    +5.99    +10.97        +3.93 Spain        -0.83     +4.46   -6.15   +12.32    +15.84        +8.49 Sweden       +5.34     +4.36  +16.29    +4.44     +4.87        -1.78 Switzerland  +0.33     +2.47  +17.31    +3.28     +4.91        -1.75 UK           -0.89     +3.03  +13.85    +0.62     +0.63        -5.76 EUROPE       -0.08     +4.31   +6.14    +4.06     +6.12        -0.61 Australia    +4.33     +5.37   -2.67    +3.18     +8.64        +1.74 Hong Kong    +2.33     -0.30  +18.90    +5.71    +12.99        +5.82 Japan        -1.64     +1.71  -17.70    -1.46     +8.74        +1.85 Malaysia     +0.62     +7.18  +12.92    +4.10    +10.45        +3.45 New Zealand  +2.91     +7.13   +2.61    +3.75    +10.64        +3.61 Singapore    -1.31     +2.58   -1.78    +2.24     +8.66        +1.78 Canada       +1.72     +3.32   -7.51    +1.88    +10.16        +3.18 USA          -0.97     +1.66   +6.67    +1.99     +8.90        +1.99 Mexico       -0.24     -5.31   +2.10    -5.47     +1.63        -4.81 South Africa +0.55     +2.01   -9.30    +7.07    +25.42       +17.47 WORLD INDEX  -0.73     +2.37   -1.22    +1.70    +8.35         +1.48  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on February 12th 1993.

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Fashion: Party-time dress pointers - Witty accessories are the key to looking good this season It is hard to feel skittish at the beginning of the party season without the tonic of a new dress. If you have to make do with last year's model - probably black - accessories are the way to give it a new lease of life. Even if you could afford a new dress, buying new accessories may be a better investment. A witty pair of shoes or a jewel-bright evening bag can enliven the most sober Little Black Dress - and seldom has the choice been larger. You could spend hundreds of pounds on an intricately-worked, hand-crafted, silken scarf or under Pounds 10 on a chain-store bargain. Although there are plenty of inexpensive accessories around, there is a new generation of designers which takes the view that it is better to own one exquisite piece that than a drawer full of workaday pieces. Take, for instance, Catherine Avison's floral embroidered scarf, which comes in cappuchino or powder pink - it is a fine example of delicate craftsmanship, each flower made and embroidered by hand. Avison has just graduated from The Royal College of Art and was immediately taken up by Browns, of South Molton Street, London W1. Just as finely wrought is Natasha Barrault's pleated silk Fortuny-esque bag. Saint Laurent's scarlet corset-belt is a modern classic which not only will lift midnight-dark monochromes but can enliven daytime tweeds. For evening, I have always been of the opinion that if the shoes, bag and jewellery look snappy then you can get away with the simplest backdrop. The sauciest shoes this season come either from Valentino, in the form of silky satin ankle boots trimmed along the cuff with impossibly frivolous marabou feathers, or from Patrick Cox - Cruella de Vil spiky courts and thigh-high boots in blood-red or fuschia-pink satin. The elegant modesty of Joseph Azagury's court and bar shoes, especially his matt satin, may also appeal. Legs need highlighting with the sheerest black hosiery; please him with stockings rather than tights and you by eliminating the cumbersome rigging of suspenders in favour of lacy-topped hold-ups. The Black Rose, a stall in Kensington Market, London, run by an Australian with ghoulish attire and gentlemanly manners, offers a wonderful range of novelty hosiery - fishnets, Lurex and bumble-bee stripes by Pamela Mann and Mary Quant for between Pounds 3 and Pounds 6. The waist and the bosom are focal points and, depending on your assets, one or both should be emphasised. VV Rouleaux, the trimmings shop behind Peter Jones, Sloane Square SW3, stocks delicate black passementerie imported from Paris at around Pounds 30-Pounds 40 a metre and multi-coloured braids hung with lambent silken cord tassels which add conversation-piece interest to any waist or throat. Dolce e Gabbana's romantic black chiffon and silk velvet neck-tie, decorated with faded, old, silk roses is exquisite, but at Pounds 350 perhaps not for everyone. For those on a budget a few black roses at Pounds 1 each from The Black Rose, or fin de siecle silk ones at about Pounds 20 each from Virginia Antiques, would recall Odette's boudoir charms. Wacky false eye-lashes of an Olympian excess and labelled 'Cow Lashes' are on offer in gold or silver tinsel at Stargazer Makeup, in the basement of Kensington Market, along with coloured wigs, ranging from a sharp, bitumen-black Louise Brookes' bob at Pounds 33 to Anita Ekberg blonde waist-length tresses for Pounds 65.00. One of the most striking jewellery ranges at the moment is Odalisque, made by an imaginative Persian woman who spent time on the north-west frontier with the Red Cross. Collecting stones and pieces of old jewellery, she reconstructs them into parures and tasselled beads. Colours are muted and subtle, such as sunset mauve with eucalyptus green. Prices range from Pounds 100 to Pounds 450.00. It is the transient nature of parties, that moment of flirtation seized and relished, that makes them a compelling stage for performance art. The adventurous extrovert, who is clever with a needle, could sew edible nasturtium flowers along the neckline of her dress. A box of six can be found at any good supermarket. Or make a pair of fur cuffs to slick up a plain, black sweater. Simply sew a wrist-sized piece on to a wide band of elastic and slip over the wrist. For those modernists who favour this season's sleek transparency, Jimmy Choo, Senso and Pied-a-Terre are all offering see-through plastic sandals, sling-backs and mules. There are myriad tiny handbags which echo this trend - but bear in mind that the contents will need to be taken into serious consideration] Baudelaire loved to chronicle what he called 'that feminine lust for bargains' and this season adversity - if you can call not having a new dress adversity - may inspire you to use invention, artifice and allure instead.

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> NFL TO STUDY DICKERSON'S STATUS  </P> <P> The NFL will take a look at the Eric Dickerson-Indianapolis Colts feud.  </P> <P> Dickerson, who was placed on the Colts' non-football injury list and suspended  by the team, is scheduled to meet with NFL counsel Jay Moyer on Sept. 17 in New  York. League spokesman Greg Aiello said a Colts' representative could also be  present at the meeting.  </P> <P> Dickerson, who recently refused to have his injured left hamstring examined by  a Colts' physician, claims that he is healthy and never should have been placed  on the non-football injury list. Because of the Colts' moves, Dickerson  virtually forfeits more than $450,000 in salary.  </P> <P> Dickerson missed the entire preseason.  </P></p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Promising start for Lifetime package Cellnet's Lifetime package, designed to attract consumer rather than business users to cellular phones, made a promising start after its November launch, according to Mr Stafford Taylor, managing director. By the end of last year, 44,000 new subscribers had signed up for the service, although 17,000 of these were business subscribers switching to the new package. This compared with 45,000 new subscribers for Vodafone, the larger network which started its LowCall service slightly earlier. In December, when sales were boosted by Christmas, Cellnet's market share exceeded Vodafone's for the first time in several years. Cellnet's turnover increased 12 per cent to Pounds 360m in the year to September 30 while operating profits grew 32 per cent to Pounds 151m, Mr Taylor said.</p>

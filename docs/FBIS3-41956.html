			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bradford Smith: "France Hits the Re-Accelerator </F> Pedal"]    [Text] The GANIL heavy-ion accelerator at Caen in France  is to be upgraded at a cost of 120 million French francs (about  14.8 million pounds) over the next six years. GANIL-plus will  collect and sort radioactive ions produced in heavy-ion-target  collisions by GANIL, and "re-accelerate" them to energies  between 2 and 25 MeV [megaelectronvolt] per nucleon. These  "radio-active beams" will be used in nuclear physics,  astrophysics and materials science research. The upgrade was  endorsed by the Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee  (NuPECC) in May.    Work on GANIL-plus is expected to start almost immediately  following an agreement signed in mid-October by Claude Detraz of  the CNRS (the national scientific research council), Robert  Aymar of the CEA (the French atomic energy agency) and Rene  Garrec, president of the Basse Normandie region of France. The  CNRS, CEA and Basse Normandie are contributing equally to the  upgrade.    Both agencies plan to fund GANIL-plus through the internal  redeployment of resources, in line with the findings of a recent  review of large research facilities by the Conseil de Grands  Equipements Scientifiques.    The review found that neither agency could afford all the  projects it had planned or under way. Capital projects, such as  GANIL-plus, could only be funded if something else was postponed  or cancelled.    The scientific goals of GANIL-plus are three-fold and will  be  overseen by a steering committee of 12 physicists, chaired by  Ben Mottelson, the Nobel-prize-winning nuclear theorist from  NORDITA in Copenhagen.    In nuclear physics, radioactive ion beams will allow  exploration of "superdeformed" nuclei - nuclei that cannot be  made by colliding ordinary matter. The short-lived ions  produced by GANIL-plus will also have proton/neutron ratios  different to everyday, stable matter.    Radioactive nuclei are thought to play an important role in  the evolution of stars. Direct measurements of cross-sections  and lifetimes will test current theoretical models in  astrophysics. In particular, GANIL-plus will be able to  elucidate the various reaction pathways in nucleosynthesis that  lead to the isotope abundances observed in the Universe.</p>

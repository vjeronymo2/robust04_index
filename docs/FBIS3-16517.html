In a letter addressed to parliament Speaker Ulo Nugis, the  Council of the Russian Community put forward suggestions  concerning the repatriation of ethnic Russians. The letter,  signed by Yuri Kotenkov, included the text of the Declaration on  Compatriots' Rights adopted Jan. 29 at the second world congress  of Russian communities.    The declaration defines as "compatriots" all persons who  permanently resided on the territory of the Soviet Union and  held Soviet citizenship, if they regard Russian as their mother  tongue. "Compatriots" have the inalienable right to a united  fatherland.    The declaration regards as fatherland "the territory that is  inherent in the statehood of the Russian nation and that  legitimately belonged to the Russian Empire and the Soviet  Union, including changes of border effected in accordance with  the Constitutions of those states." The document maintains that  compatriots cannot be declared to be aliens in any part of the  territory; that neither collective nor individual deportation,  or other similar measures, may be applied to them; and that  compatriots cannot be declared to be stateless persons.    The congress of the Russian communities plans to set up a  commission on compatriots' rights to check on observance of the  declaration. The commission is authorized, among other things,  to draw up lists of "officials, organizations and individuals  responsible for acts committed against compatriots or Russian  communities."    Kulbok said Royalists plan tomorrow to ask the interior  minister for an explanation as to "how many persons there are in  Estonia who disseminate this declaration and what's to become of  Kotenkov who sent the declaration to the parliament."</p>

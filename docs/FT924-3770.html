			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Futures edge down After a turbulent start to the week, the money markets coasted through yesterday with an unusual degree of calm, writes Peggy Hollinger. The strong jump in the pound early in the day helped briefly to lift short sterling futures. However, by the end of the day the March contract had settled back to close six points down at 93.50. December short sterling finished flat at 92.83. The futures market seemed to ignore the strength of the sterling on the trade-weighted index yesterday, which hit its highest level in almost two months at 81.3. The index closed easier at 80.7. Dealers and economists suggested this was because the market had begun to discern a tinge of recovery in the UK economy, making it less likely that the government would move to cut base rates before the new year. 'People have gone from the idea of expecting a 6.5 per cent rate before Christmas to consolidating around the 7 per cent base rate level,' said Dr Mark Austin, an economist with Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. Some traders also suggested there had been an element of profit-taking in the futures markets, which helped to depress rates. Overall trading had been largely technical, however, with dealers' thoughts more on the forthcoming weekend and Christmas holidays. Their reveries were briefly disturbed in the afternoon, when the Bank of England substantially revised its initial forecast shortage from Pounds 550m to a flat balance. The original squeeze had been calculated on the basis of a Pounds 383m drain from treasury bills and maturing assistance, and a Pounds 755m rise in note circulation. This was expected to have been partially offset by a Pounds 595m injection from exchequer transactions. It is most probable that the exchequer miscalculated the amount of receipts, thus forcing the Bank to make the larger than usual revision. The revision left overnight rates very soft, at one point hitting 3 per cent. However, by the end of the day, they had recovered to hover at the 6.5 per cent level. In Germany, call rates finished unchanged at 8.85 per cent. Dealers were not expecting a rate cut at the Bundesbank meeting on Thursday.</p>

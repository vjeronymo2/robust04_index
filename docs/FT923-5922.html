			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Iscor down 44% due to market conditions ISCOR, South Africa's largest steel producer, suffered a 44 per cent decline in profits in the year to June after being hurt by weak export prices and a depressed local market. Attributable income was down to R346m (Dollars 126.2m) from R624m in the wake of a R170m rise in financing costs to R403m. Turnover advanced by 16.6 per cent to R8.6bn from R7.4bn, but pre-tax income fell to R748m from R874m. Earnings per share declined to 18.5 cents from 33.4 cents and the dividend was cut to 6 cents from 11 cents per share. The results were in line with market forecasts, but the shares fell yesterday to close at a new low of 98 cents. Iscor registered a 22 per cent increase in export volumes which rose to 53 per cent of total steel sales. But this was offset by an 8 per cent fall in dollar export prices and a fairly firm rand-dollar exchange rate. Domestic steel sales also fell 5.1 per cent to a 15-year low. Total tonnage sold rose by 7.7 per cent to 6.04m tonnes.</p>

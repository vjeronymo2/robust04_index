			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. The ``whispered voice test'' for hearing is deleted for all classes. Substituted are a conversational voice test using both ears at 6 feet; an audiometric word (speech) discrimination test to a score of at least 70 percent obtained in one ear or in a sound field environment; or pure tone audiometry according to a table of acceptable thresholds (ANSI 1969). The amended standards for hearing are the same for all classes. [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.13(c), 67.15(c), and 67.17(c); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.105(a), 67.205(a), and 67.305(a)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The standards pertaining to the ear, nose, mouth, pharynx, and larynx are revised to more general terms and related to flying and speech communication. Specific references to the mastoid and eardrum are deleted. The current standard, ``No disturbance in equilibrium,'' is changed to, ``No ear disease or condition manifested by, or that may reasonably be expected to be manifested by, vertigo or a disturbance of equilibrium.'' The amended standards are the same for all classes. [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.13(c), 67.15(c), and 67.17(c); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.105(b), 67.205(b), and 67.305(b)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. ``Psychosis,'' as used in the proposed regulation, refers to ``a mental disorder in which the individual has manifested psychotic symptoms or to a mental disorder in which an individual may reasonably be expected to manifest psychotic symptoms.'' This alleviates some of the problems in interpreting the regulations created by changes in nomenclature and classification of mental conditions found in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 3rd edition (DSM III). [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.13(d), 67.15(d), and 67.17(d); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.107(a), 67.207(a), and 67.307(a)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Substance dependence and substance abuse are defined and specified as disqualifying medical conditions. Substance dependence is disqualifying unless there is clinical evidence, satisfactory to the Federal Air Surgeon, of recovery, including sustained total abstinence from alcohol for not less than the preceding 2 years in the case of alcohol dependence. In the case of other substance dependence, recovery would include sustained total abstinence from that substance for not less than the preceding 5 years. Substance abuse, in the case of alcohol within the preceding 2 years and in the case of other substances within the preceding 5 years, is disqualifying. Alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse are included in the terms ``substance dependence'' and ``substance abuse'', respectively. [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.13(d), 67.15(d), and 67.17(d); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.107(a) and (b), 67.207(a) and (b), and 67.307(a) and (b)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. ``Bipolar disorder'' is added as a specifically disqualifying condition. This corrects a regulatory problem created by the change in nomenclature contained in DSM III. [FAR Standards: Current (None); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.107(a), 67.207(a), and 67.307(a)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The general mental standard is amended to add the word ``other'' before ``mental.'' The proposed revised standard reads, ``No other personality disorder, neurosis, or other mental condition *&blank;*&blank;*.'' [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.13(d), 67.15(d), and 67.17(d); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.107(c), 67.207(c), and 67.307(c)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. ``A single seizure,'' and ``A transient loss of control of nervous system function(s) without satisfactory medical explanation of the cause,'' are added as specifically disqualifying neurologic conditions. [FAR Standards: Current (None); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.109(a), 67.209(a), and 67.309(a)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. The word ``seizure,'' is substituted for ``convulsive.'' [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.13(d), 67.15(d), and 67.17(d); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.109(b), 67.209(b), and 67.309(b)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. ``Cardiac valve replacement,'' ``permanent cardiac pacemaker implantation,'' and ``heart replacement'' are added as specifically disqualifying cardiovascular conditions for all classes of certification. [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.13(e), 67.15(e), and 67.17(e); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.111(a), 67.211(a), and 67.311(a)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. A requirement is added whereby all applicants for second-class airman medical certificates will be required to have a routine resting electrocardiogram (ECG) at the first application after reaching age 35 and every 2 years after reaching age 40. An ECG requirement currently exists for first-class applicants; however, first-class applicants must have an annual ECG after reaching age 40. There is no requirement added for third-class. [FAR Standards: Current &sect;67.13(e); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.111(d) and 67.211(d)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. The current table of age-related maximum blood pressure readings for applicants for first-class certificates and the reference to ``circulatory efficiency'' are deleted, and a requirement that average blood pressure while sitting not exceed 150/95 millimeters of mercury is added for applicants of all classes. A medical assessment is specified for all applicants who need or use antihypertensive medication to control blood pressure. [FAR Standards: Current &sect;67.13(e); Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;67.111(b), 67.211(b), and 67.311(b)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. For first-class applicants only, a total blood cholesterol determination after reaching age 50 is added. A cholesterol of 300 milligrams per deciliter or more may require further evaluation although the applicant, if otherwise eligible, is issued a medical certificate pending the results. [FAR Standard: Current (None); Proposed &sect;67.111(f)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. The use of anticoagulant medication is made specifically disqualifying for applicants of all classes. [FAR Standards: Current (None); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.111(c), 67.211(c), and 67.311(c)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. Current &sect;67.19 of the FAR, Special Issue of Medical Certificates, is rewritten [Proposed FAR Standard: &sect;67.401(a)] to provide for, at the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, an ``Authorization for Special Issuance of Medical Certificate'' (Authorization), valid for a specified period of time. An individual who does not meet the published standards of part 67 of the FAR may be issued a medical certificate of the appropriate class if he or she possesses a valid Authorization. The duration of any certificate issued in accordance with proposed &sect;67.401 of the FAR is for the period specified at the time of its issuance or until withdrawal of the Authorization upon which it is based. A new Authorization is required after its expiration, and the applicant must show again that airman duties can be performed without endangering air commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed FAR Standard, &sect;67.401(b) also provides for a Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA) instead of an Authorization. The SODA will be issued to applicants whose disqualifying conditions are static or nonprogressive and who have been found capable of performing airman duties without endangering air commerce. The SODA authorizes an aviation medical examiner to issue a certificate if the applicant is otherwise eligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

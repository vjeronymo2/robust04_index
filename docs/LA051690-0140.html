			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VAN DORTRECHT LEADS TITANS STRAIGHT TO PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> SOFTBALL: PITCHER HAS 28-10 RECORD, 211 STRIKEOUTS AND THE BEST ERA IN THE BIG  WEST CONFERENCE ENTERING FRIDAY'S NCAA REGIONALS.  </P> <P> Ann Van Dortrecht can't explain why her pitches start straight and then seem to  take a hop, skip and a jump as they reach the batter's box.  </P> <P> About all the Cal State Fullerton sophomore knows is how she grips the ball and  flicks her wrist upon release.  </P> <P> She leaves all the physics to those aeronautical engineers known as pitching  coaches.  </P> <P> "It's centrifugal force or something, that's what they tell me," Van Dortrecht  says. "I never think about it. I just trust what the coaches say and throw it."  </P> <P> Like a superstitious batter during a hot streak, when something works and  you're not sure why, you don't question it. You just keep doing it.  </P> <P> "I always think my pitches stay straight, but people have told me there's a hop  to them, so I believe it," Van Dortrecht says. "I can't really tell they hop. I  just use the split-fingered grip, flip my wrist and they go up somehow."  </P> <P> That's the same direction the Titans (44-21) have gone with Van Dortrecht in  the pitcher's circle.  </P> <P> The right-hander has a 28-10 record with a Big West Conference-leading 0.44  earned-run average and 211 strikeouts going into Friday night's NCAA regionals.  The Titans, ranked fifth nationally, will play host to fourth-ranked Cal State  Long Beach in a best-of-three series with the winner advancing to the College  World Series.  </P> <P> Titan Coach Judi Garman doubted she would have a World Series-caliber pitcher  this season.  </P> <P> The staff suffered two setbacks in the past year. The first came when Kristen  Jacobs, a Fullerton College standout who had signed with the Titans, decided to  return home to Oregon last summer, and the second when 1989 ace Anjie Bryant  was declared academically ineligible.  </P> <P> Garman didn't know if Van Dortrecht, who went 19-8 with an 0.90 ERA and 136  strikeouts as the team's No. 2 pitcher last season, was good enough to inherit  the stopper role, especially when she closed the 1989 season with a sore arm.  But Van Dortrecht has stepped in nicely.  </P> <P> "Without Ann, we'd be in a world of hurt," Garman said. "She sure has saved us  this year."  </P> <P> "When school started, I gave the ball to Ann and said, 'The ball's in your  hands. How well we do depends on how well you do.' I told her to be more  assertive, take a leadership role and do a good job. She has."  </P> <P> Garman, however, says Van Dortrecht can do even better. Her pitches are  effective and her control has improved over last season, but there's one  missing ingredient: A killer instinct.  </P> <P> "To become a great pitcher, she needs to develop more mental toughness," Garman  said. "She has had success, but she lacks the mental toughness to be  consistently good. She has had some mental lapses that have gotten us in  trouble, but with killer instinct, she can block out those distractions."  </P> <P> As a freshman, Van Dortrecht said, she was afraid of most hitters.  </P> <P> "I walked a lot of batters because I tried to work around them instead of going  straight at them," Van Dortrecht said. "But this year, I'm not intimidated by  many people at all. I feel I can go right at them with my pitches."  </P> <P> For four years at Santa Maria High School, Van Dortrecht went at hundreds of  batters. She pitched all but five of the Saints' games in four seasons and led  her team to the Southern Section playoffs four times. The Saints made it to the  third round every season Van Dortrecht pitched.  </P> <P> Garman recruited Van Dortrecht, but by June of her senior year, the pitcher had  not scored the required 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test to gain freshman  eligibility under the NCAA's Proposition 48.  </P> <P> Van Dortrecht took the test again -- the morning after her school's all-night  graduation party at Disneyland -- but the results were not available until  August.  </P> <P> Garman couldn't wait that long for a commitment and ran out of scholarships.  Van Dortrecht had other offers from Arizona State and Nebraska but didn't want  to leave California to attend college.  </P> <P> So she waited and hoped. In early August, she got back her SAT scores: She had  surpassed 700. Her father, Ben, called Garman to see if she was still  interested.  </P> <P> As luck would have it, Julie Jones, a high school pitcher from Yuma, Ariz., who  had signed with the Titans, decided to attend an Arizona community college  instead, leaving Garman with an available scholarship.  </P> <P> "I was in a car and on my way up there with the paper work as fast as I could,"  Garman said.  </P> <P> Jones is now pitching at the University of Arizona and Van Dortrecht is the  Titans' ace.  </P> <P> "I was really lucky that girl decided not to come here," Van Dortrecht said.  "It all worked out rather well. She stayed in her home state and I stayed in  mine."  </P></p>

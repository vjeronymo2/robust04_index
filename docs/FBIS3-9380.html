			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 24 March carries in its  regular 7-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in the  republic.    Describing the situation in Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that  "Karadzic's terrorists and Abdic's paramilitaries are continuing  to cooperate in destroying this part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. All  last night, particularly after midnight, they pounded the  defense positions on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin Vrh,  and Barakovac with artillery and tanks. They attempted an  infantry breakthrough yesterday evening but our defenders  managed to repel it with great effort." He says that "the  members of the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa  autonomy have been using artillery since yesterday against the  Cazin districts of Krivaja, (Liskovac), and (?Prle). They also  used chemical agents, and Osa and Zolja portable rocket  launchers. This is continuing this morning. They have massacred  six members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H] Army, and captured  several others."    Viktor Boban reports from Maglaj from the theater of  operations of the B-H Army Operative Group Bosna that "yesterday  evening the Chetniks intensified their attacks on Rujnica, in  the region of Zeleni Kamen, and combined it with an attempt at  an infantry breakthrough. However, our defenders had no  problems repelling this enemy attack." He says that "this  morning after 0500 the Chetniks launched a savage artillery and  infantry attack on several parts of the Rujnica defense lines.  The B-H Army was ready for this attack, and responded with equal  ferocity so the valley of the Bosna River is reverberating to  heavy explosions. The general alarm has been sounded and the  population is in shelters. At the moment of filing this report  shells are pounding the town."    The B-H Army 4th Corps Information Service reports that "the  cease-fire on the Mostar front over the last 24 hours has not  been fully observed. Extremists from the Croatian Defense  Council have been less active than over the last few days but  they still fired a few grenades from a portable grenade launcher  at the demarcation lines in the city. Elsewhere the cease-fire  has held."</p>

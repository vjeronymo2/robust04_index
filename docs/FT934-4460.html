			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Royal Doulton ends first day 14p up Shares in Royal Doulton, the fine china manufacturer demerged from media parent Pearson, ended the first day of trading 14p higher than the opening quoted price of 193p, valuing the company at Pounds 113.8m. A group of three UK institutions is believed to have led the buying as media investors sought to shed the shares. The institutions are also thought to be existing Pearson investors. A total of 23.9m shares were traded, the second largest volume after Hanson. Pearson shareholders were offered one Royal Doulton share for every 10 held in the parent, which owns the Financial Times. Pearson shares closed Wednesday at 614p. They opened at 594p, reflecting the demerger of Royal Doulton, but gained 3p during the day to close at 597p. Analysts said buyers of Royal Doulton shares were focusing on the longer-term. The company has made it clear that the current year will be depressed by redundancy and restructuring costs. It reported a Pounds 2.1m loss for the six months to June 26 and a profit of Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 15.5m) for 1992. There were no comparable first-half figures for 1992. The forecasts for next year range from Pounds 10m to Pounds 17m.</p>

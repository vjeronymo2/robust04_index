			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The government has launched a campaign to deal  with drug traffickers, with effect from today, and has called on  Tanzanians to expose all those involved in drug trafficking.  Addressing Mlandizi residents in Kibaha District, the deputy  prime minister and minister for home affairs, the Honorable  Mrema, said that the government had resolved to launch the  campaign when it realized that Tanzania had now been turned into  a transit point for drugs. The Honorable Mrema stated that the  government would reward those who expose drug traffickers.  However, he did not specify the amount to be paid to those who  would assist the government in arresting the traffickers. He  pointed out that, after five or 10 years, Tanzania would have  many mentally destabilized youth as a result of drug abuse.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / World Trade News: GE signs power cost-cutting pact GENERAL ELECTRIC of the US has signed an agreement giving it access to a promising new technology that could save the power industry millions of dollars in fuel costs. The deal between GE and Exergy, based in California, is the latest effort by power equipment producers to boost market share by offering utilities more efficient power production. An exclusive agreement will enable GE to use the 'Kalina cycle' developed by Dr Alexander Kalina, principal owner of Exergy, as part of its combined-cycle power systems. These use the exhaust gases from a gas turbine to power a second, steam, turbine. GE claims its systems are the world's most efficient. Three GEC Alsthom offshoots have won orders worth DM387m (Pounds 161m) from Vereinigte Energiewerke, to upgrade the Janschwalde lignite-fired power station near Cottbus, east Germany.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] According to an informal estimate by the Bureau of  Investigation, roughly 400,000 people use narcotics in Taiwan.  Narcotics analysts in the bureau's Sixth Department say the  1,300 kg of heroin seized during all of last year is sufficient  to supply more than 32,000 users for an entire year. And since  the amount seized is conservatively estimated to equal only  one-tenth of total circulation, the number of narcotic consumers  in Taiwan extrapolates to roughly 400,000.    Bureau narcotics specialists say that a heroin user needs  only about 0.1 g a day of the most refined form of the drug to  satisfy his craving, greater use might be fatal, so a user  consumes only about 40 g a year. Therefore, the 1,300 kg seized  by public security organs last year is enough to supply 32,500  users for an entire year.    Nevertheless, most drug-bust suspects are by no means  first-timers, admitting involvement in many "deals." Therefore,  Sixth Department researchers point out, the amount of narcotics  seized by public security units equals about only one-tenth of  the total in circulation. Indeed, this estimate is in fact  derived from conclusions reached by the U.S. Government from  studies of drug seizures and actual trafficking in the United  States. Our country's war on drugs is less effective than  America's in terms of manpower, equipment, and funding, so  "one-tenth" may well be an overestimate of our effectiveness in  this endeavor.    Extrapolating thus, the amount of narcotics circulating in  our country is enough to supply roughly 325,000 users for an  entire year. And, given the principle of market supply and  demand, there clearly must be more than 320,000 users for there  to be such a flood of drugs into our country.    Are all our narcotics consumed domestically, or is there  transshipment abroad? As to this, bureau drug agents note that  no case of transshipment has ever been discovered, our customs  officials are very rigorous in their search for drugs, so it is  better for traffickers to use neighboring Southeast Asian  countries, where the risk of losing one's entire investment is  lower than Taiwan for transshipment.    Sixth Department researchers point out that using seizure  totals to estimate user populations is crude, informal, and  inaccurate; but that precise figures for those populations are  very difficult to obtain and accurate surveys are impossible; so  that there is no choice but to resort to such crude estimation.</p>

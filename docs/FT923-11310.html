			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading INCREASED tension in the Middle East and continued nervousness in the London market as the trading account drew to a close, provided the background for a retreat in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 2,415, the September contract on the FT-SE Index saw early selling with dealers focusing on the heavy fall in the Tokyo market overnight. A spate of bear closing inspired a brief recovery before the worries over the Middle East brought out sellers again. The contract had fallen to 2,368 by lunchtime, and had pulled the cash market lower. Then, a firm opening on Wall Street and belief that earlier falls had been overdone helped the contract rally. September ended at 2,384, down 38 on Thursday's close and around 10 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover reached 8,908 lots. Traded options remained dull. Turnover of 20,894 contracts was well below the 30,000 break even level. Some 8,303 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. BTR was the most active option with total of 1,639 lots transacted.</p>

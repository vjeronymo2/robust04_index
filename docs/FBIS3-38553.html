			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Thursday [3 February] 'Ismat  'Abd-al-Majid, secretary general of the Arab League, thanked the  Federal Government in Bonn for its work for the benefit of the  Middle East peace process and its support for the Palestinian  side. On the occasion of the first hoisting of the flag in  front of the former unofficial PLO mission and current  Palestinian delegation general, 'Abd-al-Majid said: "This event  demonstrates the further development and depth of German-Arab  relations. We are satisfied with and happy about this  development."    The Egyptian politician, who has been in Bonn since  Wednesday  for a three-day visit, particularly stressed the dedication of  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. 'Abd-al-Majid and Kinkel want to  discuss the progress of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and  the expansion of German-Arab relations on Friday.    In an interview with DPA, 'Abd-al-Majid said that there are  still "some difficulties" to be overcome in the peace process.  "However, the Arab countries have decided to strive for peace  and for a solution that will bring peace and stability to the  region." The Arab League will provide help if this can  contribute to a successful conclusion of the negotiations.    Previously, 'Abd-al-Majid, together with Palestinian  Delegate  General 'Abdallah Franji, had hoisted the black-white-green flag  with the red triangle. The ceremony was attended by Arab  ambassadors, representatives of the Foreign Ministry, and about  100 Palestinians who live in Germany. 'Abdallah Franji, who has  lived in Bonn for many years as the unofficial PLO  representative, said this was one of the "best experiences of my  life." After the visit by PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat in December,  Bonn had revalued his office to a delegation general.</p>

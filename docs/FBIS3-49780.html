			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Silviya Velikova] </F>   [Text] Today Madeleine Albright, U.S. permanent  representative at the United Nations, who arrived in Bulgaria  today, was received, respectively, by President of the Republic  Zhelyu Zhelev and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. Ms. Albright  briefed them on the U.S. Partnership for Peace Initiative, which  has already been adopted by NATO.    Ms. Albright expressed the U.S. expectation that Bulgaria  will also be one of the East European states to join in this  initiative. Ms. Albright voiced the U.S. Administration's  willingness to continue to provide economic assistance to the  countries of Central and Eastern Europe. According to her, the  financing of infrastructure projects, mainly in the  transportation and communications fields, will be of particular  importance for Bulgaria.    Dr. Zhelev confirmed his insistent invitation to President  Bill Clinton to visit Bulgaria.    At both meetings, discussions were held on Yugoslav crisis  issues and the sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro.  President Zhelev expressed the view that certain indirect  measures are already in hand to alleviate the losses that  Bulgaria is suffering from observing the Yugoslav embargo, but  we hope to obtain even better trade possibilities with the  United States and to see an influx of new U.S. investments into  Bulgaria.</p>

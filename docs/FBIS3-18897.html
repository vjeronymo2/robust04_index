			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Spain will say yes to the UN request for more  blue helmets for Bosnia, but it will do so symbolically. This  was announced this afternoon by Foreign Minister Javier Solana,  who met with his Portuguese counterpart. The Spanish and  Portuguese foreign ministers spoke about the European Union  enlargement and both defend the same interests. They hope that  Norway will change its stance on fishing. Over to Pedro  Fernandez Cespedes.    [Fernandez Cespedes] Despite yesterday's attack on the  Spanish Aviocar over Croatia, the government will not only keep  up its commitment in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but is already studying  the possibility of increasing our presence in the area, albeit  symbolically.    While waiting for the Army chief of staff's report, Minister  Solana adds another company of soldiers to the technicians the  defense minister promised yesterday.    [Begin Solana recording] He was speaking about the  possibility of sending some radar-type material along with  technicians, that would be some 30 people or something like  that. And the Ministry of Defense is considering the  possibility of maybe sending a company of soldiers. That would  be it.    I have to repeat that Spain is fulfilling its obligations.  It is doing so generously, efficiently. [end recording]    [Fernandez Cespedes] Minister Solana is sure that  yesterday's  attack on the Spanish Aviocar will get an adequate answer from  the international community. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: European aluminium hit by weak dollar EUROPEAN ALUMINIUM smelters are suffering severely from changing exchange rate patterns, particularly a weakening US dollar, because the metal is internationally priced in dollars, says the Anthony Bird consultancy group in its latest review. It suggests that Spain is worst off, with primary aluminium production costs now at 80 cents a lb compared with Venezuela, the lowest-cost country, at 42 cents. Germany, 67 cents, Norway and the UK, 63 cents each, also have production costs well above present market prices, says Bird. Only France, where Pechiney's new Dunkirk smelter using nuclear electricity recently came into production, is reasonably well-placed with costs of 52 cents. This places France ahead of the US, 56 cents, and even Brazil, 55 cents. Canada, 43 cents, and Australia, 45 cents, are the other low-cost producers. Bird suggests that aluminium demand, after going into reverse this year, will surge ahead by 6.5 per cent in 1993 before settling at a 3 to 4 per cent annual growth until 1995. There will be no recovery in aluminium prices this year and only a slow improvement in 1993, it adds. But in the medium term prices must improve because they need to be about 75 cents a lb to justify new smelters being built. 'Aluminium Analysis,' quarterly.

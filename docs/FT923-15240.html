			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Retail pay settlements 'low' AVERAGE PAY settlements in retailing and distribution have more than halved in value in the past year and are below the average for the whole economy, according to a report. Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions group, found in a survey of 100 pay reviews in the four months to April that the median was 4.2 per cent against 8.5 per cent for the corresponding period last year and 4.4 per cent for the whole economy this year. Thirteen of the 100 organisations had implemented pay freezes or deferrals of up to 12 months. However, where general freezes are in operation, it has been common for low-paid employees to receive an award as companies comply with wages-council orders. The report identifies a trend of stretching pay budgets through profit-related pay. For example, Robert Dyas, the ironmongers, has a six-month pay pause in operation. However, the company has also introduced a profit-related scheme which it says will give some 80 per cent of its 570 employees net increases of between 5 per cent and 6 per cent.

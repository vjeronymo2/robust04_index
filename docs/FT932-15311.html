			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Printers win 3.7% pay rise UP TO 10,000 print workers have won wage rises of more than 3.7 per cent after a wage offensive by the Graphical, Paper and Media Union. The union is targeting specific printing companies across Britain and demanding that they meet the union's claim of a Pounds 6.50-a-week rise, an extra day's holiday from January 1 1994 and pro rata conditions for part-timers and temporary workers. This follows the collapse of national industry talks. The current agreement runs out on April 24 and deals are all being made at company level for the first time in more than 50 years. The rises of over 3.7 per cent are more than twice the government's 1.5 per cent public sector pay limit. If the companies refuse to accept what the union wants their employees are being balloted for industrial action short of striking. Six companies are being disrupted. Mr Brian Willoughby, a GPMU national officer, said yesterday: 'Our campaign is going from strength to strength. Companies are settling with us on our terms across the country.' Agreements have been concluded with the St Ives Group, Severn Valley Press, the Bemrose group, Lawson Mardon, Ferry Pickering and the Howitts group. The union estimates 15 per cent of its members have so far secured deals on union terms. Even John Waddington company has negotiated a deal satisfactory to the union although its chairman is Mr Victor Watson, president of the employers' body, the British Printing Industry Federation. The GPMU is now targeting companies in the north-east. The union's campaign follows the collapse of pay talks with the employers who made a final offer (now withdrawn) worth 1.7 per cent or Pounds 2.92 a week on basic minimum rates. The employers' federation said there was a 'great variation' in local deals. The average rise of the 41 negotiated settlements so far notified to the federation is Pounds 5.10 a week on the craft grade but it added there had also been 24 employer-imposed pay awards of which 13 are pay freezes.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Good omens from Bavarian institutions - Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank, the biggest bank in Germany, will announce its 1993 figures on Thursday. In addition to a commentary on last year's numbers, Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive and one of the most important businessmen in Germany, will give his views on current year trading, on the economy and other issues of the day. Deutsche will not be the first big German bank to report - Bayerische Vereinsbank and the Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank, the two large Bavarian institutions, both reported last week. It will, however, be the first of the 'big three', with Dresdner and Commerzbank holding their press conferences next week and the week after. At the Bavarian banks, operating profits after provisions for bad and doubtful debts rose by about a third in each case. They enjoyed the happy combination of buoyant securities markets and strong loan growth which meant that profits climbed rapidly despite the deep recession. This constellation of favourable circumstances will not have passed Deutsche Bank by, although its sheer size means that the growth will not be as pronounced as at smaller institutions. Analysts will study Mr Kopper's remarks on current year trading with interest.</p>

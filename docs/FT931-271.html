			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Japan's jobless rate steady at 2.3% JAPAN'S official unemployment rate in February remained steady at 2.3 per cent, but the total number of people employed fell 0.4 per cent year-on-year, the first drop in seven years. Job market pressure is greater on women workers, as the number of women working during the month fell 1.6 per cent or 410,000 year-on-year, though few of these appear as officially unemployed. The number of men employed rose 0.5 per cent to 36.89m. The fall in women workers reflects the emphasis of cost-cutting companies on reducing the number of so-called part-time workers, many of whom are women working full-time, but outside the mainstream career path. Another sign of the weakening demand for new employees was a fall from 0.93 to 0.91 in the ratio of job offers to applications, meaning there were fewer jobs than applicants for the fifth consecutive month. Announcing 'restructuring' programmes, most Japanese companies have tried to hold onto career track personnel, trimming those workers not considered part of the lifetime employment agreement. Generally, that means women and seasonal workers. Labour ministry officials are concerned that a new phase of restructuring may begin in coming months, as companies are forced to cut costs further by laying off a growing number of mainstream workers. If this trend does emerge, the official unemployment figure may rise quickly. Mainstream male workers tend to be a family's largest source of income and would need to register quickly with the government. The ministry said manufacturing job offers fell 26.5 per cent year-on-year, with sharp falls in transport and communications, down 20.5 per cent, and wholesale, retail and restaurant employment (down 18.2 per cent). The Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC), recently set up by the banking industry to soak up non-performing loans, is likely to announce its first round of loan credit purchases and property valuations today. Banks hope the CCPC assessment of property collateral will set a floor beneath still-weak prices, while the purchase of banks' non-performing loans will enable them to write off losses for the fiscal year, which ends today.</p>

This  daily carried interviews with Bulgaria's "top three drug  experts," Prof. Todor Stankushev of the Psychiatry Department  with the Aleksandrovska Hospital in Sofia, Filip Lazarov,  associate professor and head of the drug addicts clinic in  Sukhodol (near Sofia), and Aleksandrina Nencheva, head of the  National Drug Enforcement Service. "[Three] professionals  clashed aspiring to the top office," KONTINENT comments.    Drug abuse has not yet become a large-scale phenomenon in  Bulgaria, Prof. Stankushev claims and goes on to say that most  of his patients know each other. "The official figures we have  set the number of drug addicts at 1,280, all of them registered  at the mental hospitals," Ms. Nencheva says for her part.  According to her the much-publicized drug-abuse boom is a stunt  since Bulgaria has no efficient monitoring system in this  sector. Mr. Lazarov, too, shares the view that the effective  system for registering drug addicts is outdated. Surveys  carried out by the Sukhodol clinic found that 23 percent of the  school children in the major Bulgarian cities have tried some  kind of drugs, be it heroin, glue or sedatives. "I myself  believe drug addicts to be much more [than the official  figures]," says Mr. Lazarov while Ms. Nencheva accuses him for  using the official figures to conceal the actual proportions  drug abuse has assumed in this country.    The National Centre on Drug Abuse, which is to be set up,  and  the Oncology Hospital are placed on an equal footing, Prof.  Stankushev says. "The Sofia Municipality, for example, has  adopted a 1 million leva (about $25,000) drug enforcement  programme setting 200,000 leva for awareness campaigns at a time  when it faces a severe funds shortage preventing it from paying  the wages to polyclinics medics," Prof. Stankushev also says.  "Why my colleagues of the Sukhodol clinic spend the funds they  get from sponsors for business trips and not for medicines," he  goes on to say. [sentence as received]    "We have established contacts with some 20 international  organizations and there are interesting proposals for joint  projects," Mr. Lazarov says. He threatens to set up a parallel  private institution in case others are named to head the  National Centre. The programme of the clinic envisages the  setting up of a city centre with a department for  nonconventional methods of work whose officers will seek to  penetrate into drug addicts' communities.    The National Drug Enforcement Service was set up to meet the  commitments this country has taken under international  conventions concerning drugs, Ms. Nencheva tells the KONTINENT  interviewer. It is designed to organize and enforce nationwide  control over the transportation of narcotic substances. "The  quantity of narcotics passing transit through the territory of  this country follows a persistent upward trend," Ms. Nencheva  says.    "Apart from the coordination between experts [of the  different institutions] there is a clash and this is the reverse  side of the medal," Ms. Nencheva says to sum up the current  trends dominating the drug enforcement institutions in Bulgaria.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "1993 Yearender" column: "China's Speedy Economic </F> Growth Has Impact Far and Wide -- RENMIN RIBAO Economic  Department Holds Forum on Relationship Between China's Economic  Development and the World Economy" -- first two paragraphs are  editor's note]    [Text] "China's development cannot be separated from that  of the world, while world development also needs China." Many  people at home and abroad have used this remark to explain the  relationship between China and the world.    As the New Year approaches, various localities, departments,  and enterprises throughout the country are speeding up their  work, making plans to further increase their economic and trade  contacts with foreign countries through in-depth reform and  wider openness to the outside world. In the meantime, economic  specialists and manufacturers in various regions of the world  are enthusiastically discussing the "China factor." They have  noted that since the publication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  important remarks made during his south China tour in the spring  of 1992, along with the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu  kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] economic growth  and the increase in comprehensive national strength, China has  exerted an impact on the international community which is not to  be ignored: In the various factors by which economic growth in  the Asia-Pacific region is maintaining vigorous momentum, China  is exercising the role of a "booster," and in the various  endeavors to push forward the global economic development, China  is a positive and active factor. A developing and flourishing  China is making its greater contributions to the world peace and  development. On this occasion of bidding farewell to the old  year and ushering in the new, the colleagues of this newspaper's  Economic Department held a forum especially on the subject of  the relationship between China's economic development and the  world economy. We now publish the following excerpts from it:  <H3>  More and More Serious Attention Has Been Paid to the "China  Factor" </H3>   Lu Zhenhua (7120 2182 5478): The vigorous momentum of  economic development in China increasingly has attracted  worldwide attention. Recently, the following four figures were  most widely discussed by people: China's rapid economic growth  has lasted for 24 months, China's economy has shown a growth  rate of 12 percent, the economy in the Asia-Pacific region grew  by 8 percent, and the world economy grew by an average of 2  percent. During these "24 months," China's places in world GNP  and import-export trade volume have moved forward several times.  Some people said that China's 12 percent growth rate has given  impetus to the 8 percent growth rate in the Asia-Pacific region,  and also has generated the world's 2 percent growth rate. At  present, when many countries are considering ways to promote  economic development, accelerate economic recovery, and lower  unemployment rates, they all place the "China factor" at a high  level -- something that has never been seen before. This is  obviously practical. China is a developing country with its  economy just taking off, so it is wrong to exaggerate the role  of the "China factor." However, China possesses a vast market,  as well as a great potential for opening up this market along  with economic development. It is indeed an unwise move to  overlook or abandon this market. According to statistics, over  the past five years, foreign capital directly utilized by China  amounted to approximately $30 billion. Meanwhile, it spent $400  billion in purchasing foreign goods. It is anticipated that  during the Ninth Five-Year Plan, there will be an increase of  more than 10 percent in these two areas. Such a large amount of  capital and huge commodity market will bring many opportunities  to various foreign countries and regions.    Dai Lan (2071 1526): According to the latest World Bank  statistics, foreign funds flowing into China in 1993 exceeded  $27 billion, and China has become the world's largest country  into which foreign capital has flowed. In the 15 open cities,  more than 240 representative offices have been set up by over  130 financial institutions from 29 countries and regions. The  quick access to China by foreign banks and their extensive  involvement have attracted people's attention. Since last year,  China's stocks have crossed the Pacific Ocean and begun trading  in the renowned stock market in Wall Street. Wall Street  financiers likened the Chinese stocks to "mountaineering  tigers." Over the next five to 10 years, China, being a major  region for the future development of "energy" in the world, will  see substantial growth in the securities markets.    Japan's Nomura Securities is the first foreign organization  to set up a representative office in China. Nomura took an  optimistic attitude toward the relatively high growth rate that  China will be maintaining and the funds that China will raise on  the largest scale ever seen in history for the development of  its agriculture, energy, transportation, and telecommunications  in a period of time to come. Through Nomura's introduction, more  than 300 Japanese enterprises have come to China one after  another to set up foreign-invested enterprises there. In  addition, it has specially set up the Nomura (China) Investment  Company, Limited, to engage in various investment projects of  considerable size in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, and other  cities. Thus it is obvious that China's vigorously developing  economy really has provided good opportunities for foreign funds.  <H3>  Overseas Manufacturers Are Optimistic About the Markets in  China </H3>   Xu Zhengzhong (6079 2973 0022): China's consumer market is  an enormous one, and is significantly characterized by the  growth of its market capacity outpacing its economic growth.  This year, China's total volume of social commodity retail  sales will increase by 23.5 percent. Also, judging from the  consumption structure, both daily consumer goods and durables  have universally begun to change to a diversified pattern at  multiple levels. The strong demands of China's consumer market  not only accelerated the readjustment of the world's industrial  structure of consumer goods, but also brought about the  prosperity of these trades. This is demonstrated by the fact  that at present, many countries are contending with each other  in studying China's consumption structure in order to be suited  to the consumer market in China.    In addition, the brisk consumer market in China also  provides  outlets for the substantial amount of idle funds from all over  the world. At present, owing to the sluggish markets in quite a  few countries and regions, the return rate there has been  seriously affected, but the stable and prosperous consumer  market in China has provided investors with exactly the  environment and confidence for their success.    Lu Zhenhua: The striking characteristic of China's market is  its hugeness, with great potentials and multiple levels.  Domestic manufacturers have placed high hopes on it, and it has  an appeal for overseas manufacturers. Analysis of the prospects  of China's market just according to the increase of 22.5 percent  of the total social commodity retail sales across the country in  the first 11 months of this year over the corresponding period  last year is not comprehensive enough. We should note that at  present, there exist privately owned foreign exchange amounting  to nearly $10 billion and personal savings exceeding 1,600  billion yuan, which are potential forces for consumption. If we  analyze China's market potential from a deeper level, people  will come to some kind of understanding that is more  encouraging. First, the total population of the Western  developed countries is about one-half China's current  population, which, though under control, is still growing at a  rate of 1 percent. The demands of such a huge population at  multiple levels certainly will give impetus to world commodity  production. Second, the markets of the Western countries have  tended to mature, while the development of China's market has  just begun, and is full of opportunities. Third, the economic  development achievements attained by China over the past dozen  years have been shared by the great majority of the people, and  with their income growing, they are rapidly turning into actual  market demand. Today, many overseas manufacturers' opinion that  the "China market should not be lost" stems precisely from their  considerations of immediate and long-term interests.  <H5>  China's Economy Is Being Linked to the World Economy </H5>   Liu Luyan (0491 7627 3601): China's foreign economic  relations and trade made a stride forward in 1993 on the basis  of sustained development. It is anticipated that the total  value of exports will be over $91 billion and imports will be  approximately $100 billion. Regarding direct foreign  investment, a grand total of some 130,000 foreign-invested  enterprises have been approved; industrial output value  accounted for six percent, and import and export volume  accounted for over 20 percent of China's total. [as received]  This indicates that the dependence of China's economy on  foreign countries has increased repeatedly, and its relationship  with the world economy has become closer and closer.    In this era when science and technology are advancing by  leaps and bounds, it is an irreversible tendency to merge the  domestic economy with the world economy. Since reform and  opening up, China has made unremitting efforts to link its  economy to that of the world. The foreign trade structural  reform has been deepened deliberately, with its intensity being  further increased this year, the management of export quotas and  licenses has been relaxed, the imposition of import regulatory  taxes and requirement for all lists of imported substitute goods  have been canceled, and import tariffs have been reduced twice.  All this has enabled China to move closer to GATT requirements.  As a participant in the Uruguay round of talks, China has made  major adjustments in its foreign trade policies according to the  requirements of the talks, and has drawn up a list of tax  reductions or remissions for agricultural and nonagricultural  products, the service trade, and so on. In short, China is  moving positively toward standardized international trade.    Qin Jingwu (4440 0079 0582): In China's primary energy (yi  ci neng yuan 0001 2945 5174 3293), the development of petroleum  particularly requires international cooperation. In 1992, when  China designated the East China Sea and Tarim Basin for foreign  companies' prospecting and development at their own risk, scores  of foreign companies submitted tenders. In the meantime, China  discovered a number of oil and natural gas deposits in the  Tarim, Dzungaria, Turfan, and Hami Basins. Moreover, China's  oil industry has emerged from the national boundaries and has  engaged in overseas oil prospecting at its own risk. It has  signed agreements on oil prospecting with Canada, Peru,  Thailand, and Papua New Guinea, which indicates that China has  set up a global concept of oil exploration in order to seek  cooperation for energy development in the sphere of the world.    Xu Zhengzhong: During the decade before reform and opening  up, China mainly exported some labor-intensive preliminary  materials and rough products, and the ratio between them and the  technique- intensive products for exports was 7:3. Alongside  the technological advance and industrial structural  readjustment, the proportion of finished products in the  country's export commodities grew so rapidly that the former  ratio has been reversed to become 4:6. More and more China's  hi-tech products have crossed national boundaries to take part  in international competition. This certainly will exert an  impact on the industrial structural readjustment of  international trade.</p>

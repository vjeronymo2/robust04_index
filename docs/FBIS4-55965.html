			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 24 May carries in its  regular newscast two reports on the fighting in the republic.    Mirudin Aldobasic reports from the 7th South Operative Group  press center and says that "throughout the day, the chetniks  from Mount Ozren shelled the village of Mravici on the Doboj  front. As reprisal for all the defeats that the Serbian rebels  are suffering, they shelled civilians and residential areas.  They fired several hundred shells at (?Planje), [name  indistinct], Dobro Polje, Mrkopic, and the center of Tesanj. On  several occasions between 1500 and 1700, on almost all of the  separation lines, particularly on the Tesanj and [name  indistinct], the enemy used chemical agents. However, the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army members are in absolute control of the  situation in this region."    Gorazde correspondent Mustafa Kurtovic reports that "the day  was again marked by serious Serbo-Montenegrin fascist  provocations within the three kilometer exclusion zone. In the  course of the day, at a distance of only 500 meters from the  town center, in the district of Vara, two women were seriously  wounded by snipers. This again confirms the impotence of the UN  peace forces in Gorazde. The aggressor was not quiet in the 20  kilometer exclusion zone. He fired howitzer shells at the  villages of Brdarici and [name indistinct]. There were small  arms and antiaircraft provocations on the  Ostanica-Ilovaca-Orahovice defense line. The criminals from the  Vuk and Grah plateaus are constantly firing at the villages of  Mravnjak, Potrkusa, Djindjici, Vranice, and Perjani. They are  using antiaircraft machine guns, M-84 machine guns, sniper  rifles, and portable rocket launchers."</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Guardian journalist quits after KGB links alleged A senior journalist on The Guardian newspaper, Mr Richard Gott, last night resigned after The Spectator magazine accused him of once having close links with the KGB. In a resignation letter Mr Gott, a well known leftwing journalist and the newspaper's literary editor, denied allegations in the right-of-centre magazine that he had accepted money. Mr Gott, best known for his coverage of Latin America, admitted however that the Russians had paid for trips to Vienna, Athens and Nicosia to meet Soviet representatives in the 1980s. The trips were apparently known to MI6. In a letter printed in today's Guardian Mr Peter Preston, the paper's editor, wrote that he accepted Mr Gott's resignation 'with the heaviest of hearts' and said he hoped his distinctive voice would still be heard in the paper in the future. But of the trips Mr Preston said: 'I should have known. I should have been told. You have resigned from the staff. That is accepted.' The Spectator has used the information on Mr Gott for a broad attack on The Guardian, set clearly in the context of the paper's coverage of unorthodox behaviour by MPs. The front of this week's issue is dominated by part of a Guardian front page on Mr Jonathan Aitken and the affair of the bill from the Ritz hotel in Paris. The Spectator also alleges that Mr Gott is only one of a list of British citizens, some still in positions of authority, who are known by British intelligence to have had connections with the KGB.</p>

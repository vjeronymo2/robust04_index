			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Government intervention likely in Bombay SE THE BOMBAY stock market, which has been rocked over the last three weeks by India's worst financial scandal, is to reopen today with expected heavy government intervention aimed at warding off a further crash in prices. The market will open to an official announcement that Mr Harshad Mehta, the Bombay broker implicated in the scandal, and his family, still have unpaid commitments for share purchases over the last month of between Rs650m-700m (Pounds 13m-Pounds 14m). Mr Mehta, his wife and brother were suspended from membership of the Stock Exchange on Friday after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) froze his assets and seized share certificates. The CBI will meet at the same time with the Stock Exchange authorities to see whether share certificates in his possession can be released to fulfil sales he made during the last two accounting periods. The reopening today of Bombay and India's other main exchanges comes after a weekend of nervousness at the immediate future of the market. It is feared that both the police and tax inquiries into the affairs of Mr Mehta - the driving force of this year's bull market - could lead into further unknown minefields. In a market with limited liquidity, the state-owned financial institutions are expected to intervene strongly to hold up prices and to protect the small investor - many of whom began purchasing late in the bull run. Mr M R Mayya, the Bombay Stock Exchange executive director, said yesterday: 'We are trying to stabilise the market. We are finding ways and means to do it.' Dr Manmohan Singh, the Finance Minister, gave a similar message to investors at a meeting he held with bank chairmen to discuss financial sector reform. He said there was no need for panic or despondency. But reaffirming the government's commitment to prosecute those involved in fraud, he said that those found guilty would not be spared. It emerged over the weekend that the Reserve Bank of India (the central bank) is to call in the IMF to help computerise its supervision of security trading. The Reserve Bank's ledger of inter-bank trading in government securities had fallen one month behind in April because each entry is made by hand.</p>

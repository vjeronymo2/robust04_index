			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["froe"-signed report: "Krueger Facing Difficult </F> Negotiations on European Research Programs"]    [Text] Bonn -- As chairman of the Council of Research  Ministers of the European Union [EU] during the second half of  the year, FRG Research Minister Paul Krueger (Christian  Democratic Union) wants to pass, if possible, all 20 programs of  the EU's Fourth Research Framework Program. This involves  approximately 24 billion German marks for 1994-98. However, it  remains to be seen whether Krueger will achieve this goal. It  is expected that the minister has to set priorities to ensure  the smooth continuation of EU-financed projects with German  participation, for instance in information technology. It is  also expected that there will be differences of opinion on  industrial policy.    Last week, the Mediation Committee, which consists of the 12  EU research ministers and 12 representatives of the European  Parliament, agreed on the 1994-98 EU research budget. The  Fourth Research Framework Program, which unites all research  activities of the European Union, will allocate 12.3 billion  ECU. In addition, in 1996 another 0.7 billion ECU can be  approved, the use of which is to be made dependent on the  economic situation.    After a formal confirmation of the results achieved in the  Mediation Committee by the Council of Ministers and the  parliament, the committee can now present the 20 specific  programs, with which the framework program is to be implemented.  According to the Research Ministry, 1.25 billion of the 12.3  billion ECU will go to Euratom (840 million ECU for fusion  research, 414 million ECU for nuclear safety) and 9.4 billion  ECU to the actual technical programs.    A total of 3.4 billion ECU are to be allocated to  information  and communications technology, followed by about 2 billion ECU  for industrial technologies, which include material research,  aviation research, and the fields of measuring and testing. In  the program for non-nuclear energies, (about 1 billion ECU) 60  percent are to be used for renewable energies and 40 percent for  research and development work for energy saving. Approximately  1 billion ECU are planned for environment, climate, and ocean  research.    In the FRG Research Ministry it is assumed that, within the  framework of the Program for Industrial Technologies, the  committee will also suggest means to promote the automobile  industry. This, however, will probably provoke a controversy  over European industrial policy, because, in contrast to France  or Italy, for instance, the FRG rejects specific promotion of  the automobile industry or other industrial branches for reasons  of order policy.    Still, in the ministry it is not expected that the  automobile  industry will get nothing at all. The Research Ministry also  expects differences of opinion regarding the item "International  Cooperation" amounting to 540 million ECU. While the southern  EU countries are striving for more intensive cooperation with  Latin America, Krueger primarily thinks of cooperation with the  countries in Central and Eastern Europe.    First tenders for project proposals are to be issued at the  end of 1994 and the beginning of 1995. The projects are  assessed anonymously. Even though Krueger will try to have all  20 programs passed during the second half of 1994, when Germany  will hold the EU presidency, it remains to be seen whether this  will be possible. Thus, Krueger must set priorities to get as  many programs as possible passed. Of particular importance is  the smooth EU financing of projects in the field of information  technology with German participation. The passing of the  environmental program is considered to be politically important.  The EU decisions also have an effect on the EU's Common  Research Office. It operates eight institutes in four  countries, including an institute in Karlsruhe.</p>

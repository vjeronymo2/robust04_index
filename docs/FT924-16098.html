			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / 'Green' audit to stress tax curbs A FRESH emphasis on using market forces to bring about environmental change will be a central theme in the launch today of the government's annual checklist for progress on environmental issues. On the second anniversary of the white paper This Common Inheritance, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, will highlight the government's plans to make more use of taxes and permits as well as statutory 'green' regulation. Last year's green audit, produced by his predecessor Mr Michael Heseltine, startled environmental groups by its frankness in highlighting a long list of failures by many government departments to advance green projects. This year two of the market mechanisms closest to realisation are the plans to charge for water pollution and proposals to allow companies to trade permits for emissions. The permits, part of a wider scheme to reduce acid rain, are intended to give companies more flexibility in the timing of investment in new equipment needed to meet rising environmental standards, while maintaining the country's overall pollution targets. However, Mr Howard may find some of last year's criticisms returning - notably that the government is still failing to link its environmental and transport policies and that, in spite of promises to curb greenhouse gas emissions, the mechanisms remain unclear. It is likely that today's emphasis on market mechanisms will generate a white paper on environmental economic instruments next spring.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Greyfriars net assets fall 62% Net asset value per ordinary share of the Greyfriars Investment Company fell by 62.6 per cent to 23.28p over the year ended September 30. After-tax revenue slipped to Pounds 412,712 (Pounds 477,463), equal to earnings of 5.9p (6.82p) per share. A final dividend of 4p makes a same-again 6p total. The directors said that in order to continue to pay 'the high level of dividend' Greyfriars had, of necessity, a portfolio yield of some 10 per cent. They believed this was 'unsustainably high' and therefore have decided to reduce the yield. That, coupled with their decision to repay part of the low coupon loan note, means the outlook 'is for reduced dividends in the short term'.</p>

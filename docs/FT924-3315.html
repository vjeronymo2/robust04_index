			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Pay anomalies alleged by unions MANY public-sector workers are expected to receive pay increases of more than the government limit of 1.5 per cent next year because automatic incremental rises, linked to seniority, will be paid to some groups in addition to their basic pay rise. Union leaders have criticised some of the anomalies in the implementation of the pay squeeze which may also mean that some workers will get less than 1.5 per cent. Mr Jack Dromey, a national secretary with the TGWU general union, cited the fact that the 70,000 industrial civil servants will receive bonuses and special recruitment payments in addition to the 1.5 per cent while workers in the executive agencies will have to include performance bonuses within the 1.5 per cent ceiling.</p>

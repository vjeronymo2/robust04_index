			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Besik Pipiya report: "Diphtheria in St. Petersburg"] </F>   [Text] It seemed that Russia's doctors had eradicated this  deadly infection once and for all back in the seventies. But  diphtheria has now resurfaced and dragged democratic Russia back  to the early fifties. St. Petersburg has surpassed Kaliningrad  and Moscow to take the lead in the number of people infected  with disease, a fact which is a cause of shame as we approach  the end of the century.    The number of diphtheria victims is tripling annually as is  the number of deaths. How can this uninvited guest be removed?  Mayor Sobchak's instructions -- demands along the lines of  protect, register, and inoculate -- have proved ineffective to  date. The main reasons are the population's low level of  information about the imminent danger and about the need for  compulsory inoculation, as well as the shortage of vaccine.</p>

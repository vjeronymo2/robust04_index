			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Pressures that stretch a thin blue line: The police and the crime rate are back on the political agenda. The report by Sir Patrick Sheehy urging radical changes to police employment has been attacked by officers of all ranks while MPs and the public are calling for initiatives against crime. FT writers sound out feelings in the city and in the country MRS DOREEN McDonnell is 65, lives in a two-up, two-down terraced house near Liverpool's Royal Seaforth container terminal and has been mugged twice in broad daylight, once on a bus and once in the street. She says she does not know what the Sheehy report is but has heard of moves to end 'jobs for life' for police officers. 'It's totally wrong,' she said. 'They deserve their job security and early pensions. They have to deal with crime and horrible people. I feel so much better when I see a policeman in the street. They have always been good to me and they really helped me face the world again after the muggings.' But if the police were paid on performance criteria such as solving crime, what happened to Mrs McDonnell might not help them score many points. A couple were arrested for allegedly robbing Mrs McDonnell on the bus but she failed to pick them out at an identity parade. The other mugger was convicted, but no thanks to the police - a passing motorist who saw the robbery made a citizen's arrest. Nor did the police catch the men who mugged two of Mrs McDonnell's friends from the local bingo hall, robbing one of her winnings and the other of her pension. But police nevertheless scored highly with the victims for the support, help and reassurance they gave. It is this sort of attitude that gives the police comfort in their opposition to the Sheehy report. Apart from performance-related pay rises, Sheehy proposes lower starting salaries and an end to overtime, abolition of three middle-management ranks, fewer promotion prospects, less generous pensions and initial 10-year contracts, renewable at five-year intervals. At Copperas Hill police station, 140 police, including CID, cover the few square miles of a Liverpool city centre with only 5,000 residents, but which daily attracts more than 200,000 workers, shoppers, tourists and visitors. The area includes 250 pubs and clubs with late-night drinks licences. Policing the area can be dangerous. Comradeship is important and teamwork essential. Constable Mark Blundell, who joined from the building industry eight years ago when he was 23, said his total pay would go down under Sheehy. 'Morale would take a battering, especially if a colleague had so many more performance points on his pay than you.' he said. Superintendent Philip Joy is on a job-swap from his normal patch at Llandudno, North Wales, and is in charge of Copperas Hill. 'It's the young constables I fear for,' he said. 'Many don't want to move up. Others who are ambitious see opportunities threatened. I have been doing staff appraisals here in the last two months and 10 per cent are talking about changing their job because they fear for long-term security or progress.' Chief Inspector Ted Bennett, who is in day-to-day charge of operations at Copperas Hill, feels especially vulnerable. Sheehy would abolish his rank - together with those of deputy chief constable and chief superintendent - in an attempt to streamline management and free resources to put more police on the beat. He is 51 and has 30 years' service. He wants to carry on to 55 but is afraid the over-50s will be the first chopped in any slimming down. Recruits under 22 get an annual salary of about Pounds 12,500 initially, while those over 24 get nearly Pounds 14,800. Mr Jim Sharples, Merseyside's chief constable, says this has improved the calibre of recruits and attracted many graduates. Sheehy would cut starting salaries to Pounds 10,500, which the Police Federation - representing junior ranks - says is Pounds 200 less than traffic wardens' starting pay, in spite of shiftwork and greater responsibility and danger. Mr Sharples likes the managerial streamlining and greater flexibility Sheehy might bring, but is very unhappy about its long-term implications for quality of personnel. He said: 'You have to look at Sheehy as a package, but all the gains in efficiency which might come from greater operational flexibility would be lost if we substitute a form of institutionalised insecurity among police officers.' Sheehy has united the police of all ranks as nothing before. In the public at large, however, there appears less demonstrable sympathy than for other public servants. What the police are relying on is the support of the so-called 'silent' majority. By definition this is not vocal, although that is no fault of Mrs McDonnell.</p>

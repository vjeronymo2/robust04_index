			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Observer: Unseated Cultural events at the Barbican arts centre in the City of London evidently have power to move people to do strange things. This year, the lost property office collected several sets of false teeth, a lacy bra size 38E, a box of 124 unused condoms, and a pair of boy's underpants. All remained unclaimed. The Barbican has decided to donate these items, along with countless umbrellas, items of outerwear, briefcases and cameras to Providence Row, the city's charity for the homeless which is trying to raise Pounds 5m.</p>

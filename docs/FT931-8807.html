			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Both sides claim victory in 'who should pay' case - A long-running dispute over insurance coverage Insurers, including underwriters at the Lloyd's market in London, have welcomed the judgment by a California appeals court in the Shell Rocky Mountain Arsenal case, one of the biggest disputes about insurance coverage for environmental pollution in the US. Insurers' confidence over the judgment, though, could be at best premature and at worst entirely misplaced. At the centre of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal case is a 27-square mile site near Denver, Colorado. Its owners, the US Army, made chemical weapons there  -including nerve and mustard gas - from 1942 until 1969, leasing part of the site to Shell Oil, the US subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell, which made a range of pesticides and herbicides there - and deposited waste products - between 1952 and 1969. Current estimates of the total clean-up costs range between Dollars 1bn-Dollars 2bn. Shell has agreed with the army to pay 50 per cent of the first Dollars 500m in costs, 35 per cent of the next Dollars 200m and 20 per cent of any remaining cost. Impartial observers believe that verdict, handed down on 21 January by Judge Ming Chen, encourages both sides. 'There is enough in this for both sides to claim victory,' suggests Chris Clarke, environmental specialist with the fortnightly newsletter, World Insurance Report. And while Shell and its lawyers are understandably cautious, policyholder lawyers have been heartened by the verdict. Randolph Fields, a lawyer who acts on behalf of policyholders in similar cases, says the result is a 'a terrible defeat for Lloyd's'. Last month's legal ruling is the latest stage in litigation about who should pay. Shell originally notified potential claims on several hundred comprehensive general liability insurance policies from February 1982, resorting to legal action when its insurers refused to pay. In the judgment, the California court ruled Shell could not collect on policies which it had bought after 1969, when insurers introduced a clause which limited coverage to pollution caused by a 'sudden and accidental' release of pollutant. That part of the verdict produced a triumphant response from insurance lawyers, who say it means Shell is unable to claim on approximately two-thirds of the policies potentially triggered by the claim. 'In terms of financial impact it's very significant for London. We got more out of it than the policyholder,' says Barry Bunshoft, a San Francisco-based attorney with Hancock Robert and Bunshoft, which represented Lloyd's underwriters in the case. However, Shell and its lawyers are placing equal emphasis on a second part of the judgment. When the case was first in court in 1988 the jury found that Shell could not collect on insurance policies because the pollution it had caused at Rocky Mountain had been 'expected and intended' and therefore was not covered by the wordings on policies bought by Shell between 1952 and 1969. Last month the appeals court ruled that in 1988 the jury had been improperly instructed to determine whether Shell knew or should have known that it was contaminating the site. Instead, the court ruled jurors should have been asked to determine only whether Shell actually expected or intended the pollution. That part of the case will now be heard again by a lower court, opening up the possibility that Shell can claim on its older policies. Bunshoft, the Lloyd's lawyer, said the judge's view on this issue amounted to 'nit-picking'. Shell, though, insists that insurers could still be liable for a significant portion of the clean-up cost. At the very least the legal battle seems set to continue for some time. Clarke says: 'The reality is that more stages of judicial argument lie ahead before final resolution of this enormous case.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Andrzej </F> Jelenski and Marek Kassa on 21 May; place not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Jelenski] Mr. Prime Minister, we are talking on  the eve of Peasants Day.    [Marek Kassa] It's a 100-year old tradition: Major  celebrations this year will take place in Raclawice -- and  Raclawice means Tadeusz Kosciuszko, Bartosz Glowacki, and  scythe-bearers. Which of those traditions and slogans we are  discussing have continued to have significance today?    [Pawlak] In those years banners carried a slogan: "We feed  and defend." Today, we write on our banners: "We manage, feed,  and defend," which somehow reflects the essence of our actions  today. [passage omitted].    This 200th anniversary of the Kosciuszko insurrection  coincides with celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the  peasant movement and the creation of a party that began to work  in the age of partitions, when prospects of freedom were bleak.  [passage omitted]    [Kassa] In your opinion as prime minister and leader of the  Polish Peasant Party [PSL], is there a chance to begin to think  about the unification of the peasant movement, which continues  to be split in Poland?    [Pawlak] To a large extent, the recent elections have  prejudged the situation. Integration is taking place at the  moment but in a different manner. I think that it is important  that in our actions we seek respect for a different look at the  future, at the way the peasant movement is organized. In the  PSL we do try to pay attention to this matter, whereby different  milieus can have a significant participation in activities and  decisionmaking. This is connected with a broader cooperation  with political and unionist milieus. Involvement of all the  sides is required here. This is also an indicator for those  politicians who work in rural areas, so that we can interplay  together in this sphere of essential interests of both the  countryside and Poland. During my foreign trips, I am often  struck by the fact that in external relations in many countries  I encounter an unequivocal stand, irrespective of the fact  whether it is a government coalition or the opposition. In  foreign relations they represent one stance. This should teach  us both in internal and external relations.    [Kassa] Your government and you personally were heavily  criticized for the organization of the 50th anniversary  celebrations of the battle of Monte Cassino. President Lech  Walesa said that the organization had failed and the current  government had a different option. [sentence as heard] In this  way he indicated that it was no accident that the organization  of these celebrations was not a success.    [Pawlak] I think that we are concentrating on the emotional  and technical side. I would begin with my own personal  reflection on the anniversary itself. In my view, Monte Cassino  shows that you can fight for Poland and for the future in  different places in the world. [passage omitted] As far as the  organizational and technical level is concerned, I am glad that  different milieus became involved and I do not think that this  pinching of the government should disturb anyone. It is  important that in addition to what the government organized  there were independent social initiatives. Everyone should  become involved in such situations, events, meetings, and  celebrations which concern our widely understood national  tradition. We will soon have the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw  Uprising, and I can say today that I would like to expect such  activity in organizing it by various milieus but now, at the  moment, when there is still time to organize many useful  activities. I would only like to point out to the fact that the  whole ceremony was organized by the organizational committee  consisting of different structures and representatives of  different milieus. The government supported it, first and  foremost, from the financial side and granted over 3 billion  zlotys for the organization of this ceremony securing the money  for the former servicemen's' lodging and partly for transport.  A very important and useful thing was the involvement of  different local milieus. I could see that the former servicemen  had a completely different approach to it.    In their approach you could notice a military approach going  back to the time of the battle, irrespective of the fact whether  the resources were sufficient or not. These celebrations were  simply organized to the best of those people's abilities. And a  paradoxical final of the meeting was when it started to rain  heavily -- the Italians say that this is a blessing from heaven  -- and maybe this rain reconciled all those present there and  showed that you have to look forward on such occasions and look  for the things that unite, especially in the face of such  experiences and circumstances as the battle of Monte Cassino.    [Jelenski] Minister Michal Kulesza, the government  plenipotentiary for administration reform, has resigned,  accusing your government of halting local self-government  reforms and aiming at the centralization of power. Does it mean  that you are, using such an inappropriate word, the first  brakeman of the Polish Republic?    [Pawlak] I value cooperation with Mr. Kulesza very much. I  think that his different approach to these matters was also  important at the time when we were seeking the best solutions,  but I also value the opinion of local self-governments. This  is, I suppose, where we should start: During the meetings with  local self- governments you could not find such unequivocal  opinions as regards the reforms Mr. Kulesza had been putting  forward. Centralism is not the point here because we are far  from it, and our suggestions that more prerogatives be  transferred to provincial governments and give them greater say  in coordination of regional administration prove that we are  aiming at the decentralization of decisions, that they be as  close to the grassroots as possible. But neither do we want to  transfer responsibility from local self-governments to the  center, especially in a situation when they have no chance to  fulfill their tasks. The situation in education can be a  symbolic example, where, as you know, there was a decision by  the previous political arrangement whereby the whole of issues  connected with education be transferred to local self-  government parishes as of 1 January. We treated this matter  very democratically, I believe. Well, local self-governments  were to take resolutions themselves if they wanted or did not  want to take over schools. It turned out that in such a  situation the opinion was not at all unanimous, because  everybody knew the reserves and financial capabilities. [passage  omitted]    [Jelenski] You have been working with Grzegorz Kolodko,  deputy prime minister and head of the Finance Ministry, for  almost a month now. How does the cooperation look? Earlier on,  fears were fairly widespread that you have, putting it mildly,  fairly divergent views on the creation of the Polish economy.    [Pawlak] When I put forward a nomination to the president  for  the appointment of Deputy Premier Kolodko, there were even these  reports about the fact that these contradictions reach back to  the period of the creation of the coalition, which is not  altogether true. And I think that a very important matter that  is worth stressing is the fact that Deputy Premier Kolodko  [words indistinct] approach to his activities. And I think that  he has a similar approach. He speaks here of this formula of  escaping forwards, and so the seeking of solutions through  looking to the future. And we will surely be striving to  resolve today's problems quickly -- tomorrow there will be new  problems, new tasks, new challenges. And this creates  conditions, both for there to be a good and considerable level  of activity, and this creates good conditions for many people,  especially in the economic sphere, that of enterprises, for  development, for a dynamic look ahead. And I would not hide the  differences, but would also not treat it as a problem. The  differences might be a motivating factor, if we are but capable  of exploiting them so as to find better solutions.    [Kassa] Over the last few weeks it has been possible to  observe that the tensions in relations between the government  coalition, and the parliamentary coalition, and the president  have decreased. Do you judge that this gives an opportunity for  us muddling through up to the presidential elections with such  an arrangement?    [Pawlak] I think that the relationships are multifaceted. It  all depends on the matters we are dealing with. And, assuredly,  there will still be various interesting events here in the  future. But I hope that this approach -- the seeking of  compromises, the seeking of solutions -- will bear fruit in the  fact that we will be able to exploit these relationships and  these often differing views for the seeking of such decisions  and such activities as, nonetheless, perceive this complicated  and specific situation in Poland [sentence as heard] And it  seems to me that in this respect a view of this in such a way as  to weed out all these decisions and stances that ensue from  concern for the future is also necessary here, irrespective of  which side they come from.    [Jelenski] The strikes by Solidarity are probably the most  important component of political and social life in this country  at the moment. In your opinion, has the government succeeded in  putting an end to the last wave of strikes? And is an  understanding with the trade unionists possible? Let us recall  that a Solidarity demonstration is planned for Warsaw on 27 May,  and that the union continues to claim that the government does  not want an accord.    [Pawlak] The strikes are an important component, surely, of  our public and political life, but surely not the only one of  these important or most important factors. Here, the situations  are very complicated, and a moment ago you spoke of  relationships with the president. And within the coalition  there are, after all, dependent on the matter at hand, various  approaches at times, various methods and proposals for  solutions. And if this was solely a matter of strikes and  solely a matter of negotiations with Solidarity, then perhaps it  would be easier to find solutions here that could satisfy  everyone. But this situation is far more complicated. And I  think that the strikes at the moment... [pauses] A tendency  towards a certain calming of the situation is seen at the  moment, as regards the strike situation. I am aware of the fact  that in many concrete situations there are reasons and that  there are causes that give conviction to many people that it is  necessary to reach for very radical methods of protest. But  also, many people have convinced themselves that a method for a  solution of these difficulties is not so much protest as  well-organized work, and the seeking of effective solutions,  both for internal use and for expansion and activity outside.  And as to the main problem, then I think that this main problem  is the approach to the termination of the strikes. For, after  all, as regards the postulates, and these detailed branch  postulates, they have been signed in accords with both the brown  coal sector and the hard coal sector. General postulates have  become the subject of the decisions of the trilateral  commission. A timetable for their implementation has been  adopted, these main ones regarding the taxation of incomes are  already being implemented. The matter of the control of  remuneration -- here there is a clear divergence as to the time  and rate of departure from these administrative methods, but as  to the aim there is full agreement. And the government has also  made a clear declaration in this respect. The point is just  that, in departing from one set of solutions we should not bring  about economic destabilization.    So, if we look at problems instead of postures a good  perspective may be seen.    There is a problem getting out of the protest calmly,  without  losing face. I think Solidarity had a few good opportunities to  end the whole strike action at this stage with some success.  Now the situation is becoming a little blocked, because there  is too much concentration on positions, so to speak, and too  little regard for the problems; but I hope we are able to  resolve the matter calmly. All that is needed here is an  accommodating approach by both sides. It is difficult for us to  accept the formula, that we enter into negotiations with  Solidarity only, and leave aside the other trade unions, which  have after all been taking part in these negotiations, in  agreements -- for in a moment we will have similar demands from  the other trade union organizations. I think it is also a  matter here of mutual respect in the trade union milieu. We  must recognize the fact that there are several important trade  union organizations, respect their position, their views in  specific situations, and with this kind of approach there will  be no problem with finding solutions.    I stress once again that to end the whole process  positively,  we need good will on both sides, and sometimes it is hard to  find a good solution which would fully satisfy everybody, but I  hope we will bring it about.

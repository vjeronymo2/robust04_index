			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Fax interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, assistant </F> secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) and member  of the Aden Presidential Council, in London; by an unidentified  AL-SHIRA' correspondent in Beirut; date not given]    [Text] [AL-SHIRA'] Was your presence and that of other  south Yemeni leaders abroad when the war broke out a coincidence  or was it planned?    [Muhammad] I was on a mission to brief Arab presidents and  kings on the other side's preparations for war and to appeal to  them to intervene to prevent it. The other party, however, went  ahead with its preparations and the war broke out while I was  receiving medical treatment in London.    [AL-SHIRA'] What were your expectations before going abroad?  How do you view the military situation now? What areas are  under 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's control and what areas remain in  your hands?    [Muhammad] When Yemeni unity was peacefully and  democratically attained, certain influential circles in Sanaa  were not happy with the way it was brought about. So they  created difficulties and challenges from the first day,  including assassinations, the abolishing of the new state's  institutions, involvement in the Gulf war, undermining the  economy, and finally making the decision to begin the current  war. There is now fighting in Ta'izz, Lahij, Abyan, Shabwah,  and Ma'rib. The two capital cities are subjected to missile  attacks and air raids. The northerners are losing thousands of  troops and hundreds of tanks and other vehicles for every small  advance they make into al-'Anad Base or Abyan. No matter how  many areas 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih controls, the logic of force and  its consequences are unacceptable. The outcome of occupation  and invasion will be overturned sooner or later. An examination  of Yemeni history will illustrate this point.    [AL-SHIRA'] Are you preparing yourselves for a war of  attrition? Where are you getting the weapons?    [Muhammad] We did not begin the war. We do not want war at  all. The area that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is now invading fought  off the British Empire, the Turks, and the Portuguese. It has  been a graveyard for invaders. There is strong resistance  despite the ferocity of the battles.    [AL-SHIRA'] Are you afraid Aden will turn into another  Sarajevo?    [Muhammad] Although our army is much smaller and our areas  are less populous than the north, the heroic steadfastness of  our warriors has upset their numerical superiority. Aden's  quicksand and mighty waves will drown the forces they are  massing to attack the city.    [AL-SHIRA'] Why has the oil not been attacked yet?    [Muhammad] We respect the investments and interests of  others. We have the capability to hit Ma'rib and al-Hudaydah but  we wish to protect the Yemeni people's interests and other  people's interests. The other side, however, has struck at these  interests by hitting Aden's refineries and is trying to approach  and control the oil installations in Shabwah.    [AL-SHIRA'] Was there no alternative to your separation?    [Muhammad] What other response do you expect from people who  find war, destruction, and death imposed on them? What other  option is there?    [AL-SHIRA'] Don't you think that giving up power for the  sake  of unity is a worthwhile sacrifice?    [Muhammad] We were idealists and gave up power for the sake  of unity. We accepted a two-way and even a three-way  partnership and believed that this idealism would find a  favorable response. The bitter facts proved that the other side  wished to dominate us, abolish our rights, and monopolize  everything. We discovered that the unity we had dreamed of was  not realized in substance or form. We will leave this to  political analysts to judge later and decide which side wanted  unity and which side is actually separatist.    [AL-SHIRA'] Have you been using the tactic of luring the  northerners to the south to prolong the war and sap their  capabilities for a political purpose? Are you trying to get  Arab-international intervention that will formalize the current  status?    [Muhammad] The next few days will answer this question.    [AL-SHIRA'] What is the actual U.S. position on the issue?  Is it true that coordination between you and the United States  began when [Yemeni Socialist Party Secretary General] 'Ali Salim  al-Bid visited the United States and met with U.S. Vice  President Al Gore?    [Muhammad] We hope that the U.S. attitude will be consistent  with the U.S. position on the new world order and its views on  democracy, human rights, renunciation of violence and terrorism,  rejection of military dictatorship, and respect for all nations'  mutual economic interests on an equal basis. The Sanaa party  does not respect these principles, judging by its atrocious  conduct before and during the war.    [AL-SHIRA'] How do you assess the roles played by the Arab  countries?    [Muhammad] There is no effective Arab role. It has been  paralyzed since the Gulf war. The Egyptian, Saudi, Syrian, and  Emirian appeals to end the fighting are welcome but what we  actually need is a firm Arab position to end the war and make  the two parties accept dialogue to reach solutions satisfactory  to both sides. As to the Iraqi position on the issue, the  statement issued by the National Command [of the Iraqi Arab  Ba'th Socialist Party] and the attitudes shown by their  representatives at the Arab League demonstrates Iraq's position.  Iraqi officials are also making visits and sending Republican  Guard experts and experts in other fields to the north. We used  to believe that Iraq was concerned with improving its poor  economic conditions instead of meddling in other people's  affairs but it appears that the militarist mentality that ruined  many of our Arab countries is now shared by the Iraqi regime and  the Sanaa regime.    [AL-SHIRA'] When will the Arabs and the world recognize you?  Why has this recognition been delayed?    [Muhammad] Arab and international circles acknowledge that  there are two Yemens. Recognition that we are two equal parties  exists. How else would you explain the referral of this issue  to the Arab League and the UN Security Council? The  representatives of south Yemen were accorded the same level of  reception as the representatives of the north.</p>

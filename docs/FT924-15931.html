			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow becalmed ahead of September jobs report Wall Street APART from some end-of-quarter 'window-dressing' by institutional investors, US stockmarkets were becalmed yesterday as investors anxiously awaited tomorrow's vital employment report for September, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 4.86 at 3,271.66, having spent the entire day no more than 10 points either side of Tuesday's close. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 finished slightly firmer, up 1.00 at 417.80, and the Amex composite rose 1.11 to 376.72. The Nasdaq composite was the day's best performer, rising 5.64 to 583.27. Turnover on the NYSE was 185m shares. September's employment figures, due out tomorrow morning, dominated trading. Investors and analysts are unsure whether a particularly bad jobs report will provoke the Federal Reserve into cutting interest rates once more, to stimulate the sluggish economy. Analysts say that prices did not move up in anticipation of a policy ease this week, for two reasons: investors were not confident that the Fed would ease if the numbers were bad; and even if the report showed further deterioration in labour market conditions, expectations of economic growth and corporate earnings for the rest of the year would have to be revised downward quickly. The day's economic news had little impact on sentiment. The Chicago purchasers' index for September rose slightly, but new home sales showed a sharper-than-expected decline of 6.1 per cent in August. Among individual stocks, Times Mirror fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 30 1/2 after Smith Barney, the broking house, downgraded the stock to a 'hold' from a 'buy', citing continued weakness in the Los Angeles area economy. On Tuesday the company warned that August advertising revenues fell by 5.6 per cent from a year ago. Another stock hit by a Smith Barney downgrade was Morgan Stanley, the securities house, which fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 48 after Ms Alison Deans, the Smith Barney analyst, lowered her fiscal year 1993 forecasts for Morgan Stanley because of lower international business. Computervision fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 6 1/8 in turnover of almost 3m shares after the company warned that third-quarter operating profits will be lower than a year ago, adversely affecting full-year 1992 results. On the Nasdaq market, Gensia Pharmaceutical fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 20 1/2 on news that shareholders are suing the company for alleged securities law violations relating to the testing of its Arasine drug. Canada TORONTO stocks continued downwards as the main Canadian banks raised prime rates by two points to 8.25%. The TSE 300 composite index dropped 29.36 to 3,297.88 in volume of 30.35m shares worth CDollars 363.2m. Investors fear the trend will continue if the Canadian dollar keeps falling.</p>

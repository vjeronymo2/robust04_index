			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by G. Seibert: "The EMIR-1 Program - A Basic </F> European Microgravity Research Programme"]    [Text]  <H5>  1. Background and Objectives </H5>   In June 1992 the ESA Microgravity Programme Board adopted a  Resolution on the future structure of the Programme, which  requested that in future the Agency's microgravity activities be  split into two distinct financially independent elements:    -- A basic European Microgravity Research Programme (EMIR);    -- A programme to develop the facilities required for  microgravity experiments to be carried out in the Columbus  Attached Laboratory (MFC = Microgravity Facilities for Columbus).    This Programme Board Resolution was approved by the Council  at Ministerial level on 9/10 November 1992 at Granada.    In May 1993 the Microgravity Programme Board approved the  transformation of the ongoing extended Phase 2 of the ESA  Microgravity Programme into the EMIR-1 Programme by re-orienting  its scientific/technical content towards fundamental research.  <H3>  The Subscription Levels of Participating Member States to  the EMIR-1 Programme </H3> <H3>  Scale of Subscriptions of Participating Countries in the  EMIR-1 Programme </H3>   -- Germany: 25 percent    -- Austria: 0 percent    -- Belgium: 3.81 percent    -- Denmark: 1.96 percent    -- Spain: 2 percent    -- France: 12 percent    -- Italy: 15.86 percent    -- Ireland: 0 percent    -- Norway: 0.34 percent    -- Netherlands: 4 percent    -- United Kingdom: 1.15 percent    -- Sweden: 4.50 percent    -- Switzerland: 4 percent    -- Total subscription: 74.62 percent    -- Not covered: 25.38 percent    The motivation of Member States to establish a basic  microgravity research programme EMIR is based on the desire to  ensure modest but assured funding for basic microgravity  research activities independent of possible programmatic changes  in large infrastructure elements such as Space Station/Columbus  and Hermes. It is assumed as a general guideline that Short  Duration (Sounding Rocket, Parabolic Aircraft Flights etc),  Shuttle-related and non-Shuttle related activities are of  approximately equal importance and are therefore funded at  similar levels.  <H5>  1.1 Scientific Aspects </H5>   The main features of microgravity are the elimination of  gravity-driven convection, sedimentation and fluid-static  pressure. The feasibility of containerless processing is  another advantage of this unique environment.    Density gradients in liquids and gases arise wherever  temperature or concentration gradients exist. This is the case  with any heat treatment and any process involving phase  transitions or chemical reactions. Density gradients and their  corollary, buoyancy-driven convection, prevail thus in fluids on  Earth. The effects of convective flow may dominate heat and  mass transfer and limit the control of numerous processes such  as crystallisation. It prohibits conducting defined model  experiments for testing theoretical models. Under microgravity  conditions gravity-driven convection is virtually eliminated.  Consequently a new generation of experimental research in Fluid  and Materials Sciences becomes feasible in space.    Fluid dynamics phenomena can be investigated without the  interference of gravity-driven convection. Results from such  studies are expected to provide important feedback for the  testing and development of theories describing three-dimensional  laminar, oscillatory and turbulent flow generated by various  other driving forces.    In space, diffusion-controlled heat and mass transport  conditions in fluids can be achieved. This was demonstrated  with a variety of experiments, whereby exceptionally precise  data on self-diffusion, hetero-diffusion and thermo-transport  were obtained.    In crystallization, the control of heat and mass transfer  presents a major problem, and microgravity is therefore of great  interest for the solidification of metals and alloys and for  crystal growth in general. Virtually all crystal growth  processes from melts, solutions, and vapours involve thermal and  concentration gradients driving buoyancy flow on Earth. The  crystallisation under conditions of diffusion-controlled heat  and mass transfer in microgravity should enable to optimise  these processes and finally to better control the product.  Chemically homogeneous semiconductors have been obtained and  crystals grown from the vapour phase and from solutions have  reduced defect density.    One of the very promising projects is the crystallization of  proteins. The molecular structure of only several hundred out  of an estimated million of different proteins has been  unravelled. The difficulty lies in obtaining sufficiently  large, and sufficiently perfect crystals for X-Ray diffraction  analysis. There are clear experimental indications that the  crystallisation of proteins is enhanced in space. Recent  experiments yielded a variety of protein crystals of a quality  superior to those obtained on the ground.    In space, the behaviour of mixtures of liquids with gases  and  solids can be investigated without sedimentation causing  separation of the components according to their densities. The  elaboration of composites such as high-porosity alloys or  particle and fibre dispersions which cannot be obtained on the  ground, can be investigated in space.    The absence of fluid-static pressure and of gravity-driven  convection provides optimal conditions for the investigation of  capillarity phenomena, phase transitions, and critical point  phenomena in fluids. As the critical point is approached, the  compressibility of fluids increases by orders of magnitude, and  on Earth a fluid is therefore compressed under its own weight.  The fluid is stratified according to density, and homogeneous  bulk samples needed for investigating phenomena near the  critical point can only be obtained in space.    In the absence of gravity, melts can be positioned and  manipulated without containers. Containerless processing is of  interest since crucibles can be the source of contamination,  heterogeneous nucleation, and mechanical stress. So far very  few microgravity experiments on glass formation have been  undertaken. There is the possibility of studying under cooling,  nucleation, and the formation of metastable phases in the  containerless mode.    Combustion is an example of a process where microgravity has  dramatic effects. There are complex chemical reactions with  large temperature and concentration gradients and, therefore,  with strong convection. Microgravity is the only means by which  combustion phenomena can be investigated under  diffusion-controlled conditions and without sedimentation  (droplet and particle burning).    There is a new class of experiments emerging using the  near-weightlessness condition for fundamental physics  investigations. Besides tests of general relativity (e.g. STEP  project), there are projects on developing an ultraprecise  atomic clock with the long-term perspective of application in  Global Pointing Systems, studies on fractal materials,  aggregation phenomena and thermal radiation forces. It can be  expected that more physicists will discover microgravity as a  tool for research in the future.    Space life sciences experiments aim at identifying the part  which gravity plays at all levels of life from the organization  of a single cell to the nature of gravity-resisting and  detecting mechanisms in more highly developed organisms  including man.    In the life sciences, microgravity provides unique  experimental conditions that are unavailable on Earth.  Microgravity studies on the underlying mechanism in cellular  processes add a new dimension to our basic knowledge in biology.  Studying higher organised life forms such as plants, small  animals or even man himself, can reveal gravity-dependent  processes, or gravity responses to gravi-sensing mechanisms, all  of which can be considered as an extension of ground-based  research.    To the biologist, microgravity offers a whole new area of  research: Life has evolved within the limits of the particular  physical conditions on Earth, where most of these conditions -  with the exception of gravity - are variable. Most of our  understanding of the functioning of living organisms was  obtained by varying these conditions in a controlled manner,  however, always against a background of at least 1 g.    Investigations under reduced gravity forces therefore  represent a completely new field for biological research.  Initial studies were performed in plant biology, where  microgravity proved to be a unique tool for research into  mechanisms of graviresponse.    Studies in developmental biology and cell biology have  generated many new and open questions. On a macro-scopic level,  most biological processes appear not to differ in a microgravity  environment. However, results clearly show that on the level of  individuals cells or tissue, unexpected and often rather drastic  differences occur. These results are intriguing. They provide  a strong basis for obtaining insight in the (unexpected) role of  gravity in fundamental cell biological processes, in regulatory  mechanisms and their influence on the level of whole plants or  animals (including man).    Further research in these fields will also contribute to the  field of exobiology. Questions about the origin of life on  Earth, the likelihood of life having originated on other  celestial bodies, the possibility of interplanetary (or  interstellar system) transfer of living organisms will all be  addressed by this discipline, that is included in the programme.  The finding that gravity may influence cellular, or even  molecular processes, therefore has strong relevance for the  study of those fundamental questions.    Furthermore, there is a group of processes of adaptation to  the absence of gravity, the study of which could well illuminate  the normally-occurring process. In the absence of gravity bone  becomes demineralized and muscle proteins are broken down faster  than they are built up. The cardio-vascular system has to  function differently in the presence of different hydrostatic  forces. Prolonged bed-rest can simulate some of the gross  effects of weightlessness, but microgravity has already been  shown to produce additional effects, presumably because of the  elimination of actions due to differences in the magnitude and  direction of force on individual components of the body.    The study of the interaction of cosmic-ray particles with  living matter is another area of research. While a considerable  part of this work can be conducted with particles generated  using Earth-based accelerators, the full spectrum of HZE  particles, however, is difficult to produce simultaneously.  There already is some experimental evidence that space flight  factors such as weightlessness enhance the biological effects of  radiation, and the mechanisms of this could cast much light on  the functioning of the genetic apparatus. It will also assist  with the evaluation of the radiation hazards to man during  prolonged space missions, in terms of both, their immediate and  their longer-term effects.  <H5>  1.2 General EMIR Programme Objectives </H5>   The main objectives of the EMIR Programme are:    -- To promote fundamental and applied research in materials,  fluid, physical and life sciences in space; and    -- To establish the necessary knowledge base of research and  engineering results in order to provide the firm foundation upon  which future activities with a more applied or commercial thrust  can be built.    These objectives shall be met by:    (a) The Development of Research Facilities    Multi-user Facilities and dedicated specific experiment  equipment will be developed for sounding rockets, Shuttle,  Spacelab, Foton/Nika type retrievable carriers and MIR in such a  way as to reflect the evolving scientific needs.    (b) The Provision of Flight Opportunities    A balanced programme of flight opportunities using  short-duration suborbital flights (parabolic aircraft flights,  sounding rockets, etc.) Spacelab, retrievable carriers and MIR,  will be provided in such a way as to ensure the regular  availability in the short and medium term of the microgravity  environment to the scientific user communities. This is  considered a prerequisite for the further evolution of basic  research in the microgravity environment.    (c) The Nurturing of the User Community    Ground-based research which may ultimately require further  experimentation in low-gravity conditions will be encouraged at  the European national level or via ESA Prodex programmes  whenever possible.  <H5>  2. Operating Principles of the EMIR Programme </H5>   (a) Scientific Emphases    The Agency's EMIR Programme will give equal importance to  life sciences and materials/fluid/physical sciences. Scientific  excellence will be the overall guidelines determining  priorities. The Agency will pre-select, with the help of  independent scientific peers, the experiments on the basis of  scientific merit and space relevance and will submit lists of  pre-selected experiments to the Microgravity Programme Board for  approval. With the help of its Microgravity Advisory Committee  the Agency intends to identify areas of scientific priorities  and to initiate a grouping of experiment proposals into focuses,  which will, in general, be centred around proposals of  exceptional quality.    (b) Use of Existing Facilities    The selection of flight opportunities will be made on the  basis of cost effectiveness, and so maximum use will be made of  existing multi-user and dedicated experimental hardware.    (c) International Cooperation    Since the orbital flight opportunities are rather scarce at  present, the Agency will continue to expand the international  cooperation with the United States of America, Russia and other  countries pursuing microgravity activities. For instance in the  immediate future this means that the Agency intends to expand  its use of the NASA spacelab missions and the Russian Foton/Nika  type retrievable carriers and MIR missions. This cooperation  covers also joint basic microgravity research and joint use of  the experimental flight hardware.    (d) Technology Development    The ESA EMIR Programme will pursue and extend, in its  Supporting Technology Element, the development of advanced  technology required for the development of high-quality  experiment equipment, its automation, the application of  telescience and robotics.    (e) Data Base    In the frame of the ESA Microgravity Programme a  Microgravity  data base of scientific results has been established. This data  base is available to all users from academic and industrial  research laboratories. It is expected that via a data  dissemination system a wide spectrum of the research community  can be reached.    (f) Scientific Reporting/Education    A further means to promote microgravity research will be the  presentation of results at conferences of scientific and  professional associations and the support of "microgravity  summer schools" which aim at the involvement of young scientists  in future microgravity activities.    (g) Advisory Bodies    The Agency intends to continue to utilise expert advisory  bodies, i.e. the Microgravity Advisory Committee and discipline  working/expert groups which are made up of top level scientists.  These groups regularly review the programme, support the Agency  in selecting the best research proposals (use of scientific peer  groups), and suggest - based on the results of experiments - new  studies, the introduction of new research fields and also  focusing on prioritized research fields.  <H5>  3. Overall Description of the EMIR-1 Programme Elements </H5>   The proposed EMIR-1 Programme is a merger of Phase 2, and of  the Second Extension to Phase 2. For EMIR-1 two basic options  concerning the programme content can be identified. The two  options referred to as Option A and Option B, relate to the fact  that the Spacelab Mission E1, which the Microgravity Programme  would like to use to the maximum extent, has not been approved  yet. It is uncertain, at present, if Member States will agree  to "sufficient" funding in the framework of these Columbus  Precursor Missions to finance the E1-Spacelab Mission.    Option A reflects the programmatic content and the proposed  adjustments of the Second Extension assuming that the E1-  Spacelab Mission will be funded. This option is the clearly  preferred one and has been a key planning hypothesis over the  past years.    Option B reflects a situation where the E1-Spacelab Mission  would not be funded. This option has not been studied to the  same extent as Option A in view of the indication given by the  States participating in the Precursor Missions in the past, that  preference would be given to funding of the Spacelab E-1  mission. Therefore, Option A was discussed as planning baseline.    In the following subsections the various programme elements  are described, and where relevant, the alternative flight  opportunities are identified if no E1 Spacelab missions would be  funded.    The various programme elements are grouped in the following  activities:    -- General Activities, covering studies, technology, data  base and expert working groups etc.;    -- Mini Missions, covering sounding rockets, parabolic  aircraft flights, GAS and drop tower/tube experimentation;    -- Spacelab Facility Development/Reflights, covering the  following individual facilities:    a) Biorack reflights on IML-2 and E1 Spacelab missions;    b) Bubble Drop and Particle Unit reflight on IML-2 and E1  Spacelab missions;    c) Critical Point Facility on IML-2 and E1 Spacelab  missions;    d) Anthrorack reflight on the E1 Spacelab Mission;    e) Advanced Fluid Physics Module reflight on E1 Spacelab  Mission;    f) Advanced Protein Crystallisation Facility on Spacehab 1,  IML-2 and two other missions;    g) Advanced Gradient Heating Facility on Spacelab missions  such as E1 or equivalent.    -- Spacelab Independent Payloads, covering the development  and mission costs of the diffusion measurement Facility (a GAS),  and mission costs of the APCF on Spacehab (June 1993);    -- Payload Development/Refurbishment, covering the planned  development of the Fluid Physics Facility (derived from LSF), of  the Floating Zone Stability Module for Foton, the costs  associated with the utilisation of existing facilities on MIR,  and the development of the Breath Analyzer and BIB-incubator for  the MIR-95 mission. (BIB = Brunel Institute of Bioengineering.)  In addition, the refurbishment costs for the reflights of  Biobox and Biopan are included in this programme activity. For  new developments for Foton an attempt will be made to apply the  technology used for sounding rockets;    -- Mission Costs for Retrievable Carriers/MIR, covering  missions costs for ESA payloads on Foton/Nika-type missions and  potentially special payload services for the MIR missions;    -- Participation in NASA Spacelab Missions, covering at  present the development of the Torque Velocity Dynamometer (TVD)  and Neurorack for the NASA Spacelab Missions SLS-3 and SLS-4,  but could be extended to cover ESA payloads on other Spacelab  missions of NASA;    -- Phase B Studies, covering the Phase B studies of  multi-user facilities for Columbus (i.e. the Biolab, Materials  Science Lab and the Fluid Science Lab) which will later become  part of the MFC programme.    In the following sections, short descriptions of those  programme elements or activities shall be given which still play  a major role in the future.  <H5>  3.1 Future Studies </H5>   Since the amounts obtainable from General Studies are more  and more reduced, there is a strong need for this activity to be  maintained within the EMIR Programme. In 1993 the funds needed  are especially high because parallel Phase A studies had been  initiated in 1992 for the microgravity facilities for the  Columbus APM. Past experience has shown that parallel studies  are in the best interest of the Agency from a  cross-fertilisation viewpoint and in order to maintain  competition up to fixed-price offers for the Phases B and C/D.  Other areas which require studies are:    -- Analysis of scientific, technical and operational  requirements of proposed experiments;    -- Payload accommodation studies for retrievable carriers;    -- Investigation of required gravity levels across all  Microgravity disciplines;    -- Feasibility studies of multi-user facilities (e.g.  Neurorack);    -- The implementation telescience.  <H5>  3.2 Supporting Technology </H5>   In order to remove technological, schedule and hence cost  risks, a supporting technology programme element is needed to  ensure timely development in potentially critical areas. At the  request of the Microgravity Programme Board the originally  planned amount for supporting technology has been reduced and to  the programme element "Mission Costs for Retrievable  Carriers/MIR" has been increased accordingly, because no funds  were originally planned to support the suddenly upcoming  Euro-MIR 94 and 95 missions. This means that the planned early  breadboarding of MFC within the Supporting Technology Programme  can no longer be performed.  <H5>  3.3 Microgravity Data Base (MG-DB) </H5>   The MG-DB entered its final test phase in March 1993, after  the building up phase of collecting and formatting the data had  been concluded. The first release of the MG-DB to the large  user community is planned for the autumn of 1993.    The User Support Centres MARS, MUSC, CADMOS and DUC were  involved in the establishment of the data base and have ensured  the largest possible coverage of microgravity experiments.  Between March and June 1993, a selected number of users were  given the opportunity to examine the application, easy access,  man-machine interface as well as the quality of the data. The  ESA MG-DB contains at present the description and results of  about 180 European and 600 NASA/United States experiments. By  the end of 1993 the MG-DB will contain all the European  microgravity experiments flown and a short description of the  objectives of those experiments which are planned to be flown in  the near future.    The Agency reached an agreement with NASA to share the  experimental data of both sides and to develop and use  compatible formats and application procedures.  <H5>  3.4 Experts, Advisory/Working Groups, Purchase Orders </H5>   This programme element includes a number of general  activities which in the past fell under ESA internal costs, but  which in reality do not belong there. The following expenses  are covered by this programme element:    -- Experts and consultants, scientific advisory/working and  expert groups, peer groups for experiment evaluation, symposia  support, etc.;    -- Use of facilities, laboratories and computer services;    -- Purchase orders (this type of procurement procedure is  often used for smaller equipment items because it strongly  reduces the administrative effort and associated delays).  <H5>  3.5 Sounding Rockets </H5>   Sounding rockets have played a significant role in  microgravity experiments, particularly in Europe through the  German national programme TEXUS (Technologische Experimente  Unter Schwerelosigkeit), in which ESA participates at a level of  about 50 percent. In the United States and Japan sounding  rocket programmes were also carried out for microgravity  research, but in a more sporadic manner. In addition to the  normal two TEXUS rocket flights per year, the Swedish Space  Corporation (SSC), with major ESA participation (about 90  percent), started a sounding rocket programme called MASER  (Materials Research Experiment Rockets) in 1987, with a flight  frequency of one payload every 18 months.    Five successful Maser flights were carried out to date, and  the sixth is planned for November of this years.    Apart from the established usefulness of such flights for  materials/fluid sciences, sounding rockets offer good  opportunities for experimental study and assessment of the  gravity relevance of some key bioprocesses which do not require  long exposure to microgravity. Sounding rocket experiments are  especially appreciated by the scientific community because of  the short lead time between experiment selection and flight, and  because of the frequent flight opportunities.    In the TEXUS programme 30 sounding rocket payloads were  flown  since 1977. Microgravity durations of the order of six minutes  are achieved by payloads of about 360 kg (250 kg pure  experimental hardware) flown to an altitude of 250 km. Launch  and recovery takes place at ESRANGE near Kiruna in Northern  Sweden, the launch vehicle being a Skylark 7.    The payloads of Texus and Maser consist of up to six  autonomous experiment modules, each with its own power supply,  data handling, and in some cases, video monitoring and  telecommand for real-time experiment control. New module types  are continuously under development, depending on the experiments  selected during each call for experiment proposals.    The use of longer-duration sounding rocket flights using  larger rockets, is attractive for many experiments. Therefore  MBB/ERNO and SSC established the Maxus sounding rocket programme  and considered the following design criteria:    -- Re-use of existing Texus/Maser hardware;    -- Microgravity time off up to 14 minutes;    -- Experimental payload of about 440 kg.    The first Maxus flight partially failed, however, the  payload  was safely recovered. The reflight in November 1992 was  successful.    The programme element sounding rockets has somewhat suffered  from the:    -- Stretching of approved MG programmes within the same  financial envelope;    -- From the increase of the mission costs (flight ticket and  payload), because for geographic return reasons, new  unexperienced contractors for the development of payload modules  had to be involved.    Considering the present budget for sounding rockets, which  has not been reduced or blocked as a consequence of the low  subscription to the approved Extended Phase 2, the mission  scenario looks as follows: a Maser (6) and a Texus (31) flight  in November 1993, a further Texus flight in 1994, a Maxus 2  flight in Spring 1995, followed by Maser 7 in Spring 1996. It  is assumed that new funds will be available from the EMIR-2  programme for the 1997 sounding rocket activities.  <H5>  3.6 Parabolic Flights </H5>   For many years, in the United States and in recent years  also  in Europe, aircraft flying parabolic trajectories have been  employed to produce low gravity conditions. In the early years  this was mostly for astronaut training and similar activities.  More recently, these parabolic flights have been used for  microgravity activities, especially precursor experiments,  equipment checkout and experimental parameter optimisation, in  materials sciences and the life sciences.    From the life sciences perspective, parabolic flights are  useful not only for testing new procedures and equipment, but  they also provide the opportunity of crew involvement.  Furthermore, the periods of hypergravity, which occur during  re-acceleration and climb to altitude in such flights, are also  useful, for example, for the construction of physiological  models over a wider range of gravity levels, and for  understanding instantaneous dynamics of physiological reactions  to transient g-levels.    Several types of aircraft were used. ESA was able to use the  NASA KC-135 aircraft six times, both as precursors to Spacelab  flights for experiment optimisation, and also, more generally,  for experimental opportunities for interested microgravity  researchers. The disadvantage of the KC-135 flights was that its  campaigns were performed as JSC Houston, so that all  experimenters with their equipment had to travel to Houston.  Therefore the French company NOVESPACE, with major investments  of CNES, made a Caravelle airplane available which ESA has used  twelve times since February 1989. In 1994 the flight  certificate of the Caravelle (the aircraft is some 20 years old)  will probably expire and a new solution for parabolic aircraft  flights has to be found. In this context the procurement of an  Airbus A 300 was proposed; however a procurement of leasing  would cost between 14.5 and 20 MAU [million accounting units]  for 4 to 8 years' leasing options. In addition, the Airbus has  a very large capacity (about 12 tons, 50 passengers) - too large  for it to be used fully and efficiently for the ESA MG  programme. The advantages of Caravelle's frequent flight  opportunities -- so much in demand -- would be lost to the users.    Another alternative to Caravelle might be the commercial  offer of the company "Elbe Space and Technology Dresden",  proposing parabolic flight services with a Russian aircraft  IL-76 MDK. However, the safety aspects, which are also based on  the flight history of a plane, might pose a problem. The  technical capabilities of the IL- 76 MDK are somewhat larger  than those of the Caravelle and its utilisation is therefore  slightly more expensive.    The budgetary planning of parabolic aircraft flight  campaigns  in the EMIR-1 Programme (each consisting of some 90 parabolas  with about 20 seconds of 10-2 periods) assumes two campaigns per  year until 1997.  <H5>  3.7 Spacelab Facility Development/Reflights </H5>   This major element of the programme covers the developments  in the past and the refurbishment and reflights of some ten  different independent multi-user facilities. Since all these  facilities were described in detail in PB-MG documents (e.g.  ESA/PB-MG(89)9), a document of 85 pages, most of them also in  "Microgravity News" and in many external publications, no full  description of these facilities will be repeated here. However,  remarks to the status of flight opportunities, especially where  the not yet approved Precursor Mission E1 is concerned, will be  given below.  <H5>  3.7.1 Vestibular Sled </H5>   The Vestibular Sled, already developed prior to the start of  Phase 2 of the Microgravity Programme, was designed to support  the investigation of the functional organisation of man's  vestibular apparatus and orientation system and the vestibular  adaptation process in the absence of gravity.    The Sled was flown on the German Spacelab mission D-1 in  1985. It provided a linear acceleration (0.2 g max) with a  well-defined level and profile, on an astronaut attached to a  seat which moved on rails along the centre aisle of the  Spacelab, the Astronaut could be oriented in three planes with  respect to the acceleration vector. The vestibular system of the  astronaut could be stimulated both thermally and optokinetically  during the experiment.    Mainly due to its heavy demands in terms of resources (total  Spacelab floor) and due to disturbances generated during its  operation, Sled could not find further Spacelab flight  opportunities. However, both Sled models were used successfully  in terrestrial research laboratories. No further expenses for  the Vestibular Sled are planned in the MG Programme.  <H5>  3.7.2 Biorack </H5>   The Biorack is a multi-purpose facility for experiments in  cell and developmental biology and radiation biophysics. Its  first two flights were on the German Mission D-1 in 1985 and on  IML-1 1992, and it will be reflown on the NASA International  Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2 Spacelab Mission in July 1994.    The main elements of the Biorack are incubators, a  cooler/freezer and a glovebox. It also includes special  canisters for transporting and maintaining sensitive biological  samples under a well-defined thermal environment. Experiments  are in general housed in small experiment containers of standard  dimensions. The experiment containers are provided to the  investigators who accommodate their biological samples,  nutrients, etc. according to their specific requirements.    In future, after IML-2, it is planned to refly Biorack on  the  E1 Spacelab mission. If this mission is not approved, there is  a good chance that Biorack will be selected for a NASA Spacelab  mission. In the "Call for Experiments" for the NASA Spacelab  mission SLS-4, Biorack is offered to support research areas in  cell and molecular neurobiology and developmental processes at  cellular level.  <H5>  3.7.3 AFPM (Advanced Fluid Physics Module) </H5>   The AFPM evolved from the Fluid Physics Module. It was  successfully flown on the German Spacelab mission D-2 in April  1993. It is designed, like the FPM, for investigation of liquid  bridge stability. Marangoni convection, drop coalescence,  surface and interfacial forces, capillary phenomena and the  behaviour of containerless immiscible fluids. The system and  diagnostics are more sophisticated than the original FPM.    The core of the AFPM is an interchangeable test chamber with  two coaxial discs (up to 100 mm diameter). Liquids can be  injected through one of the discs so that a liquid column can be  mechanically stimulated either by rotating the discs or by axial  vibrations. The discs can be heated such as to establish the  temperature gradients required in the liquid.    Illumination of meridian or cross-sectional planes permits  the observation of phenomena within the liquid. Images can be  recorded by two TV cameras. A thermographic camera permits also  the determination of the surface temperatures.    In future, after D-2, it is planned to refly the AFPM on the  Spacelab Mission E-1. Should this mission not be realised, the  following near term alternative exists: The Floating Zone  Stability Module, planned to be developed for a Foton flight in  1996, could be extended to cover the essential capabilities of  the AFPM. The remote control capabilities of Foton are rather  limited. Therefore an effort should be made to improve this  capability of Foton.  <H5>  3.7.4 BDPU (Bubble Drop and Particle Unit) </H5>   The BDPU is dedicated to the study of the behaviour of  bubbles, drops and particles in transparent liquids. The unit  is modular consisting of a test container with test cells, a  fluid injection system and a fluid reservoir. The test  container can be replaced in orbit. The temperature of the  fluid can be controlled and thermal gradients can be generated.  Acoustic and mechanical means for mixing of the fluids are  provided. The diagnostic means include direct observation by  TV, cine and still cameras, a Point Diffraction Interferometer  and a Schlieren Optics System.    Temperatures are monitored by ten sensors in the wall of  test  cell, and surface temperatures are determined by a thermographic  camera.    The BDPU will fly on the Spacelab mission IML-2 in June  1994,  during which about half of its utilisation is given to United  States investigators in return for a free flight ticket (i.e.  mission and integration) on IML-2. NASA is also interested in  sharing the utilisation of BDPU on the E1 mission and would  compensate this by reducing the Shuttle costs for the E1  mission. Should there be no E1 flight opportunity, the BDPU  could probably refly on one of NASA's Spacelab missions, which  are planned by NASA as successor missions - with international  participation - of the national USML-1 and USML-2 missions, or  on Space Station Precursor missions.  <H5>  3.7.5 CPF (Critical Point Facility) </H5>   This facility is designed to investigate phenomena occurring  near the critical point in transparent fluids under microgravity  conditions. It has flown on IML-1 in 1992 and is scheduled for  flight on the IML-2 Spacelab mission in June 1994.    The major elements of this facility are a precision  thermostat with an experiment-dedicated fluid cell. Various  stimuli, such as acoustic stirring, heating and cooling can be  applied. Thermal and optical diagnostic systems permit  observation of flow and of phase separation.    The thermostats can be exchanged in orbit so that different  systems can be investigated. The temperature in the thermostats  can be controlled in the range of 30-70 Degrees Celsius with an  accuracy of 1 milli-Kelvin and a stability of 0.1 milli-Kelvin.    The optical diagnostics consist of a Schlieren optics  system,  a Twyman-Green type interferometer, a small and wide-angle light  scattering measurement system and a light-attenuation  measurement system.    In future it is planned to fly the CPF on the E1 Spacelab  mission. Should this mission not take place CPF could probably  fly on one of NASA's missions, under similar conditions  (IML-conditions) as on IML-1 in 1992 and IML-2 in 1994. There  is considerable interest in the United States of America to  continue joint ESA/NASA flights on the CPF.  <H5>  3.7.6 Anthrorack </H5>   The Anthrorack is a multi-user facility for research in  human  physiology, which was successfully flown on the German Spacelab  mission D-2. The concepts is to measure interrelated body  systems (e.g. cardiopulmonary metabolic etc.) simultaneously on  the same subject, thereby allowing the intercomparison of data  in a whole body analysis.    Such an approach allows sets of high quality extensive  science data to be acquired, and it mitigates the effects of the  serious lack of mission opportunities and the low number of test  subjects, which have precluded a normal statistical approach.  Specific system-stimulation devices are provided in order to  perturb well- regulated and balanced body systems e.g. heart  rate and fluid distribution, in a calibrated and reproducible  fashion.    Anthrorack contains specialised equipment for monitoring, on  a non-invasive basis, the cardiovascular adaptation,  deconditioning and pulmonary function. It has provisions for  sampling, processing, conservation and acquisition of signals  representing the biopotentials (ECG, EMG, EOG, EEG), blood  pressure, body temperature and ambient conditions.    The experiments on the first mission covered three major  groups, namely cardiovascular, pulmonary and hormonal research  experiments. There are two major monitoring and diagnostic  systems: the Respiratory Monitoring System, based on a mass  spectrometer for analyzing the pulmonary functions, and the  Ultrasound Monitoring System for studying cardiovascular  functions. The major body stimulation equipment is a Bicycle  Ergometer mounted on the centre aisle of Spacelab. A high-speed  centrifuge is included to permit the processing of blood samples  on board.    It is planned to refly Anthrorack on the E1 Spacelab  mission.  Should this mission not take place, the Anthrorack could be  converted into an ESA-Neurorack for the NASA SLS-4-Neurolab  mission. For a Neurorack it is planned anyhow to use similar  infrastructure and service elements as for Anthrorack.  Anthrorack would have to be modified for the specific needs of  the Neurolab mission objectives.    In particular re-use of the following Anthrorack  sub-elements  is foreseen:    -- Central computer unit for data acquisition and transfer;    -- Modular support equipment with plug-in modules and the  modular support system for experiment specific equipment (ESE);    -- Automated blood pressure measurement system;    -- Remote signal conditioner units for support of EMG, EOG,  ECG, EEG, strain gauge dynamometer/potentiometer, and  temperature sensors;    -- Ambient conditions monitoring system;    -- High-resolution colour video monitor.    In this case of conversion of major hardware elements of  Anthrorack into a Neurorack, which serves a different  physiological science community, i.e. the neuro-physiology  community, it would be desirable to extend the experimental  opportunities on the MIR-94 and MIR-95 mission to serve the  "traditional" Anthrorack user community in the cardiovascular,  pulmonary and hormonal research fields.  <H5>  3.7.7 AGHF (Advanced Gradient Heating Facility) </H5>   This facility is a Bridgman-type furnace for crystal growth  and directional solidification. Relatively large samples of up  to 18 mm diameter and 300 mm length can be processed under  well-controlled conditions of thermal stability, solidification  rate and interface planarity. The cartridges containing the  samples can be exchanged so that a series of samples can be  processed. Electric pulses can be applied to the samples  causing instantaneous growth rate variations for interface  demarcation. To minimise microgravity disturbances, the  cartridge remains stationary whilst the furnace is translated.    NASA and ESA had planned to fly and utilise the AGHF during  the NASA USML-2 Mission in 1995. However, NASA was not allowed  to fly AGHF on the United States-National Spacelab mission  USML-2.    It is now planned to fly the AGHF on the E1 Spacelab mission  with the same set of selected ESA and NASA experiments, as  planned for the USML-2 mission.    Should the E-1 mission not be realised, a joint re-flight of  AGHF on a NASA Spacelab mission is envisaged. NASA is very  interested in using AGHF.  <H5>  3.7.8 APCF (Advanced Protein Crystallisation Facility) </H5>   This facility is designed for the growth of protein  crystals.  The two APCF flight units fit technically into two Shuttle  middeck-lockers and can accommodate 96 (= 2 times 48) protein  crystallisation reactors at closely controlled temperatures (+4  Degrees Celsius and +20 Degrees Celsius for IML-2). APCF  consists of two completely independent identical modules. This  means that a one middeck-locker size APCF facility could be  flown and operated at any desired temperature between + 4  Celsius Degrees and some 30 Celsius Degrees. This APCF provides  the possibility to utilise the three crystallisation methods  favoured by the investigator community:    -- Free interface diffusion;    -- Dialysis;    -- Vapour equilibrium.    High-quality video observation and recording is available  for  20 reactors, which will allow the study of growth rates and  mechanisms and determination of the size and habitus of the  grown crystals prior to re-entry (possible damage). There also  is a simple light-scatter nucleation-detection device, which may  be developed into an advanced diagnostic system for crystal  growth at a later stage.    APCF successfully flew for the first time on the Spacehab 1  mission in June 1993. It will refly with two modules (two FM's)  on the IML-2 mission in 1994, and two more flights were agreed  with NASA in the 1994/95 time frame, in exchange for NASA's use  of the ESA glovebox on the USML-2 mission.    In future, no problems of flight opportunities of the APCF  are expected, because the facility is compatible with standard  Shuttle middeck lockers and with Spacehab lockers.  <H5>  3.7.9 Glovebox </H5>   The glovebox concept was derived from the Biorack glovebox,  an enclosed space penetrated by gloves, which isolates the  internal content from the glovebox' environment. The glovebox  protects the astronauts' living environment from the experiment  and the experiments from each other. This is accomplished by a  constantly filtered air flow and a slight underpressure with  respect to the Spacelab cabin. Residual leaks will draw clean  air in to be filtered rather than allow contaminated air out.    The Biorack glovebox was so successful that NASA requested a  next-generation version for the USML-1 Spacelab mission, which  flew in 1992. This new glove-box was aimed more towards  materials/fluid science experiments. The improved technical  capabilities included video channels for downlinking and  on-orbit recording.    In return for NASA's utilisation of the glovebox on USML-1,  the Agency already obtained the APCF flight opportunity (two  middeck lockers) on the IML-2 mission, and will obtain two more  flight opportunities (one middeck locker each) for APCF on  future Shuttle flights, in return for the utilisation of  glovebox on the USML-2 mission in 1995. NASA's life science  office have specifically requested that ESA's glovebox fly on  the SLS-4 mission in order to replace the originally planned  large NASA General Purpose Work Station (a Spacelab Double  Rack). The glovebox would permit biological sample preparation  and handling in a safe and contained environment. In return,  the ESA investigators selected would be offered to use NASA  facilities during the SLS-4 mission.  <H5>  3.8 Biobox and Biopan for Foton </H5>   The two facilities were developed by the Agency for flight  on  Russian retrievable Foton type satellites.    Biobox is a fully automatic and programmable incubator (with  a 1 g reference centrifuge) for research in gravitational  biology. It flew for the first time in December 1992/January  1993 on the Russian Bion 10 retrievable satellite mission (a  Foton re-entry capsule). It is planned to refly Biobox in 1994  and 1996 on cost reimbursable Foton missions.    The Biopan is a multi-user experiment facility intended to  support research into the effects of cosmic radiation on  biological sample materials. Biopan is designed to fly on  recoverable satellites, on missions with an orbital inclination  of 62.8 Celsius Degrees or 82.3 Celsius Degrees, and with a  duration between two weeks and six months. Biopan will be  mounted on the outer surface of its carrier satellite and will  allow direct exposure of the biological samples to the hard  vacuum and radiation environment of outer space.    The candidate carriers for Biopan are, in the first place,  the operational Russian satellites of the Bion, Foton and Resurs  type, and at a later stage the Russian Nika-T satellite, which  will make its first flight in 1995. Different numbers of  Biopans (between one and four) can be accommodated on these  satellites.    In the frame of the ESA/RSO arrangement mentioned above, it  is planned to perform Biopan's first operational flight at the  end of 1993 and to refly it in 1994 and in 1996. Already in  October 1992, a technical qualification flight of Biopan on  Foton was successfully carried out.  <H5>  3.9 New Payload Development for Retrievable Carriers and MIR </H5>   It is planned to develop - after Biobox and Biopan - the  following two fluid science facilities for flight on Foton:    -- Fluid Physics Facility (FPF);    -- Floating Zone Stability Module;    And it is proposed to develop two life sciences facilities  for the MIR 1995 flight:    -- Breath Analyzer;    -- BIB-MIR Incubator.  <H5>  3.9.1 FPF (Fluid Physics Facility) for Foton </H5>   ESA made, in summer 1992, a detailed comparative assessment  of the capabilities of the two fluid science facilities BDPU and  the Liquid Structure Facility (LSF)(ESA/PB-MG(92)21). The  background for this comparison was the strong reduction in the  scope of Columbus Precursor missions from originally two Eureca  reflights and two Spacelab missions (E1 and E2), to one E1  mission with only 50 percent ESA payload, and 2 MIR missions.  Since the ESA multi-user facilities already developed for  Spacelab, exceed by far the accommodation capabilities of a 50  percent E1 Spacelab, it was strongly recommended to refly either  BDPU, or to develop the LSF and fly it on E1. The Microgravity  Programme Board decided in September 1992, that a peer group  examine the situation by taking into account the feasibility of  the priority-A fluid science experiments which could either be  performed with the BDPU, LSF, or with both facilities.    In short, the Peer Group reached the following conclusion:  The development of a derivative of LSF for flight on Foton was  justified, because three priority A experiments could not be  performed with the capabilities provided by the BDPU. The  Microgravity Programme Board accepted this recommendation, and  the Executive has, in the meantime, started a Phase A/B study  for the FPF (as a LSF derivative), which will be concluded in  autumn 1993. It is intended to subsequently initiate the  development phase of the FPF in order to meet a launch on Foton  in the 1996 time frame.  <H5>  3.9.2 Floating Zone Stability Module </H5>   A European team of scientists (six laboratories from four  member states) proposed to develop a new fluid science facility  either for Foton or for Maxus, to investigate the stability of  non-axisymmetric liquid columns. The study/development of such  a facility would certainly obtain a high priority if no E1  mission with the AFPM as payload was to be realised.  <H5>  3.9.3 Breath Analyzer for MIR </H5>   The Breath Analyzer proposed here is derived from a  technological concept developed by a Danish company (Bruel &amp;  Kjaer) and is based on a combination of acoustic, infrared light  an paramagnetic measuring principles. Compared with the  Anthrorack mass spectrometer gas analyzer, the characteristics  of this new analyzer are compactness, low power consumption,  high stability and no vacuum requirement.    The new analyzer transforms gas concentrations to  acoustically detectable signals, and a highly sensitive  microphone can be used as transducer for gas analysis. This  transformation results in an alternating pressure obtained by  applying phased energy (IR light) to the gas molecules and by  choosing the pulsation frequency in the audible range. In the  frame of the ESA Technological Research Programme, a breadboard  model for space application was already built and showed similar  resolutions, apart from CO, as the Anthrorack mass spectrometer,  but was by a large factor smaller regarding mass, volume, and  power.    Since a gas analyzer is an instrument needed for monitoring  the astronauts' pulmonary and cardiovascular functions, but  which is not yet aboard MIR, it was proposed to develop the  flight model and associated support and data storage equipment  for the Euro-MIR-95 flight.  <H5>  3.9.4 BIB Incubator for MIR </H5>   The call for experiments for the Columbus Precursor missions  resulted in a large number of proposals (more than 80) in the  field of biology. The peer group evaluation of these biological  experiment proposals resulted in some 33 category-A proposals.  ESA examined which of these 33 experiments could be  accommodated in the BIB-MIR incubator, and found that it would  be possible for some 15- 20 of these category-A experiments to  be performed with this incubator, originally conceived for  flight on the Russian-British MIR flight.  <H5>  3.10 Torque Velocity Dynamometer (TVD) </H5>   NASA invited the Agency to participate in NASA Spacelab  Mission SLS-3. SLS.3 is a dedicated life sciences Spacelab  mission, which will be launched in the first quarter of 1996.  The objective of this mission is to study the effects of  microgravity on the musculo-skeletal system in the human body.  This mission will also encompass the CNES/NASA Rhesus Projects,  rodent experiments and an extended-duration orbiter medical  programme. The mission will last 16 days.    Although NASA had already selected its experiments related  to  studies in the human musculo-skeletal system, NASA had invited  ESA to participate in this mission by developing a research  facility, called Dynamometer, a facility for testing skeletal  muscle performance overall and for specific research into muscle  disuse atrophy. In return for ESA's contribution, European  scientists were invited to participate in this mission. ESA had  identified several experiment proposals from the Columbus  Precursor Missions which were rated as Category A and would  match the scientific objectives, both of the mission, and the  potential research hardware provided by ESA.    In particular, ESA plans to develop, together with industry,  the Dynamometer which can measure force, torque and velocity of  various human limbs/joints, in an adjustable and reproducible  way.    The Torque Velocity Dynamometer will be of central  importance  to the understanding of adaptation processes taking place in the  skeletal muscles during the "0-g immobilisation". The  quantification of the deconditioning in space with the help of  the TVD is new compared to the pre- and post-mission muscle  performance programmes carried out for the SLS-1, SLS-2 and D-2  missions. The TVD is also useful for studying and defining  countermeasures.    In order to comply with the very compressed SLS-3 schedule,  NASA has offered to support this TVD development in the areas of  safety aspects and Spacelab interface aspects, and to utilise a  recently qualified NASA portable computer for control and data  acquisition from the TVD. It is intended that the TVD hardware  will also be technically compatible with a Shuttle Middeck  accommodation.    In the medium term the TVD could also be flown on long  missions on the planned MIR-2 Space Station, where it would be  an interesting complement to the Breath Analyzer. During these  long-term missions it is important to maintain sufficient muscle  strength for the time of return to the 1g environment.  <H5>  3.11 Neurorack </H5>   NASA invited ESA and other space agencies to participate in  the Neurolab Spacelab mission (SLS-4) in 1998. The SLS-4  Neurolab mission is dedicated to studying fundamental  neuroscience questions and to studying mechanisms responsible  for neurological and behavioural changes that occur in space  flight.    In order to evaluate the best way for ESA to participate in  the SLS-4 mission, and in order to discuss the hardware  requirements of the European neuroscience community, ESA has set  up a Neurolab Science Team in February 1993. The preliminary  recommendation of the hardware ESA should study, is a Neurorack,  which is composed of an infrastructure similar to that of  Anthrorack, and which would provide the following services:    a) A central computer service unit, a Facility Support  Computer for:    -- Data acquisition and data transfer between involved  nodes;    -- Communication with peripheral micro-processors/computers  in connected or other Neurorack equipment;    -- Data Acquisition and power supply support of the existing  Anthrorack Plug-in Module (PIM) and Modular Support System (MSS);    -- Provision of two individual displays: One stationary and  one mobile, the latter connected to the rack by a flexible  data/power cable. The facility Support Computer accommodates  separate interface cards for support of specific interface  requirements.    b) Automated Blood Pressure Measurement System (ABP) derived  from Anthrorack (Finapres system);    c) A Remote Signal Conditioner Unit (RSCU) for support of  EMG, EOG, ECG, EEG, dynamometer (strain gauge)/potentiometer,  and temperature sensor;    d) A vestibulo-ocular interaction recording device;    e) Plug-in Module (PIM): For support of data  acquisition/power/status coming from rack-external equipment.    f) Modular Support System (MSS): For support of fully  integrated units, connected through the Modular Support system  (MSS) which may provide device control, data and power support  as well as data acquisition by the Facility Support Computer.    g) Video Colour Monitor (high resolution) for real-time  display of video images and other support functions.    ESA intends to initiate a Phase A study of Neurorack, which  is based on the recommendation of the Neurolab Science Team in  the near future. This study will also cover the scenario in  which an E1- Spacelab mission would not be funded, so that  Anthrorack hardware elements could become available for use in  Neurorack. This should enable to strongly increase the  capability of Neurorack.  <H3>  4. Programmatic Changes Introduced by the Transformation of  the Previous MG Programme (Extended Phase 2) into the EMIR-1  Programme </H3>   The changes/adjustments introduced when the Extended Phase 2  was transformed into the EMIR-1 Programme, (lasting until 1997),  are the following:    a) It is assumed that no Eureca reflight will take place  until 1997.    b) The EMIR-1 Programme will support the ESA MIR missions in  1994 and 1995, as far as the utilisation of existing French,  German and Russian experimental facilities onboard MIR are  concerned, and in the frame of EMIR-1 a breath analyzer, an  incubator, a freezer, a separation centrifuge, and other support  equipment will be developed/procured and operated on MIR.    c) The number of payload elements to be reflown on E1 or  equivalent missions will be increased by reflights of Biorack,  BDPU and CPF.    d) New facilities will be developed for the recently offered  NASA Spacelab missions SLS-3 and SLS-4:    -- A Torque Velocity Dynamometer for the SLS-3 mission which  is planned for early 1996;    -- A Neurorack for the SLS-4 mission planned for early 1998.    e) Additional funding has been allocated to develop, for  flight on the Russian retrievable carrier Foton, a Fluid Physics  Facility, FPF (which is derived from the former Liquid Structure  Facility), and a Floating Zone Stability Module (FZSM).    f) The funding of the Technology Support Programme will be  reduced and the resulting "saved" amount will be used to support  the microgravity experiments selected for the Euro-MIR 94 and  Euro-MIR 95 missions.    g) Additional funding has been allocated to cover the  mission  and utilisation costs for retrievable carriers such as Foton.  In particular the following flights are planned:    -- Biopan reflight in 1993 (September), 1994 and 1996;    -- Biobox reflights in 1994 and 1996;    -- Flights of the FPF and the FZSM in 1996;    -- Performance of materials sciences experiments using the  existing Foton and MIR furnaces.    h) The Phase B-Studies (detached design) for the  microgravity  facilities for the Columbus Attached Laboratory have been  blocked until the Columbus Programme is approved. This Phase  B-Study is the only Columbus Programme element which remains  within the EMIR-1 technical programme content.    i) The annual budget limitation of the EMIR-1 Programme  imposed by the Granada Council Meeting at ministerial level, of  88 MAU (1992 economic conditions), a sum which included the  blocked amount of 25.5 percent or about 24 MAU resulting from  the low subscription level of only 74.5 percent, has been  introduced. This means that for EMIR-1 a net annual budget of  about 64 MAU (1992 economic conditions) will be available, from  which all industrial development/refurbishment expenditure,  mission/flight costs, expenses for experts and consultants,  scientific working groups, peer groups, test facilities, science  teams and all ESA internal costs have to be paid.    The approved EMIR-1 Programme incorporates a high degree of  flexibility, enabling it to adapt to changes in related  programmes (i.g. Columbus Precursor Missions) and to allow for  timely adjustment to the emergence of new scientific results, or  scientific focusing, which might require a change in scientific  emphases.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kinyarwanda </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] According to the communique that has just been  issued by the Presidency after President Habyarimana's meeting  with Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu, President Habyarimana  reportedly informed Faustin Twagiramungu of his readiness to  preside over the swearing-in ceremonies on 24 March. However,  the communique shows that President Habyarimana has created new  obstacles. Among them we can mention those related to the  Liberal Party [PL] ministers and the question of the Islamic  Democratic Party [PDI] deputies. The other question raised by  President Habyarimana is that of the Coalition for the Defense  of the Republic [CDR].    Concerning the PL's minister, President Habyarimana is said  to have asked Faustin Twagiramungu to continue talks with PL  officials so that the justice ministerial post goes to the  faction which has five deputies, namely Mugenzi's [PL chairman  and Habyarimana ally] faction, claiming that this was agreed at  the meeting he chaired on 27 February. Now that President  Habyarimana has given an order to Twagiramungu, why does  Twagiramungu have to meet PL officials? This clearly means that  President Habyarimana is denying Faustin Twagiramungu the  freedom of choice that was bestowed on him by the Arusha peace  agreement. He is giving him orders on how to select and fill  posts. It is worth recalling that President Habyarimana  continues to torpedo the peace agreement. The agreement only  allows him to preside over the swearing-in ceremonies and not to  interfere with what does not concern him. Maybe he believes  agreements are still mere pieces of paper.    With regard to deputies, President Habyarimana went too far.  In the communique issued by the presidency, President  Habyarimana is said to have asked Prime Minister Agathe  Uwilingiyimana to ensure that hindrances to the inclusion of the  CDR in the National Assembly are removed. What can remove these  obstacles? First, the CDR has not signed the political parties'  code of ethics. One may recall how the CDR refused to sign that  code. It does not even qualify to sign the code since it is  against its contents.    Since the signing of the Arusha agreement, the CDR has been  promoting division and misunderstanding among Rwandans. In fact  it should be banned. However, it will die a natural death since  it owes its existence to the dictatorship. Once the  dictatorship disappears, the CDR will disappear because it will  have no platform and no audience. Habyarimana, who wants a seat  for the CDR in the National Assembly, should remember that we do  not need a transition to destroy the country, we need one to  build it. He is once again interfering in questions that do not  concern him. He is not responsible for the issue of deputies.    The same thing applies to the PDI. Habyarimana has asked  Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana to ensure that the PDI  deputy has the support of the party. He wants to do the same  thing he is doing in regard to the PL. The candidate who was  elected a long time ago [words indistinct] 37 days, would be  replaced by Habyarimana with one chosen recently with the help  of a small group of his supporters in the PDI. [passage omitted]    President Habyarimana's readiness to preside over the  swearing-in ceremonies on 24 March is no different from his  readiness to preside over the swearing-in ceremonies on the  other dates he suggested. Perhaps he hopes his wishes will be  respected through terror. These days he uses terrorism. He  showed it in the communique. He said he expressed his  dissatisfaction to Faustin Twagiramungu over the bad language  used in his address announcing the list of ministers. Judging  from the contents of the communique, one wonders whether  Habyarimana is really seeking to implement the Arusha agreement  or whether he just wants Rwandans' problems to remain. It is  clear that he is capable of this. No one will extricate  Rwandans from the current situation; they will have to do it  themselves.</p>

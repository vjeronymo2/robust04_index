			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["MOFERT Notice on Carrying Out State Asset Ownership </F> Registration" promulgated by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) on 5 October 1993]    [Text] The State Council General Office this March [1992]  relayed the "notice regarding the request for instruction by the  departments such as the National Administration of State  Property, on launching nationwide work in state assets ownership  registration in 1992," and made it clear that such work would be  launched in 1992. In May and July this year [1992], the  National Administration of State Property held and presided over  work conferences on state assets ownership registration, as well  as meetings making arrangements for registering assets ownership  in units directly under the central authorities. It also  printed and issued "Temporary Measures Governing State Assets  Ownership Registration" and "Procedures for Implementing the  Temporary Measures Governing State Assets Ownership  Registration," making concrete arrangements for registering  ownership over state assets. In order to do a good job in  registering ownership over state assets in economic and trade  enterprises, and to gradually form a system, the relevant  matters are hereby relayed as follows:    I. Strengthen leadership; improve understanding.    Various units must strengthen leadership over the work in  registering ownership of state assets, and seriously learn from  the State Council's "Notice on Strengthening Management of State  Assets" and "Temporary Measures Governing State Assets Ownership  Registration," as well as the procedures for implementation.  They must upgrade the understanding of the significance of  state assets ownership registration to protecting the integrity  of state assets and preventing state assets from draining, and  they must adopt effective measures in order to score real  results.    II. Registration domain.    1. The central economic and trade enterprises, enterprise  groups, jointly run enterprises, joint-stock enterprises,  collective enterprises run by state assets, and business units  with business licenses issued to legal persons for operating  enterprises, of various levels and directly under the Ministry  of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [MOFERT], must register  ownership of assets.    2. Foreign-funded enterprises, units under construction  (these units will register ownership of assets upon completion  of construction and opening for business), and the business  units which have obtained non-legal-person business licenses, do  not have to register ownership of assets at this moment.    3. The enterprises which have already registered ownership  of state assets for the 1992 fiscal year according to the State  Council's relevant regulations and based on their final accounts  of 1991, no longer have to register ownership of assets.    III. Registration of ownership of state assets in central  economic and trade enterprises will be organized and implemented  according to subordinate relations in financial terms.    1. Various corporations directly under MOFERT, China Foreign  Trade Center (Group), and China (Fujian) Foreign Trade Center  Group, must submit their ownership registration forms to MOFERT  for examination and verification, and to the National  Administration of State Property for examination and approval.    2. The subsidiaries of various corporations are to be  examined and verified by the corporations themselves, and  examined and approved by MOFERT centrally.    3. The branch offices of corporations, as well as other  units practicing independent auditing, are to be examined and  verified by the corporations themselves, and examined and  approved by MOFERT centrally.    IV. Regarding the work in registering ownership of assets in  enterprise groups.    1. The corporations which have already been established as  enterprise groups must still submit their asset ownership  registration forms to MOFERT for examination and verification,  and to the National Administration of State Property for  examination and approval.    2. The asset ownership registration form to be submitted by  an enterprise group should include the assets of enterprises at  close stratum [jinmi ceng 4868 1378 1461], that is, the form  should be filled in according to the total amount of assets of  the core enterprise and the enterprises at close stratum.    The enterprises at close stratum do not have to register  asset ownership individually, but must have their credit  standing verified (they must also fill in the forms registering  ownership of state assets, but the forms only have the function  of verifying credit standing), a thing to be done by the core  enterprises.    3. Regarding the enterprises at the loose stratum [songsan  ceng 2646 2414 1416], that is, the enterprises which have no  links or relations with a core enterprise in terms of assets,  but which have come into being due to business relations,  registration of assets ownership will be performed according to  their original subordinate relations.    V. For the enterprises registering assets ownership this  year [1992], the assets ownership registration forms should be  filled in according to their final accounts in 1991.    VI. The financial departments of various units are to be  responsible for the work in registering asset ownership within  the units.    VII. Registration of asset ownership divided into  categories.    On a natural basis, asset ownership registration is to be  divided into four categories: Opening, changing, canceling, and  inspecting business on yearly basis. A brief explanation is  given below.    1. Registration of opening of business: Newly opened  enterprises, the enterprises which have broken off from the old  ones and become independent legal persons, and the new  enterprises which are formed by merging, must perform  registration of opening of business.    2. Registration of changing of business: When some part of  an enterprise breaks off, when another enterprise is annexed by  the enterprise (merging), when subordinate relations in terms of  finance change, when increase or decrease in assets exceeds 20  percent including (20 percent) [as published], and when the  enterprise's address, economic nature, and representative of it  as a legal person changes, the enterprise must register the  change.    3. Registration of canceling of business: An enterprise  which is annexed, canceled, or goes bankrupt must go through  registration of cancellation.    4. Yearly inspection: All enterprises which are regarded as  independent legal persons must go through registration of yearly  inspection.    VIII. The assets ownership registration here mainly refers  to registration of yearly inspection. Registration of opening  of business, canceling of business, and changing of business  must be handled individually.    IX. After examination and verification, state assets  management departments will issue to enterprises "certificates  empowering enterprises to occupy and use state assets," relevant  regulations will be announced later.    X. This year's work in registering assets ownership will end  before the end of October. The asset ownership registration  forms of various corporations must be submitted to MOFERT before  30 September for examination and verification, and the asset  ownership registration forms of the enterprises which are  subordinate to various corporations must be submitted to MOFERT  before 10 October for examination and approval.    XI. Various corporations (enterprise groups) are requested  to seriously organize work in registering asset ownership within  their own systems. They may, according to the spirit of this  notice, formulate implementation procedures and supplementary  regulations for asset ownership registration within their  systems, and report to MOFERT for the record.    XII. After the conclusion of the asset ownership  registration work, MOFERT will join hands with the National  Administration of State Property in assessing and accepting the  work in registering assets ownership in various units under  MOFERT. The units and individuals who have a good performance  will be commended, and the enterprises and units which do not  work according to the regulations and which are irresponsible in  work will be notified and criticized, while those which have  serious problems will have their asset ownership registration  work and industrial and commercial registrations suspended.    Regarding how local economic and trade enterprises should  begin the work in registering ownership of state assets, the  departments in charge of economic and trade affairs in the  localities are requested to make decisions together with the  state asset management departments in the localities, and the  forms for registering state assets ownership may be filled out  according to this notice.

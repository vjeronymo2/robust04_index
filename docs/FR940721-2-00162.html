Purpose and Availability of Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this competitive area is to announce the anticipated availability of fiscal year 1995 funds for projects which assist Native Americans to assure the survival and continuing vitality of their languages. Approximately $1 million of financial assistance is anticipated to be available under this announcement for projects to promote the survival and continuing vitality of Native American languages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Category I, Planning Grants, the funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $50,000. For Category II, Design and/or Implementation Grants, the funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $125,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Congress has recognized that the history of past policies of the United States toward Indian and other Native American languages has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of Native American languages that have survived over the past five hundred years. Consequently, the Native American Languages Act was enacted (Title I, Public Law 101&hyph;477) to address this decline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This legislation invested the United States government with the responsibility to work together with Native Americans to ensure the survival of cultures and languages unique to Native America. This law declared that it is the policy of the United States to ``preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice, and develop Native American languages.'' While the Congress made a significant first step in passing this legislation in 1990, it served only as a declaration of policy. No program initiatives were proposed, nor any funds authorized to enact any significant programs in furtherance of this policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1992, Congressional testimony provided estimates that of the several hundred languages that once existed, only about one hundred and fifty-five (155) languages are still spoken or remembered today. However, only 20 are spoken by persons of all ages, 30 are spoken by adults of all ages, about 60 are spoken by middle-aged adults, and 45 are spoken only by the most elderly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to this testimony, the Congress passed the Native American Languages Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;524) to assist Native Americans in assuring the survival and continuing vitality of their languages. Passage of this law is an important second step in attempting to ensure the survival and continuation of Native American languages, as it provides the basic foundation upon which the Tribal nations can rebuild their economic strength and rich cultural diversity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Federal government recognizes that substantial loss of Native American languages has occurred over the past several hundred years, the nature and magnitude of the status of Native American languages will be better defined when eligible applicants have completed language assessments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administration for Native Americans (ANA) believes that responsibility for achieving self-sufficiency rests with the governing bodies of Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and in the leadership of Native American groups. This belief supports the ANA principle that the local community and its leadership are responsible for determining goals, setting priorities, and planning and implementing programs which support the community's long range goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, since preserving a language and ensuring its continuation is generally one of the first steps taken toward strengthening a group's identity, activities proposed under this program announcement will contribute to the social development of a native community and significantly contribute to its path toward self-sufficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

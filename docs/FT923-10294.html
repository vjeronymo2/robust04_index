			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Life Sciences bucks US trend with 10% increase to Pounds 8.5m Life Sciences International, the scientific instruments company, continued to buck the continuing recession in the US, its largest market, by reporting a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the half year to June 30. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 7.74m to Pounds 8.48m on sales of Pounds 50.7m, up from Pounds 39.5m. Mr Christopher Bland, chairman, said: 'In the first six months of the year we have experienced the toughest conditions since new management took over five years ago.' He reported a recent strengthening of demand in North American markets, which account for about two thirds of group sales. While European markets showed some signs of recovery, Mr Bland said the Japanese market remained sluggish. The issue of new shares to acquire Neslab, a New Hampshire temperature control company, and a higher tax charge, affected fully diluted earnings per share which edged up to 3.8p (3.7p). The interim dividend was increased from 1.15p to 1.2p.</p>

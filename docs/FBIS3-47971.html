The sixth party congress set forth the renovation policy and  created a turning point in the cause of socialist construction  in our country. The seventh party congress evaluated the  results of five years of carrying out the renovation process  according to the socioeconomic development platform and  strategy. It also put forth the orientations and measures for  conducting the renovation process in a far-reaching and uniform  manner.    The international situation has developed quickly and become  complicated since the seventh party congress. The socialist  regimes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have  collapsed. The independence and sovereignty of a number of  countries have been challenged by policies based on power and  imposition. The hostile forces are stepping up their activities  in a bid to undermine our people's cause of national  construction and defense. Once again, our revolutionary  undertaking is facing harsh challenges.    The international situation presents new opportunities,  however. The strength and determination to struggle for national  independence and sovereignty have been consolidated. The trends  of cooperation and development have prevailed in the world  community. The revolutionary forces have learned valuable  lessons from their temporary setbacks. The success of our  country's renovation policy has further consolidated our  people's strength and position, thus creating the conditions for  us to overcome difficulties and take advantage of good  opportunities to serve the cause of national construction.    Faced with new challenges and opportunities, our party and  people have adopted a firm political stance. The resolutions of  the party Central Committee's Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth  Plenums have concretized and further developed the line set  forth by the seventh party congress, resolving a series of  practical problems on the domestic and diplomatic fronts based  on actual international developments and real-life situations.  We have persisted in the renovation undertaking, accelerated  socioeconomic development, broadened the process of  democratization, firmly maintained political stability,  consolidated our national defense and security capabilities,  diversified our diplomatic activities, and gradually overcome  the impact of blockade and embargo.    The National Party Conference has the duty to assess the  implementation of the seventh party congress resolution and  evaluate the actual results of the renovation undertaking since  the sixth party congress. The objectives of this are to clarify  further a number of issues relating to the process of socialist  construction in our country and define major policies and  measures to implement the seventh party congress resolution  successfully and lead the revolutionary undertaking in our  country forward.    Part One: The situation concerning the implementation of the  seventh party congress resolution.    I. Achievements    1. The great achievement of primary importance is the  fact that we have succeeded in overcoming the socioeconomic  crisis to a very important extent.    The crisis began in the late 1970's and early 1980's. It  lasted for many consecutive years and became most serious from  1986-88, with inflation at a gallop. Another menace occurred in  1991. Thanks, however, to the great efforts of our party,  state, and people, our national economy not only held fast but  recorded outstanding achievements and overcame sluggishness and  recession. The economic growth rate has remained very high and  steady for the past three years.    Inflation was cut from 67 percent in 1991 to 17.5 percent  in 1992, and then to 5.2 percent in 1993. The GDP shows an  average annual increase of 7.2 percent, compared with the  1991-95 target of 5.5 to 6 percent.    Agricultural production has developed in a relatively  comprehensive manner. The food grain issue has been resolved  satisfactorily. The output of food grain in 1993 amounted to  nearly 25 million tons, thus exceeding the target for 1995.    Industrial production is growing at an average annual rate  of  13 percent, higher than the 8 to 10 percent target set in the  five-year plan for 1991-95.    The productivity of a number of important sectors and  products -- such as electricity, crude oil, steel, and cement --  has increased. The communications and liaison system has  expanded rapidly through the use of new equipment and technology.    Many sectors -- such as building, transport, trade, travel,  and other services -- have developed. The economy is undergoing  structural changes. A number of production and business sectors  have emerged.    Foreign economic relations have expanded, becoming more  diversified and multilateral. We have overcome the results of  the unexpected drop in trade with our traditional market,  broadened our trade exchanges with newer trading partners, and  increased our annual export volume by nearly 20 percent.    By the end of 1993, some 836 foreign investment projects had  been licensed, with a registered capital of $7.5 billion. We  have begun to attract more development aid and preferential  capital loans from various governments, and have normalized  relations with international financial and monetary institutions.    The economy has achieved some initial capital accumulation.  Although this is still small, a broad section of the population  has seen their lives improve. A multisector economic system is  taking shape. State firms are beginning to be rearranged and  re-registered. State firms with long histories of operational  losses have been reduced in large numbers, while the number of  state firms with effective operations has increased.    Generally speaking, the state-run economic sector is  continuing to develop. It controls key fields of activity and  is playing an essential role in the national economy. The  state-run economic sector's share of the GDP increased from 34  percent in 1990 to 39.9 percent in 1992.    Agricultural cooperatives have developed much clearer  orientations for renovation since the party Central Committee's  fifth plenum. The autonomous role of peasant households has  been affirmed. A number of new formats for economic cooperation  have emerged. The Land Act officially gave peasants the right  to the long-term and stable use of the land. This has helped  the peasant household-based economy gain momentum in  development. Individual economies and private capitalist  economies have developed remarkably. Share-holding and  partnership enterprises, which are attracting capital investment  from various forms of ownership, have emerged in increasingly  large numbers.    The market system, which is under state management along  socialist lines, is becoming a driving mechanism in the economy.    The amendment of laws and the continued renovation of  various  systems and policies on planning, pricing, the exchange rate,  finance, banking, labor, wages, and the land have created a more  favorable environment for various firms to develop dynamism,  self- motivation, and a sense of self-responsibility in  production and business. The state has accumulated more  experience and made progress in the macromanagement of the  national economy.    In parallel with economic development, the resolution of  various social issues and the implementation of various social  welfare policies have been given more attention.    Thanks to an increase in production and services, market  prices have become relatively stable and the lives of people in  various urban and rural areas have been improved. The number of  rich households has increased while the number of needy  households -- especially the number of underfed households --  has been reduced. The people's basic need for food and clothing  has been met in a more satisfactory way.    The construction of houses, roads, electrical facilities,  and  health establishments has developed in various rural and urban  areas.    Democratic rights -- especially economic democracy -- have  developed gradually. The people are free to work according to  the law. They feel more secure about putting their money into  production and business, thus creating more jobs.    Various policies -- such as the policy of tackling  unemployment; the policy of eliminating hunger and poverty; the  policy toward war invalids, families of fallen heroes, and  people who have performed meritorious deeds for the revolution;  the policy of providing assistance to disabled, helpless, and  homeless people; and the policy of helping needy students return  to school -- have been carried out satisfactorily.    Educational activities have made some progress in fighting  degradation, diversifying various educational formats,  rearranging the school network, consolidating the system of  specialized schools and selective classes, and building general  education schools for ethnic minority students. The  popularization of education has begun to develop satisfactorily.  Vocational training and the study of foreign languages and  computer technology have developed in various cities.    Science and technology have started to develop as a driving  force. Scientific and technological studies have been linked  with social requirements. Many research and application  projects -- especially in agriculture, fisheries, consumer  goods, and export goods -- have developed their practical value.  They have helped to increase economic results and improve  technological knowledge.    The system of state-level scientific study programs has  become more centralized, and for the first time has included  programs on social science and the humanities.    Cultural activities have become more lively. Cultural  exchanges with foreign countries have been expanded. Literary  and artistic works have become more copious in terms of content  and theme, and more diversified in terms of form, category, and  means of expression.    The information system has made new steps in development  with  the expansion of radio and television transmission coverage to  various districts throughout the country, including a number of  mountain and high-altitude areas and distant offshore islands.    Health care activities for the improvement of the people's  health have shown great progress in various fields, such as  preliminary health care, expanded immunizations, and the control  of epidemics and social diseases. Requirements for essential  medicine have been partially met. Physical education and sports  has achieved encouraging results.    Work on population and family planning has been carried out  correctly, leading to an increase in the number of people  voluntarily registering for the birth control program.    2. The second important achievement is the continuation of  political maintenance and consolidation. Because of our success  in many areas of renovation -- especially the socioeconomic  achievements, the party's skillful leadership, and the political  awareness of the country's people and soldiers -- we have  survived the recent international political shock. The party's  leadership role has been strengthened, the state's management  efficiency has been heightened, democracy has been broadened,  and national defense and security have been guaranteed. The  people's confidence in the party, state, and renovation  undertaking has increased and public movements for socioeconomic  improvement have developed.    After the seventh national party congress, our party --  especially the party Central Committee, the Political Bureau,  and the Secretariat -- accelerated party building work,  considering this to be a duty of crucial importance to the  entire revolutionary cause in our country and to our party. The  third party plenum confirmed that economic development is the  central duty and party building is the fundamental duty. It  clarified conceptions on party building work when the party is a  ruling party, and defined principles for the party's  organization and activities. It outlined the duties for  consolidating the unity and unification of the entire party. It  renovated and strengthened logical and ideological work and  consolidated the party organization system.    After more than a year of party building work, we have  improved and heightened our knowledge and responsibility toward  party committees and party members. We have rearranged the  party organization system and reestablished cadre committees to  oversee party committees and youth unions in state organs and  mass organizations. The function and role of grassroots party  organizations, together with their working procedures and  personnel management regulations, have been established. Party  principles -- especially the principle of democratic centralism  for the restoration of order and principles -- have been  executed. Party management and work attitudes have been  revamped in a more democratic, collective, and appropriate  manner to ensure close and efficient party leadership and expand  the positive role of state organs and mass organizations.    We have concentrated more on training and admitting new  party  members. In 1992, admission of new members increased by 39  percent over 1991. In 1993, it increased by 30.7 percent over  1992.    The party has continuously renovated its thinking and paid  more attention to logical and ideological work. It has  clarified concepts and principles for guiding the renovation  cause and has gained more leadership experience. Party cadre  have become more mature and active, and have gradually grown  accustomed to leadership and management work in the renovation  undertaking.    Our social democracy has made significant strides over the  past two years, together with the construction of a law-governed  state of the people, by the people, and for the people. The  most prominent event was the promulgation of the 1992  Constitution. That helped to institutionalize rapidly the  party's line on national construction along socialist lines.  The implementation of constitutional stipulations in the fields  of politics, the economy, culture, education, industry, security  and national defense, and the citizen's fundamental rights and  obligations -- together with the introduction of many new legal  documents and regulations -- have further accelerated the  democratization process in our social activities.    The Fatherland Front and mass organizations have diversified  their activities to broaden the national great unity block,  motivate the public to carry out its political duties,  accelerate social activities, provide good care for the people,  and protect their interests.    Mass motivation work has been given more attention by party  committees at different levels. Coordination between state  organs and the fatherland fronts and mass organizations has been  strengthened more than ever in motivating the public to take  part in law-building work; the planning of national policy; the  formation of local authorities; and the implementation of the  policies relating to the socioeconomy, security, and national  defense.    The armed forces, together with the public, have made many  efforts to accelerate the renovation cause in the areas of  national defense and security, and in developing their own  strengths. They have executed their duty to protect the  socialist fatherland; guarantee political stabilization; and  safeguard national independence, sovereignty, and integrity in a  satisfactory manner.    We have successfully implemented the great strategic  adjustment in national defense, reduction in military personnel,  and the strengthening of the universal defense system. We have  built regional defense networks in provinces and cities,  adjusted the strategy for national security protection, revamped  our military activities in the new situation, gained better  knowledge regarding the current situation, and become more  efficient in fighting the activities of hostile forces.</p>

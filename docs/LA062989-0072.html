			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. FINISHES FIRST PHASE OF REFURBISHING AT FERN DELL  </P> <P> Five years after community activists launched a fight to restore the Fern Dell  section of Griffith Park, the initial phase of a Los Angeles-supervised  refurbishment project has been completed. But city officials acknowledge that  the effort has dragged and that a significant portion of the repair work has  not begun.  </P> <P> This month, 14 prefabricated bridges were installed, replacing steel and wood  bridges that had become unsteady and unsafe. Railings were installed along the  footpaths in the canyon that borders Fern Dell Avenue at the entrance to the  park just north of Los Feliz Boulevard.  </P> <P> A bond issue approved by voters in 1984 provided $500,000 for the work on Fern  Dell. The state funds were allocated after a community group, Friends of Fern  Dell, spearheaded a drive for money to restore the canyon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Irrigation System  </P> <P> Still to be installed is a new $150,000 irrigation system. The ferns planted  throughout the mile-long stream bed and canyon have been dying in recent years  for lack of water.  </P> <P> The state funds do not include the cost of installing the system. That will be  paid by the city, but it is unclear when the complex of aboveground pipes will  actually be installed, said Joel Breitbart, assistant general manager for  planning and development for the city's Department of Recreation and Parks.  </P> <P> The repairs have been delayed several times.  </P> <P> The first time the proposal was up for bid, in 1985, the bids came in almost $1  million over budget, Breitbart said. City architects rewrote the plans to cut  costs.  </P> <P> Then in December, 1987, the Department of Recreation and Parks awarded a  $389,999 contract to Hacienda Landscape of Los Angeles to refurbish Fern Dell,  and city officials said construction could start almost immediately.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Safety Assessment  </P> <P> The work was held up for more than a year when inspectors at the Department of  Building and Safety requested a safety assessment of each bridge and each  bridge abutment in the dell.  </P> <P> Installation of the bridges finally began earlier this spring.  </P> <P> "There's been a feeling, and justifiably so, that this has taken a long time,  and certainly it has," Breitbart said. "Obviously, it could have gone better."  </P> <P> Lenore Levan, who organized Friends of Fern Dell, said she is disappointed that  the project -- a relatively minor one for the city -- has yet to be completed.  </P> <P> "Since we did get the money and it was started because the community was  interested, it really should be finished, and it shouldn't take five years to  be done," she said.  </P></p>

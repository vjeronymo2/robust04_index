			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Vosper Thornycroft to shed jobs at warship yard VOSPER THORNYCROFT, the smallest of the UK's four warship yards, is to cut its workforce by several hundred in the next six months after a lack of defence orders from the Royal Navy and from overseas. The job losses, believed to be about 350, will take place mainly between April and June and will be concentrated at the shipyard at Woolston, Southampton, which has a workforce of 1,900, and at another unit in Portchester, near Portsmouth. The cut has been caused by a delay in funding a fourth minehunter to be built for the Saudi Arabian navy and by postponement of the follow-up order for Sandown class minehunters for the Royal Navy. Mr Martin Jay, Vosper Thornycroft managing director, said yesterday: 'We are obviously very sad to have to make this announcement, but the reduced GRP (glass-reinforced plastic) workload forces us to take this step.' The announcement is another illustration of the troubles facing defence manufacturers as orders are cancelled or postponed in the wake of relaxation of tension between the west and the former Soviet bloc. The company hopes to avert further cuts by receiving the delayed Saudi order and by the confirmation of an ex-pected corvette order from Oman. It put in a bid for the frigate order announced by the Royal Navy earlier this month but lost to Yarrow Shipbuilders on Clydeside. The company says that in spite of redundancy costs and the reduction in GRP work, it is financially strong and is well-placed to win new business at home and abroad in its defence and civil markets. Mr John Simmons, chairman of the local Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said the yard was running out of new orders and it was up to the government to release work to maintain employment. 'Our main effort now will be to convince the government it has to change its mind on Royal Navy orders . . . You can't keep throwing people on the dole.' A lobby of parliament is planned next week to coincide with a debate of defence procurement. Anglo Great Lakes Corporation, one of only two UK producers of graphite electrodes for the steel industry, is to close its plant at Newburn, Newcastle, with the loss of 230 jobs. Mr Jim Munro, managing director, said yesterday a fall in demand from UK and continental steel producers and steep increases in UK electricity costs led to the decision. Mr Munro will meet Mr Doug Henderson, MP for Newcastle North and Labour's trade and industry spokesman, and trade union officials today at their request to see if closure can be averted. He said Great Lakes Carbon Corporation, the plant's American owner, had tried in vain to find alternative markets for Newburn products. Mr Henderson said: 'It is yet another example of a company going to the wall in the recession because of under-investment and a failure to compete in the European market. 'The gap in supply will apparently be met by competitors in Europe who are more productive.'</p>

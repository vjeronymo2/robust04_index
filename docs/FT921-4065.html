			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Arts: The Crackwalker - Gate, Notting Hill Theresa is fat, phlegmatic and plainly retarded. Not being retarded is Alan's sole asset; he shows meagre signs of growing up, has no skills, is prone to reliving his childhood nightmares and submerging them in drink. He worships Joe, a blustering lout who likes to beat up on his woman Sandy, especially when he's drunk, and that seems to turn her on more than anything else. Sandy is still just about pretty, but soured beyond hope. They all live in Kingston, Ontario. The Junior Chamber of Commerce there must have been dismayed by Judith Thompson's first play, a dozen years ago. Since then she has won national awards for other pieces, and the strengths of The Crackwalker whet one's appetite to see them. The language here is faithfully, repetitiously foul, without any of the low-life 'poetic' flights one feared. Yet these miserable, marginal characters reveal themselves in extra-lucid detail. When Joe pulls up stakes to go West, Al sets up house with poor 'Treeze' because she reminds him of the Madonna in school pictures. Treeze is happy to have her own Bay-bee Jesus, and her anxious social workers tell Al that he is a great father; but he declines into alcoholic paranoia, the baby proves sad and dim, and soon it meets a predictably horrid end. Sandy decamps to Calgary to continue her violent relations with Joe on a higher economic plane; she hopes Treeze will visit, one of these days. For respectable Canadian audiences, The Crackwalker must have offered something like the nasty revelations of Tobacco Road 50 years ago in the US. Thompson's people have no history, and are neither rebellious nor disappointed - merely baffled losers in a market-place where most people are managing much better. Each of them gets a direct-to-audience address, without milking for pathos, though Al's private horrors wrench the guts. Robert Bowman plays him with defenceless honesty, from abject Joe-worship through proud, nervous fatherhood to disintegration, and he captures perfectly the plaintive rising inflections of small-city Canadian. Kathy Burke's Treeze is a serene, clinically exact study, touching and appalling as she totes her dead baby 'to the graveyard' in a plastic toy-bag, placidly accepting the loss of a doll while looking around for a nice new boy-friend. Neil Dudgeon exposes vulnerable points in Joe's macho violence. Their accents come near enough, which matters in this starkly demotic stuff. For Sandy, Kathryn Pogson's comes from nowhere and her style of twitchy, would-be-metropolitan poise comes from the wrong side of the Atlantic. There is a fifth character, a wrecked Canadian Indian even more marginalised than the others, whom Kennetch Charlette (a real-life Cree) represents as weirdly detached, benign and desperate. The director James Macdonald keeps the action swift, unfussy and perfectly focused. Though the Gate's minuscule playing-area leaves a designer scant room to be clever, Ian MacNeil has contrived one flash of trompe-l'oeil.</p>

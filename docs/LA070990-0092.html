			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIXON LIBRARY DEBUT HAS YORBA LINDA ABUZZ  </P> <P> With Richard M. Nixon's presidential library set to open in his hometown here  in less than two weeks, signs of the big day are popping up all over.  </P> <P> A police riot squad has commandeered a preschool across the street as a base of  operations, to the dismay of some parents. The Secret Service has arranged to  take over a nearby real estate office so government agents can assume lookout  positions both inside and on the roof.  </P> <P> And the owner of a local ice cream shop plans to sell a special variety of cake  featuring Nixon's solemn likeness.  </P> <P> "We will also fly flags and have red, white and blue streamers," said Deloris  McConnell, owner of the Baskin-Robbins shop. "We're going to try and look like  we're interested."  </P> <P> Other local merchants plan to go all out for the July 19 dedication of the  Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace, with plans to sell Nixon necklaces,  Nixon T-shirts and even Nixon sandwiches.  </P> <P> City officials, meanwhile, are finishing up new parking lots and notifying  residents of road closures on opening day. With as many as 20,000 people  expected to turn out to see Nixon, President Bush and former Presidents Reagan  and Ford, city planners have decided to close off Yorba Linda Boulevard in  front of the library and turn it into a giant parking lot.  </P> <P> Unlike such cities as Anaheim and Buena Park, which are flooded with tourists  visiting amusement parks, Yorba Linda has little experience in dealing with  large crowds. The city of about 50,000 residents is so low-profile that it  doesn't have a single hotel or its own police department. Many of the guests  invited for the library opening will be staying at hotels in surrounding  communities.  </P> <P> City officials are confident, nevertheless, that they can handle the crowds and  the massive news media attention, which will include a live broadcast of the  "NBC Nightly News" anchored by Tom Brokaw from Yorba Linda on the library's  opening day.  </P> <P> "We feel real comfortable," said Roy Stephenson, Yorba Linda city engineer and  director of public works. "We've been planning a couple of months on this."  </P> <P> Since the library is near the intersection of two of Yorba Linda's biggest and  busiest streets -- Yorba Linda Boulevard and Imperial Highway -- traffic should  not be a disaster, said Assistant City Manager Bruce Channing. The city is also  opening three satellite parking lots from which to shuttle library visitors on  opening day, Channing said.  </P> <P> "We will have plenty of parking for all the people who want to come," Channing  said.  </P> <P> After consulting with Anaheim and other larger cities, Channing said Yorba  Linda designed a crowd control plan that began last week.  </P> <P> A vacant field across the street from the library, for example, was graded to  provide parking for security teams and other people working the event. City  crews also started posting orange signs on area roadways warning local  motorists of the July 19 road closures. Notices were mailed to residents who  live near the library, advising them of the restrictions.  </P> <P> Roads in a triangular area bounded by Yorba Linda Boulevard on the south,  Imperial Highway on the northeast and Valley View on the west will be closed to  all but residents and patrons of businesses within that area between 8 a.m. and  3 p.m.  </P> <P> The Brea Police Department, which contracts with Yorba Linda to provide police  coverage for the city, last week arranged to take over Yorba Linda Preschool  &amp; Daycare across the street from the library on opening day, school  officials said.  </P> <P> Jon Langston, the school administrator, said police want the building for,  among other things, its restroom. With so much police commotion, Langston said  he decided to cancel classes that day for the school's 60 children.  </P> <P> "A few parents were not very happy, but we offered to give them a day's  credit," Langston said.  </P> <P> Brea Police Lt. William Lentini said his officers will use the school as a  place to cool off and rest between stints at crowd and traffic control. About  150 Brea officers will be assisting the U.S. Secret Service in providing  security for the event.  </P> <P> "We're prepared to have a large crowd but a good crowd," Lentini said.  </P> <P> Secret Service officials last week also arranged to use offices of the  Prudential near the library as a base of operations, according to officials of  the 50-employee realty company. Although the company intends to remain open for  business on the big day, armed agents will be prowling the premises, positioned  behind tinted glass and atop the roof, said Jerry Best, a real estate agent  there.  </P> <P> "It will definitely not be business as usual," Best said.  </P> <P> Secret Service officials declined to comment on any details of their security  preparations.  </P> <P> "Yes, we do make preparations for a presidential visit," said Joseph Perez,  assistant special agent in charge of the Secret Service office in Los Angeles.  "But we don't make (public) specifics regarding a plan."  </P> <P> A few other businesses in the vicinity of the library will be closed on opening  day because of the difficulty in negotiating the crowded streets and parking  lots.  </P> <P> "We're planning to stay as far away as possible," said Janet Frazier, a  receptionist at Michael Frazier Architects in the three-story Yorba Linda  Packing House office complex across the street from the library. "There'll be  too many people that day."  </P> <P> Diane Scheiffler, leasing officer for the 42-business complex, said many of the  businesses are waiting until Tuesday -- when they are scheduled to meet with  city officials for more information about the Nixon dedication -- to decide  whether to close or not.  </P> <P> "We're trying to get the tenants to stay open because once it (the dedication)  is over, we think we will get some business," Scheiffler said.  </P> <P> Although some business will be lost that day, Yorba Linda Chamber of Commerce  President Harry Elliott said the overall disruption would be negligible.  </P> <P> "It will be a disruption for four hours on one day out of 365," Elliott said.  "It's not going to hurt anybody. In fact, it will help gas stations,  restaurants and shopping centers. In addition to that, people walking to and  from their cars will have an opportunity to do a little window shopping."  </P> <P> Among the beneficiaries of the Nixon dedication will be a nearby Family Fitness  Center, where manager Chris Kolb said he has already gotten calls from people  in San Francisco and Los Angeles wanting to use the club's workout facilities  after attending the dedication.  </P> <P> So far, no celebrities or political bigwigs have inquired -- just regular  members of the national fitness center chain who don't want to miss exercising  that day, Kolb said.  </P> <P> Anticipating a rush of business, the Chili's Grill &amp; Bar on Yorba Linda  Boulevard is doubling its staff and opening a half-hour early on the dedication  day.  </P> <P> "We're really excited," said Chili's manager Nancy Tooke.  </P> <P> Across the street in the Yorba Linda Station Plaza shopping center, the 30  businesses in the complex are stocking their shelves with Nixon souvenir items,  said Joy Miedecke, head of the merchants' association and owner of the Teddy  Bear Station shop.  </P> <P> "In our shop, we have designed a T-shirt of a Teddy Bear that has one hand with  Nixon's famous peace sign and the other with an American flag," Miedecke said.  "We're also going to have a Nixon Teddy Bear necklace."  </P> <P> Fernanda's Italian Cuisine is also modifying its menu to reflect a presidential  theme. Fernanda Capraro, the restaurant's owner, said she plans to serve a  Nixon sandwich, although as of Friday she was still not sure what it would be.  </P> <P> "I am trying to find out what kind of sandwich he (Nixon) likes the best,"  Capraro said. "We are going to try and make it very presidential."  </P> <P> However, on streets surrounding the nine-acre library grounds, residents were  making no special preparations for the big day.  </P> <P> "We're going to sit in the back yard and watch it," said Kathy Bigonger, 29, a  housewife whose Park Place home abuts the library property.  </P> <P> "As long as I've got my parking space, I'll be OK," added Ken Stack, 36, an  animator who lives on the same street.  </P> <P> Although one female resident grumbled about the upcoming event being "a real  pain in the butt," most residents interviewed said they looked forward to all  the activity.  </P> <P> "I voted for Nixon three times, so I'm going to like it," said Radka Egan, 67,  a retiree who lives on Eureka Avenue. "I think it's going to be beautiful."  </P></p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Management: How to make your mark in Germany A cross-border deal loomed; the Americans were flying in. But Volkert Klauke, head of corporate finance at the Price Waterhouse accountancy firm in Germany, was worried about letting his American colleagues loose in Frankfurt without an elementary briefing on the differences between Anglo-American and Germanic corporate culture. Klauke, who joined PW last year after 10 years with Deutsche Bank in New York, met the American team at the airport. Before they were allowed to meet the client - or leave the airport - he gave them a lecture on how to succeed with German businessmen. Here are Klauke's observations and some practical do's and don'ts: The adage that time equals money is taken more seriously in Germany than elsewhere: time is valuable and is rationed out extremely carefully. The more important the businessman, the more difficult it will be to gain access to his time. As Klauke puts it: 'The importance of people is expressed in terms of their limited availability'. Diaries are plotted out months in advance. In some big German companies, board directors do not see each other without making an appointment first. It follows that being late for a meeting is more than an impropriety: it is an insult. And it means that off-the-cuff meetings are out of the question: you cannot ring up and say: 'Hi, I'm in town. How about a chat?' Klauke says it is far better to write with a request weeks, if not months, in advance. Do not try to change a schedule at short notice. Germans observe a strictly linear approach to problem solving, says Klauke. They will seize upon one problem and work on it step by step until it is solved, rather than tinkering with a dozen problems at once and advancing them all at the same time. 'Never give a German a whole lot of problems to solve at once,' says Klauke. German businessmen are highly sensitive to infringement of their personal space. 'Space is at a premium here because there isn't much of it,' observes Klauke. Open plan offices are rare and German executives fence themselves in from each other behind solid, shut doors. Do not burst into an office, and once in there 'don't grab a chair and sit down wherever you feel like. Don't slouch all over a chair and don't try and rearrange the furniture,' Klauke cautions. Personal relationships are the basis on which business is done in Germany, but they are exceedingly difficult to forge. Klauke says that it would be unlikely that an employee of a German company would be invited to a colleague's home until he or she had worked there for at least two years. The only way to make friends with colleagues outside work is to play sport. If you are too old, become involved in the arts world. In this way you build the relationships and the trust which will, over the long-term, bear fruit. This is one cause of Germany's fabled long-termism: businessmen have a view to a lifetime working with each other. This makes it difficult for non-Germans to be really successful in Germany, unless they are there for life. Klauke cites the story of his near-neighbour in a salubrious suburb of Frankfurt where many main board directors of German companies live. The neighbour is the head of an American investment bank. 'You drive past his house every day and after a while notice that he's often away during the week, and he's rarely there at weekends at all,' Klauke says. 'You realise that he doesn't like living in Germany very much. It's unlikely that he'll stay here for long. Germans think: why should we do business with him if he's not going to be around in five years or so. 'He won't be around to live with the consequences of his own advice.'</p>

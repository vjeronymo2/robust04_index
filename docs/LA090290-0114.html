			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RABBI HIER  </P> <P> As a survivor of the Holocaust in Poland, I must say that Rabbi Marvin Hier  ("The Unorthodox Rabbi," July 15) is a hard-core realist.  </P> <P> He is quite aware that centuries of anti-Semitism, inspired by Christianity,  culminated in the Holocaust and cannot be erased with a smile and a handshake.  Every type of anti-Semitism, anywhere in the world, is a seed for future  Holocausts.  </P> <P> Rabbi Hier is a contrast to all those moderate and liberal present-day Jewish  leaders who unfortunately are infected with hypocrisy and who deceive  themselves that we have friends waiting for us everywhere. We need more leaders  like Rabbi Hier.  </P> <P> LEO BACH  </P> <P> Cerritos  </P></p>

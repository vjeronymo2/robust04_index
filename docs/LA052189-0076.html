			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTRODUCING: HUSKY 'NU-FOLK' TONES OF INDIGO GIRLS  </P> <P> Artist: Indigo Girls.  </P> <P> History: Back in Atlanta, Amy Ray and Emily Saliers first sang as a duo at a  high school PTA show, harmonizing on the sensitive hits of James Taylor and  Elton John. Moving on to the English-lit-fed climes of Emory University, the  two began to take their own "nu-folk" writing more seriously. Their  post-dropout debut album doesn't include Taylor or John, but does boast some of  the Hothouse Flowers, and all of R.E.M., those fellow Georgians who invited the  Girls to open most of their latest arena tour. College radio play has gotten  the record off to a fast sales start; just wait until the Tracy Chapman crowd  discovers it.  </P> <P> Sound: The two voices here are distinguishable only to a careful ear. Ray and  Saliers both have lovely altos, warm and husky, that can glide up to the higher  notes or swoop around each other as they sing verses and choruses in the round.  Both write solid, melodically rich, acoustic-based material; if they both also  have a tendency to overextend themselves lyrically, write it off to youth.  Saliers (whose father is a theology professor) tends to pen the headier  material, full of religious imagery, while Ray comes up with earnest, tortured  love songs. "Closer to Fine," the single, is pretty close to fine itself with  its distinctly '60s, Dylan-meets-the-Everlys hooks.  </P> <P> When: Monday and Tuesday at the Roxy, Wednesday at the Bacchanal, Thursday at  Bogart's.

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Banker warns on German inflation GERMAN inflation, at 4.3 per cent, is still too high to allow the Bundesbank to cut interest rates, according to criteria laid down by a leading banker in Bonn yesterday. Mr Friedel Neuber, chairman of the Westdeutsche Landesbank, the biggest Land (state) bank in Germany, said the German economy would recover during the year and the Bundesbank would be able to ease interest rates a little. However, the timing of the reduction depended mainly on developments in prices and pay. 'An inflation rate of 4 per cent cannot be tolerated,' he added. His comments followed an announcement from the federal statistics office that a 0.6 per cent rise in consumer prices last month had pushed annual inflation in west Germany to 4.3 per cent, compared with 4 per cent in January. The climate in the current pay round is also unpromising, with most unions claiming around 10 per cent. However, banking workers, who have disrupted business for the past two weeks with scattered strikes in pursuit of their 10.5 per cent demand, showed signs yesterday that they would accept the employers' offer of renewed talks. Public service unions, meanwhile, launched a threatened wave of warning strikes with a demonstration by 500 workers in Berlin. Claiming a 10.5 per cent increase, the 2.3m workers have been offered 3.5 per cent by federal and state employers. IG Metall, representing around 4m engineering employees, meanwhile said that the Gesamtmetall employers' association was on a catastrophe course. Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, Gesamtmetall's president has suggested that a maximum of 2 per cent would be 'economically reasonable.' The union is claiming 9.5 per cent. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday promised to maintain strict budget discipline, rein in federal spending and reduce the state deficit.</p>

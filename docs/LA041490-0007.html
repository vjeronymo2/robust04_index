			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN'S ABILITY TO SERVE  </P> <P> Regarding the recent article (Metro, April 1) concerning the physical condition  of Councilman Gilbert Lindsay, followed by your editorial (April 3) urging him  to resign:  </P> <P> Lindsay, after only a brief convalescence, returned to regular attendance at  the City Council, but on a reduced schedule prescribed by his doctor to aid his  more rapid recovery. Gil has now completed the first phase of his post-stroke  therapy, and is soon to commence a second phase, which it is predicted will  restore him to nearly his pre-stroke vigor.  </P> <P> The reaction of some, publicly and privately, to Gil's current disability, has  varied. Understandably, there are those who have been waiting in the wings for  many years as he has passed his 70th birthday, then his 80th, and now  approaches his 90th, waiting for him to retire to open the seat for "new  blood." To those the disabilities caused by his stroke give an opening to  demand his resignation now which may become moot if he continues to improve  through his new therapy. They tend to lay aside the fact that the road back  from stroke is difficult, and is not traveled in a day.  </P> <P> We should not be so ready to abandon those of advanced age who have served so  well for so long as Gil has and who still has the ability to recover to the  point of nearly full participation.  </P> <P> There is another point to be made as well, which has to do with the word  "democracy," the right of the people to choose their own representatives, and  the duty of the chosen to serve. In 1988 Gil suffered his stroke. In 1989 there  was an election in the 9th District, and Gil's opponents made a major point of  the disability caused by his stroke. Gil won overwhelming reelection to a term  that lasts until July 1, 1993.  </P> <P> Gil Lindsay is the elected representative of the people of the 9th District,  and he has not only the right but the duty to remain in office for the balance  of his term.  </P> <P> ARTHUR K. SNYDER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

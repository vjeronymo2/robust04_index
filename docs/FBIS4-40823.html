			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow June 20 ITAR-TASS -- A delegation from the  lower house of the Russian parliament led by Duma Chairman Ivan  Rybkin returned home from Berlin on Monday.    On Sunday, Rybkin addressed representatives of the Berlin  assembly of deputies in the castle of Charlottenburg. He said  Russia and Federal Germany were both in the process of renewal,  which, despite many differences, was much alike in both  countries. This is particularly true about east Germany, which  opens perspectives for cooperation and interaction.    Rybkin stressed that "cooperation with Germany is of great  importance for us in the period of complex economic changes in  Russia".    According to Reinhard Fuehrer, deputy chairman of the Berlin  assembly, the visit of the Russian delegation is seen by the  German side as a contribution to the development of current and  the beginning of new contacts between the two states at the  parliamentary level.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Share option tax change THE BUDGET contains a change intended to remove a possible disincentive to companies wishing to set up approved share option schemes. The change is to the tax treatment of capital gains which may arise on the grant of share options by companies to their employees under approved share option schemes. The proposal is that the amount of the capital gain on which the company is chargeable to tax in these circumstances should be the amount, if any, actually paid for the option by the employee. The proposed change applies to share options granted under approved share option schemes on or after yesterday.</p>

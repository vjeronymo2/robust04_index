Prior to the implementation of the manufacturers bubble program, EPA will prepare a statistical showing that the aggregate effect of the specified averaging time is consistent with attaining the ozone NAAQS and satisfying applicable progress requirements on a typical summer day basis in accordance with the proposed economic incentive program rules and guidance (see 58 FR 11110, February 23, 1993). However, EPA is also considering annual, monthly, and flexible compliance periods, and is soliciting comment on the appropriateness of the duration of these compliance periods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also soliciting comments on establishing a single VOC content limit for all industrial and commercial solvents and coatings, which would be the level that a manufacturer's sales weighted average must be less than or equal to in order to be in compliance. This option differs from the averaging scheme discussed above in that instead of having several VOC content limits for each source subcategory that would be used to determine if a manufacturer was in compliance, a single VOC content limit for all industrial and commercial coatings and solvents would be established. Manufacturers products would have to be less than or equal to this content limit, on average, in order to comply with the rule. This option is exhibited mathematically in following formulas:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,w159,d135 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=92 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSEP05my94.001 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Where:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> N=Number of Products; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i=Product Index; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOCC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> i <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> =VOC content of product i; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SW <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> i <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> =sales weight of product i <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> S <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> i <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> =sales of product i <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> i <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> =Content Standard for the ith product; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A manufacturer will be in compliance if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Average Emissions&gt;Average Content Standard <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> That is, if average emissions are less than or equal to the content standard, the manufacturer is in compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the proposed manufacturers bubble rule provides compliance flexibility for manufacturers with several products, requiring manufactures that produce only one solvent or coating to meet content limits could put them at a disadvantage. Because of this, EPA is soliciting comments on options to ease the regulatory burden on manufacturers with one product. Specifically, EPA is considering the following options:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Including these manufacturers despite the competitive disadvantage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Excluding these manufacturers from the rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Raising the minimum size manufacturer that would be subject to the rule for these manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Recordkeeping and reporting. To demonstrate compliance, EPA will require manufacturers subject to this proposed manufacturers bubble rule to submit documentation to EPA. This documentation will be submitted in two parts. The first part will be a plan describing what products the manufacturer intends to market during that compliance period, the VOC content of each product, an estimate of their sales during the compliance period, and how the manufacturer intends to conclusively show what the sales of those products during the compliance period actually were. EPA will review this plan for completeness and the viability of the proposed sales reporting method. EPA will approve or disapprove this submission within the 90 days of the compliance period. In the case of an incomplete submittal or disapproval, EPA will notify the submitting manufacturer of the deficiencies, and will require another submittal before the end of the second quarter of the compliance period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

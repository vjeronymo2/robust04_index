			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Package tours from abroad 'need updating' PACKAGE tours to the UK must be updated to cater for the growing number of visitors who demand greater flexibility and variety, the Henley Centre for Forecasting says. The UK attracted 2.3m package tourists in 1990, about 29 per cent of all visitors to Britain. Last year's figure was 1.9m, down because of the Gulf War. The centre's report says such packages are increasingly unsuitable for tourists who have visited the UK before. The report says the traditional low-cost package trip appeals to inexperienced travellers who lack confidence in dealing with foreign cultures. Traditional packages should be used to encourage tourists from new markets in eastern Europe and south-east Asia. Experienced travellers with the confidence to discover the country for themselves need different arrangements, the report says. Inbound Tourism: A Packaged Future.

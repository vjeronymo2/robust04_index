			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Burmah cheer Optimism ahead of the results from Burmah Castrol proved thoroughly justified as the group announced profits above most analysts' expectations, figures which drove Burmah shares up to their best level for more than nine years. Burmah's net income came in at Pounds 90.2m, well above the most optimistic forecasts, as was the dividend. Most analysts pencilled in a current year forecast of Pounds 100m-plus, following what was described as a very successful post-results meeting. Burmah shares, among the market's best performers in the past week, closed 18 higher at 750p, after touching 757p. British Petroleum shares continued to lose ground, with the market reacting to hints that a possible blockbusting rights issue may be in the process of being put together by City merchant banks. It was hinted that the derivatives market had picked up the scent of an exceptionally large put trade in the making. A record-breaking rights issue at BP has long been mooted, although many analysts take the view that a massive call on shareholders could still be at least a year away. At the close of trading BP were 6 weaker at 297 1/2 p with 10m shares dealt. Recent weakness in Lasmo shares, triggered by what has been seen as a poor response by institutions to a recent series of post-results presentations, was arrested as a number of big funds were said to have switched from Enterprise into Lasmo. The latter edged up 2 1/2 to 158p on 3.7m traded, while Enterprise weakened 12 to 506p.</p>

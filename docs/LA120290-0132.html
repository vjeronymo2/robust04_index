			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV BARS MILITARY SEPARATISM BY REPUBLICS  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, warning that his country's defense capabilities  are under threat, decreed Saturday that rebellious Soviet republics no longer  can be allowed to challenge Moscow's military policy, particularly by  interfering with conscription.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's decree came in reaction to attempts by governments in the Soviet  Union's 15 constituent republics to establish their own armies or to limit the  military service of their youth to their own territory.  </P> <P> It was his latest step in a concerted effort to appease the 4-million-member  armed forces, which have complained ever more vocally in recent months that  they are losing public respect and that the government tolerates far too much  from upstart local leaders.  </P> <P> But in another move certain to anger the military, leaders of the three Baltic  republics, meeting Saturday in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, formally  urged Soviet "occupation forces" to withdraw from their territory and said  civilians will protest their presence as long as they remain.  </P> <P> "We also urge the officers of the Soviet Union never to raise their weapons  against our peaceful citizens," said the resolution, signed by the presidents  of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.  </P> <P> The Baltic leaders were responding in part to a decree Gorbachev issued Tuesday  authorizing soldiers to use force if attacked. Arms depots have been repeatedly  raided by militants seeking arms in the southern Soviet republics of Armenia,  Azerbaijan and Georgia, and protesters in the Baltics have attempted several  blockades of military areas.  </P> <P> The trigger for Saturday's decree, however, appeared to be the decision last  month by the Parliament of the Ukraine that the republic's soldiers would serve  only within the republic. The Ukraine provides nearly 20% of Soviet soldiers,  including a large proportion of noncommissioned officers,  </P> <P> "All this has a negative effect on the formation of the personnel of the Soviet  armed forces," Gorbachev's decree said. "It threatens vitally important issues  of the Soviet state's defense capability."  </P> <P> The turnout for the draft this year has been miserable, according to recent  reports, with only small proportions of draftees showing up in Armenia, the  western Ukraine, the Baltics and other areas where nationalist sentiment runs  high.  </P> <P> Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, in a newspaper interview published Saturday,  complained particularly about the Baltic governments. He said they encourage  their youths not to serve and are "seeking open confrontation with the troops  of the Baltic military region."  </P> <P> The Parliament of Latvia voted Nov. 14 to cut off services to the army bases in  the republic to encourage the troops to leave.  </P> <P> "Winter is beginning, and they threaten us: 'We'll cut off the light, heat and  water,' " Yazov told Komsomolskaya Pravda, the youth newspaper.  </P> <P> The defense minister said he is even more concerned, however, about republic  laws on territorial armies and the formation of local, technically illegal  militias.  </P> <P> "They gather the kids in some kind of bands, without any discipline, without  any order," he said. "They try to get weapons, by stealing, robbing or attacks  on warehouses. Is this how armies are formed?  </P> <P> "I'm most concerned that young people are becoming the hostages of ambitious  politicians who don't realize what will come tomorrow."  </P> <P> Armed militias in Armenia submitted to a new, nationalist government this year  only after an armed standoff and prolonged negotiations. Moldova, a small  republic in the southwest splintered by ethnic unrest, has similar renegade  groups.  </P> <P> The popular governments of the Russian Federation, the Ukraine, Byelorussia and  the Baltic republics all claim the right to their own armies or at least home  service for their youths.  </P> <P> Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the radical new president of Georgia, announced last week  that his republic should have not only its own army but its own Black Sea  fleet.  </P> <P> To stop such demands, Gorbachev's decree invalidated all republic laws that  contradict the Soviet constitution, which allocates defense functions to the  central government.  </P></p>

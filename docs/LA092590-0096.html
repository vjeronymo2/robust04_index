			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABOR: DEMOCRACY GAINS IN TEAMSTERS  </P> <P> Three court-appointed administrators with enormous power over the  scandal-plagued Teamsters Union have made remarkable progress in their effort  to democratize the giant organization and eliminate the pervasive influence  that organized crime has had on it for nearly half a century.  </P> <P> The gains have not come easily. The international officers have been waging an  expensive legal fight to block almost every move the outside administrators  make -- even those moves most of the officers themselves liked and had agreed  to accept last year in a court consent decree.  </P> <P> It is unclear why the top officers decided to spend millions of the union's  dollars vainly fighting the administrators, who several officers privately  admit are generally doing a good if costly job.  </P> <P> Some say the legal battle has been pushed by the union's feisty president,  William McCarthy, who was infuriated by the presence of the administrators. But  most of the Teamsters' 18 highest officers, including McCarthy, signed the  unprecedented consent decree to avoid court trials of a few of them on  corruption charges and the rest on charges that they permitted corruption in  the union.  </P> <P> The administrators were empowered to oust corrupt leaders, including those  found to have underworld ties; to supervise operations of the union, and to  conduct scrupulously honest elections. Much of their goal has been achieved.  </P> <P> Now several of the officers have quietly joined forces to implement a plausible  plan they hope will retain the gains made under the administrators and still  help them keep their well-paid positions.  </P> <P> The informal inside group is said to be willing to continue cleaning up the  union by creating an ethical practices committee under the effective  court-appointed investigating officer, Charles Carberry.  </P> <P> The group is also reportedly ready to continue government-conducted elections  of local union delegates to the international conventions, probably with the  second administrator, Michael Holland, who is now doing it under the consent  decree. However, they want to scrap their previous acceptance of a secret  ballot referendum procedure that would give each of the 1.4 million members the  chance to vote directly for top union officers. They expect that delegates to  next summer's convention will reject the referendum, unless the court  intervenes.  </P> <P> First, though, they have to quell the furious power struggle raging among the  officers and reach a consensus on a candidate for the presidency and a single  slate of candidates for the other top offices. They expect to achieve their  unity goal before the union's international executive board meets in two weeks  in Palm Beach, Fla.  </P> <P> If they can unite their forces and scuttle the referendum, they will reduce the  already slim chance of a victory by Ron Carey, the dissident reform candidate  whose hope for success rests in part on a continued split among the current  leaders and on his vigorous, direct appeal to the members.  </P> <P> Even without new, attractive leaders like Carey, the union is not what it was a  year ago when the administrators were appointed by U.S. District Judge David  Edelstein.  </P> <P> Carberry, the administrator named to clean up corruption, has taken action  against 40 officials at the national and local levels, and his cleanup effort  is continuing. Half of the members of the old executive board have either been  removed or left voluntarily.  </P> <P> Although government investigators say some remaining officials are still linked  to the underworld, the grip that mobsters had on the union has been badly  weakened and will soon be broken entirely if the cleanup continues.  </P> <P> The other encouraging news comes from Holland, the administrator in charge of  democratizing the union. He says the procedure now being used to elect  delegates to the Teamsters' convention next July is "the best I have ever  seen."  </P> <P> Judge Edelstein said the election system that Holland put in place means "the  coming of the light of freedom to this dark union."  </P> <P> Carey agrees, saying the system for electing convention delegates is "honest,  and now it is up to the members to elect him and make sure corruption is never  again tolerated in the Teamsters, as it has been for so long."  </P> <P> He is struggling, though, to defeat the attempt to kill the promised referendum  election and instead allow delegates to elect officers at the convention in  Orlando, Fla., next June 24-28.  </P> <P> Like almost all unions, the Teamsters have traditionally elected their officers  at conventions. Carey and others say that may be fine for other unions but not  for Teamster conventions, which have always been dominated by local officers,  who are delegates because of their positions.  </P> <P> The local officers are strongly influenced by entrenched national leaders whose  power stems from their ability to dole out jobs and other forms of patronage.  </P> <P> However, even in fairly conducted elections, delegates are expected to once  again include most of the local officers because they seem to be popular with  their own members.  </P> <P> McCarthy, 71, has indicated that he wants to keep his job, but that won't be  easy if the inside group can agree on a consensus candidate. McCarthy  apparently isn't being considered.  </P> <P> Among several incumbents said to be in the running are vice presidents Arnie  Weinmeister, Walter Shea, R. V. Durham, Mike Riley and Weldon Mathis, the  union's general secretary, who narrowly lost to McCarthy in 1988, when the  executive board named a successor to the late Jackie Presser.  </P> <P> But neither the public fight for power that is so rare in the Teamsters nor the  move to back out of the nationwide referendum can diminish the impressive gains  already made to reform the country's largest union.  </P></p>

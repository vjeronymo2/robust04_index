			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (4): A selective approach to training - Case Study / British Telecommunications For Britain's largest companies, training is an enterprise in its own right. And for none is that more so than British Telecommunications (BT), which currently employs around 1,500 people in its development and training divisions BT is in the throes of a big reorganisation of its training capabilities, seeking to apply four principles commonplace in theory but less widely observed in practice. Namely: greater use of outsourcing. BT exists to provide telecoms services, not training. It already contracts out a fair slice of its senior executive development, but the rest - including most of the technical and sales and marketing training vital to its performance - is still done by trainers employed by the company. 'Until now, we have tended to train in-house, and only go outside for more senior levels where the need is to mix with a peer group and bench-mark with other company's executives,' says Jan Davis, BT's development and training adviser. 'Now we are considering greater use of outside trainers.' centralised purchasing and quality control. Until now, line managers have had control of most of BT's training budget. Employees have been directed - or self-directed - to courses chosen from an a la carte list, often organised by trainers attached to BT's operating divisions. From July, a central supply management unit will advise on all external purchasing of training and certify courses for all divisions. 'We were in the laissez faire cafeteria approach to training where you chose what you wanted,' says Ms Davis. 'Now we intend to have far more rigorous monitoring of inputs and outputs with a more selective approach tied to company needs.' a unified development and training organisation. BT currently has two separate training divisions, one for management development, the other (and far larger) for technical and function-related training. From this July the two will be brought together into a single structure. But the plan is for unified management, not for centralisation of the training itself. BT's existing main training centres - primarily at Kent's Hill, Milton Keynes for management development and commercial training, and Stone in Staffordshire for technical training - will be retained. Indeed, the plan is to shift more of the actual training nearer the customer base, concentrating resources on work-based activities rather than residential courses. coherent training programmes. For more technical staff, training requirements are generally fairly obvious. In the management and broader work skills arena, however, training needs are typically less precise. BT has made rapid progress towards a more programmatic approach to management training - focusing on those about to make significant career steps. 'The aim of all the changes, including a shift to external supply, is to create an even greater in-house centre of excellence of high-quality development and training at minimum cost,' says Ms Davis. For the myriad of independent trainers and business schools struggling out of recession, it is the opportunity of the decade.</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WON TWO ACADEMY AWARDS;  </P> <P> SCREEN LEGEND BETTE DAVIS DIES IN PARIS HOSPITAL AT 81  </P> <P> Bette Davis, the two-time Oscar winner whose toughness, huge eyes and haughty,  cigarette-smoking style made her a movie industry legend, has died at 81, her  longtime lawyer said early today.  </P> <P> Davis died late Friday in a Paris hospital after returning there from the San  Sebastian film festival in Spain, said lawyer Harold Schiff.  </P> <P> Davis appeared in more than 80 films, including "Jezebel," "All About Eve," and  "Of Human Bondage."  </P> <P> She was nominated for Academy Awards 10 times and won an Emmy in 1979 for the  television production "Strangers -- The Story of a Mother and Daughter."  </P> <P> She won her Oscars for "Dangerous" in 1935 and "Jezebel" in 1938.  </P> <P> Her screen heroines were often strong women -- as uncompromising as the actress  was off-screen.  </P> <P> She once suggested the lines for her own epitaph: "Bette Davis -- She Did It  the Hard Way." That included a 1985 comeback after suffering from cancer, a  stroke and a broken hip in quick succession.  </P> <P> Her success story was one of Hollywood's most unlikely tales. Lacking the looks  of a traditional Hollywood glamour girl, the skinny youngster with the huge  eyes relied on her acting skill and took roles nobody else wanted, playing  nasty women more often than nice ones.  </P> <P> "My entire career was never based on looks or glamour or sex," she once said.  "It was an absolute miracle that people came to watch me act."  </P> <P> She sought happiness in marriage, but after four husbands declared that she had  failed and would never marry again. When she wrote her autobiography, she  titled it, "The Lonely Life."  </P> <P> She was born Ruth Elizabeth Davis on April 5, 1908 in Lowell, Mass., the elder  of two daughters of Harlow and Ruth Favor Davis. Her parents were descended  from early New England settlers -- Pilgrims and Huguenots -- and Davis was  always proud of her heritage.  </P> <P> Davis' parents separated when she was 7, and through her childhood she lived  alternately with her mother and in boarding schools. As a teen-ager she showed  talent in school theatrics and decided to become an actress.  </P> <P> She won a scholarship to study with drama coach John Murray Anderson, ushered  at New England theaters in the summer and won small roles in stock company  shows before making her New York stage debut in "The Earth Between" in the  1920s.  </P> <P> During her first Broadway hit, "Broken Dishes," Davis was given a screen test  by movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn. Unimpressed, he scolded a talent scout for  wasting his time.  </P> <P> However, her stage reviews caught the attention of Universal Pictures, which  offered a three-month contract and brought her to California in 1930.  </P> <P> Her film debut came the next year in "Bad Sister." Five other pictures  followed.  </P> <P> When the studio dropped her contract, Warner Bros. picked it up and in 1932  gave her a co-starring role as an ingenue in "The Man Who Played God."  </P> <P> It was the beginning of her 18-year association with Warner's, a sometimes  stormy period in which Davis was known for her famous quarrels with studio  chief Jack Warner. Yet when Warner was asked in later years to define the term  "movie star," he said simply, "Bette Davis."  </P> <P> In 1934, Davis was loaned to RKO for the role that would establish her  reputation -- the sullen heroine Mildred in "Of Human Bondage."  </P> <P> All full obituary will appear in Sunday's editions of The Times.  </P></p>

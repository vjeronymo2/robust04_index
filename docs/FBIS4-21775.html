			<p>BFN     [Text] No'am Arnon, spokesman of the Jewish residents in  Hebron, was arrested this morning in Qiryat Arba'.    Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0900 GMT on 31 March  adds  that Arnon was arrested ``after he refused to turn over his  gun.''    Our correspondent in the territories Golan Yokhpaz reports  that Arnon was scheduled to lead the right-wing rally in Qiryat  Arba' today, and the organizers of the rally announced that they  will not begin the rally before Arnon is released from custody.  The police have not yet reacted.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / International Company News: La Generale cuts exposure to industry sector SOCIETE Generale de Belgique, the Belgian holding company, is taking rapid steps to reduce its exposure to Europe's weak industrial economy. On Thursday, La Generale unveiled a strong increase in profits before extraordinary items in 1992 - to BFr6.1bn (Dollars 184.8m) from BFr4.5bn - but said its results were still too heavily influenced by 'cycles of industrial activity'. The group pledged to lift its presence in 'the most promising sectors' of activity. It also announced a complex deal which should remove all trace of the Belgian group's 25 per cent stake in Arbed, the Luxembourg steelmaker, from this year's consolidated profit, without cutting the investment itself. Arbed accounts for only 2 per cent of the value of portfolio value, but dragged down La Generale's profits by more than BFr1.4bn over the year as it struggled in the deepest steelmaking recession for a decade. At the same time, BFr2bn of extraordinary provisions at Union Miniere, the 82 per cent-owned metals group, all but wiped out the holding company's extraordinary capital gains. After extraordinary items, the holding company's net consolidated profits slipped to BFr6.2bn last year from BFr7.6bn in 1991. The group is proposing to maintain its gross dividend at BFr112 per share. Compagnie de Suez, La Generale's majority shareholder, has made clear it wants to reduce its industrial interests. Viscount Etienne Davignon, the Belgian group's chairman, and Mr Gerard Mestrallet, chief executive, said they were not simply abandoning industrial investments in favour of the group's utilities, tourism, banking and insurance holdings. However, they confirmed they were talking to potential buyers of a minority stake in Union Miniere, and that La Generale might consider increasing its 21 per cent stake in Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, by buying some of the shares owned by another associated company, Groupe AG, the Belgian half of the Belgian-Dutch insurer Fortis. Meanwhile, La Generale and the Luxembourg government, which owns nearly 41 per cent of Arbed, each intend to inject a 6 per cent stake in the steelmaker into a new company, which could link up with an industrial partner by 1995. A simultaneous swap of voting and non-voting shares will enable La Generale to reduce its voting stake to 15 per cent from 29 per cent and exclude the Arbed investment from its consolidated profits in 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Committee for Research and Communication of the  Haitian Religious Conference, CHR, published an Easter  reflection in which it criticizes the attitude of the  international community toward the Haitian crisis. The increase  in crime and repression in Haiti coincides with the so-called  parliamentary plan supported by the U.S. Administration, writes  CHR.    After reading recent news releases by the UN/OAS civilian  mission on increased violence in Haiti, the Haitian Religious  Conference asserts that hands washed in vain by U.S.  Administration authorities, and all those who together with them  plan for the death of innocent people, are stained by their  victims' blood. The Haitian Religious Conference especially  denounces the contradictions and disparities between the  international community's words and deeds in Haiti's case.</p>

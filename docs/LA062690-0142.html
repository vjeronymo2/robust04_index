			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KOLL CO. TO BUILD $40-MILLION, MIXED-USE PROJECT ON 33 ACRES  </P> <P> The Koll Co. of Newport Beach announced plans Monday for a $40-million,  33-acre, mixed-use development project in this booming Riverside County bedroom  community, with the Keith Cos. of Costa Mesa signed on as the first major  tenant.  </P> <P> Dubbed the Koll Corporate Center, the project will provide space for office,  industrial and retail businesses, and is scheduled for ground breaking in  September.  </P> <P> The city, eager to provide more local employment opportunities for its rapidly  growing population, will contribute $2 million to $3 million in infrastructure  improvements around the site.  </P> <P> The Keith Cos., a land planning and engineering firm, has agreed to a  $5-million lease for 50,000 square feet of space in the project's  63,000-square-foot office building, and will relocate its 100-employee Inland  Empire division to the site.  </P> <P> Debi Hausdorfer, a Keith Cos. spokeswoman, said the firm also has an equity  interest in the project, but she declined to provide details. An investment  partnership called Oak Springs Inc. also has a stake in the venture, and the  Industrial Bank of Japan will be the construction lender.  </P> <P> The design of the project will follow previous Koll Co. mixed-use developments,  with a unified architectural and landscape theme aimed at creating a  "city-within-a-city" atmosphere.  </P> <P> In addition to the office building, the development will include a  135,000-square-foot, multitenant industrial building, a 26,000-square-foot  retail building and a 100-room hotel. Twelve acres of undeveloped property will  be offered for build-to-suit or sale to either office or industrial tenants,  and the entire project is slated for completion by 1994.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'O.C. TRANSPORTATION TAX INCREASE A TOSSUP'  </P> <P> Concerning the Orange County Transportation Commission refusing to buy Southern  Pacific's right of way for use as a commuter train route unless voters approve  a hike in the sales tax in November (June 24):  </P> <P> How dare the commission hold the Orange County Transit District and the voters  hostage! We need the proposed light rail that will be built on the right of  way. It will run from Santa Ana to Buena Park, feed into rail systems in Los  Angeles County and lessen the congestion on the freeways.  </P> <P> The voters should defeat the tax increase just to teach the commission a  lesson!  </P> <P> ELEANOR HENRY  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

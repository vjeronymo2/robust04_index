			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / No German lottery winner Germany's record lottery jackpot failed to find a winner for the tenth week, rising to DM42m (Pounds 17.4m) ahead of the next draw on Saturday. Lottery officials said yesterday no winning card had been turned in for the latest weekly draw, which would have netted a top prize of over DM35m. Ten players each won DM1.9m for getting six of 49 numbers right, but winning the jackpot requires seven numbers. Germans have succumbed to lottery fever as the jackpot has mounted and bought more than 30m cards last week, with some help from eager players who come over from neighbouring countries.</p>

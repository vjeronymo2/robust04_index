			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN'S U.S. REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS SURGE;  </P> <P> LEVEL IS ALMOST DOUBLE THAT OF GREAT BRITAIN'S  </P> <P> Japan's buying of U.S. commercial real estate has surged ahead since 1986 and  its $10.02 billion in holdings last year was far larger than any other  country's, the U.S. General Accounting Office says.  </P> <P> "Most countries' positions have remained somewhat stable, with the notable  exception of Japan, which in just a few years has grown from a relatively  modest share to almost double that held by the United Kingdom," said Allan I.  Mendelowitz, the director of the office for trade, energy and finance issues.  </P> <P> Japanese holdings increased 64.3% from 1987 to 1988, he added.  </P> <P> The office makes audits for Congress. Mendelowitz's statement came in a letter  to Sen. Quentin N. Burdick of North Dakota. The letter, dated July 31, was made  available Thursday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small Portion of Total  </P> <P> Britain's commercial real estate holdings in 1988 were given as $5.32 billion.  Britain was followed by Canada with $4.17 billion, the Netherlands with $3.34  billion and the Netherlands Antilles with $3.19 billion.  </P> <P> The letter to Burdick updated a report to him of July 10. That report listed  the Netherlands Antilles, a group of five small Caribbean Islands, as one of  four "identity havens" used to conceal the names of owners. The others were  Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Panama.  </P> <P> The figures represent only a small proportion of total real estate values in  the United States. The National Assn. of Realtors, a private group, estimated  last November that the value of all foreign real estate holdings in 1986 was  only 1.5% of U.S. commercial holdings, excluding farmland and land used for  housing.  </P> <P> Citizens of other countries owned even a smaller proportion of American farms  -- about 1%, according to the report.  </P> <P> It said foreign holdings of farmland amounted to almost 12.5 million acres  worth nearly $9.5 billion in 1988. Britons were the biggest holders with 10.6  million acres, followed by the Swiss with 2.8 million acres.  </P> <P> Using an older set of figures, the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Commerce  Department valued at $90.9 billion all commercial property held by  non-Americans in 1987.  </P></p>

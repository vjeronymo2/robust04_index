			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / The final chapter: Electronic media are challenging the book After several years of successful expansion, the UK publishing industry is experiencing a rare twitch of self-doubt. It has been shaken, a little, by the prospective demise of the net book agreement, which allows publishers to set the retail price of books to prevent discounting. The agreement is due to be reviewed by the restrictive practices court, but seems to be unravelling already as publishers and retailers divide over its continued usefulness. However, it is the growth in electronic media and new channels of information that has really got the industry stirred. The prominence of software stands at this month's Frankfurt Book Fair was a portent that publishers are finding hard to ignore: could developments such as these be the death-knell for the book-as-we-know-it? The snapshot of a family at leisure in the 21st century, previously constructed by the fertile imaginations of science-fiction writers, is now a more tangible vision: one parent snaps a credit card-sized disc of a novel into a compact computer with CD-Rom drive, sets the automatic scroll at the appropriate reading speed and relaxes for the evening; another prepares dinner from a recipe delivered in multimedia format on the kitchen screen; meanwhile, the children use interactive programmes to research their homework. That already assumes that all of them are not, en famille, watching television or a movie, or listening to music. The idea that the family home's bookshelves will be creaking with volumes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, special interest reference books and a lifetime of novels seems sadly anachronistic. Of course, publishers have been studying these developments for years; what has prompted the latest dip in confidence has been the recent check in the publishing resurgence of the past decade. From 1981 to 1993, the number of new titles (including new editions) published in the UK nearly doubled from 46,215 a year to 83,780. Even the expensive sector of scientific, academic and professional books recorded a near doubling of new titles. This year, so far, has been a different story. Mr Clive Bradley, chief executive of the Publishers Association, describes the summer-to-Easter period as 'disappointing'. Despite a pick-up over the last couple of months, sceptics, who have all along insisted that the industry's expansion was unsustainable, are making their voices heard. They have long awaited a 'turning-point' and, given the speed of developments in information technology, it is only natural that the very future of the book has become a focus for concern. The two developments that threaten the book format are digitisation and the multimedia revolution. Digitisation, which allows text and graphics to be stored electronically, provides easy access to very large amounts of information. Multimedia packages present that information through text, graphics and sound which the user can manipulate. Vital markets such as education and business are expected increasingly to turn to such formats. Yet Mr Bradley points out that the print medium is still holding its own: 'Even in reference material, it is still a common reaction for people to find CD-Roms and screens relatively cumbersome, it is often much quicker to pick up a book. 'Multimedia, though it sounds fine in principle, needs to be well done to keep the attention for longer than a few minutes, almost like a movie. That costs a lot of money.' He also points out that the information revolution has not been matched by a revolution of the human mind: 'We are all still waiting for someone who can awaken the mind in a new way, an Einstein for the era, but it has not happened yet. Many of the new packages around do not offer a great deal more than modern text books.' When it comes to fiction, Mr Bradley finds it even more difficult to conceive of electronic publishing having a significant impact on book-buying habits. The most advanced development in this area is in interactive packages, allowing the reader to choose between several different endings, according to his or her mood. Once the novelty value has worn off, it is hard to see these packages competing against the attractions of a slim, cheap paperback that manages to make up its own mind, Mr Bradley believes. 'Interactive media are fine for developing curiosity and search skills, but less satisfactory for books to be read sequentially,' he said. A measure of publishers' confidence in the book is their commitment to the most threatened sector of the market: the reference book. It might be thought that publishers would be bringing out new reference material only in CD-Rom form, phasing out the book in much the same way as record companies phased out vinyl records in favour of compact discs. But that does not appear to be the case. Chambers, which specialises in reference books, has just brought out a new encyclopaedic English dictionary, aimed primarily at secondary school children. Although it will come out in electronic form next year, Mr John Clement, chairman of Chambers Harrap, says he expects the book to out-sell the electronic version by about 10 to one. 'We are not expecting such books to die out in the near future,' he said. 'The book still has the huge advantage of sheer facility, primarily because of its portability and the pleasure which can be had from browsing it.' Mr Bradley echoes this sentiment: 'The technology of producing a book is cheap, the culture of reading a book is very well-established. That will take it a long way.' But once the costs of the new electronic media begin to spiral downwards, will the physical frisson of leafing through a new volume be enough to ensure its survival? And will the new, computer-smart generations experience it at all? The view that curling up with a good book is one of the timeless pleasures of civilised life is about to face its most radical challenge yet.</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Ascom appoints chief executive Ascom, the troubled Swiss telecommunications equipment group, has appointed Mr Hans-Ulrich Schroeder as its chief executive. He is currently head of the German unit of Alcatel, the French telecoms group. Mr Schroeder, a Swiss, will replace Mr Fred Sutter, a long-serving Ascom executive who stepped in a year ago when Mr Leonardo Vannotti was sacked. The Swiss group, which has suffered two years of losses and business and management upheavals, said it had returned to profit in 1994 while net debt had been cut by one-third to about SFr600m (Dollars 451m) in the past 12 months. Ascom is the product of a 1987 merger of three traditional protected suppliers to the Swiss PTT. It has been struggling to develop a strategy to cope with liberalised telecommunications markets. In the wake of Mr Vannotti's departure and a 1993 loss of SFr336.7m, it was suggested the group be broken up. But the directors approved restructuring, recognising the customer base was too small to support a full range of telecoms activities. Ascom has sold off and closed several activities, and concentrates on three product lines: telephone sets and related systems, corporate network systems, and coin- and card-operated telephones and vending machines. Georg Fischer, the Swiss foundries and engineering group, is to acquire Schubert &amp; Salzer Eisenguss, a Leipzig-based iron foundry that makes cast iron components for heavy vehicles and construction machinery. The foundry employs 300 and 1994 sales are expected to be DM65m (Dollars 41.4m).</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One  Network in Mandarin at 1210 GMT on 21 December broadcasts the  ninth of a twelve-part documentary entitled: "Mao Zedong." A  series of editorial reports describing the content of the first  eight parts of the documentary was published in the Political  &amp;  Social section of the 30 December China DAILY REPORT, pages  25-33. The ninth part, which lasts for 50 minutes, is entitled:  "Unique Perception of a Sentimental Poet," and focuses on Mao's  literary attainments as a poet, revolutionary, and statesman.    After video shows an on-screen prologue read by an  unidentified narrator: "A Westerner said: A poet has conquered  New China...." the documentary begins with video shots of a  construction site in Mao's birthplace, Shaoshan, where 100 stone  tablets are engraved with Mao's poems -- this project began in  1992 to commemorate his centennial. Video then shows interviews  with French statesman Giscard d'Estaing, famed Japanese  sinologist Nimoru Takeuchi, and leading Chinese writers who laud  Mao as a poet-revolutionary who composed poems that rhymed with  the rattling of guns on the battlefield. According to those  interviewed, Mao's poems, which reflect the vicissitudes of  Chinese and world history in the 20th century, were written  mostly under adverse circumstances after he encountered setbacks  during the Long March, and were filled with revolutionary  enthusiasm and romanticism, as well as boldness of vision.    As the narrator reads and annotates passages of Mao's poems  during four different periods of his life, namely, his youth,  the War of Resistance Against Japan, the liberation war, and  after the PRC's founding, video shows historical footage of  events, and present-day places connected with Mao. The  documentary devotes a lengthy portion to Mao's poem "Snow -- To  the Tune of Qin Yuan Chun," citing people concerned who recount  the twists and turns prior to publication of the poem in  Chongqing in November 1945. The narrator recites "Snow," which  describes the beauty of the land, deplores illustrious Chinese  emperors lack of literary grace, and says: "For truly great men,  look to this age alone," thus displaying Mao's bold aspirations.  The narrator goes onto describe the poem: "The People's  Liberation Army Captures Nanjing," written in April 1949, as a  brilliant work which declared an end to the Chiang Kai- shek  dynasty and epitomized the advent of a new era. With the end of  the war, Mao's poetry entered a new era. In the fifties, he  wrote poems inspired by milestones in China's socialist  construction, such as the Chang Jiang Bridge in Wuhan, the  elimination of snail fever in Jianxi, and the peasants'  harvests. From the early sixties on, his creative endeavors  reached a new peak. As the international and domestic climate  changed, most of his poems were full of militant spirit. His  poetry, which also featured snow and flowers, frequently  combined realism with romanticism. In addition to writing  poems, Mao also strived to improve his brush painting which he  used to write his poems; he was an accomplished calligrapher.    At 1300 GMT, the documentary concludes with the narrator  acclaiming Mao's poems as expressions of his personal charisma,  as real pictures of China's revolution and construction, and as  a monument of 20th century Chinese history.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- A government advisory panel  issued a report Tuesday [21 June] that offered no specific  figures, but broad options to enable the minority government of  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to decide quickly on globally  promised tax reform while avoiding unnecessary political  disputes.    Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, handed the report  to Hata, leaving sufficient time for the government and the  ruling coalition parties to keep promises made in the March  market-opening package.    The promises were to detail tax reform, including  continuation of 5.5 trillion yen income tax cuts, now limited to  the current year, by the end of this month. Enactment into law  is seen by the yearend.    The report calls for a net revenue surplus to fund an  expected increase in welfare spending amid a graying society in  the 21st century by raising the consumption tax to more than  offset "permanent" tax cuts.    On specific figures and dates, the advisory panel to the  prime minister indirectly endorsed "mechanical calculations"  prepared by the Finance Ministry on revenue estimates in fiscal  2001 under the proposed tax reform.    The estimates, also provided to the ruling parties, showed  that only a tax increase to 7 percent or more would secure extra  revenue. The figure is based on income from tax cuts worth 6.2  trillion yen and 10-to 20-year redemption for stopgap bonds for  a three-year lag between the continued cuts and a tax hike in  April 1997.    But the panel also offered tacit acceptance of a tax hike  below 6 percent, saying that specific figures and dates rest on  efforts to conduct fiscal and administrative overhauls to win  taxpayers' support.    "The limit under the current fiscal condition is a rise to 7  percent, and most panel members agreed on this," Kato told a  news meeting after handing over the report.    But he added a tax increase of 6 percent or less is an  option  if the prime minister can come up with a strong plan for fiscal  and administrative reforms.    The report also notes some panel members would accept a  stage  plan of limiting the tax hike and leaving the issue of net  revenue surplus for further discussions.    "That's why we made unusual commitments as the Tax  Commission  to external discussions led by the fiscal and administrative  reforms," Kato said.    The report urges the government to map out "medium-term  numerical targets and programs" on such reform and to review the  income and consumption tax systems for more fairness.    The panel's inclination to exclude concrete figures  apparently stemmed from mounting uncertainties on the political  side, with the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party  poised to launch a no- confidence motion against Hata's minority  government.    Moreover, the tax hike is an extremely delicate issue for  the  Social Democratic Party, which split from the ruling coalition  in April, resulting in a minority government.    Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said his ministry wants the  government and ruling parties to include concrete figures and  dates for the tax hike and to write the reform into bills by the  end of the month.    Meanwhile, the ruling coalition's tax forum issued its tax  reform report, also leaving out specific figures for the cuts  and hike while calling for a heavier burden on taxpayers to cope  with the aging society and administrative reforms.    The forum handed the report to the coalition's policymaking  group of top representatives.    As for ways to cut income taxes, both reports call for  easing  burdens on the medium-income brackets of 7 to 10 million yen,  but differed on whether to lower the ceiling for the maximum tax  rate.    As for a regional consumption tax, both reports put it aside  for further talks.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Bombed Aden goes about its business Two north Yemeni warplanes hit the Aden oil refinery with cluster bombs, sending a massive column of black smoke and flickering orange flame hundreds of feet into the air. The attack, on Sunday, was the third and most intensive air raid on the city in a week and brought home forcefully the war that has raged out of view for more than a month. But Adenis, like many other people under fire, are not cowering. They are angered by the attacks on their homes and most remain determined to resist what they perceive as aggression from the north. Aden is a sprawling town, its population of half a million clustered in and around the barren rocks of ancient volcanoes. The heart of the place is Crater, a veritable melting pot of races and nationalities that teem through its sweltering streets. Up Bazaar Street merchants are selling everything from boxes of Ribena to bottles of exclusive French perfume. On the pavement, intent young men work with small screwdrivers and tweezers, repairing watches while you wait. There is no sign of anxiety as people saunter to and fro in search of bargains. In Maala, another district of the town, people have been without water for five days. No one knows quite why, nor do they stop to wonder about it much. Children in their hundreds are on the streets with bright yellow plastic bottles and make-shift wheelbarrows, dispatched to water wells dug in the streets. Two boys race, laughing as their empty yellow bottles tumble on to the road. 'Yes, we are having problems. The military has commandeered our buses and that makes getting to work difficult,' says one office manager in the Tuwahi district. 'But we come as we can and do what we can. We are not afraid. We are sure that our defences will hold. We are very proud of what they have done so far,' he says. It is more than a month since north Yemeni military forces began their drive on Aden and other parts of the south. General Ali Abdullah Saleh, the northern leader, has since frequently boasted of arriving in the city to chew qat, the privet-like leaves everyone in the land munches to keep awake in the afternoon. 'General Saleh has made many appointments, but he's so far failed to arrive,' notes a secretary. About 20 miles north of the city, a dozen southern troops settle down for lunch. It is rice and grilled chicken, spread in huge platters on the concrete floor. They lean their AK-47s against the walls and begin to take their food by the handful. Northern artillery shells rip through the air, crashing nearby. The soldiers continue their meal, barely looking up as the walls shake around them. Last week one of the most ferocious battles of the war was fought here, the burned out remains of a southern army camp only the most visible sign of the struggle. But there are more ghastly reminders. Southern troops point to the corpse of a northern soldier, his face respectfully covered in a chequered headcloth. Other corpses of northern soldiers are buried en masse in makeshift graves alongside the road. The stench of death rises from the road where southern troops stand ready for a new northern offensive. 'Our defences will hold,' says a spindly old man in Crater. Perhaps they will. Northern troops massed to the east have been held off for nearly six weeks, as have other soldiers driving in from the north and west. Smoke still rises above the refinery, a reminder of the north's destructive power. But southern pilots, defying incoming northern shells, continue their sorties, taking off with clockwork precision every 10 minutes throughout the morning. Meanwhile, traffic in the city carries on in an orderly manner, directed by policemen wearing pale green uniforms and sparkling white hats.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Tax change hits property schemes The government yesterday announced a change to its tax legislation which will affect the ability of some property owners, such as London's Canary Wharf, to take advantage of tax breaks in enterprise zones. The rule change could have a severe impact on the viability of enterprise zone trusts, which are tax-based property investment schemes for private investors, said investment adviser Mr John Spiers of BESt Investment. Some property developers in enterprise zones would regard the change as a 'a breach of faith', he said. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said the government was rectifying a weakness in its capital allowances legislation, by which property owners have been able to retain the benefit of their tax allowances when they sold a long lease in the building. The announcement could seriously delay Canary Wharf's ability to take advantage of several hundred millions of pounds of capital allowances. Yesterday it cancelled plans to launch an enterprise zone trust, as a result of the announcement. Mr Patrick Garner, finance director of Canary Wharf, said that the change 'in no way affects the viability of Canary Wharf'. Shareholders had not factored in the benefits of the capital allowances into their calculations in making their decision to take the scheme out of administration, he said. The new rules will make it more difficult for some property owners to take advantage of tax breaks by selling parts of their buildings to investors.</p>

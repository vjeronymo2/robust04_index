			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (10): A humbling experience - The monetary excesses of the 1980s are costing the country dear / Japan IT HAS been a humbling year for financial authorities in Tokyo. For most of 1992, government economists and Bank of Japan officials insisted that the Japanese economy was suffering from little more than a hard-to-explain bout of self-doubt. True, land and stock prices were plummeting as a result of a tight money policy. But all calculations appeared to show that with the employment market tight, and consumers flush with cash, brisk consumer demand would keep a firm floor under the economy. In the end, amid mounting signs of a financial crisis, the calculations proved false, and the government was forced to step in at the end of August with the largest emergency economic package in Japanese history, amounting to Y10,700bn. The action followed a rising fear that Japan may be passing quickly from a Japanese-style slowdown into a full-blown American-style recession, with several quarters of negative economic growth and significant unemployment. What has gone wrong? In simple terms, Japan is paying a huge price for the monetary excesses of the late 1980s, when record low interest rates prompted a fantastic rise in stock and land prices. The Bank of Japan, under strong international pressure at the time to cut Japan's trade surplus, held the official discount rate to 2.5 per cent for more than 2 1/2 years to stimulate imports. This it did, temporarily, but the action led to asset and consumer price inflation and an overheated economy. The Bank of Japan moved to squeeze the money supply in 1989, and land and stock prices have fallen spectacularly. It appeared until early this year, however, that the central bank had managed to isolate financial and asset markets from the rest of the economy. In retrospect, the sharp fluctuations in interest rates had set up the country's mainstream manufacturing sector for a severe cyclical crash. Vehicle and electronics companies took advantage of the historic low cost of capital to raise financing. Indeed, they were frequently able to issue convertible bonds in the stock market for 1 per cent or less, and earn a higher return by depositing the money in the bank. With capital cheap, and consumers spending money lavishly, it was natural for companies to expand capacity, and private capital spending rose by more than 10 per cent for four years running. The spending, which had been a principal source of economic growth, however, could not be sustained when the cost of capital began to rise. As a result demand growth started to slow. As new plant opened, inventories piled up. This in itself was enough to hurt profits badly, but it came at a time when the bill for the binge of capital spending in terms of depreciation charges was mounting heavily on profit and loss accounts. The reaction has been to introduce further cuts in capital spending, which led to a sharper contraction in demand. The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan estimates that total capital investment will be off 0.1 per cent in fiscal 1992, with manufacturing investment off by 8.7 per cent. Japan's trusty consumers were supposed to prevent the situation from getting out of hand by continuing to spend freely. This, the theory went, was because of a structural labour shortage. In the end, however, Japanese companies have been cutting overtime work, limiting bonus payments, and reducing hiring. Bankruptcies of small manufacturing companies have been rising. As a result, household income is not so secure after all. All measures of consumer spending have turned downward. Department store sales have shown a year-on-year decline for five consecutive months to July. In August, new car sales plunged 18.6 per cent. With capital investment and consumer spending accounting for 65 per cent of Japan's gross national product, and both stagnating, there appears little chance of the government coming anywhere close to its original growth target of 3.5 per cent for the fiscal year ending March 1993. Many private economists now believe growth will slip below 2 per cent, even with the emergency spending package and its headline figure of Y10,700bn, which comes to 2.3 per cent of GNP. Only about half of the advertised total will contribute directly to GNP growth, as this is pure spending for public works or housing. The balance includes acquisition of land and a variety of loan programmes which, given the weak state of demand, may or may not be taken up fully. The impact of the package will not be felt until the new year. As important as the extra spending measures, was the promise from the government that a programme would be put in place to help banks get bad loans off their books. These bad loans may now total Y25,000bn to Y30,000bn, although no one knows the exact size. The cost of bearing so much bad debt had wiped out bank profits and forced banks to sell securities to dress up the accounts, thus further depressing the stock market and undermining the capital base of the banks. This, more than the slowdown in the economy, accounted for the sense of crisis in August, and it was the promise of government support that later turned the market around. It remains to be seen whether the government can overcome the substantial political and technical obstacles to mounting an effective rescue.</p>

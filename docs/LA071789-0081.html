			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WILDCATTER STRIKES AGAIN;  </P> <P> AT 72, ARCO FOUNDER ROBERT ANDERSON IS BUILDING A SECOND EMPIRE AT PAULEY  </P> <P> The first time Robert O. Anderson started an oil company, things were simpler.  </P> <P> In 1942, all he needed was $150,000 in capital, a couple of partners and $1,400  in drilling rig equipment. He packed up his belongings and his new wife and  daughter and drove half a continent from his native Chicago to settle in the  arid desert of New Mexico.  </P> <P> It worked out pretty well. After 25 years as an independent oilman and  wildcatter, Anderson helped create and run Atlantic Richfield Co., which grew  into the seventh-largest oil company in the country before Anderson left in  1986.  </P> <P> On the way, Anderson's annual income as Arco's chairman exceeded $1 million a  year. He became a land baron, patron of the arts, adviser to presidents and an  unmistakable industry presence in his trademark bow tie and well-worn Stetson.  </P> <P> Now 72, Anderson could have retired to the solitude of his beloved New Mexico  ranch, where he still tools around in the 1949 Oldsmobile convertible that was  a perk in a long-ago deal.  </P> <P> Instead, he is trying again to build an oil company the way he did in the  beginning -- from the ground up. "I happen to think that a rocking chair and a  television screen are a quick way to the graveyard," he says.  </P> <P> In January, 1988, Anderson assumed control of tiny Pauley Petroleum Inc. by  merging his private Hondo Oil &amp; Gas Co. with Pauley in a deal valued at the  time at about $42 million. Pauley was founded by the late Edwin W. Pauley,  himself a Los Angeles millionaire oil entrepreneur and presidential adviser  perhaps best known as the namesake of UCLA's basketball pavilion.  </P> <P> Anderson, eager to recapture the hands-on feel of the oil business he had lost  as chairman of Arco, aims to transform Pauley from a moribund refiner and  producer into a fully integrated oil company. "In a sense, I guess it is  starting all over again -- or picking up where I left off, depending on how you  look at it," he said last week in Pauley's small Westwood office.  </P> <P> It's been a year and a half since the merger, and he may be finding that it's  not as easy as it was the first time around. "Everything's running, but not  quite the way we want it yet. . . . For some reason, things just don't move as  fast; things are bigger, more complicated I guess," he said. "But patience is  the key to it all."  </P> <P> Anderson has already transformed Pauley into a company resembling his earliest  oil ventures. Like them, Pauley has oil and gas holdings largely in the  Rockies, New Mexico and Texas, and is focusing primarily on exploring and  drilling for oil.  </P> <P> Because of exploration costs, debt-servicing costs, and depressed crude and  refined product prices, the company reported a loss of $9.5 million in the  first six months of fiscal 1989 on revenue of $151 million. That compares to  net income of $4.6 million on revenue of $65.8 million in the year earlier  period.  </P> <P> But Anderson and other industry insiders feel that Pauley's fortunes should  turn around now that oil prices are easing back up and with expectations that  natural gas demand should grow. "Next year will be the first year we'll have  the opportunity to put the whole thing together," Anderson said.  </P> <P> At the same time, Anderson is leading a move quietly to divest Pauley,  headquartered for many years in the Los Angeles area, of all its local  holdings, including its Newhall refinery, said William R. Pagen, Pauley's  former chairman and now part-time vice chairman. The company's headquarters  have already moved to Roswell, New Mexico, the base of all Anderson's  businesses.  </P> <P> Sitting in his Westwood office, Anderson seems every bit the oil executive in  his tailored blue suit. His hair has gone white, and his speech is more  measured than it once was, although he still discourses easily on subjects from  global warming to natural gas supplies to corporate dividend policies.  </P> <P> But then he smiles as he picks up his battered hat, fingers a fishing fly in  the band and abruptly interrupts a conversation: "That's a Rat-faced  McDougall," he says with a laugh. "With a hair body."  </P> <P> Why would a man so enamored of fly fishing want to get back into oil  prospecting? "You don't get involved in this business in the first place unless  there's something burning in you to go out and drill holes in the ground and  risk everything in a venture," said H. R. (Bud) Scoggins, president of the  Independent Petroleum Assn. of America.  </P> <P> That urge is what drove Anderson, the son of a Chicago banker, to spend summers  away from the University of Chicago on oil pipeline crews in Texas, shoulder to  shoulder with the roughnecks in the 1930s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Refining Company Partner  </P> <P> In 1942, he bought into a partnership in a small refining company in Artesia,  New Mexico. During the war, Anderson sold jet fuel to the nearby Army Air Corps  station and delivered diesel fuel to a mysterious government camp in nearby Los  Alamos.  </P> <P> He and his wife were in their mountain cabin about 50 miles away when the early  morning atomic blast from the camp lit up the room like daylight, he recalled.  </P> <P> Over the years, Anderson completed a series of deals that increased his  holdings of both oil and gas properties, refineries and retail outlets. He  moved his base of operations to Roswell, New Mexico, and began acquiring land  and livestock for his ranching interests.  </P> <P> "I live in the country because I'm very sensitive to the environment," he says.  </P> <P> In the late 1950s, Anderson's Hondo Oil &amp; Gas Co. struck oil in the  Empire-Abo oil field, one of the largest in the Southwest, with 250 million  barrels in reserve. His holdings in the field caught the attention of  crude-starved Atlantic Refining Co. of Philadelphia. In 1962, Hondo merged with  Atlantic, giving Anderson stock worth $32 million, making him the company's  largest shareholder and putting him on the track to the chairmanship.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appalling Discovery  </P> <P> Anderson, the independent oilman, was appalled to discover that many of the  Philadelphia executives were unfamiliar with routine oil field jargon.  Throughout his career, he worked to erase the gap between the executive suites  and the drilling rigs.  </P> <P> In 1965, shortly after his election as chairman, Anderson and President  Thornton Bradshaw used a transatlantic plane trip to formulate a six-point  strategy that was to eventually see the company through its greatest period of  growth. That strategy included focusing on key areas of the business and  keeping them in balance.  </P> <P> "Most companies don't take an objective view of what they do," he said. "But I  think a company should philosophically review its activities and what it's  doing every few years. If you don't, certain segments of a company will grow  faster than the rest."  </P> <P> A fishing trip with Charlie Jones, chairman of the Richfield Oil Corp. cemented  the merger that would create Arco and bring the company its greatest asset:  leases on the North Slope of Alaska.  </P> <P> Anderson made his first trip to the North Slope in 1966, wearing a suit and  carrying his boots and jeans in a duffel bag, he recalled. At the time, many  oil companies had abandoned unsuccessful efforts to find oil there -- and Arco,  under Anderson's direction, was among the last to drill exploratory wells.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prepared to be Wrong  </P> <P> "There's no question that if we hadn't made a discovery, it would have been the  last well drilled on the North Slope for a good many years," he recalled of the  decision to proceed after a series of failures. "But you shouldn't be an  explorer for oil and gas unless you're prepared to be wrong 80% or 90% of the  time."  </P> <P> Eventually, Arco under Anderson's chairmanship would be one of the players in  the costly and frustrating construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline.  Anderson recalls the high emotions surrounding the proposed pipeline: during  one speech in Washington, a young woman walked up and doused him with a can of  motor oil.  </P> <P> During this time, Anderson became one of the largest landowners in the world.  He still owns major ranches in New Mexico and Texas.  </P> <P> He advised and befriended presidents, became an active figure in Republican  politics and was considered for numerous civic appointments.  </P> <P> The namesake of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's newest wing, he also  became known for his devotion to the arts and world affairs, a passion he  imprinted on Arco as well. He chaired dozens of cultural groups, helped revive  the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, underwrote research into global  problems and engineered bailouts of respected but financially troubled  publications like the London Observer and Harper's magazine.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grabbing the Public Eye  </P> <P> Curiously, Bradshaw seemed to grab more of the public's attention. But even  that was part of Anderson's design. At his busiest, Anderson devoted only a  couple of days a week to Arco and traveled as much as 500 miles a day. A given  week might take him from an Arco board meeting in Los Angeles to a seminar at  the Aspen Institute in Colorado to his ranch in Roswell to spend time with his  wife, Barbara, his two sons and five daughters.  </P> <P> Even now, he estimates, he devotes a third of his time to interests outside  Pauley and still travels several thousand miles a year.  </P> <P> In 1985, as crude oil prices were poised to plunge and oil company takeovers  were in the wind, Anderson was part of the management team that engineered a  major restructuring of Arco that included a major stock repurchase, staff  reductions, divestment of Eastern retailing and refining operations and  curtailment of exploration. Later that year, Anderson resigned his  chairmanship, and in 1986, left the company completely.  </P> <P> "He left a company that was very well poised to take advantage of a very tricky  environment," said oil consultant Thomas Wachtell.  </P> <P> Current Arco executives declined to discuss Anderson's new venture, but Arco  Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook said in a statement: "Bob left us a firm foundation  on which to build, and we are grateful for his leadership during those pivotal  years."  </P> <P> After leaving Arco in 1986, Anderson and the British conglomerate Lonrho PLC  bought some of Arco's marginal oil and gas properties for an estimated $180  million in a bidding process that drew some criticism and a shareholder lawsuit  that was later dismissed. At the time, critics accused Anderson of having  insider knowledge about certain drilling rights that were not listed for sale  -- charges Anderson denied. The drilling rights were eventually sold back to  Arco.  </P> <P> "It was a cat and dog collection that still needs some sorting out," he says.  "But it made good sense from the point of view of an independent company. . . .  A small company can operate properties like that better than a big company."  </P> <P> With the properties, Anderson reconstituted his old Hondo Co., with Lonrho  holding a little less than half interest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Assuming Control  </P> <P> Anderson assumed control of Pauley in January, 1988, when Anderson's Hondo Co.  received 10 million shares, or about 77%, of Pauley's outstanding common stock,  in exchange for which Pauley took over Hondo's oil and gas subsidiary. With  other purchases, Hondo eventually ended up holding about 81% of Pauley's stock.  </P> <P> In the merger, Pauley gained Hondo's sizable oil and gas reserves in the Arco  properties. Pauley's reserves stood at 16.7 million barrels of oil and 108.7  billion cubic feet of natural gas at the end of the last fiscal year.  </P> <P> In the past two years, the company has pursued an aggressive drilling program,  drilling about 39 new wells a year, Pagen said. About $18 million is slated for  drilling in fiscal 1989, with $12 million going to new prospects.  </P> <P> Anderson said he intends to remain actively involved in the company's  management, though he maintains a stiff travel schedule. He has cut back on  many of his outside involvements, preferring to concentrate his activities in  New Mexico. He has also sold off his foreign land holdings and most of his  outside business interests.  </P> <P> Anderson has involved his two sons, Phelps, 38, and Robert B., 42, in the  management of his new company. Each is also an officer of Hondo and owns about  5% of that company.  </P> <P> "One of the reasons I decided to go back into the business was my two very  bright young sons," he says. Asked whether he'd like them to mirror his own  career, he says simply, "That would please me very much."  </P></p>

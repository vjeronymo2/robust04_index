			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Chemical leak at Shorts factory Three men were in intensive care last night and one was said to be 'critical' after a chemical leak at the Shorts aircraft factory in east Belfast. Sixteen other staff were detained for hospital treatment after they were overcome by toxic fumes in a production area of the plant. The Royal Victoria Hospital described the condition of the other two men in intensive care as serious but said the rest were 'stable'. Some of the 450 workers who had to leave the plant because of the spillage collapsed after inhaling hydrogen sulphide in the chemical milling area, which was closed for three hours as fire fighters moved in to contain the spillage. Shorts said a full investigation was under way. It said the leak was accidental but could not say how big the spillage was or what caused it.</p>

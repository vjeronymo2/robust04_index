			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Extravision" newscast] </F>   [Text] Former President Daniel Ortega recognized the  decision of U.S. President Bill Clinton to suspend the trade  embargo on Vietnam that had been in effect since 1975 and called  on the U.S. President to follow suit with the people of Cuba.    [Begin Ortega recording] What has happened? Despite the  embargo and the blockade, Vietnam continued to grow and develop.  Finally, in an intelligent and courageous measure -- we must  recognize this -- U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to lift  the trade embargo on Vietnam. We are now sending a message to  President Clinton telling him that we recognize his courageous  action of bringing justice to the Vietnam case because U.S.  policy was unfair as long as the embargo and blockade were  maintained.    We recognize President Clinton's courageous act because  there  are extremists in the United States who are already criticizing  him for lifting the embargo against Vietnam. We also tell  President Clinton that just as he was brave enough to lift the  embargo on Vietnam, he must have the courage to lift the embargo  on Cuba, because that is a real disgrace to the policy of U.S.  leaders. [applause] [end recording]    The United States imposed the trade embargo on Vietnam in  1975, when U.S. troops were defeated by the Vietnamese people.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILL BE WORKING AT WHITE HOUSE;  </P> <P> QUAYLE ABANDONS PLANS TO CONCENTRATE ON CAPITOL  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle, continuing to flesh out what his role in the new  Administration will be, Tuesday made a round of calls on Capitol Hill but said  that he has abandoned earlier thoughts of making such visits a dominant part of  his job.  </P> <P> For weeks before being sworn in, Quayle had toyed with the idea of spending  most of his time at the Capitol, serving as President Bush's "eyes and ears" in  Congress and trying to influence deliberations in the Senate by exercising the  vice president's little-used powers as presiding officer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Be 'Downtown'  </P> <P> Tuesday, however, he told reporters that "most of my time is going to be spent  downtown" at the White House. Having met with Senate Majority Leader George J.  Mitchell (D-Me.), Quayle realizes that "the powers of the presiding officer are  extremely limited," said his press secretary, David Beckwith. And as for being  the eyes and ears, Quayle said: "I'm going to be as effective in getting that  kind of intelligence and information from down there as up here."  </P> <P> Instead, Quayle will be fulfilling more traditional vice presidential duties,  including foreign trips, the first of which will come next week, the White  House announced Tuesday. The trip, Quayle joked in a meeting with House  Republican leaders, will be for a happy event rather than a funeral -- the  swearing-in of Venezuela's new president, Carlos Andres Perez.  </P> <P> After a day in Venezuela, Quayle will stop briefly in El Salvador to deliver a  message of good wishes from Bush to ailing President Jose Napoleon Duarte.  </P> <P> The trip, Quayle said, "will be a good signal and symbol" of the importance the  United States places on Venezuela's tradition of democratic elections. In  addition, he said, he hopes to "have some bilateral discussions with other  leaders while I'm there."  </P> <P> But he replied with an abrupt "no" when asked if he would meet with  representatives of Nicaragua's left-wing Sandinista government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stern Lecture  </P> <P> In 1983, President Ronald Reagan sent Bush on a mission to El Salvador. Bush at  the time delivered a stern lecture to that country's military and civilian  leaders about the need to end right-wing "death squad" violence. This time,  however, Quayle's mission is far less sensitive, simply to deliver a message of  the "friendship and concern the United States has always had for El Salvador,"  said White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.  </P> <P> On Capitol Hill, Quayle presided at a brief news conference, then was  photographed in a series of meetings with House and Senate leaders, including  Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who kept him waiting for half an  hour.  </P> <P> While the sessions were largely courtesy calls, complete with lighthearted  chatter about golf games and football tickets, they fit in with the  Administration strategy of keeping Quayle in the public eye in positive  settings, an attempt to counteract the negative images with which he was  barraged during the fall election campaign.  </P> <P> Quayle's decision to stay "downtown," meanwhile, appears to be part of his own  strategy to maximize the access he will have to White House policy-making. The  idea of spending large amounts of time on Capitol Hill had been advocated by  several senior Republicans, including Howard H. Baker Jr., the former Senate  majority leader who served for a time as chief of staff in the Reagan White  House. So far, Quayle seems to be having considerable access to the President,  meeting seven times with Bush on Monday and four times on Tuesday, Beckwith  said.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] TDK will boost its overseas production ratio to 50  percent (38 percent as of end of fiscal 1993) with fiscal 1995  as the goal (March 1996 quarter). It is a measure backed by the  overseas production shift of finished goods manufacturers and  worsening export profits due to the high yen, and it aims to  achieve its goal by partially shifting production such as  high-performance magnetic heads and high-frequency parts for  mobile communications. The overseas production shift by the  electronic parts industry seems to be accelerating further.    TDK's overseas production ratio in fiscal 1993 was 38  percent, one point down from the 39 percent in fiscal 1992. It  was affected by the reduction in amount of production along with  the switch in magnetic heads for hard disk drives (HDD) and HDD  IC [integrated circuit] types centering on overseas production.    In the plan to achieve the goal of "a 50-percent overseas  production ratio in fiscal 1995," the program is to start within  the fiscal year production of "MR heads," thin film magnetic  heads for HDD, in the Asian region, in addition to beginning  production of dielectric filters for mobile communications  instruments at the ferrite plant in Oklahoma in the United  States within this fiscal year. Both products are products that  previously had been produced only domestically, and the aim is  to achieve 50 percent in stages by raising the overseas  production ratio to 42 percent at the end of fiscal 1994.    Moreover, in facilities investment, while holding it down  domestically to about 15 billion yen this fiscal year, on par  with last fiscal year, it is scheduled to increase facilities  investment overseas by more than 20 percent compared to the  previous year, to about 25 billion yen. In next fiscal year and  thereafter, the idea is to expand the overseas production items  with this basic stance.    The company is putting effort into avoiding exchange rate  risks such as promoting a change of export transactions to a yen  basis, besides establishing a budget this fiscal year at $1 to  100 yen. By achieving a 50-percent overseas production ratio, it  will have a balance with domestic production and the policy is  to link this course thoroughly to strengthen the constitution of  the business.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAFETY OF BICYCLISTS IS TWO-WAY STREET  </P> <P> It was interesting to read Richard Beene's column requesting motorists to be  mindful of the safety and well-being of cyclists. The story also asks that  cyclists ride safely and responsibly.  </P> <P> All very applaudable, indeed.  </P> <P> Now let's talk about cyclists' use of multiple-use pathways in Huntington  Beach. An alarmingly large number of cyclists daily ignore posted speed limits  (10 m.p.h. maximum, 5 m.p.h. when pedestrians are present). These offending  cyclists ride at speeds of up to 20 m.p.h. and more, weaving between  pedestrians and other cyclists.  </P> <P> Last week I was struck from behind by a cyclist going 15 to 18 m.p.h.,  according to him. He wasn't watching where he was going. It still hurts.  </P> <P> If cyclists want to go fast, then get out on the highway and take your chances  with cars -- your 20 m.p.h. versus the car at 55 m.p.h. Don't be such cowards  as to ride down a path of people on foot with your 20-m.p.h. dangerous speed,  however.  </P> <P> STEVEN D. ANDERSON  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

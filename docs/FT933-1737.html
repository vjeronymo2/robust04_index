			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Tambrands stock falls nearly 10% THE share price of Tambrands, the US-based maker of Tampax tampons, dropped by nearly 10 per cent yesterday after an announcement late on Monday that the company's board had abandoned plans for a sale. The Dollars 3 7/8 fall in Tambrands' share price to Dollars 42 yesterday came in spite of an increase in Tambrands' quarterly dividend to 42 cents a share from 38 cents. The fall puts the shares back to the level at which they were trading before market speculation about a sale first surfaced in June. Tambrands has refused in recent months to confirm that it has been for sale. However, Mr Howard Wentz, chairman, said yesterday: 'As part of a comprehensive review of Tambrands' strategic alternatives, over the last several months we explored the possibility of a sale of the company.' He added that the board had 'decided that the best course is to continue to run the business independently.' It is not known whether Tambrands received any offers for the company. The company, whose chief executive, Mr Martin Emmett, was ousted in June, said it expected to announce new senior management shortly.</p>

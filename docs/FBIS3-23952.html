			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Kotelnikova: "The Prime Minister </F> Re-establishes Management of the State Sector"]    [Text] The increased influence of the sectorial  ministries on the activity of the cabinet of Viktor Chernomyrdin  has permitted them to partially regain the positions with  respect to enterprise management lost during the time of the  reforms. The governmental decree "On Delegation of the Powers of  the Government of the Russian Federation With Respect to the  Management and Disposal of Federal Property Facilities," which  was officially distributed yesterday, grants to sectorial  ministries the right to determine personnel and production  policy. It is obvious that by this decision the government not  only seeks to re-establish the manageability of the state sector  but also to constrict the influence on it of the State Committee  on the Administration of State Property, which is to be  restricted now to the monitoring of the use of state  property.    The new governmental decision has the object of "improving  the management of the state sector of the economy." The sector  people lost their managerial functions already in the time of  the "romantic" period of the reforms, after the liberalization  of the economic activity of state enterprises.    According to the document adopted, management of the state  sector is shared between the sectorial ministries and the State  Committee on the Administration of State Property. The sectorial  ministries have now been granted the right to conclude contracts  with the managers of enterprises and to approve their charters  while the State Committee on the Administration of State  Property is to regulate, correspondingly, the specific-purpose  use of state property. The document also permits the sectorial  ministries to monitor the dimensions of the state sector. The  point is that not only the creation of an enterprise but also  its liquidation will require coordination with the sector  people. In this connection the possibility of denationalizing  enterprises through bankruptcy that is incorporated in the State  Privatization Program is to be constricted. That is why the  forecasts of the experts who thought that introduction of the  institution of bankruptcy would neutralize the victory of the  sector people, which involved the removal of enterprises from  under denationalization (in the course of the months-long  discussion of the State Program the restrictive list of  enterprises not subject to privatization was increased from 30  percent to 36 percent), are not justified. However, the consent  of the sector people alone will be insufficient for the  bankruptcy of an enterprise since it will be further necessary  to obtain the "all right" of the local organs of executive power  of the subjects of the federation.    The clear pro-sectorial direction of the document is  obvious.  Moreover, the unwarranted change in the powers of the State  Committee on the Administration of State Property--their  reduction to monitoring the use of an enterprise's property  (minus management)--exceeds the limits of the existing normative  base. That is why the Prime Minister has proposed that the State  Committee on the Administration of State Property "adjust" its  powers and submit the draft of a statute on the Russian  Federation State Committee on the Administration of State  Property to the government within a month.    If the State Committee on the Administration of State  Property consents to the new distribution of functions, its  status (now defined by law) as well as the influence of its  leadership on economic policy will be substantially reduced.  <H3>  Distribution of Powers Between the Sectorial Ministries and  the State Committee on the Administration of State  Property </H3>    -  The sectorial ministries are granted the right to  approve the charters of federal enterprises, to appoint and to  dismiss the managers of federal enterprises, and to conclude,  change and cancel contracts with these managers. The ministries  also act as legal successors with respect to contracts  previously concluded with the managers of federal enterprises by  the organs of state administration of Russia, the former USSR  and RSFSR, as well as by concerns, associations and other  amalgamations of enterprises in the period when they were  granted the corresponding powers.    -  The jurisdiction of the State  Committee on the Administration of State Property entails the  transfer of state property to full economic management and  operational control, as well as to leasing and the right to use,  by legal persons, and the monitoring of the specific-purpose  utilization of state property.</p>

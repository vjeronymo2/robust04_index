			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: S African options market to open up THE Johannesburg Stock exchange (JSE) plans to open its Traded Options Market (TOM) to foreigners and non-residents. Exchange control regulation currently bar preclude them from the equity options market. By using TOM, foreigners will be allowed to buy and sell call and put options on some of the main blue chip shares on the JSE as well as the all-share index and the all gold index. This list will expand as and when demand requires it. Announcing the change, Mr Roy Andersen, JSE executive president, said foreign investors would earn interest on cash margins remittable at the more advantageous commercial rand rate of exchange. He said brokers would be able to service a wider client base. He hoped the hedging and arbitrage opportunities available would stimulate liquidity in the underlying cash market. Foreign clients will trade as ordinary clients of brokers, and may use their financial rand or blocked rand balances for TOM trading.</p>

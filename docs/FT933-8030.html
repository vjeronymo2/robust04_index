			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Arts: From Highgrove to home videos - Television Dudley Moore's career has been a striking manifestation of the Peter Principle (which, you may recall, states that people are promoted until they reach a level at which they prove to be incompetent). As a young man, in partnership with Peter Cook, he was superb in the BBC series Not Only But Also. Watch any of the 'Dagenham Dialogues' - if it's a good painting the eyes, or the bottoms, follow you round the room; always count railings otherwise something awful will happen - and they work as well today as they did in the 1960s. Then he was accepted as a film actor, a job where you would have to say he was, at best, mediocre. More recently he has been used, back on television, as the presenter of didactic music series, a role in which he proved in Orchestra] to be embarrassingly bad. Why, then, is he now appearing in a similar series called Concerto]? Presumably because, in television, nothing succeeds like familiarity. The opening programme on Channel 4 on Sunday featured Michael Tilson Thomas, who showed in the recent BBC programme about Beethoven's 5th Symphony that he was such an impressive conductor/presenter, and soloists James Galway and Marisa Robles, both charming and articulate. So why did anybody think it a good idea to bring in Moore with his Goon voices and facetiousness? Presumably the reasoning is that those thickies out there in front of their sets will never accept musical analysis without the sugar coating of comedy - and Dudley Moore is funny, isn't he? Not in Concerto] he's not. ***** The impressionists on Spitting Image have a lot to answer for. Nowadays we all think we know how Prince Charles sounds when chatting with his friends. Keeping your teeth gripped firmly together and speaking through your nose say 'Shall we take a walk rind the grinds? It's all dine to Mother Thingy in the end isn't it? You know, Nature'. So strong is our certainty that this is how he sounds that it came as a great surprise to find him talking only a little like that in ITV's Survival Special 'Highgrove, Nature's Kingdom' on Friday. True, he had a walking stick so long that he had to reach up to hold it, but generally speaking he came across as quite sane. The programme was of a remarkably old fashioned type, close to the original Disney wildlife model, with superb pictures by Maurice Tibbles (the fox in the foreground with the rabbit sitting stock still in the background, for instance) but a fatuously condescending commentary: 'Conservation doesn't necessarily mean preserving everything . . . spring is a busy time on the farm . . . the horse was domesticated by man long ago'. Gosh, no, really? ***** Some have claimed that in Billy Roche's Wexford Trilogy on BBC2 the third part was better than the second and the second better than the first. To me they seemed quite consistent: all excellent. The first, set in a betting shop, was a Chekhovian lament about provincialism and the virtues of loyalty to your roots versus the attractions of escape. The second, set in the ante room to a snooker hall, while still concerned with small town mentality, looked at pecking orders, crime and hypocrisy. The third, set in the vestry and belfry of a church, featured a sexually naive sacristan, an adulterous wife and a wise innocent. They did more to make you think than an entire year's supply of glossily filmed mini-series. Let us hope that this tremendously successful transfer from stage to screen has reminded Charles Denton, BBC Television's new head of drama, that there is infinite life in studio production. ***** The 'up to' habit is spreading like couch grass through television news rooms and it should be ripped out and banished immediately. When they tell us 'At least Pounds 1m was stolen' that is fair enough; it means that a minimum of Pounds 1m was involved so that, whatever the precise figure, this was a significant event. But to say 'Up to Pounds 1m was stolen', as they did on the BBC's south east regional news, is meaningless. It could mean that Pounds 999,999 was stolen or that Pounds 1 was stolen. If they mean 'About Pounds 1m was stolen' they should say so. Similarly with casualty figures: 'Up to 10 people were killed' is nonsense whereas 'At least eight' makes sense. ***** The success achieved by the BBC's Community Programmes Unit (responsible for access programmes such as Open Door) in dishing out video cameras to members of the public and getting them to make programmes about their own lives is remarkable. Video Diaries has produced some of the most powerful documentaries we have seen in the last couple of years, and the current series of Teenage Diaries on BBC2 on Saturdays is proving that this was no flash in the pan. Though the camera is in the subject's own hands the content does not always endear the subject to the viewer. Indeed the programmes in this series so far - made by a fatherless, husbandless 15-year old mother; an astonishing Portuguese boy musician; a school-hating 13-year-old girl with a shaven head; and the 12-year-old daughter of single-parent mother - have left some viewers seething and muttering about fecklessness, conceit, mollycoddling and scrounging off the state. But that, surely, is an indication of the effectiveness of the form. It would be interesting to know just how much of the editing, music laying, and tripod mounted footage is really the work of the teenagers, but even if the fine professional hands of the unit do intrude more than we might guess, this is still a most impressive series. ***** Yet again coverage by a foreign broadcaster of a big sporting occasion is revealing by default the extraordinarily high standards of the BBC's own sports coverage. German (presumably) coverage of the marathon at the World Championships in Stuttgart gave us overhead shots of a completely deserted road, shots of athletes from the waist down so that they were unidentifiable, pointless shots of the helicopter which was doubtless providing the pictures of the deserted road, and a crucial time gap between the first and second runners which must have been wrong unless the chasing runner got a lift on one of the motorbikes. Where a BBC camera crew would have been well prepared for Konchella's astounding finish in the 800 metres, the Germans were taken entirely by surprise, and so on. If you enjoy athletics it is all deeply irritating except insofar as it highlights the home grown excellence that we are so used to. ***** The time has come, if not for a complete retraction, at least for a reappraisal. When Pandora's Box was first shown I found the thesis in the opening episode, about attempts by Soviet Russia to run a 'scientific' state, wholly unpersuasive, feeling that blame was being laid at the door of science when it should have been that of politics. I took little notice of the rest of the series, but the repeats on BBC2 on Thursdays are showing that to have been a mistake. The episode two weeks ago on the faith that was placed in DDT just after the war, then the launch of the ecology movement with Rachel Carson's 'Silent Spring', followed by a new wave of blind faith in Mother Nature, was a profoundly sane programme. And although this pink newsprint may seem an odd place to be saying so, last Thursday's systematic expose of the ineffectuality of the 'science' of economics, at least as practised in Britain since 1945, was masterly. I now look forward eagerly to tomorrow's programme about the chaps at the Rand Corporation, the first 'scientific' think-tank, who believed in the balance of terror and provided Hollywood with the models for Dr Strangelove.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Minister Predicts Economic Revival -- Johannesburg THE STAR  in English on 17 February in a page-14 editorial notes that  Finance Minister Derek Keys was "very upbeat" and his "message  to the nation certainly makes encouraging reading, punctuated as  it is with references to the many factors in place requisite for  strong economic revival." However, this euphoria should be  "tempered by an awareness of the platform on which the Minister  stands. His public pronouncements have one eye on the upcoming  election and another on the need to reassure foreign investors  that the ANC's [African National Congress] Leninist leanings are  designed solely to drum up voter support, and that the danger to  stability posed by the Freedom Alliance is no more than a  temporary phenomenon. That such reassurances are needed  underlines the potential hazards facing the embryonic economic  recovery." At the same time, Keys's "stress on a positive  outlook highlights the economy's considerable incipient  strength, the potential of which (if realised) would serve as a  major boost to the standard of living of all South Africans."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Revised ANC Position on Constitution `Attractive' -- "The  revised ANC position on regional powers, self-determination and  a volkstaat [homeland] may be attractive both to Buthelezi and  to the more rational elements of the white right," declares a  page-8 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 17  February. "It will certainly help show whether they are still  serious negotiators." "What is needed now is not just hard  bargaining, but the determination to reach agreement." BUSINESS  DAY says "constitutional and electoral changes seem certain  through renewed negotiations and a brief parliamentary session."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Township Facilities `Falling Apart' -- "When the Greater  Soweto rent boycott ended officially earlier this month  residents thought the condition of their townships would  improve," notes Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 17 February  in a page-8 editorial. But this seems like "a forlorn hope" as  the trash heaps grow larger and the roads "are all but  impossible to navigate." "While it is not clear who is in  charge these days the facilities generally are falling apart."  "Until residents are convinced their facilities have been  improved they will not pay."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Difficult Choices on IFP-AVF Actions -- Johannesburg BEELD  in  Afrikaans on 14 February points out in a page-8 editorial: "At  this point it seems fairly certain that the Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP] and the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF]  will not participate in the April election. The question is,  what are the government and the other participating parties  going to do about this? The harsh reality is that there can be  no quesiton of postponing or cancelling the election; that would  cause immeasurably greater problems than those caused by the  IFP-AVF boycott." "The problem with the boycott is not that  these parties' supporters will remain outside the election. Ten  to one they will go and vote. The problem is the ability of  these two parties to cause disruption and bloodshed. And how  the authorities should react to it. The government/Transitional  Executive Council are faced with difficult choices. Should the  IFP-AVF and the other borderline groups opt for disruption, the  state does possess the muscle to ward off their efforts and  defend the process. But it could be a bloody business, which  may upset the country's brittle psyche. Naturally ruthless  action by the state to protect the political process would have  to be the last option. It is, however, a decision which must  not be reached hesitantly. Exceptional determination will be  demanded of political role players and others involved. They  will have to do what must be done, knowing full well that if the  present problem is not neutralized effectively, far greater  disaster and misery could be waiting around the corner."</p>

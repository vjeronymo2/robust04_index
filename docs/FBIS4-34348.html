			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Haiti  advises in a press release that although it had decided to  maintain silence, it now finds itself compelled to break this  silence and raise the most energetic protest against the threats  of intervention to the country. The Chamber makes a point of  advising that in keeping with the Constitution, it will never  accept an attack on Haiti's sovereignty. The Chamber of Commerce  and Industry of Haiti believes that it must also protest to the  American people and the international organizations the untimely  statements of President Clinton's representative, William Gray.  Mr. Gray, states the Chamber of Commerce, in the policy that he  is ready to apply without visiting Haiti, without knowing the  country's problems, without getting in touch with the Haitian  organizations, attacks the Haitian people.    Mr. Gray totally ignores the fact that 90 percent of all  airline tickets are bought and used by a small group of vendors.  Indeed more than 2,000 to 3,000 venders travel back and forth to  Miami, New York, Curacao, and Panama to supply themselves with  goods for resale, and to provide jobs to more than 10,000 small  distributors. It is this possibility that Mr. Gray wants to  prevent because it will increase the number of boat people,  since this group will no longer be able to feed their families,  states the Chamber of Commerce. Out of 700,000 airline tickets,  this group uses approximately 600,000. Only 100,000 tickets are  used by the so-called wealthy class and the middle class, those  traveling on business and to visit their children studying  abroad.    Moreover, implying that $50 a month should be enough to  support a Haitian family is without a doubt, says the Chamber,  an insult to a whole nation, and a scandal similar to genocide.  Such statements and all of those who approve of Mr. Gray have  ignored the Haitians themselves and are considered detractors  and destroyers of the Haitian nation. Furthermore, it is  incomprehensible that to restore democracy to Haiti, dictatorial  formulas are being used, such as freezing all Haitians' bank  accounts in the United States, and imposing an unfair, criminal  embargo. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Haiti takes  this occasion to reiterate that only Haitians will succeed in  solving the current crisis of the country.</p>

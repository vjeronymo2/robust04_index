			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KIMBLE MAKES $100,000 POINT ABOUT HIS ALL-AROUND ABILITY  </P> <P> Everyone knows Bo Kimble of Loyola Marymount can score. What hardly anyone  realized was that Kimble can play defense, too.  </P> <P> "The big doubt about my game was defense, and I hope I showed that Bo knows  defense," Kimble said after winning the One-On-One Challenge Monday night.  </P> <P> "I want people to know I like to compete and play defense."  </P> <P> Kimble outshot and out-muscled Gary Payton of Oregon State, defeating him,  30-23, in the final of the single-elimination tournament.  </P> <P> Kimble earned $100,000, his first pro paycheck, and Payton got $50,000. The  other six entrants each were guaranteed $10,000.  </P> <P> Both finalists played two previous eight-minute one-on-one games, but Payton  had an advantage with an extra few minutes of rest while the 6-foot-5 Kimble  battled 6-7 Lionel Simmons of La Salle, a boyhood friend of Kimble's, in the  semifinals.  </P> <P> But Kimble showed no signs of fatigue, making four three-pointers early in the  game for a 14-5 lead, then muscling inside to draw fouls. He made 12 of 12 free  throws in the final 4:31 and had only one field goal in that span.  </P> <P> "Stamina is my strongest point after playing for Loyola," Kimble said. "You  have to be mentally and physically tough to play there."  </P> <P> Kimble, the nation's leading collegiate scorer last season with a 35.3 average  for the Lions, is expected to be a first-round pick in Wednesday night's NBA  draft.  </P> <P> "I don't think I'm No. 1 in this draft," Kimble said, "but I feel I deserve to  be in the top 11."  </P></p>

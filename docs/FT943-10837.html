			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Postal union is warned on protests Royal Mail is trying to stop its employees from campaigning against the government's proposed privatisation of the service. It has warned officials of the Union of Communication Workers that it will take disciplinary action against staff who wear anti-privatisation badges or stickers produced by the union on their uniforms or who put them on Royal Mail vehicles. Mrs Jane Kitchen, operational developments manager in Sheffield, told the union that drivers were being instructed 'in as non-threatening a way as possible' to inform staff that display of stickers and badges could lead to disciplinary action. Royal Mail's rules on the wearing of badges point out that 'private badges may be worn on duty, provided they are not obtrusive and are not badges of a political party or organisation'. The tough attitude of managers has led to disciplinary action being taken against a union member in the Warwick and Leamington area who was distributing the union's anti-privatisation leaflets in the sorting office. Her appeal against the disiplinary action is to be held on Friday. Letters, Page 14</p>

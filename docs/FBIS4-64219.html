			<p>BFN     [Text] Stuttgart (DPA) -- Daimler-Benz Chief Edzard Reuter  and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat have agreed on more intensive  cooperation, above all in border-crossing infrastructure  projects. This was announced by Reuter, who had invited 'Arafat  for a one-day visit to Stuttgart, in a talk with journalists on  Monday [2 May]. "We at Daimler-Beinz are convinced that the  peace process in the Middle East can be consolidated through the  contribution of European companies," Reuter said. The meeting  with 'Arafat is a good starting point for the accelerated  expansion of economic cooperation.    Reuter promised his guest that a development study would be  drawn up to solve the infrastructure and traffic problems in  Palestine as a gift. The study will compiled by the  corporation's subsidiary Donier Management Consulting. 'Arafat,  who said that economic recovery is one of the most important  bases for the pace process in the Middle East, accepted the gift  with thanks. 'Arafat came to Stuttgart two days before the  planned signing of the Gaza-Jericho autonomy agreement.</p>

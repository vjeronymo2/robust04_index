			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Failure of computers 'may kill' DEATHS AND serious injuries caused by computer system failures are likely within a few years unless a shortage of experienced safety engineers is eased, the British Computer Society warned yesterday. It said there might be more cases like that of the London Ambulance Service unless the number of computer specialists qualified to build, inspect and approve 'safety-critical' systems increased sharply. Poor system design and management in the London service led to unacceptable delays in the arrival of ambulances. Safety-critical systems are computer systems which can lead to injuries or deaths if they go wrong. The London ambulance system was never declared safety-critical and was not inspected by qualified safety experts. Professor John Cullyer of Warwick University, chairman of a society task force, said yesterday that computers were spreading rapidly through society. But the training of experts in safety-critical methods was lagging behind. He said it was impossible to put a figure on the number of extra engineers needed, but specialists were already overstretched. Companies qualified to carry out safety-critical inspections included Roll-Royce, BAe-Sema, Program Validation and Thorn EMI. Prof Cullyer, a consultant to the US space programme, said that by the turn of the century most passenger cars would have six or more microprocessors, at least two of them controlling potentially life-threatening functions such as braking or suspension alignment. Prof Cullyer said the recession in the UK had caused a sharp reduction in training which was making the shortage worse and had serious implications for safety over the next decade. He said it took about 10 years for a computer engineer to gain the experience and maturity needed to work on safety-critical systems. Statutory regulations in the UK designed to ensure that a new computer system passes inspection cover only the aerospace, nuclear and toxic chemicals industries. Defence systems are covered by rigorous standard procedures set by the Ministry of Defence, but are not statutory. Industries where there is no statutory requirement to have new systems tested and approved include medical electronics, motor electronics and manufacturing. Prof Cullyer said a principal concern was that small companies, many of them developing innovative and advanced systems, had neither the resources nor incentive to ask for independent inspection of their work. A policy statement prepared by the society's task force warns that some of the science and technology needed to design and assess safety-critical systems is not yet fully developed and calls on the government and the Science and Engineering Research Council to support the necessary research and development. It calls for a system of registration with mandatory fault reporting for safety-critical systems so minimum standards can be enforced.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Competition brings confusion to gas: Strains over industrial fuel supplies NEXT MONTH the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is likely to decide whether households will be able to choose their own gas supplier. But any move to open up the gas market further will have to be made cautiously. The rapid growth of competition to industrial users in the past three years has caused embarrassing problems for British Gas and brought the threat of legal action from rival suppliers. The commission has been investigating the gas industry since last August and its report will indicate whether British Gas's pipelines should be sold off and whether competitors can enter the household supply business. Competitors now account for about 10 per cent of the gas flowing through British Gas's 162,000 miles of pipelines. In November 1991 competitors supplied 1,000 industrial sites. By last September that had grown to 5,000. Since then the market has been opened up further and rivals now serve 45,000 sites. Competitors have captured a quarter of British Gas's industrial market and the company is expecting the number of sites supplied by its rivals to pass 100,000 by the end of this year. But no-one predicted how rapidly competition would develop and there have been problems. British Gas is responsible for reading the meters at all industrial sites - whether the sites are supplied by British Gas or its competitors. Once it has read the meters it bills the rival shippers for transport charges, telling them how much gas they have supplied. The shippers, which may supply several sites belonging to one company, must then invoice their own customers. British Gas's computers have not been able to cope with the extra work, however. A backlog of invoices has built up meaning that some shippers have not been billed for gas since November. As a result the shippers have either been unable to invoice their own customers or have had to present them with estimated bills. The changeover from British Gas to rivals has also been difficult for customers. One department store chain received bills from British Gas - with the threat of cutting off supply - long after it had moved to a competitor. A group of shippers has written to British Gas to complain and several have threatened legal action for breach of their transport contracts. But Mr John Huggins, director of gas transportation at British Gas, said the situation was improving. The company is spending Pounds 10m on updating its computer in the next six months so that it will be able to deal with the increased workload. Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas's chief executive, said yesterday: 'We're making very good progress and in a couple of months we should be up to date on the invoices.' But the company's competitors still complain that the more business they capture, the more delays it brings in billing. Mr Huggins said: 'It's a huge task. You can get as many as 10,000 pieces of information for the bigger shippers, and if one is missing, you can't send them a bill.' Just monitoring the additional gas flows has proved a logistical headache. 'It's been an explosive growth and we just didn't have a system designed to cope with that quantity,' Mr Huggins said. British Gas relies on its 47 competitors to tell it by fax or telex how much gas they are pushing through the network each day. But this information is given five days in arrears. There is no way of knowing to whom the gas belongs once it is in the pipelines. At the moment, British Gas provides back-up gas if shippers are short. But if the commission recommends that pipelines be separated off - as has been suggested by the regulator - the transport arrangements will have to be more carefully policed.</p>

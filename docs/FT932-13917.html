			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Trafalgar plans merger of offshore operations - Proposed reorganisation prompted by dramatic fall in North Sea orders REDPATH AND RGC, two of Britain's biggest North Sea offshore oil and gas fabricators, are to merge as part of a reorganisation of Trafalgar House's offshore engineering operations. The move comes against the background of a dramatic fall in North Sea orders. Turnover of the seven largest North Sea fabricators of Pounds 1.5bn last year is expected to fall to about Pounds 500m this year. Trafalgar House Offshore, which owns both Redpath and RGC, has cut its labour force from 7,000 to 4,000 since last summer. A further 500 to 600 job losses, already announced, have still to take place. The group closed its Scott Lithgow yard on the Clyde, west of Glasgow, in February. Last year the yard employed 700. Mr Syd Fudge, managing director of Trafalgar House Offshore, said there were no plans to close any of its three remaining yards - one at Fyfe, in Scotland, and two on Teesside in north-east England. Mr Fudge said yesterday: 'We would hope that there will be no further redundancies beyond those which have already been announced. Much will depend upon how successful we are at tendering for what work is available.' Trafalgar is reorganising its offshore business to take account of the fall in orders for fabrication of large exploration and production rigs as development of the North Sea slows. As a result it plans to have up to half of its business generated outside the North Sea. The company is in the final stages of negotiating with the Vietnamese government a joint venture to provide services for the developing Vietnamese offshore oil industry. Trafalgar, which would own 60 per cent of the joint venture in Vung Tu on the Mekong delta, intends to use it as a base to break into other south-east Asian offshore markets. It would use local labour and services as much as possible, said Mr Fudge. The company has also been looking at opportunities to form similar joint ventures in Azerbaijan, Russia, India and Canada. Its reorganised business will also place greater emphasis on North Sea repair, maintenance and improvement work. Trafalgar said production facilities in future were likely to be much smaller and would hook up to existing platforms. Fabrication of large scale stand-alone platforms for the North Sea, which last year accounted for about 80 per cent of Trafalgar's workload, is expected to reduce to about 30 per cent during the next decade. Turnover of about Pounds 500m last year is expected to fall to about Pounds 300m this year.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hollas in red after restructure A review of activities by the new management team at Hollas Group, the Manchester-based clothing and textiles group, resulted in pre-tax losses of Pounds 254,000 for the six months to September 30, against profits of Pounds 255,000, writes Nigel Clark. The outcome was after exceptional costs of Pounds 705,000, comprising Pounds 208,000 relating to management changes and Pounds 425,000 for losses on and provision against the values of surplus properties. Of the property charge Pounds 325,000 was accounted for by the net loss on the sale of a Manchester property announced yesterday. The total consideration was Pounds 2.4m, raising net cash of Pounds 1.85m which is being used to cut borrowings and for working capital. Mr Julian Lee, who retreated from the corporate scene following the sale of Bricom, the industrial conglomerate, in 1990, came out of retirement to become group chief executive in October. Turnover was Pounds 12.8m, against Pounds 15.9m including Pounds 3.83m from discontinued activities. Losses per share were 0.5p (earnings 0.3p). The interim dividend is halved at 0.3p.</p>

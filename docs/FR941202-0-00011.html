			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 35.14&blank;Notification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters stated that the phrase ``within 30 days of the date'' in the proposed &sect;32.72(b)(3) may be misinterpreted and suggested that a new phrase ``no later than 30 days after the date'' should be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> See response to comment (1) of section 32.72(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 35.22&blank;Radiation Safety Committee <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were two comments concerning this section. One commenter agreed with the proposed change. The other commenter stated that the proposed change was not warranted because the Radiation Safety Committees (RSC) are overburdened by other duties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that it is important for the RSC to review the training and experience of authorized users and authorized nuclear pharmacists and to approve or disapprove any such individuals because this review and the approval or disapproval by RSC is a key factor in the program to ensure radiation safety. Furthermore, existing regulations already require the RSC to perform such review and approval or disapproval of authorized users, Radiation Safety Officers, and teletherapy physicists. By adding authorized nuclear pharmacists to the review and approval or disapproval process of the RSC, the Commission does not believe that a significant burden will be added to the RSC's responsibilities because it is expected that a relatively small number of authorized nuclear pharmacists will be included in Part 35 licenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 35.25&blank;Supervision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters stated that this section should not be so restrictive and that instructions to workers can only be provided by the supervising individuals. These commenters suggested that the provision for instructing workers may be delegated to other qualified individuals. Similarly, they suggested that periodic review of the work of the supervised individuals may also be delegated to other qualified individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees that the workers may be instructed by the licensee, the supervising individuals, or other qualified individuals as long as the instructors are knowledgeable about the subject areas. The regulatory text has been revised to indicate that although the licensee may delegate these tasks to other qualified individuals, the licensee retains the responsibility for instructing workers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the requirement for periodically reviewing the work of supervised individuals remains with the supervising authorized nuclear pharmacist or physician authorized user. The Commission believes that the supervising individual is in a better position to review the work than another individual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

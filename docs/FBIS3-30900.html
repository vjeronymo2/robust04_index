Accordingly, the News, The Week, and the Daybreak [Napkelte]  programs will follow the events of the campaign in the first  period of the election campaign, strictly adhering to the  principles of proportionality and impartiality. In this period,  the television will not broadcast paid election advertisements.    In the campaign period in the stricter sense of the word,  the  television will broadcast campaign programs by introducing the  parties and their candidates that have a national list.    It will provide an opportunity for the parties to contrast  their views and ideas twice a week in 60-minute discussion  programs. The leaders on party lists will participate in the  last, 90-minute discussion forum to be held two days before the  elections.    During the four-week campaign period, all parties that are  on  national lists can appear on television with a film edited by  themselves and at their own costs, in the order drawn in front  of a public notary. Every party will have two chances to  appear, first with a five-minute film, then with a 10-minute  one. To prepare these programs, the parties will be able to use  Hungarian Television's film archives for a charge, but they can  only use material made on them and not other parties. In the  actual campaign period, all parties can have altogether one  minute per day advertising time on the two channels together.  The propaganda films will be made at the cost of the parties  and the television will broadcast these for 10 percent of the  usual charge. The broadcasting time of these advertising films  will be decided by a draw. The same applies to the period  between the two rounds of the elections.    In accordance with the election code of ethics, parties that  set up lists have to be shown in news programs on the election  events under identical conditions, and the election reports have  to be done in proportion to their nominations. The duty of the  election programs is to explain the electoral law in an  understandable way, and to assert that participation in the  elections is a moral and political obligation for all citizens.  To inform the public, constitutional lawyers and politicians  will explain the electoral system, its advantages as opposed to  other systems, and the procedure of the elections. According to  the chairman's orders, to mobilize the public and to ensure the  highest possible participation, these programs will have to show  the election experiences of western countries, the electoral  activities of Hungarians living in the West, and well-known  Hungarian intellectuals will have to speak about this issue.  The views of the committee that is defined in the elections  code of ethics will have to be asked on disputed or unclear  issues. These orders will come into force from the date of  their publication, namely 4 February 1994.</p>

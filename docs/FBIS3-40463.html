			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The government will introduce a permit system  beginning 16 July for the export of biotech-related equipment  and pathogenic organisms, which can be converted to the  manufacture of biological weapons.    The goal is to prevent the proliferation of weapons to  volatile regions of the world. Under this system, seven types of  equipment such as freeze dryers and ultracentrifuges, and 63  types of pathogens and toxins such as the Japan encephalitis  virus will be restricted. The system will require exporters to  report to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry the  destination, user, intended use, etc., and export will be denied  if there is a chance that these items might be used to make  biological weapons. The Diet will revise the Export Trade  Control Ordinance on 15 June.    It was decided to place restrictions on biotech-related  equipment and pathogenic organisms at the meeting of the  Australia Group (currently comprised of 25 nations including  Japan, the U.S. and Europe) held in December 1992 in Paris.</p>

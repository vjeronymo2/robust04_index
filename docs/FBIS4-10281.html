			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gabriela Coutino] </F>   [Text] San Cristobal de Las Cases, Chiapas, 3 Apr --  Chiapas interim Governor Javier Lopez Moreno today said that the  delays in the peace talks are causing uncertainty and that  Chiapas natives should not be subjected to such anxiety.    At the inauguration of the Spring Peace Fair, Lopez Moreno  said: "There is a collective need for the second phase of the  dialogue to start soon." This is why he reported that within  the next 48 hours he will meet with Peace Commissioner Camacho  Solis.    Meanwhile, Felipe Aguirre Franco, bishop of the Tuxtla  Gutierrez Dioceses, urged the federal government to speed up the  release of 21 "alleged Zapatists" who have been staging a hunger  strike at Cerro Hueco Penitentiary since last Friday. The  bishop indicated that no matter what the circumstances are,  justice must be applied within the framework of the  Constitution, "freely, swiftly, and expeditiously."    In Tapachula, Felipe Arizmedi Esquivel used his Easter  message to urge the faithful not to give up hope. He said:  "Although the rock at the Holy Sepulcher was heavy, Jesus rose  from the dead. Courage, do not give up!"    He said: Since 1 January, we have lived in a state of  anxiety, doubt, and fear. All of us have asked ourselves: What  is going to happen? What violence is going to continue to be  unleash? When will we enjoy an honest and true peace?    Arizmendi said that what is being felt at the state level  has  been felt nationwide since the murder in Tijuana. It seems that  a very heavy object fell on us, like the enormous rock that  covered the Holy Sepulcher.    He added: There is a feeling of uncertainty, defeat, and  pessimism, as if a solution to the problem cannot be found -- as  if we are buried in an abyss without hope.    Nevertheless, he said, this bleak outlook will be  transformed  because "the one crucified has risen from the dead.... Do not  fear... He will lead you." Indeed, Christ could not be  defeated. He is the Lord of life and the Lord of history,  Arizmendi added in his Easter message.    This is why we want a new, just, fraternal, united, and  pacified Chiapas and Mexico. We must all bury injustice,  discrimination, verbal and physical violence, corruption, lies,  and arrogance.    He insisted: It is necessary to crucify egoism, arrogance,  envy, hatred, and the desire for vengeance, and we must open our  arms for pardon and reconciliation! Arizmendi noted: Chiapas  can rise! Mexico can rise!    For the first time in three months, hundreds of people met  at  the main plaza. More than to mark the initiation of the  traditional fair, the meeting was highlighted by the hope of  creating a fitting climate to enable peace to dwell forever in  San Cristobal.    The collective effort carried out during Easter week was  designed to ease the tense climate, and it had a tranquilizing  effect that caused faith to return. The smile of the fair's  queen, "Maria de la Luz," was enough to raise the spirit of  those who believe that it will be difficult to smile again in  San Cristobal de las Casas.    Shortly after placing the crown on and delivering the  scepter  to the queen of the fair, Governor Javier Lopez Moreno pleaded  for San Cristobal to become "to a greater extent a center of  civilized coexistence among ethnic groups, religions, and  ideologies."    He said the city is not simply a common meeting ground for  the outlying communities. He said he hoped that "this fair will  be an sign, an announcement of what is to come. A peace that is  tolled by the bells and nurtured enthusiastically by us is an  active peace for all."</p>

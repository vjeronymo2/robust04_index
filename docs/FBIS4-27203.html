			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Komeito Secretary General  Yuichi Ichikawa urged the Social Democratic Party [of Japan,  SDPJ] Monday [30 May] to present "more realistic terms" in  seeking to rejoin the ruling coalition.    Ichikawa, arch ally of coalition architect Ichiro Ozawa,  told  a news conference, "I cannot approve of a reconfiguration of the  current administration only to achieve the goal of enticing the  SDP back into the coalition fold."    The veteran politician was commenting on a decision by the  SDP during a meeting in Tokyo of local representatives  nationwide to try to reintegrate itself into the government if  the current coalition agrees to replace its cabinet lineup with  a new one.    The SDP meeting adopted the strategy of forcing Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata to disband his minority cabinet by  offering to marshal 74 SDP legislators behind his administration  and transform it into a stable majority government.    The SDP stormed out of the coalition on April 26 over the  secret formation of a large non-SDP parliamentary voting bloc in  the House of Representatives.    Ichikawa expressed opposition to an SDP threat to support a  possible no-confidence motion against the Hata administration  unless Hata agrees to voluntarily disband his cabinet.    A no-confidence motion, if approved by a majority of the  lower chamber, would force Hata to choose between disbanding the  cabinet or calling a snap general election.    "Forcing a dissolution of the lower chamber while the  current  multiseat constituency system is still in place would amount to  crushing reform, whatever rationale they may cite for it," he  said.    Ichikawa expressed irritation at burgeoning rumors that some  quarters in the SDP may take advantage of the popularity of  incumbent Hokkaido Gov. Takahiro Yokomichi to marshal liberal  and left-leaning politicians behind him in a new political party.    Yokomichi "should give up the governorship immediately by  suspending his term as governor responsible for administration  for the prefecture of Hokkaido, if he wants to enter the central  political community," he said.    "Unless Yokomichi speaks from his heart (about the political  agenda), it is pointless to speculate (on his move)," Ichikawa  said.</p>

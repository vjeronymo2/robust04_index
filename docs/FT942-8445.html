			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / A season for sacrifices: John Murray Brown examines Turkey's economic crisis As Turks prepare for tomorrow's festival of the Sacrifice of Abraham, a gloomy mood pervades the capital Ankara. For this year's Bayram (Eid al-Adha), which families traditionally celebrate by exchanging gifts and slaughtering their favourite sheep, finds Turkey in the middle of its worst economic crisis in a decade. The sacrifice most Turks will make this year will be an economic one. For the government is steeling its political nerve to implement a set of measures which even the International Monetary Fund is concerned may prove overambitious. The prime minister Mrs Tansu Ciller is invoking the spirit of the war of independence against Greek and other forces in the 1920s in a bid to muster public support for her plan for national revival. Most bankers and economists, and some government officials, believe Turkey cannot get through the crisis alone. Much hangs on an IMF agreement. An IMF mission left Ankara on Wednesday after two weeks of negotiations on the austerity programme announced by Mrs Ciller on April 5. Turkey is seeking a one-year standby loan of about Dollars 450m to support its balance of payments, half of which could be immediately disbursed. Turkey will need the understanding of its foreign bankers if it is to escape a debt rescheduling. With about Dollars 4.7bn of medium- and long-term principal to be repaid this year, the government is also relying on measures from creditors such as the European Union and Japan to refinance this amount. Turkey's request for a standby loan is to be presented to the IMF board in July. The fund's approval would send a signal that international confidence in Turkey was rising. Until then, Mrs Ciller has to keep her adjustment measure on track, holding the line on wages in the current biannual talks with civil servants and public sector workers, and meeting repayments on Turkey's Dollars 66bn foreign debt, of which about Dollars 1.3bn is due at the end of June. Even if a standby agreement is concluded, funds would be frozen if Turkey slipped up on what are likely to be extremely strict performance targets set by the IMF. Moreover, any World Bank structural adjustment loans, also under negotiation in parallel with the IMF deal, would be put on hold. Turkey's foreign bankers may also consider cutting their lines of credit. This could lead to a balance of payments crisis, forcing Turkey to a full debt rescheduling with both the Paris and London clubs of creditors. Such a development would put Mrs Ciller's political survival at serious risk. Turkey's economic ills can only in part be laid at Mrs Ciller's door. The main reason is the refusal of successive governments to tackle growing fiscal deficits, the root cause of Turkey's persistently high inflation rate, which last month rose to an annualised 107 per cent. Second, the impact of new financial instruments such as asset-backed securities, has undermined the ability of Turkey's central bank to control the money supply. Third, Mrs Ciller last year launched an unsuccessful attempt to push down interest rates on government paper in a bid to reduce budget costs. In the first quarter of this year, without being able to borrow domestically and with the international debt markets closed off after a series of credit downgradings by the agencies Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the government was forced to go to the central bank for short-term advances to finance the budget. The resulting increase in money supply set in train a run on the Turkish lira. The lira has fallen in value by 50 per cent against the US dollar since January. Nevertheless, there are signs that confidence is slowly returning. Earlier this month, for the first time this year, the government sold Treasury bills at auction, albeit in relatively small volumes. Interest rates, having been as high as 400-500 per cent over the past three months, are edging down and the exchange rate appears to be stabilising at about TL33,000 to the dollar, compared with a low of TL41,000 in mid-April. Central bank reserves are recovering slightly, although at Dollars 3bn, they are at half the levels of 1993. The fiscal adjustment plan comprises both short-term stabilisation measures and longer-term structural reforms. It envisages halving the projected deficit to Dollars 2.8bn by the end of the year and slashing the public sector borrowing requirement from 17 per cent to 10 per cent of gross national product, through a Dollars 2.1bn one-off wealth tax, a 15 per cent real wage cut in the public sector, laying off 30,000 state workers, and speedier privatisation. Pain is being felt across the economy. Business people think the government is leaving companies to fend for themselves in an officially engineered recession, while calling on the private sector to make new tax contributions. Three banks have already been closed by the Treasury. The authorities recently introduced unlimited deposit insurance to stem the haemorrhaging of savings from the banking sector. The policy appears to have worked, although over the longer term, it could encourage banks to pursue imprudent practices. The State Planning Organisation is projecting a fall of 4 per cent in consumer demand this year, compared with growth in consumption of 13 per cent last year. On one day last week, for the first time, Turkey's car industry failed to sell a single vehicle. Imports have been hit hard in the wake of the lira's devaluation. According to Mr Cumhur Atilgan, of the International Transporters Association, more than half Turkey's truck fleet is stranded in Europe, unable to find a load for the return leg. But as a result of slower imports, officials say the current account should come back into balance or perhaps a small surplus this year, compared with a Dollars 6.4bn deficit in 1993. The real challenge for the government is to curb its own finances. Economists criticise the programme for relying too much on one-off measures such as tax charges on the rich, without proposing more sustainable sources of revenue. Mrs Ciller seems to be hostage to her own bold proposals. Having announced them with such a fanfare on April 5, she is reluctant to change course. In rejecting the IMF's suggestion to adopt a two- or three-year adjustment period, she may have one eye on her electoral calendar, aware that a general election has to be held before the end of 1996. Western diplomats are doubtful whether Mrs Ciller has the political authority to push the programme through. They point out that it is central government, over which she has direct control, which has taken the main brunt of the spending cuts. State enterprises run by ministries, where there is excess labour, have escaped relatively unscathed. For her programme to succeed, Mrs Ciller must keep wages down. But first she must convince workers that she is winning the battle against inflation. On this, the jury is out.</p>

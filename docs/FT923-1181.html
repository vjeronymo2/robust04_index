			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Letter: Smoothing in the short term, but long term? Sir, At the beginning of 1979 the pound was worth about FFr8.50. The French franc joined the EMS and, for most of the next 14 years, the pound stayed out. Today, the pound is again worth about FFr8.50. Both currencies have, therefore, in the long term, lost a similar amount against the D-Mark, one within the EMS and one, mainly, outside. The question cannot be avoided: apart from smoothing out short-term fluctuations, how can it be held that membership of the EMS preserves exchange rate parities?

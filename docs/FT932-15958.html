			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Hop across the border - Bernard Simon considers a deal between Miller Brewing of the US and Canada's Molson Breweries The wholesalers who distribute Miller beers in the US were given an unusual message at their national sales convention in Orlando, Florida, last month. Jack MacDonough, Miller Brewing's president, told them that the US's second-biggest brewer was putting its muscle behind the hitherto-competing brands of Canada's Molson Breweries. MacDonough encouraged the wholesalers to do likewise by buying the Molson distribution rights for their area. Miller and Molson had just signed a deal which, if it works, could become a model for similar partnerships between other consumer products companies. One party, in this case Miller, is eager to broaden its product range without the vast expense and risk of launching a new brand. The other, Molson, has a promising product but lacks the resources to make a significant dent in a large and unfamiliar foreign market. 'Everybody gets something great out of this,' enthuses John Carroll, president of Molson Breweries, the joint venture formed in 1989 between Canada's Molson Companies and Foster's Brewing of Australia. Under the deal, which took effect last week, Miller has bought the US marketing and distribution rights for Molson brands, the best-known of which include Molson Golden, Molson Canadian and Foster's. Miller will pay Molson a royalty on sales. The Milwaukee-based company has not just committed itself to spending specific amounts of money to boost Molson sales but is also contractually bound to achieve specific sales targets. Both companies declined to reveal details, other than to say that the marketing effort for Molson will be on a par with that for leading US domestic brands. As part of the deal, Miller has also become a partner in Molson's operations outside the US. It has acquired a 20 per cent stake in Molson Breweries, whose brands account for more than half the Canadian beer market. The two companies expect their co-operation to extend to such areas as purchasing, product development and brewery operations. Miller, which is the brewing arm of Philip Morris, the tobacco, food and drinks group, has long been regarded as the least aggressive of the leading US brewers. But it is now the only one with a foothold in all three countries which have signed the North American Free Trade Agreement. In its first investment outside the US, it acquired a minority stake late last year in Fomento Economico Mexicano (Femsa), one of Mexico's biggest beverage companies. Molson's market share in the US is currently a minuscule 0.8 per cent. But of the 400 imported beers sold in the US, Molson is second only to Heineken. Its market share reaches double digits in such border cities as Buffalo, New York and consumer research suggests it enjoys a much higher awareness among drinkers than its market share indicates. Miller's MacDonough says Molson is 'a terrific brand which has good growth potential if resources are put behind it'. Miller and Molson predict that US beer drinkers will be especially attracted by Molson's Canadian roots, which evoke images of a cool, clean and high-quality product. 'Over the next few years, we plan to build on the strengths that we've got and to establish those strengths in other markets,' says John Barnett, president of Molson USA, which is now a subsidiary of Miller. Molson is encouraged by the early results of three test campaigns which it launched last autumn in the New England states, Denver and Syracuse. Thanks to new labels and packaging and lower prices, Molson says the boost in sales so far has exceeded its expectations. Some of the increase appears to have come at the expense of US domestic brands. That raises the question whether any future gains made by Molson in the US will eat into the market share of Miller beers. MacDonough acknowledges there may be some cannibalism. 'When you expand the growth of Molson, that growth will come from domestic brands, more than from imports,' he says. But with Miller's brands accounting for 22 per cent of the market, he predicts 'it will impact the competition more than it will impact us'. The partnership also creates an awkward situation for Molson, which has the Canadian licence to brew Coors, one of Miller's chief rivals. Coors Light is among the most popular light beers in Canada and Molson is anxious that its deal with Miller should not jeopardise the Coors relationship. Miller has agreed that its representatives will not take part in any discussions between Molson and Coors. Molson beers are already available across the US but, in Barnett's words, 'just being there is not enough. It can be available because it's there, or it can be actively promoted and advertised. In a country of this size, there's an enormous difference between the two'. Furthermore, he says that Miller's knowledge of the US marketplace will give Molson access to 'significant ethnic markets that we have never really tried to understand.' With the Miller clout behind it, Molson expects that its beers will be displayed more prominently in retail outlets, such as the valuable end-of-aisle spots. It is also looking for Molson brands to be featured more often in retailers' flyers, and other promotional material. Within a day or two of the deal closing, MacDonough met Lintas, Molson's US advertising agency, to discuss Miller's marketing strategy. Miller salespeople who look after the accounts of big retail chains will in future also promote Molson products. For the time being, however, Miller and Molson will continue to have separate sales teams calling on wholesale distributors. The Canadians and Australians will be well satisfied if their link with Miller boosts Molson's share of the US beer market to 2.5 per cent over the next five years. That may seem a modest target, but it would triple Molson's present market share, putting it far ahead of Heineken, its main competitor. At that level, exports to the US would also equal half the total Canadian market. The survival of Molson's breweries in Canada, now running well below capacity and facing an inexorable decline in domestic beer consumption, would be assured.</p>

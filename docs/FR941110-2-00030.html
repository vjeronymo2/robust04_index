			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Koyo concludes that the below-cost allegation on which the Department predicated its cost investigation in the 1979/86 periods of review was both factually deficient and untimely and, accordingly, the Department should not investigate whether Koyo sold such or similar merchandise in the home market at prices below the COP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken disagrees with Koyo's assessment of Timken's 1983 below-cost allegation for the 1974/79 administrative reviews, stating that Koyo's argument contains several key errors and omissions, namely its failure to mention Timken's supplemental COP allegation of April 28, 1992, or its submission of August 19, 1988.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken notes that although the Department initiated a sales-below-cost investigation for the 1974/79 periods in September 1983, that investigation was subsequently interpreted to cover only the 1978/79 period, and was to encompass subsequent periods only if the Department found below-cost sales in the 1978/79 POR. Timken states that when the Department found that Koyo made below-cost sales during the 1978/79 POR, it issued a COP questionnaire for the 1979/86 PORs in July 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken states that, upon completion of the 1974/79 reviews, Koyo filed a CIT action challenging the Department's decision to conduct a COP investigation of Koyo. Timken elaborates on the history of that litigation: 1) the court ruled that Timken's original 1983 submission did not meet the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Al Tech  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> standard for initiation of a cost investigation and remanded the case for re-calculation of the margin without a COP analysis ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  796 F.Supp. 517 (CIT 1992); 2) on Timken's motion for rehearing, the CIT modified the remand order, permitting Timken to supplement its COP allegation without recourse to information obtained during the Department's initial COP investigation ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 16 CIT 92&hyph;139 at 11 (August 21, 1992)); 3) the Department determined and the CIT affirmed that Timken's supplemental allegation was a sufficient basis for the below-cost sales investigation ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd., et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 819 F.Supp. 1093 (CIT 1993)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the 1979/86 reviews, Timken asserts that it supplemented its prior allegations for the 1979 through 1986 reviews in April 1992, based on the COP data Koyo submitted in response to the July 1989 questionnaire and the variable cost data that would have been on the administrative record in any event. Timken notes that Koyo failed to address Timken's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> April 1992 submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If we find sales below cost in the immediately preceding segment of a proceeding, we have reasonable grounds to believe or suspect below-cost sales in the subsequent segment of the proceeding pursuant to section 773(b) of the Tariff Act. Therefore, we require a response to a cost questionnaire in an administrative review subsequent to finding sales below cost in a previous segment of the proceeding. We decided to proceed in the 1979/86 reviews with a cost investigation since, upon remand in the 1974/79 litigation, the Department conducted a cost investigation for 1978/79 and found sales below cost. The Department's finding of sales below cost in the 1978/79 review is an adequate foundation to conduct a cost investigation in the subsequent administrative reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 31:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken maintains that Koyo's COP information should be rejected in its entirety as unreliable because Koyo admitted that its primary records for COP prior to 1984 were destroyed. According to Timken, the information submitted by Koyo is simply an extrapolation of data from the 1985/86 POR. Moreover, the data have never been verified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken points out that the Department rejected Koyo's COP data for the 1978/79 review as inconsistent and unreliable and consequently used BIA. According to Timken, Koyo has not demonstrated that the cost information submitted for these reviews is any more accurate or reliable than the cost data rejected by the Department in the 1978/79 review. Moreover, Timken notes that corporate losses sustained by Koyo in the late 1970's and early 1980's makes it inherently unreasonable to extrapolate 1985/86 costs to this earlier period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken identifies the following specific deficiencies in Koyo's COP submissions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;From 1980&hyph;86 Koyo used three separate and irreconcilable COP systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

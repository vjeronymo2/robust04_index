			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Japan-based Peruvian economist and journalist </F> Marco Kamiya: "What Can Peru Expect From Japan?"]    [Text] "Peru at a Crossroads," "Fujimori's Country on Its  Deathbed," "Authoritarianism: The Only Alternative." Sound  familiar? These are the titles of a number of editorials  frequently appearing in the Japanese press. After learning the  results of the referendum, leading economic news daily NIHON  KEIZAI SHIMBUN was even more dramatic: "Fujimori deserves  Japan's help in continuing his revitalization of Peru."    It is a good sign. In 1989 and 1990, Peru was always linked  with news about terrorism, cocaine, and Machu Picchu. Since the  election of the "Nisei" president, Peru has merited a special  place in the media. Every event brings in correspondents and  sets off a wave of frantic telephone calls requesting  information. In terms of editorials, Fujimori and Clinton are  neck-and-neck.    Nevertheless, Japan's interest is more sentimental than  real.  The government has not funded enormous loans and businessmen do  not view Peru as an immediate investment possibility.    Nor have Tokyo's bureaucrats done much for Peru. Following  the killing of three Technical Cooperation engineers by  terrorists, the government suspended its technical exchanges  with the JICA [Japanese International Cooperation Agency]  program.    As for loans and the remission of debts, Japan conducts its  negotiations through the IMF and World Bank, organizations in  which Japan maintains an economic presence but has no  decision-making power, as a result of which its ability to apply  pressure in favor of a country such as Peru is limited. Japan  could also be accused of favoritism and thereby create problems  with its trading partners if it defends Peru.    There remain the nonrepayable cooperation loans, which are  minimal and used to guarantee sales of Japanese products in  Peru. In such cases, Japan loans money to Peru in order to  enable it to buy products from Matsushita or NEC. It is just a  form of insurance for those companies' sales abroad.    Nor does business offer any brighter prospects. Although  Keindaren, the Federation of Economic Organizations, has  publicly stated its interest in Peru, businessmen say privately  that the best policy for the time being is to see what happens.  Annual meetings of Japanese and Peruvian businessmen have also  been organized, the site alternating between Japan and Peru, but  enthusiasm has not grown.    This is but a reflection of the trend with respect to Latin  America. In 1991, Eximbank, Japan's Export-Import Bank, did a  survey of 115 leading Japanese businesses to ascertain their  investment plans for 1992 and 1993. Some 26 percent said they  would channel their investments to Europe, another 25 percent to  Asia, and 19 percent to the United States. Only 3 percent were  considering investing in Latin America. In addition, Peru is  rapidly forgotten when the Japanese view Chile as a growing  market and Colombia as the central pole for the expansion of  telephone systems in South America. Mexico is creating great  expectations as a result of its participation in the Free Trade  Agreement with the United States and Canada.    What are the determining factors for Japanese investment  abroad? The prime factor worldwide is the advantages to be  derived from ownership, meaning large-scale economies,  technological advantages, and high-level administrative  training. In second place are locational factors, i.e., barriers  to export markets and the availability of cheap labor and  natural resources. Ranking third are factors relating to  internationalization, meaning the possibility of controlling the  risk of losing technological control, easy terms for the  repatriation of capital, and administrative simplification for  setting up systems similar to the Japanese keiretsu.    Based on these elements and leaving the United States and  West Europe aside, Southeast Asia meets all the requirements  mentioned, followed by the former Socialist satellite countries,  Latin America and, lagging far behind, Africa.    In Latin America, the Japanese are less demanding. Before  investing, their demands can be summed up in three additional  conditions: 1) economic stability, meaning low inflation, the  obtainment of development plans, and low or "manageable" trade  union activity; 2) security against terrorist action aimed at  companies as well as individuals; and 3) political stability,  mainly meaning strong governments that can guarantee stable  rules of play in medium- and long-range terms. Business's  perception is that Peru was on its way to meeting the first two  conditions, but still had a way to go on the third, about which  doubt remained.    Shigeo Osonoi, professor at the Toyama University of Foreign  Studies and formerly a Japanese diplomat in Peru, thinks the  Japanese are very cautious and hopes the United States and  Europe will go in first to test the waters. Japan always goes in  later. If the Americans are enthusiastic about Peru, the  Japanese will get on the band wagon, Osonoi adds.    Economic relations have been maintained--not expanded--but  the figures show that they do not amount to much. For Peru,  Japan is the second-ranking buyer of Peruvian products after the  United States. As a seller, it comes in fifth after the United  States, Argentina, Brazil, and Germany. Japan's imports from  Peru total less than 1 percent and its exports amount to 5 or 6  percent (Chunanbei Shokoku Shiran 1992, Latin American Company,  Tokyo).    Although in historical terms, Japanese accumulated  investments are sizable (from 1950 to 1990, Peru ranked fifth in  Latin America, with $41.48 million), the situation has grown  stagnant. From 1985 to 1990, the figure amounted to a scant $20  million, which comes out to 0 when the total statistics are  calculated. From 1990 to 1992, rather than speaking of  investments, one would refer to the reinvestment of the profits  of companies already operating in the country (Panorama of  Industry and Japanese Economic Cooperation 1992, Latin American  Company, Tokyo).    While the economy has not been a very active channel between  Japan and Peru, diplomacy has endeavored to fill the vacuum.  Japan is the country that has put the most pressure on Fujimori  to restore legal order and constitutional rights after the  imposition of special powers [autogolpe]. The reason is clear:  Japan feels a certain degree of responsibility to Peru, but does  not want to suffer in the international community for supporting  a regime that could carry its authoritarianism to extremes.    Japan has always seconded the United States on international  issues. Only in three cases--all of them in Latin America--has  it opposed it: In Panama with Noriega, Japan did not impose  sanctions despite the American request to do so. During the war  in the Falkland Islands, it did not suspend commercial trade  with Argentina until events were well under way. Finally, in the  case of the "Fujicoup," it strongly resisted pressure to break  off relations. Such a defense implies risks. If there are  excesses, Tokyo could find itself in the delicate position of  having to defend the government before the international  community, endangering its possibilities of winning a seat on  the UN Security Council, damaging its relations with the United  States, and hurting its prospects of heading up a power bloc in  Asia.    At Japan's suggestion, Kabun Muto, then minister of foreign  relations, went to Venezuela in April to help restore relations  between Peru and Venezuela and, speaking off the record,  expressed the need for Fujimori's government to "legitimize  itself" by restoring Parliament so as not to be seen as a  civilian dictator. It is to be hoped that in the diplomatic  field, Japan will continue to maintain a low profile while  adopting a wait-and-see attitude.    Obviously, feelings count for very little in international  policy. Japanese capital and the official aid accompanying it  are governed by the simple laws of profitability. In Chile, the  minister of economy is also Japanese, but it is obvious that  that is not the reason why the main investments are channeled in  that direction. If political and economic stability can be  achieved in medium-range terms and if the government forms a  base of support by managing to rallying a certain social  consensus, the investments will flow. For Japanese private  capital, that is the most convincing argument.    For the time being, the only thing anyone knows for sure is  that Peru will continue to make the front page of Japanese  newspapers.  <H5>  [Box, p 47] </H5> <H5>  Peruvians in Japan: Nontraditional Export </H5>   In 1992, Peruvians working in Japan (the descendants of  Japanese) sent home to Peru anywhere between $80 million and  $150 million. For the past five years, Peruvian labor has been  the main nontraditional product exported to Japan.    It is an enormous sum for Peru. For example, in 1992, the  value of Peruvian products exported to Japan amounted to  approximately $600 million. Some 80 percent of those products  were minerals, 15 percent agricultural products such as coffee  and cacao, and 5 percent manufactured products, basically  textiles. Since the mid '80's, trade in the so-called  nontraditional exports has wavered between 5 and 8 percent. The  amount of money Peruvians send home to Peru could exceed the  revenue obtained from exporting coffee or textiles to Japan.    According to unofficial sources in the Peruvian Embassy,  some  70,000 Peruvians are living in Japan. According to the  Immigration Office in Lima, 60,000 have left. In 1989, that  figure was 10,000. This means that the number has risen by 8,000  a year!    Over half of the so-called dekasegui send--or were  sending--anywhere between $350 and $1,500 a month to Peru. All  of these figures are approximate because no statistics exist.  According to some estimates, over the past four years,  Brazilians (now numbering around 150,000) have sent a total of  $2 billion to their relatives.    It is hoped that the amount of money sent will drop  drastically in the months ahead. As a result of the recession,  there is no work in factories, forcing many to return to their  native countries.</p>

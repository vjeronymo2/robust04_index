			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Economics Notebook: Anatomy of a stalled reform programme Was President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela hounded out of office because of the price of bus tickets in Caracas? Or because his government failed to tell people in advance that bus fares were to rise? Or because the increases were introduced at the end of month when most workers in Caracas had little left of their monthly pay packets? The rises in transport prices in February 1991 - three weeks into Mr Perez's second term of office - triggered riots which engulfed the capital. The trauma that this set off coloured the rest of his presidency. The fate of Mr Perez, suspended from office on May 21 this year on corruption charges, may thus not have been decided by the big decisions of his economic reform programme but by the apparently insignificant issues he ignored. As the Russian president Boris Yeltsin is finding out, the path for those who promote economic reform is not easy. A book* by Moises Naim, a former industry minister, casts new light on what he calls the 'reverse Midas touch' of successive Venezuelan governments. It dissects the Perez reform programme, of which he was part, and zeroes in on its failures. It provides an object lesson for those with similar projects elsewhere in the world. Although managing economies dominated by a single commodity is notoriously difficult - Venezuela earns four fifths of its foreign exchange from oil - the country was even two years ago regarded as one of the Latin American countries best placed for success. Now it is viewed as one of the region's less stable countries, a legacy of two 1992 military coup attempts and a political crisis as yet unresolved. Mr Perez took office facing a host of problems: foreign currency reserves were sorely depleted, the fiscal deficit exceeded 9 per cent of GDP, the current account deficit was at a record high and prices of most basic products were artificially and unsustainably repressed. A system of price controls and regulation had grown up over decades. The government even controlled the price of a cup of coffee in a cafe - which was different depending on whether you drank it at the counter or sitting at a table. The repression of prices became particularly intense in the last year or so of the government of President Jaime Lusinchi, Perez's predecessor. It produced severe shortages of goods and, as in the Soviet Union, supermarket shelves emptied because of hoarding and capacity closures. On the streets, tensions rose since this followed years in which most people had become poorer and public services had deteriorated. It was against this background that the Caracas bus fare rises took place. Nobody knew about them in advance: 'In what later proved to be a systematic flaw of the Perez administration, the government failed to communicate its decision in a timely and effective manner,' says Naim. The timing of the increases was bad. Furthermore, the Caracas police force was in crisis and let rioting take hold. It was a day-and-a-half before Perez decided to bring in the army. The government had decided on a shock approach to freeing prices, but it was not, Naim makes clear, driven by ideology, 'more by the lack of administrative capacity to introduce reforms gradually'. The price inspection administration simply was not functioning. The aim of the government was to replace a system of generalised price controls and subsidies with programmes aimed directly at the poor. The government set up parallel organisations to sidestep the traditional bureaucracies, run for the benefit of political party loyalists and the trade unions. During the 1980s, these corrupt bureaucracies were responsible for spending 10 to 14 per cent of GDP on social programmes. The government spent three times more per head on health than Chile, Jamaica or Panama, but had an infant mortality rate that was 200 per cent higher than Jamaica's, 80 per cent higher than Chile's and 30 per cent higher than Panama's. In education, the government spent more than four times as much per student as Chile, Jamaica and Argentina, yet suffered the worst illiteracy rates in the region. The administration needed the support of the political parties in Congress, in particular his own Accion Democratica. Yet the AD hierarchy was adamantly opposed to reform having spent, as Naim says, 'most of the 1980s profiting from the many opportunities to serve as a broker between society and the state'. The parties had been captured by special interests and over time the state came to depend for its survival on the specific groups that benefited from its policies. Yet the president and his advisers continued to use the political parties - and other exhausted organisations such as the trades union and employers' federations equally remote from the population - to explain policies. His fatal error may simply have been that he made no effort to reach out direct to society. Perez became the lightning rod for the genuine ills suffered by Venezuelans, who blamed the reform programme rather than the preceding decades of government incompetence for their troubles. Corruption - ironically probably lessened by the reform process - became the stick with which to beat him and eventually remove him from office. The army - the other element in his downfall - was another exhausted institution without clear organisational goals. As the country heads towards presidential and congressional elections in December, it continues in a state of uncertainty. The element of hope is that a genuine democracy will be able to override the special interests that forced the Perez programme into the sand. Venezuela is in transition, but to what is unclear. Naim quotes the Italian political scientist, Antonio Gramsci: 'The ancient is dying and the new has yet to be born. In this interlude, monsters are bred.' *Paper Tigers &amp; Minotaurs by Moises Naim. Published by the Carnegie Endowment; distributed by Brookings Institution, Dept 029, Washington DC 20042, USA.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Like the domestic vehicle manufacturers, the foreign manufacturers recommended numerous other changes in the proposed regulation, relating to such things as how the value of passenger motor vehicle equipment is determined, how the engine and transmission countries of origin are determined, the responsibilities of suppliers, how currencies should be converted, the time when the label must be attached to the vehicle, and what requirements are appropriate with respect to maintenance of records and reporting content information to the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA received comments from several suppliers and one supplier trade association, the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association (APMA). That association stated that if the agency does not adopt the AIAG model of content calculation, the regulation should specifically state how outside suppliers should calculate U.S./Canadian content. APMA stated that the proposed rule relies on the definitions of ``value added'' and ``foreign content'' in the statute, but that neither the statute nor the regulation give specific regulatory direction concerning how outside suppliers are to calculate ``value added in the U.S./Canada.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency also received comments from two dealer associations, the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) and the American International Automobile Dealers Association (AIADA). These organizations submitted comments which focused on dealer responsibilities and other issues of concern to dealers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA also received comments from final stage manufacturers and the National Truck Equipment Association (NTEA), a trade association representing distributors and manufacturers of multi-stage produced work-related trucks, truck bodies and equipment. These comments focused on issues of concern to final stage manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Overview of Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's final rule establishes a new regulation, 49 CFR Part 583, Automobile Parts Content Labeling, to implement section 210 of the Cost Savings Act. The regulation establishes requirements for (1) Manufacturers of passenger motor vehicles; (2) suppliers of motor vehicle equipment used in the assembly of passenger motor vehicles; and (3) dealers of passenger motor vehicles. A summary of the requirements is set forth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] As a deputy to the municipal people's congress  elected by Xuanwu District, Chen Xitong, secretary of the  municipal party committee, joined the group discussion held by  the Xuanwu District delegation on the government work report on  the afternoon 9 April. [passage omitted]    Chen Xitong listened attentively to the speeches given by  the  deputies and took notes. He said: The deputies have given many  good opinions and suggestions. To promote Beijing's work, the  wisdom and concerted efforts of the deputies and the people of  Beijing are indispensable. This year, Beijing should put  stability in the first place. Stability is the prerequisite. We  should resolutely safeguard the political and social stability  of the capital. Without a stable and united situation, reform  cannot be conducted, nor can development be achieved. Speaking  on the medical system, Chen Xitong said: The reform of the  medical system should be coordinated with the endeavor to  accelerate establishment of the social security system. The  principle of the reform is to actively protect people's health  and change the past practice of eating form the common big pot  and letting the state take care of everything into the practice  that burdens are shared by various fields of society together.    Chen Xitong emphasized: We should earnestly address the  specific problems in people's live, ensure the steady  improvement of their living standard, and, in particular,  improve the conditions of difficult plants, difficult shops,  difficult schools, difficult households, and poverty-stricken  households in mountainous areas. We should help them reduce  deficits and increase profits. Speaking on improvement of  literary and art organizations, Chen Xitong said: Municipal  leaders should go deep into literary and art organizations to  conduct investigation and study, find out problems, and work out  ways to address them. Literary and art organizations should, on  the one hand, conduct reform and, on the other, continuously  improve their artistic quality and create the literary and art  works that are loved by the masses so that the literary and art  stages of the capital can be made more flourish.</p>

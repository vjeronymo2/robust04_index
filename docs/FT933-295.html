			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (7): The Japanese connection / Review of the effort to attract Pacific Rim investors IT IS hardly surprising that Peru should have developed a special relationship with Japan. Mr Fujimori is the first president of Japanese descent anywhere else in the world, and the Japanese are fascinated by his rise to international prominence. Mr Fujimori has visited the land of his ancestors five times since his 1990 election. When the international community reacted with hostility to last year's institutional coup, Tokyo expressed 'understanding'. Since then, Japan has played a leading role in the 'support group' of friendly countries which is helping out on Peru's balance of payments. Donations have also flowed. Goodwill, however, has not translated into direct Japanese investment. Figures from Conite, the Peruvian body which monitors foreign investment, indicate that less than 3 per cent of the money entering Peru in the first half of 1993 came from the cautious Japanese. The Japanese already wield considerable influence in Peru, which has the largest nikkei colony (about 70,000), bar Brazil, in Latin America. Mr Fujimori's rise has propelled several traditionally low-profile Japanese-Peruvians into positions of prominence. Mr Jaime Yoshiyama, president of congress, and Mr Daniel Hokama, mines minister and privatisation supremo, are just the tip of the oriental iceberg. Most privatisation committees, and many of the remaining state companies and regional governments have an appointed official with a Japanese surname. Mr Fujimori does not hide his Asian roots. In an early June trip to Seoul, he offered the South Koreans an area of the Peruvian coast to serve as an industrial free zone. The proposal is under evaluation. The Korean government has reciprocated by offering Dollars 18m to rehabilitate the airport at Cuzco, expected to spearhead a future tourist boom. And engineers from Korea's Daewoo Corporation are drawing up plans for improving the La Paz to Ilo road link, Bolivia's outlet to the sea. The Chinese, meanwhile, made the single largest investment in Peru for many years when the Shougang Corporation bought ailing iron producer Hierro Peru for Dollars 312m last November. Shougang plans further investments in agro-industry and the fishing sector - Peruvian fishmeal sales to China topped Dollars 300m last year, around 10 per cent of all export earnings. The Chinese are potential buyers for some of Pesca Peru's fishmeal processing plants, due for sell-off in coming months. China National Mining and China Non-Ferrous are interested in forthcoming mining sector privatisations. Mr Hernan Barreto, chairman of Centromin, reported 'enormous interest' in Peruvian copper and iron on his recent visit to China - apparently in anticipation of a construction boom if Beijing succeeds in becoming the venue for the Olympics in seven years' time. Mr Tony Chen, majority shareholder and president of Bandesco, a small but active Lima-based bank, is helping to 'bridge the Pacific', as he puts it. Taiwanese-born Mr Chen has excellent links with mainland China and is already involved with two joint ventures with Shougang. Bandesco is channelling financing for small and medium-sized Peruvian businesses via Korea's Eximbank and hopes to do the same with a Taiwanese government guarantee fund. Mr Chen's bank has also established two trading and leasing arms of Bandesco to help Korean manufacturing companies, looking at expansion opportunities in Latin America, set up in Peru. 'Peru has relatively low labour costs and preferential access to certain markets,' he says. 'Korea has the technical expertise, the customers and experience in foreign trade which Peru does not. I think it will be a successful partnership.' Mr Victor Joy Way, former minister of trade and industry and now Peru's third vice-president, is of Chinese descent and has longstanding commercial experience with the Pacific Rim countries. He says Peru's geographical position makes it attractive for Asian countries. 'What's more,' he says, 'unlike most Latin American countries, Peru is a racial melting-pot where Asians can easily feel at home.' The popular Mr Fujimori - affectionately known, as are all orientals in Peru, as the 'chino' - proves his point.</p>

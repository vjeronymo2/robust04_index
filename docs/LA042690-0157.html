			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> POLLUTER POLICY CHANGE CRITICIZED  </P> <P> Twelve members of California's Democratic congressional delegation signed a  letter urging Republican Gov. George Deukmejian to reconsider the state's  decision to let some toxic polluters clean up their wastes without direct state  supervision or inspection. "Mr. Governor, with all due respect, toxic polluters  are not the best candidates for the honor system," said the letter, which was  written in response to a story in The Times revealing the previously unheralded  policy shift. The letter acknowledged that the program is designed to speed up  cleanup of the state's 345 major toxic sites, but it said: "Your Administration  should allocate greater resources to this high priority responsibility rather  than turn the job over to the polluting industry."  </P> <P> The letter was initiated by Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez). It was co-signed  by fellow Democrats Henry A. Waxman and Edward R. Roybal of Los Angeles; Howard  L. Berman of Panorama City; Matthew G. Martinez of Montebello; George E. Brown  Jr. of Colton; Don Edwards of San Jose; Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco; Ronald  V. Dellums of Oakland; Gary Condit of Ceres; Tom Lantos of San Mateo and  Barbara Boxer of Greenbrae.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT TO RULE ON SPIRITUAL HEALING DEATHS  </P> <P> A panel of the Minnesota Court of Appeals has been asked to decide whether  Christian Science parents can face criminal penalties if their children die  after receiving only spiritual healing treatment for serious illness.  </P> <P> The panel heard arguments July 11 in St. Paul on an appeal by Hennepin County  of an April ruling by Hennepin County Judge Eugene Farrell that dismissed  second-degree manslaughter charges against a Christian Science couple in the  death of Ian Douglass Lundman.  </P> <P> The 11-year-old boy's mother and stepfather, Kathleen and William McKown, were  indicted after he died of insulin deficiency May 9, 1989, in the couple's  Independence, Minn., home. Before his death, the boy had been sick with  flu-like symptoms for three days. The government claimed that by relying only  on prayer to cure the boy's illness, the couple had negligently caused his  death by creating an unreasonable risk.  </P> <P> Farrell dismissed the charges on grounds that parents who rely on spiritual  healing for their children's health care can't be punished for criminal child  neglect when that care is less than successful.  </P> <P> Hennepin County Atty. Tom Johnson told the appeals panel that while the  parents' religious beliefs have absolute protection under the law, their  actions do not.  </P></p>

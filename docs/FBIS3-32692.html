With the signing of Brazil, the main cocoa-producing country  that had not yet signed the agreement, what is now missing is  the massive participation of the consumers so that the agreement  can become effective. The European union is the main cocoa  consumer. Brazilian diplomats reported last week that the  Europeans will sign the agreement.    The new agreement is based on production and consumer  committees with the objective of promoting the development and  strengthening of the sector. Sergio Moreira Lima, chief of  Itamaraty's Basic Products Division, told this newspaper that  "there is a commitment to seek a balance between supply and  demand and thus prevent the overproduction of cocoa that has  been responsible for the low prices during the past five or six  years."    According to the diplomat, while the agreement is not in  effect, there is the policy of the Alliance of Cocoa-Producing  Countries, which functions independently from the international  agreement and it is working to seek a balance within the market.  The Alliance, which has its seat in Lagos, met some two months  ago in Quito, where the producers agreed to a new production  policy with the implementation of ceilings.    The producing countries desire the participation of the  consumers in the agreement because the success of the new policy  will depend on the consumers' commitment to encourage an  increase in the consumption of cocoa within their own countries.    The diplomats admit that the main concern is the European  union's pressure to replace cocoa butter with similar products,  such as margarine, which would lead to a 200,000 ton annual  reduction in the consumption of cocoa.    Moreira Lima said that "the importing countries must make an  effort to reduce the obstacles that block an expansion of cocoa  consumption."    The agreement will be implemented after it has been ratified  by five exporting countries that will be responsible for 80  percent of the total world exports. The endorsement by consumer  countries that must commit themselves to a minimum of 60 percent  of the total imports is another condition for the agreement to  go into effect.</p>

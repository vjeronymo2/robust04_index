			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Nationwide cuts cost income ratio to 48.1%  -Internal reforms and adoption of more cautious lending policies showing through THE PAST year has been one of difficulty and upheaval at Britain's second largest building society. But it has ended with Nationwide in rather better shape to rebut the critics who regard the Pounds 35bn-asset society as a lumbering giant that had to focus its efforts to survive in a harsher world. The difficulties of the year encompassed personalities and commercial strength. Two of its most senior directors left during the year, while its ability to raise funds cheaply in wholesale money markets were affected by the downgrading of its short-term debt rating by Standard &amp; Poor's. The society also had to trade through one of the most difficult years in the UK housing market, as house prices in the south continued to fall, and interest rates rose. The result was to push 15 per cent of its borrowers into arrears, and at least 100,000 into holding 'negative equity'. If Nationwide was a publicly-quoted company, shareholders might have been impatient over its performance since the merger with the Anglia Building Society in 1987. Even as a society that would have to agree to a merger, it is often mooted as a potential acquisition target for Lloyds Bank. Yet Nationwide's results yesterday depict a society that has finally managed to reduce its ratio of costs to income to a respectable level. It also managed to strengthen its capital ratios without recourse to more than a single issue of Pounds 100bn subordinated debt during the year. 'Lots of people used to see Nationwide as a swimmer who was out of sight of the shore, and some doubted whether it could even swim, but it is a lot closer to dry land now,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS, yesterday. It has made progress by concentrating on internal reforms while adopting more cautious lending policies. Assets hardly rose last year - from Pounds 34.1bn to Pounds 34.9bn. It adopted stricter lending criteria, and increased its net interest margin to 2.43 per cent from 2.21 per cent. At the same time, it cut management expenses by reducing staff and closing 60 estate agency branches. Expenses fell by 2.7 per cent as it reduced staff by 1,500 - including 650 redundancies. This helped the cost income ratio to fall to 48.1 per cent, excluding restructuring costs of Pounds 52.6m. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive, argued that the biggest upheaval in its 730-branch network is now over, but further cuts are likely in central administration. 'Our administration is still cumbersome to a degree, and we can make changes in the long term to save money,' he said. A second immediate problem has been the society's exposure to the southern housing market. Its short-term debt downgrading by Standard &amp; Poor's in December cited both its high cost base and its mortgage insurance which provided 'stop loss' down to 80 per cent of original value. Mr Alistair Dales, who became finance director during the year after the departure of Mr Daniel Hodson, the deputy chief executive, to head the London International Financial Futures Exchange, said the society had been making efforts to improve arrears to convince ratings agencies of its worth. He said there had been a 5 per cent fall in the number of borrowers more than two months in arrears during the year. Mr Dales argued that its relatively high level of provisions relative to assets reflected both the southern bias of its lending and its policy of avoiding repossession. Yet while the society shows signs of recovery, there is still some way to go. Although its ratio of tier 1 capital to assets - calculated by UBS - strengthened to 8.97 per cent compared with 8.38 per cent last year, its pre-tax return on capital fell to 11.9 per cent (12.5 per cent). Mr Melville-Ross acknowledged that shareholders might have become impatient with a public company that only performed to this level, but emphasised the improvements. 'Because we are a mutual we have a bit more time, but that does not mean we are less determined to make progress.'</p>

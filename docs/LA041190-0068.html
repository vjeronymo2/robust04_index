			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOW THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT;  </P> <P> SECRET MEXICO-U.S. DRUG CHASE WAS A CONFIDENCE-BUILDER  </P> <P> Officially, the top-secret aerial mission over northern Mexico didn't happen.  </P> <P> In fact, neither Washington nor Mexico City will confirm that a U.S. radar  plane recently pursued a suspicious aircraft from Colombia into Mexican  airspace. When the Colombian plane landed on a remote airstrip near Monclova,  just south of the border, the U.S. Customs Service alerted Mexican authorities,  who nabbed eight smuggling suspects and 1,700 pounds of cocaine.  </P> <P> But it did happen, as Times correspondents Marjorie Miller and Douglas Jehl  have reported. The incident shows that two governments that have often been  critical of each other, especially on the touchy issue of drug smuggling, can  cooperate when they want to -- although that is not the main lesson of  Monclova. Even before he was elected, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari was saying publicly that drug trafficking poses as great a threat to  his country as it does to the United States. While Mexicans don't abuse drugs  to the extent U.S. citizens do, the corruption that comes with drug trafficking  helps undermine whatever trust Mexicans have in their police and, ultimately,  their political system. And, sure enough, five suspects taken into custody by a  task force of special Mexican federal agents at Monclova were local Mexican  officials (the other three were Colombian citizens).  </P> <P> So despite the cynical suspicion by many Americans that the Mexicans won't  cooperate with us because they know that many of their own officials are up to  their ears in drug trafficking, the Monclova operation was a success. One  likely reason: It was kept quiet until after it happened. That's a noteworthy  contrast to the flap caused recently when Pentagon officials boldly announced  they were sending a Navy task force to anchor off Colombia to intercept drug  smugglers without bothering to tell the Colombians first. The outcry in Bogota  proved that Mexicans are not the only Latin Americans sensitive about  heavy-handed gringo interference.  </P> <P> So if Washington has more operations like Monclova in mind -- and it should --  the odds of success are higher if it avoids making big, public productions out  of them. It just takes some sensitivity to Latin Americans' sensibilities. They  know that their people are involved in drug trafficking, and that some of their  cops are crooked. But so are some of ours. Instead of shouting about it, let's  offer help quietly, so nobody gets embarrassed. That way only the bad guys wind  up angry and frustrated.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A source close to the Haitian Army denies the  accusations brought against the Haitian police chief, Lieutenant  Colonel Joseph Michel Francois. According to the charges, the  police chief has allegedly supported a lucrative drug trade  between Colombia and the United States, through Haiti. Gabriel  Taboada, a former Colombian drug trafficker, asserted before the  [U.S. Senate] Drug Trafficking and Terrorism Subcommission that  he met Michel Francois during a meeting with Pablo Escobar in  (Colombia). Former Haitian President Prosper Avril also  participated in that meeting.    The source, who wishes to remain anonymous, has pointed out  that Col. Francois' last trip took place in 1981 before  [corrects himself] after he was commissioned. He went to the  United States for proficiency courses in security. Since then,  he has never gone abroad. How can Taboada assert that he met  Col. Francois in 1984, our source wonders.    Let us recall that upon the return of Col. Francois, he was  appointed to the Corps of Heavy Vehicles [as heard] of the  presidential guard at the National Palace.</p>

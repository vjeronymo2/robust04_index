An address on the  current international situation in the light of the Geneva  negotiations was delivered by Radovan Karadzic, president of the  Srpska republic. Here is a report by [name indistinct]:    [Correspondent] [passage indistinct] On the ground the  situation is characterized by Muslim attacks on our positions  and the stage-managing of bloody incidents in Sarajevo, the most  tragic of which took place in Markale, and which has already  been proven to have been perpetrated by the Muslim side.  However, this incident was one of the heaviest blows on us by  the international community because the blame was put on us as  usual, Karadzic said, adding:    [Karadzic] "On 6 February this year [passage indistinct].  Both sides were to hand in their heavy weapons -- Sarajevo was  thus to be taken off from the world headlines, as the Muslim  side in Sarajevo heavily used it for its propaganda against us.    "As you know, on 9 February the ultimatum was issued, which  more or less contained what we had agreed with Mr. Akashi, and  so we adjusted our actions to be exclusively in accordance with  the agreement with Mr. Akashi. However, there was no firm will  to withdraw the weapons or partly to place them under control,  because our agreement with Akashi did not set that out.  However, the international community assessed -- maybe Russia  did it on its own or in cooperation with others -- that a  dangerous moment came as the Serbs had not withdrawn their  weapons seven days prior to the expiration of the ultimatum, and  that NATO would inevitably strike [passage indistinct] and that  it would be good to make a compromise with the Serbs. A  compromise was made when Churkin arrived bringing a message from  President Yeltsin to President Milosevic and to us here saying  that the Russians were guaranteeing the cease-fire, and we then  reached a situation whereby we could accept that proposal.  Thus, in addition to the United States, we ushered Russia and  Russian diplomacy through a wide-open door to the resolution of  that problem. You know what happened afterwards.    "After the ultimatum -- which is the ultimate form of  pressure, the worst pressure, the hardest threat -- U.S.  diplomats came to us. The ultimatum may have been in the  service of opening a door [word indistinct] success for the U.S.  diplomacy. And the U.S. diplomacy, as the United States is  biased first to the benefit of the Muslims and then of the  Croats, started working with the Muslims and the Croats. Back  on 9 and 10 February we were informed in Geneva by Mr. Redman,  the U.S. envoy [passage indistinct] because of our entire  history in 20th century and then we thought that this was a  solution.    "The difficulties that arose in connection with a European  Union proposal on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina into three  parts started being overcome as a possibility to divide Bosnia  into two parts emerged. We had earlier heard some presumptions  in the European circles about Bosnia-Herzegovina being divided  into two parts in several options: one option was this -- that  the Croats and Muslims should unite into one state with the  Serbs remaining in another one. The second option was that the  Muslims should go with the Serbs and set up a Serb-Muslim state,  i.e., some kind of a state, or to join Yugoslavia, and the third  option was that Bosnia should be divided between the Serbs and  the Croats, because of some tendencies in the Tuzla basin to  join Yugoslavia, while in Zenica (?and Cazin) there were  tendencies to join Croatia. That option would not have been  favorable for the Muslims, neither were we crazy about this  option, as we deem that the antagonizing of our ethnic  communities would have continued. There were some other options  of division into two states.    "Considering the new campaign and partial military successes  by the Muslim side, there was the danger that Croats might lose  all their territory, which was not in our interest, despite the  fact that we have been enemies almost throughout the 20th  century. We believe that we should reach a solution  satisfactory for all three nations, and only such a solution can  be lasting and stable. A solution which would possibly harm  Serbs or Croats would be particularly unfavorable, because the  basis of the stability in the Balkans is in the relations  between Serbs and Croats.    "Realistically, and from a political point of view, that is  a  signature of two sovereign nations and their legitimate  representatives which regulates the life of those national  communities in their territories. Therefore, that signature has  suspended any kind of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- a unitary one, a  union or any kind of [word indistinct]. Simply, from the legal  and political point of view, since the signing,  Bosnia-Herzegovina has been in the status [word indistinct];  Bosnia-Herzegovina is now material from which everyone makes  what they believe they should and can make."    [Correspondent] Meanwhile, we have strengthened our  relations with Russian diplomacy. [Bosnian Serb] Foreign  Minister Aleksa Buha visited Russia. Our delegation stayed in  Russia for three days. We had a meeting with Churkin, worked on  the possibilities of opening Tuzla airport and on the resolution  France insisted on for Sarajevo. The results are obvious, by  the mere fact that the resolution became acceptable for us, that  is, less unacceptable than it was. Karadzic had the following  to say about the current positions:    [Karadzic] "As far as the conference is concerned, we have  been bypassed, not to say expelled, or left behind like orphans.  They met there and are now creating their own state. But for  us, this has more good than bad sides: we do not have to accept  what we did not take part in preparing, we do not have to join  it in this form. We can open up a completely new process of  negotiating as the situation created by the signing is  completely new to us.    "Nobody has the right nor can call on us to join, as we are  not a nation to be attached, we are just as much sovereign as  the Croats and the Muslims are. They have to recognize the same  rights to us, the same rights that they have given themselves.  And [word indistinct] documents that Mr. [name indistinct]  mentioned as being a base for their (?setting up), that is the  sovereign right and the state-building right of those two  nations."    [Correspondent] Karadzic then warned that the European Union  [EU] promised to lift the sanctions to reward the willingness to  cooperate and concessions given by the Serb side. However, the  European Union has not fulfilled this. In connection with the  future of the peace process, i.e. the continuation of peace  negotiations Karadzic said:    [Karadzic] "We are in a situation whereby we shall continue  negotiations although Resolution 820 is still in force; this  resolution is exclusively in connection with our rejection of  the Vance-Owen plan. The acceptance of the EU plan in two  different forms has not made anyone think about suspending  Resolution 820. That is a resolution that is strangling the  Serb people, strangling entire Yugoslavia and [words  indistinct], all the documents, oil for humanitarian purposes,  and so on.    "We have to decide whether we shall join any kind of  conference that was prepared without us, whose official  documents were examined, prepared and adopted by the two sides  in our complete absence. Then, decide whether we shall join any  international conference if the international community does not  make some goodwill gestures and recognize the Serb willingness  to cooperate. We are not asking them to abolish the sanctions  and say that Serbia is not guilty, although it is clear to the  entire world now that Serbia is not to blame. But we want them  at least to fulfill their basic promises, i.e. comply with  agreements which forced us to make some political and  territorial concessions. We are not asking them to make a final  judgement about the inadequacy of the sanctions, that Serbia is  not to blame, that it is not responsible and is not involved in  fighting. We are asking for a practical approach to the Serbs  in their carrot-and-stick policy. In one hand they are holding  a [word indistinct], in another one a stick. We are wondering  what they are offering the Serbs. In both hands they are  holding a stick. If they had three hands they would be holding  three sticks."    [Correspondent] In this report, we would like to single out  one more segment from President Karadzic's address. It refers  to a decision by the United Nations Security Council providing  for the deployment of Turkish troops in Bosnia:    [Karadzic] "The latest decision by a committee granting the  right to the Secretary General to accept Turkish troops in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is leading us to believe that a big Balkan  conflict is being prepared. If this conflict becomes necessary  to the international players, full conditions for a big Balkan  war will be created by the deployment of the Turkish troops. We  are calling on the Secretary General never to invite a  neighboring country, no country -- former occupier -- to deploy  their troops here neither as observers, technicians, such as  technicians [passage indistinct].    "Reasons of good taste should guide the German Government to  keep its hands away from the remainder of Yugoslavia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The greater German state policy and  diplomacy have left their fingerprints all over the ruins of  Yugoslavia. The history will show it, Germany is to blame and  is responsible for the redefining of the outcome of World War  II. Let it be the concern for Britain and France, for Slovenia  and Croatia, that again came under the German influence and  which enabled Germany to win World War II at the negotiating  table. Our concern is that this should not refer to us. We won  World War II, we have won this war, and we want Germany to stay  away from us.    "Now to speak about Turkey. If Turkish troops are deployed,  even if in our neighboring country -- the Muslim-Croat  federation -- we will then demand that the Yugoslav troops,  troops of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as a UN member and  as a neighboring country, be deployed on our side."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] British Secretary of State for Education John Patten  says he sensed a great desire on the part of Malaysia and  Britain to bring business back on normal footing as soon as  possible. He said this was his impression from meetings with  various ministers and British businessmen during his three-day  visit to Malaysia which ended today. He was anxious that the  flow of investment from the United Kingdom into Malaysia  continues because he thinks that it would be a benefit to both  countries. Patten, the highest-ranking official to visit  Malaysia since the Malaysian Government slapped a ban on  awarding government projects to British companies in February.  Patten said that once he returned home, he would try his best  to give a picture that relations between the two countries were  getting better again and that investment opportunities in  Malaysia were too good for British investors to miss.</p>

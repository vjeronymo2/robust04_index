A meeting was scheduled later Thursday in the Bosnian  Serb stronghold of Pale between the head of the UNHCR mission in  Bosnia-Hercegovina, Karin Abu-Zayd, and the separatist  republic's vice-president Nikola Koljevic, said UNHCR spokesman  Kris Janowski.    Karadzic had personally assured UN special representative to  ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi the trucks would be returned as  soon as possible, Janowski said. Convoys would again start  moving from the Croatian capital Zagreb to the Maglaj region  once the United Nations obtained security guarantees, he said,  adding that convoys however were still leaving from Zenica, in  central Bosnia.    The stolen trucks were parked at a Bosnian Serb barracks in  Tezlic, southwest of Maglaj, a mainly-Moslem enclave which  received its first aid convoy in five months on Sunday after  Serb forces eased their siege, the spokesman said.    Rogue Bosnian Serb forces hijacked a 10-truck UN aid convoy  taking 94 tonnes of food and other aid to Maglaj on Wednesday  near Teslic. Serb soldiers, led by a colonel whom Karadzic said  would be punished, threatened the Danish drivers and forced them  to abandon the trucks, Jankowski said. The Serbs starting  loading the trucks' contents onto civilian trucks, but when it  turned out to be a lengthy operation, they stole the trucks, the  spokesman said, adding that Serb police guarding the convoy  "evaporated." The Danish drivers were abducted, then found a few  hours later at Zepce, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the  south, in a Bosnian Croat-held area. One of the trucks was  recovered later, he said.    Jankowski described the theft as a "very serious incident."  He said Pale late Wednesday "declared itself quite upset and  surprised" at what had happened.    Two UNHCR convoys have reached Maglaj from Zenica and two  others from Tesanj, north of Maglaj, since British UN  peacekeepers entered the town Sunday. Before that, the town of  16,000 had been supplied for the past five months mainly by air  drops. No convoys had been sent in since October, when two  Danish drivers of a UNHCR convoy were assassinated as they were  entering Maglaj.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CENSORSHIP FORUM SET FOR SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A group of San Diego artists has scheduled a public forum -- paid for under a  National Endowment for the Arts grant issued to support a public education  campaign dealing with censorship issues -- for Sunday titled "Art: Framed,  Censorship and the NEA, 1989."  </P> <P> It will last from noon to 3 p.m. and be at the Installation Gallery, 930 E St.,  San Diego.  </P> <P> The program will include an appearance by Elizabeth Sisco, a San Diego artist  who resigned from an NEA visual arts review panel last month to protest the  endowment's withdrawal of a grant -- later reinstated -- for an AIDS-related  art show in New York City.  </P> <P> Sisco said the program was not intended to be directly provocative. But a press  release announcing it said the NEA-funded program will address the question "Is  art which dares to criticize too much art for the U.S. government to support?"  ALLAN PARACHINI  </P></p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Brought to book at last A SPLENDID party took place this week in the garden of St James's Square, in London. Some hundreds of authors, publishers, reviewers, and  - most importantly - readers gathered, with their guests and staff, to celebrate the literary world's best-loved institution. The Queen Mother was also there. For this month marks the 150th anniversary of the founding of the London Library. Other events will follow. The Antiquarian Booksellers Association is arranging a small exhibition at a book fair at the Park Lane Hotel, London, from June 25 to 27. In October the library has arranged a series of seven lectures in which distinguished members will talk about predecessors - Noel Annan on Carlyle, Lord Quinton on Milnes, AS Byatt on George Eliot and GH Lewes, John Julius Norwich on Kipling, Kenneth Rose on Harold Nicholson, AN Wilson on Rose Macaulay, and John Wells on Some Former Librarians. A commemorative medallion has been struck, available from the librarian at Pounds 49.50 in bronze and Pounds 98.50 in silver. Later in the year Macmillan will publish a history of the library by John Wells. Entitled Rude Words, and described as discursive, it is unlikely to be the usual dull corporate panegyric. The library owes its existence to the indignation of that bad-tempered genius, Thomas Carlyle. The lack of books had made his childhood in Scotland seem like prison, but when he reached London, he found things little better. The greatest city in the world had no public libraries and books were expensive. True there was the British Museum, but Carlyle chafed at the rule which confined the books to the premises. Carlyle shamed writers to raise money, donate books, help design a sensible catalogue and recruit members. The library's first auditor was William Thackeray.</p>

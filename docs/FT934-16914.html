			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Arts: Britain writ large on the South Bank - Theatre / Malcolm Rutherford watches 12 hours of David Hare at London's Olivier David Hare and the Royal National Theatre go together. Without Hare, the RNT would be hard put to find a contemporary British dramatist writing about contemporary British subjects on an epic scale. Yet without the RNT's massive staging resources, Hare's recent plays would be less worth seeing. The spectacle is bigger than the texts. For someone who believes, as Hare manifestly does, that Britain is a country failing to live up to its potential, it is not surprising that some of the defects should be reflected in the national theatre. If there were a new young radical playwright following in the Hare tradition, he might satirise the RNT just as Hare derides other, older British institutions. But does Hare deride or not? That is the question. After spending more than 12 hours watching his trilogy in the Olivier Theatre - the RNT's biggest stage - on Saturday, one is tempted to conclude that he is a whacking great conservative. There can be no complaints about the running time. The trilogy consists of revivals of his earlier plays Racing Demon, (about the Church of England), Murmuring Judges (about prisons, the Bar and the police) and the premiere of The Absence of War which centres on the defeat of the Labour Party at last year's general election. One could have stayed for more. Indeed it would have been welcome to have seen a fourth play, bringing some of the characters together and summing it all up. For unless one takes Hare at his face value and accepts that everything that is wrong with Britain is to do with class and anachronisms, it is not always clear what he is saying. The staging is magnificent. Those who have seen the earlier plays will remember the splendour of the way the Savoy Hotel is reproduced in Racing Demon and the Royal Opera House in Murmuring Judges. Nor is it all just show. Almost the dominant character in the Savoy scene is the head waiter, who doesn't speak but keeps a discretely watchful eye in case the customers should get out of hand. This is the power behind the scenes. Absence of War goes further. The first scene is at the Whitehall Cenotaph. Although I suppose it must be smaller than the real thing, it doesn't look like that. There is a switch to the central lobby of the House of Commons at Westminster. The scene looks remarkably convincing. There is the same impression as there was at the Savoy of clerks and lackeys, and the pull of tradition, keeping behaviour in order. All of that is a triumph, perhaps cumulatively even more so than in the individual plays, in sets by Bob Crowley. But what else? It is notable that all the great set-pieces, all the great designs, take place broadly within the same square mile. Possibly that is Hare's view of how power is exercised. Yet, even on that narrow interpretation, there is not much subtlety. Does anyone seriously think today that the Church of England is one of the great agents of the British establishment, even if the establishment had been defined in the first place? On Saturday quite the best of the three plays looked to be Absence of War, especially in the second half. One suspects that is because it is the most topical, dealing with a subject that people still talk about. Yet it is still a curiously hybrid piece. Hare did a lot of research on the Labour Party election campaign, just as he did earlier on the church and the law. The result is that he knows a certain amount about the Party from inside. Much more puzzling is what he is trying to do with his knowledge. Absence of War is neither documentary nor fair comment; nor is it particularly imaginative. John Thaw, who plays the Labour leader, the Rt Hon George Jones MP, does not look like Neil Kinnock. Perhaps he is meant to be a mixture of all past Labour leaders rolled into one: physically there is a touch of Harold Wilson, though without the Wilson intellect. Even then, some very strange references are inserted, such as the Labour leader having a preference for war and admiring the military machine. There is one remarkably odd character called Vera who might be intended as Barbara Castle. If so, like so much else, she doesn't quite fit. Yet, as the plot unfolds, it is plain that the 1992 campaign is the subject, the party accepting defeat from the jaws of victory and the leader regretting that he has abandoned his old Bible and Shakespeare quotations for the language of the public sector borrowing requirement 'and', as his deputy says, 'all that bollocks, whatever it is'. There is also a strong suggestion that the leader was not fully supported by his shadow chancellor, the Rt Hon Malcolm Price MP, played as a rather distant figure by Richard Pasco. Two scenes reach the heights. One is a debate, close to election day, in an aircraft factory between the leader and the shadow chancellor about how the party should be led. (Hare's duologues between men are better than those between the sexes, where he tends to be trite.) The other is the leader being put through it in the television studio where, in the manner of British broadcasting, the interviewer (one Linus Frank played by Robin Bailey) takes over the programme. Nothing else in Absence of War lives up to those exchanges. In the trilogy as a whole the outstanding performance and the outstanding part is Mark Strong as Detective Constable Barry Hopper in Murmuring Judges. No one could accuse Hare of being biased against the lower levels of the police. He clearly prefers them to barristers. As a writer, Hare, you will observe, is not very good on feeling. His characters tend to be flat and his jokes written much in the style of the comedy programmes on the old BBC Home Service. Still, no other dramatist is writing about Britain on this scale. The direction is by Richard Eyre who has backed Hare all the way, and it would be very foolish not to go just because there are defects. This is the national theatre. The trilogy is sponsored by Amerada Hess Limited. In repertory, Royal National Theatre (071) 928 2252</p>

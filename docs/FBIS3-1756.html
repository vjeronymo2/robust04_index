Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, gave  an important speech. Mayor Zhang Lichang delivered an important  report, entitled: "Seize the Opportunity To Accelerate  Development and Strive To Raise the Income of Peasants."    Municipal leading comrades Li Jianguo, Li Shenglin, Nie  Bichu, Liu Jinfeng,Zheng Zhiying, Zhang Yuhuan, Lu Huansheng,  and Zhang Guanwen, and veteran comrades, including Wu Zhen and  Wang Liji, attended the conference. Vice Mayor Zhu Liankang  presided over the conference.    Last year the municipal rural situation was excellent. All  district and county party committees and governments led the  broad masses of cadres to do all they can to overcome serious  natural disasters and all kinds of difficulties, succeeded in  reaping a bumper agricultural harvest, maintaining a fairly  rapid growth trend in township enterprises, and achieving a  fairly big progress in rural economic development, and make  positive contributions to the whole municipality's economic and  social development. Gao Dezhan and Zhang Lichang extended  lofty respects and heartfelt thanks to the broad masses of rural  cadres and comrades who have cared for and supported the rural  work on behalf of the municipal party committee and the  government.    In his speech, Gao Dezhan stressed: It is necessary to  further enhance the sense of urgency and responsibility of  seizing the opportunity to accelerate agricultural and rural  economic development. Agriculture has occupied an extremely  important status in our country's economic and social  development. Since reform and opening up, Tianjin has rapidly  developed its agriculture and rural economy and made great  achievements in this regard. Agriculture and rural economic  development have become an important component of the  municipality's national economy. Judging from the overall  situation, to seize the opportunity to accelerate development,  we must strengthen the foundation status of agriculture and  accelerate the development of rural economy. We must soberly  recognize that our municipality's rural economic development is  not good enough and the growth of income from the agricultural  sector and of peasants is quite slow. The higher and the lower  levels across the municipality should further enhance the sense  of urgency and responsibility of accelerating agricultural and  rural economic development. During this year, party committees  and governments at all levels should conscientiously implement  the guidelines of the central rural work conference,  realistically attach prime importance to agriculture while  formulating economic guidelines and putting them into practice,  adopt effective measures, concentrate efforts on accelerating  agricultural and rural economic development, try by all possible  means to increase the income of peasants, enable the municipal  agriculture and rural economy to cope with the overall situation  of accelerating development in the whole municipality and to  match with the status of Tianjin as a municipality.    Gao Dezhan emphatically pointed out: It is necessary to  regard accelerating rural economic development and unceasingly  increasing the income of peasants as the fundamental starting  and resting points of the rural work, exert strenuous efforts to  grasp the "nonstaple foods" project on the premise of  guaranteeing a steady increase in grain and cotton production,  actively develop high- yield, fine-quality, and highly-efficient  farming as well as township enterprises, comprehensively  expedite the development of rural economy, and further enhance  the economic strength of rural areas in the municipality. While  attending to agriculture and rural work, we should pay great  attention to the issue concerning peasants' income, strive to  increase the income of peasants across the municipality by a  large margin through deepening rural reform and accelerating the  development of agriculture and rural economy, and realistically  end the situation of slow increase in the income of peasants  throughout the municipality. Increasing the average per-capita  income of peasants should be regarded as one of the important  targets for evaluating the work of all localities. In order to  fulfill the objectives and tasks of accelerating agriculture and  rural economic development, we must realistically do well the  work in three aspects: First, we should continue to deepen  rural reform and actively develop the social productive forces  in the rural areas; second, readjust the rural production  set-up, optimize the allocation of resources, and develop  high-yield, fine- quality, and highly-efficient farming; and  third, regard township enterprises as the new economic growing  points and further accelerate development.    Gao Dezhan pointed out: We should realistically strengthen  leadership over agricultural and rural work and create a new  situation in this aspect. The municipal party committee and  government should take the lead in this work and concentrate  more energy on it. Continued efforts should be made to attend  to the work of changing government functions and give further  play to the role of districts and counties. All departments  and units should consciously make contributions to the  development of agriculture and rural economy. It is necessary to  advance this work in an all-round manner, implement the work  target responsibility system, and make strict evaluations. We  should exert strenuous efforts to strengthen the building of  socialist spiritual civilization in the rural areas. Party  committees and governments at all levels in the rural areas  should consciously uphold the principle of "taking a two-handed  approach and be tough with both," realistically strengthen the  building of spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal  system, and do a good job in comprehensively improving public  security in the rural areas. It is necessary to realistically  strengthen the building of grass-roots party organizations in  the rural areas, and give full play to the fighting bastion role  of party branches and the vanguard and exemplary role of party  members. We should adopt measures to further strengthen the  building of township leading bodies, village party  organizations, and party organizations of township enterprises,  make special efforts to consolidate backward party  organizations, and rapidly improve their work. Continued  efforts should be made to strengthen the building of village  supporting organizations with party branches as the nucleus,  strengthen and improve education and management of party  members, do a good job in training, and unceasingly raise the  quality of party members and party-member cadres.    Zhang Lichang pointed out in his report: The rapid  development of rural economy and all undertakings have become  increasingly important in the whole municipality's reform,  opening up, and economic construction, and their role has become  more prominent. Currently, the vast countryside is making solid  steps to become industrialized and modernized cities and towns.  We should comprehensively recognize the rural situation, and  enhance the sense of urgency of accelerating development.  Compared our municipality's rural economic development to that  of the advanced localities throughout the country, our  development rate is not quick enough and the overall level is  quite low. We must keep a sober mind, have the sense of  hardships and a sense of urgency and responsibility of  accelerating development, be determined to work with a will to  make the municipality strong, continue to work hard, and strive  to make brilliant contributions.    Zhang Lichang pointed out: The year of 1994 is important for  deepening reform, expanding opening up, and accelerating  economic development. Rural work should be chiefly focused on  increasing peasants' income and effecting a quicker economic  development in the rural areas. In the next five to seven  years, the GNP of the agricultural departments should increase  at an annual rate of 12 percent, higher than the municipal  average; through five to seven years of efforts, the average  per-capita net income of peasants should increase by 100 percent  over 1993; by the year of 1997, all rural areas throughout the  municipality should become well-off. To realize this objective,  we must have a high starting point in carrying out various rural  work and achieve big development in some important aspects:  First, the level of agricultural production should be greatly  enhanced. This year, while stabilizing the family-based  output-related contract responsibility system, we should further  deepen reform of the rural land utilization system and the  operational form of agricultural production, sum up and  popularize the experience in developing the land on a fairly  large scale, carry out work in close connection with the  development of high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient  farming, and make new contributions to developing production,  invigorating the market, and increasing peasants' income.  Second, we should regard enhancement of efficiency as the  central task and accelerate the development of township  enterprises. Township enterprises must have a flexible  mechanism. Currently, the most important is to clarify the  property right relations, actively popularize the shareholding  cooperative system, and enable township enterprises to raise  scale, level, and ability in market competition. Third, we  should greatly raise the proportion of export-oriented economy  in the rural economic sector. Expanding the use of foreign  capital should be regarded as a breakthrough point. We should  firmly attend to items on inviting business and capital, change  the past method of only confining business to industrial items,  and comprehensively carry out primary, secondary, and tertiary  industries. Fourth, with urbanization as the objective, we  should speed up the building of modern small towns. According  to our initial plan, by the end of this century, we will develop  seven districts and counties outside the outer ring road where  the governments are located and build them into satellite cities  with a fair scale and fairly modern facilities. In 12 districts  and counties, we will select 30 towns and market towns with  convenient means of transportation, good infrastructure  facilities, strong radiation functions, and promising  development prospects and build them into central cities and  towns with initial prosperity. The rural areas inside the outer  ring road will be built in line with the unified urban plan.  Fifth, we should make more villages become prosperous. By  1997, we will make peasants across the municipality become  well-off in living and some advanced localities attain the  standard of initial prosperity. Attention should be paid to  reducing peasants' burdens, strictly controlling peasants'  personal burden at within 5 percent of the average per- capita  income of the previous year, and rapidly reducing the irrational  burdens of township collective organizations and collective  enterprises.    Zhang Lichang pointed out in conclusion: We should  realistically strengthen leadership and create a good  environment for expediting rural economic development. Comrades  charged with rural work, specially the leading cadres at all  levels, should seize the opportunity, take advantage of the  situation to advance, and create new achievements. It is hoped  that all trades and professions will care for and support rural  economic development and make new contributions to Tianjin's  invigoration and prosperity.</p>

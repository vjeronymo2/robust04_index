			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At quadrilateral trade talks among the United  States, Japan, Canada, and European nations, the United States  and European nations have called for starting renegotiations on  some portions of agreements reached under the (Uruguay Round of  GATT's) multilateral trade talks. In this connection, speaking  at a news conference on 13 January, Vice Minister Kyogoku of the  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries [MAFF]  criticized the moves of the United States and European nations,  saying: "This is outrageous, and we cannot accept their  requests."    Regarding trade issues involving the ministry, the United  States is calling on Japan to make further concessions to lower  a tariff rate for wood products. Vice Minister Kyogoku said "we  have already confirmed with the United States that negotiations  were concluded," thus reiterating that Japan has no intention of  renegotiating the trade issues.</p>

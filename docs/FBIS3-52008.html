National Security Minister Russell Huggins said 300 armed  soldiers have been placed on foot patrol in crime-hit areas  throughout the country.    They are in the eastern part of Port of Spain, the southern  San Fernando City and in some rural eastern and southern  villages.    The issue of putting soldiers on foot patrol was mentioned  in  a statement to the nation last Friday by Prime Minister Patrick  Manning, who expressed concern over the increase in serious  crimes.    Last year, almost 20,000 serious crimes were reported to the  police. There were 108 murders, including drug-related killings  and the execution of key state witnesses. For this year, the  country has so far witnessed 17 murders.    Following Manning's statement to the nation, Huggins met  with  Commissioner of Police Jules Bernard and chief of defence force,  Brigadier Ralph Brown, over the weekend to work out a plan to  have the soldiers on foot patrol.    Previously, soldiers had joined policemen in joint-patrols  but this came to an end when there were no working vehicles to  accommodate the special crime-fighting initiative.    Huggins said that like ordinary citizens, the soldiers were  allowed to make citizen's arrest.    He also said that the soldiers' presence would act as a  deterrent to criminal activites while bringing comfort to  citizens.    "Having soldiers unaccompanied by the police is designed to  bring comfort to the citizens," he said.    "It is not envisaged that bandits, seeing armed soldiers  would say they don't have powers of arrest and decide to pull  out their guns and commit robberies.    "The comfort aspect is just as important."</p>

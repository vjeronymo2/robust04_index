			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / EU presents 'action plan' for Bosnia European Union foreign ministers yesterday put forward their 'action plan' to end the war in Bosnia, vowing not to lift sanctions against Serb-led Yugoslavia until Bosnian Serbs handed over land to their Moslem adversaries. Despite threats by EU ministers to suspend relief operations in Bosnia this spring if the warring sides fail to endorse a settlement dividing the republic into three ethnic mini-states, the leaders of the three communities yesterday appeared to remain far from agreement. The Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, and his Bosnian Serb proxy, Mr Radovan Karadzic, renewed their demands for the immediate suspension of United Nations sanctions before the Serbs made any territorial concessions. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, said the mainly Moslem republic must receive additional land from the Serbs and access to Adriatic ports from the Croats. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, yesterday said sanctions would remain in place until the Serbs fulfilled their pledges to hand over land in Bosnia. 'The first move has to come from the Serbs' offer of additional withdrawal, once that offer had been implemented, and there was a ceasefire, and the aid was flowing freely, then we, the Europeans, would think that the Security Council should consider suspending sanctions,' he said during the first all-party talks since the collapse of the peace process in September. However, in a defiant speech, Mr Milosevic slammed the EU for doing 'enormous harm' to his country. A statement from the Belgian EU presidency outlined the 'action plan', which also called on Croat leaders to fulfil their pledge for concessions on ports and on the Bosnian government to stick to its territorial demands of 3-4 per cent. The Croatian president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, and Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader, reportedly gave their support for the EU plan at the Geneva session, also attended by Moslem and Croat military leaders but boycotted by Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic. Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN high commissioner for refugees, accused all three leaders of reneging on their pledge of 11 days ago to allow the free access of humanitarian aid to some 3m people in Bosnia. Discussion of the latest EU-sponsored Bosnian peace proposals will continue in Rome today as EU foreign ministers, together with their US and Russian counterparts, join foreign ministers from the former communist states in a broader review of European and central Asian security issues at a meeting of the Conference of Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), Anthony Robinson writes from Rome.</p>

China, as a member of the committee, was represented and the  head of its delegation, Chen Shiqiu, addressed the meeting.    In his speech Chen outlined the efforts and achievements  made  by China in the peaceful uses of outer space and in the  development of space science and technology, stressing that  there should be international cooperation on the uses of outer  space.    Delegates from various countries expressed a keen interest  in  an Asia-Pacific economic and social council ministerial meeting  to promote the region's uses of outer space, which is scheduled  for September in Beijing, as well as in the creation of an  organization to oversee the uses of outer space in the region.    The committee now has 53 member nations and the meeting,  which opened on June 6, is the first of its kind since the UN  Outer Space Affairs Division was transferred here from New York.</p>

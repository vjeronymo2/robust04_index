			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Technology: Rigid standards lead to the top - David Waller on how German software company SAP has prospered on a vision five men shared 21 years ago Twenty-one years ago, five software engineers left the German arm of IBM to set up their own company. Their aim was to develop 'standard' software powerful enough to handle all companies' data management needs in areas as diverse as production, sales and distribution and accounting, and flexible enough to adapt to the individual requirements of companies in widely different industrial sectors. It would be an alternative to costly tailor-made software packages. The dream turned into a reality and SAP, the company which they founded, is today one of the world's top dozen software companies and European market leader in integrated business software. Its main competitor in this segment of the market is Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software (DBS), a subsidiary of the US business information group. For more than a decade, the mainstay of SAP's business has been a product called R/2, a software system designed for use on large companies' mainframe computers. Customers include more than 1,400 of Germany's largest companies  -but also 75 US corporations, including nine of the top 10 Fortune 500 companies. The system typically handles tasks involving the input of thousands of individual items of data - for example, an airline's ticket-issuing system or cheque clearing for a large bank. It is designed on a modular basis, so that the customer can extend the use of the system to cover different applications at will. At the core of the system is what SAP calls the Basis System which provides limited data storage and word-processing facilities. On to this the customer can bolt modules which cover functions such as materials management, quality assurance, plant maintenance, financial accounting or cost accounting projects. While R/2 accounted for more than half SAP's group sales of DM831m (Pounds 332m) last year, the thrust of the business is set to change fundamentally with the recent introduction of R/3 - a new generation of software which is designed to appeal to small and medium-sized companies. According to Dietmar Hopp, SAP's chief executive and one of the four founders who own 80 per cent of the company's shares, the move to a new product mirrors fundamental changes in the computer technology market. As computers become cheaper and smaller while retaining the power of larger machines, companies are shifting away from expensive mainframe computers to client-server systems, which form networks of personal computers and workstations to process the company's data. Coupled with this is the move to open systems, where hardware and software are built to common standards which enable them to be interconnected with an ease unknown in the past. Hopp says the new product, which SAP began marketing last year, is designed to follow the market trend away from mainframe computers - and to open up a vast customer base of medium-sized companies for whom R/2 was inappropriate and too expensive. While R/2 costs anywhere between DM400,000 and DM2.5m to install, R/3 sells at a minimum of DM100,000. As yet, SAP is the only company in the world to offer this kind of fully-integrated modular software for mid-range computers, although DBS is expected to launch a rival product this year. Other companies tend to specialise in one functional area (for example, providing accounting or human resources software) but R/3 links the financial, personnel and manufacturing functions together. The new product achieved sales of DM37m last year. This year, Hopp predicts, SAP will have sold 1,000 R/3 systems - 10 times as many in 1992 when the system was sold only in Germany - generating sales of DM200m. As the marketing push continues in the US and Europe, analysts are hopeful that sales will climb to DM350m in 1994. This is likely to compensate for the slow decline in revenue from R/2, which is likely to lose ground as more companies move away from mainframes. R/3 can also be used to upgrade existing R/2 systems. Having tackled the 'midi-market' with R/3, the next step is to develop integrated standard software for the PC market. To this end, SAP is in talks with Microsoft, the US software group. SAP hopes that this will lead to the development of a package which the US group could incorporate into its Windows-based systems.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Arts: Le Cirque Invisible reopens Riverside Riverside Studios, the West London Arts venue which closed its doors in April, has reopened after the first phase of an extensive redevelopment programme. Gone are the corner bookshop and hotchpotch of small gallery spaces. A new, glass-fronted entrance (on Crisp Road) leads directly into a deep, brightly lit, grey and white foyer where a long counter houses both box office and reception. The cafe and bar area, although transitionally streamlined, remains unresolved - the dark wood, bistro-style tables and chairs an irritatingly anachronistic element within the plain and rather industrial-looking interior. But what of the studios? Seating capacity has been increased - to 500 (from 370) in Studio 1 and 400 in Studio 2 - at the expense of comfort. Studio 3, redesigned for small scale projects, can accommodate an audience of just over 100. The seats are of the small, shallow-backed, red plastic variety and the tightly packed rows offer minimal leg room. Should you actually lean back, it is likely to be against someone's knees. When Riverside's director, William Burdett-Coutts, decided to add Robert Lepage's epic The Seven Streams of The River Ota to his autumn programme, he must surely have blanked out any thought for the comfort of his audience. Le Cirque Invisible, the show with which Burdett-Coutts has chosen to reopen Studio 1, lasts almost two hours, yet it is not the kind of event which compels viewers to sit quietly rigid. This self-contained mini-circus founded by Victoria Chaplin and Jean Bapiste Thierree (her husband) some 20 years ago (as Le Cirque Bonjeur and, subsequently, Le Cirque Imaginaire) is not really a vehicle for conventional, sawdust-ring skills and turns. Indeed, it features Chaplin treading the high-wire and the couple's acrobatic son, James, on elasticated trapeze and on various custom build cycles. But Chaplin and Thierree subvert the whole character and vocabulary of circus performance and, in doing so, multiply its essential magic and fun. As the show's prize clown, Thierree injects the simplest tasks and ideas with totally absurd humour: pulling off a wig of shaggy grey hair only to reveal his own, identical mop; placing an open book in front of a dozy rabbit; accidentally 'amputating' his finger whilst chopping carrots and celery at high speed. These antics - or maybe just Thierree's small but wildly inappropriate gestural flourishes - leave you weak with laughter. But Thierree also has an extensive solo repertoire of surrealist, chameleon characters, such as the Magritte-inspired zebra man and tapestry man. The latter, dressed from head to foot in needlepoint-realised pastoral scenes, carries a tapestry covered suitcase and peels a tapestry-skinned banana. As a conjuror, Thierree freely dabbles in the coloured handkerchief school of magic. Not that he aimed for - or achieves - the usual results: 'a dog,' he announces, letting a square of silk waft to the ground and lifting it to reveal a plastic turd. He also treats his props with a schizoid combination of brutish disregard and motherly care: metal objects are tossed into the empty wings; a dropped satsuma is recovered with a napkin. Of Thierree's Gallery of walk-on/walk-off joke characters, the most brilliantly perverse is an overcoated figure who clutches a spherical, newspaper wrapped object to his chest and rips away the covering to reveal Thierree's bobbing, chattering head. The perfectly assessed brevity of these episodes contrasts with the more sustained quality of Chaplin's solos - most of which rely on the laboriously precise manipulation of large and heavy costumes for their clever, illusory effects. The most organic of Chaplin's designs is a free-standing, full length skirt structure in which she is hidden and which drifts and rolls precariously around the stage, like some decapitated Georgian dancer. While Chaplin works slowly and methodically, transforming herself into the unidentifiable creatures of a vivid imagination, Thierree tends towards more prosaically human roles embracing both deliberate incompetence and irascible silliness. His comic mime take on the Pearlfishers duet - Thierree dressed as a medieval monarch and grinning like a village idiot, mouthing the words and tugging discreetly at the jaws of the singing puppets on his knees - is rib-achingly funny. After her husband's tomfoolery, it is easy to treat Chaplin's contributions as mere recovery time, but her more modest presence should not be underestimated. Together, Chaplin and Thierree have created a dream circus full of wondrous eccentricities. At Riverside Studios until October 16. (081-741 2255).</p>

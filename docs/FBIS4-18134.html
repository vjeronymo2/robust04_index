			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, March 30 (AFP) -- General Philippe Morillon,  who headed UN forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina in 1992-1993, was  named head of the French Army's Rapid Deployment Force Wednesday  [30 March]. Morillon was nominated for the position by Defence  Minister Francois Leotard, a military spokesman said.    The 58-year-old Morillon will replace General Bertrand de  Lapresle who became head of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  in ex-Yugoslavia on March 5.    Morillon came to public attention a year ago for his  outspoken criticism of the shortcomings in international  intervention in the stricken country.    General Morillon will begin his new job on April 5. Under  his command will be 35,000 men, made up of four divisions and a  logistics brigade.</p>

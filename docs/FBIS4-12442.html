			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cairo, April 10 (AFP)--An outlawed  fundamentalist group said Sunday it had killed a police general,  who had been at the forefront of the battle against Islamic  militants, in revenge for human rights abuses in Egyptian  prisons.    Security forces launched a manhunt on Sunday after General  Ra'uf Khayrat was killed by assailants who hurled a bomb at his  car in the Egyptian capital.    Three people in a car and two on a motorbike raked General  Khayrat's car with automatic gunfire late Saturday and then  lobbed the bomb before escaping, witnesses said.    The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group] said in a  statement to AFP it had carried out the attack "to avenge the  most atrocious violations of human rights which Islamic  prisoners are subjected to in Egyptian prisons."    Khayrat was the number two in the state security services,  which have been accused by human rights groups of torturing  suspected militants.    His charred body was found in the burnt-out car after the  attack in the suburb of al-Jizah on Pyramids Avenue, which  happened as the general was leaving home at the wheel of his  car, the witnesses said.    The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah warned on March 27 that it would  avenge what it called the "serious violations of human rights in  Egyptian prisons," where the state security services interrogate  thousands of suspects.    It said it had tracked the general down even though he had  changed address several times, and used three different cars in  a bid to outwit possible assailants. [passage omitted]    Khayrat was one of the leading officials in charge of the  fight against militants who launched a terror campaign against  the government in the spring of 1992.    It was the first killing of a police general in Cairo,  though  four other police generals have been killed in southern Egypt, a  hotbed of Muslim fundamentalism.    Police launched a massive manhunt in al-Jizah, with officers  out on patrol and soldiers armed with automatic weapons posted  on all the main roads and bridges of the capital.    The motorbike and car used in the attack were found near the  general's home.    It was the worst attack in Cairo since a failed November 25  assassination bid against Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi. The  authorities had since kept Islamic violence mostly confined to  the south of the country.    The Egyptian Human Rights Organisation has accused Khayrat's  services of systematically torturing suspects in Islamic  militant attacks.    More than 360 people have been killed, including 132  policemen, since the militants declared war on the secular  government of President Husni Mubarak in March 1992.</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Banesto's capital question The Bank of Spain's intervention at Banesto will have raised the temperature of many Milwaukee insurance fund managers to boiling point. Those US funds which helped sink Dollars 775m of rights issue money into Banesto this summer will be appalled by the sudden turn of events. Investors were persuaded by JP Morgan that once Banesto's complex web of cross-share-holdings had been untangled, a strong retail bank would emerge boasting good recovery prospects. Banks have certainly been European flavour of the year, as the successful privatisation of Argentaria among others illustrates. Banesto's fall seems to owe more to its own shaky loan portfolio and peculiar collection of industrial assets than any general weaknesses in the Spanish banking system. Yet there remain many unanswered questions - not least why the Bank of Spain chose this moment to intervene. Banesto had long lingered below the capital ratios of other Spanish banks and the Bank had been monitoring its financial health for some time. This raises the suspicion that there is some more specific bad news to come. JP Morgan's seeming ignorance is particularly baffling, given its seat on the board. It invested some of its reputation in Banesto along with its own and its clients' money. There will be red faces aplenty at the blue chip bank. Banesto cannot hope to continue operating in its present form. The new management will have its work cut out rationalising overhead costs to squeeze cash flow and seeking buyers for its industrial businesses. The most likely outcome is that a single Spanish bank, such as BBV, or a broader consortium will eventually assume control. The reaction of the Madrid stock market in dumping shares across the sector shows how nervous it is about the prospect.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["IAEA Must Take Measure for Strict Inspection of All </F> Nuclear Facilities of Japan" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the  General Department of the Atomic Energy of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea on Friday answered a question put by  KCNA on the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] is defending the concealment of plutonium by Japan.    The spokesman said:    The International Atomic Energy Agency recently published a  communique to the effect that it did not call in question the  discovery of a large amount of unaccounted-for plutonium in  Japan. This fully reveals the partiality and irresponsibility of  the agency.    The agency claims that it had known the accumulation of a  fabulous amount of plutonium "in the form of dust and waste" at  the tokaimura nuclear fuel-making plant of Japan. But facts  clearly prove that it had been in the dark about it in actuality.    According to a media report, when the South Korean  authorities requested the clarification of the background of the  discovery of the unaccounted-for plutonium in Japan on May 12,  Japan herself admitted that 70 kg of unaccounted-for plutonium  had been discovered at the Tokaimura nuclear fuel-making plant.    The donen (the power reactor and nuclear fuel development  business), the operator of the Tokaimura plant, informed the  ITAR- TASS on May 10 that the plutonium in question was  discovered in April by inspectors of the agency during their  scheduled inspection of the plant.    The Japanese paper JAPAN TIMES said the agency would have  never known that hidden raw material was being prepared in Japan  for nuclear bombs, unless a secret report of the U.S. Nuclear  Control Institute tipped it off about that.    The director of the U.S. Nuclear Control Institute pointed  out in a more explicit term that though high-tech facilities  supervising the amount of remaining plutonium are installed in  the plant, the inaccuracy of measurement is high and the amount  of plutonium that might be accumulated in that course is  fabulous and, in view of this, the agency cannot confidently  declare that plutonium enough to make one or more nuclear bombs  has not been diverted from the plant and the problem is that the  agency's safeguards cannot detect the possible crafty divergence  of plutonium at the nuclear fuel plant.    Nevertheless, the agency, without so much as a proper  explanation about the case, claims that it had known of the  plutonium in question at the Tokaimura plant and it is now under  its safeguards. We are quite surprised at this absurd claim.    While maximizing and taking issue with a tiny amount of  reported plutonium of the DPRK which was extracted for  experimental purpose, the agency is zealously defending the  ridiculous amount of unreported plutonium of Japan which is  undeniably high in the possibility of diversion and, ignoring  the demand of the world community for the clarification of the  truth, refuted it off-hand with a sheet of communique. This  irresponsible act has brought into bolder relief the partiality  of the agency and its application of a double standard and makes  us feel a stronger doubt as to its mission and credibility.    By defending the case, the agency itself has, after all,  given the strong impression that its inspection depends on  political considerations.    Since the case occurred when Japan has not definitely  renounced its excessive stockpile of plutonium and, worse still,  her nuclear armament has reached a practical danger line, the  agency, true to its mission, must call it in question and  discuss it at the board of governors and take a measure for an  overall and strict inspection of all the facilities of Japan,  thus dispelling the serious concern of the world community over  the nuclear armament of Japan and her conversion into a military  power.    We will follow the move of the agency.</p>

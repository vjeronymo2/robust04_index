This appeal was made by Tyll  Necker, the president of the Federal Association of German  Industry [BDI], at a congress of his organization in Bonn on the  issue of "Germany's Role in the World."    Positive developments have already taken place in some  spheres, Necker said, referring to the Federal Government's Asia  concept. Even now, Germany is the most important trading partner  for many Asian countries, but the results are lagging behind  expectations. German exports and the technology transfer to this  part of the world only account for 10 percent of German foreign  trade. German investment in the Asian-Pacific region amounts to  3-4 percent of total foreign investments.    It is important not only to increase exports to promising  regions but to be present on location and to invest, Necker  emphasized. One has to think of new forms of cooperation with  local companies. "Package solutions that not only supply plants  but also run them, thus earning funding and payment, are  necessary," he said.    The BDI president sharply criticized the trend toward new  protectionism in connection with environmental and social  standards. This is not the right instrument to secure  international environmental standards or standards for  employees. Lower wage costs are often the only competitive  advantage developing countries have. Necker demanded that they  should not be stripped of this advantage.    At the Congress, Saarland Minister President Oskar  Lafontaine, of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD],  warned against hasty European monetary union. As a result of  economic developments, the Maastricht timetable cannot be kept.  Lafontaine said that "any automatism would be fatal." He  called for better coordination between national banks in the  European Union [EU]. National strategies are anachronistic.  The deputy SPD chairman came out in favor of a joint European  approach to solving problems such as unemployment. Lafontaine  emphasized that common European foreign and security policy must  start from cooperation between Bonn/Berlin and Paris.    Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag group, called  for a collective approach to solve international security  policy. Maintaining the ability to be a good member in the  alliance and a good partner is of top priority, but greater  emphasis must also go to elements of development and  environmental policy. NATO and the European Union must be  further consolidated. Within the framework of growing  international responsibility, Germany must participate in the  military protection of stability with equal rights and duties,  Schaeuble demanded. Peace and security cannot be had for free.  [passage omitted]</p>

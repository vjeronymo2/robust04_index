			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Pirelli agrees to sell holding in Continental PIRELLI, the Italian tyres and cables group, yesterday ended a long corporate takeover struggle by agreeing to sell its holding in Continental, its bigger German rival, to Deutsche Bank. The bank will retain 5 per cent of the total stake of 33.4 per cent in Continental that is changing hands, taking its holding to 10 per cent. The bulk of the remainder will go to government and business interests in Continental's home state of Lower Saxony. The Norddeutsche Landesbank, the central bank for the state of Lower Saxony, is buying 15 per cent of the shares. It will hold 5 per cent on its own account, while three other local companies - Preussen Elektra and two insurance groups - will buy the remaining 10 per cent via a bond issue convertible into Continental shares between 1995 and 2000. The price is DM235 a share and NordLB is guaranteeing a 6 per cent annual coupon. Mr Peter Fischer, economics minister of the state of Lower Saxony said the solution would block 'possible foreign influence' over Continental. 'The company will be able to get on with running its business without worrying who its shareholders are,' he said. The remainder of the stake, some 13 per cent, will be placed with big German banks and institutional investors. Pirelli, which was forced into a radical restructuring partly by the losses on its aborted bid, will post a L140bn (Dollars 87.8m) extraordinary profit on the deal. The complex transaction, covering more than 2.9m shares, envisages the sale by Pirelli to Deutsche Bank of 5 per cent of Continental held by its Amsterdam-based Pirelli Tyre Holding subsidiary. Pirelli will also exercise options to buy 28 per cent of Continental's shares owned by Italian investors and held by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank. Options on a further 5 per cent of Continental's shares will be bought back from Pirelli by Mediobanca. Mediobanca's motives for repurchasing the options are unclear. A Pirelli executive denied the holding might represent the basis for some future attempt at developing links between the two groups. However, Mr Hubertus von Gruberg, Continental's chief executive, said in Hanover yesterday that the transaction could facilitate future co-operation. Last year, Pirelli used its stake to block Continental's plans for a rights issue. Deutsche Bank is buying the shares for DM250 each, a substantial premium on yesterday's stock market price of DM204. Pirelli will not receive the proceeds, nor exercise its options, until December 30. Pirelli will also gain from the fall of about 30 per cent in the value of the lira against the D-Mark since buying its shares and options in Continental. In all, Pirelli will receive DM733.6m (Dollars 458.5m) for the combined shareholding. Net proceeds after exercising the options will amount to about L330bn. The failed takeover was the main factor behind Pirelli's L670bn loss in 1991. Apart from writing down to DM207 a share the value of its Continental stake, bought for about DM300 a share, the company was also obliged to pay previously-secret indemnities to other Italian investors. Yesterday's transaction still leaves Pirelli considerably worse off than had it not mounted the takeover. However, the terms vindicated its policy of aggregating its stake through options and seeking a premium to the shares' stock market price.</p>

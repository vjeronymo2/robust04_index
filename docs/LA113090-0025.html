			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> HOKEY PLOT CLOUDS 'VISIONS'  </P> <P> "Night Visions" (tonight at 9 on Channels 4, 36 and 39) is a supernatural buddy  movie about a gruff, tough cop paired with a naive female partner who happens  to be telepathic and have multiple personalities -- sort of a Nick  Nolte-meets-Sybil thing.  </P> <P> Wes Craven directed and co-wrote, but there's scant trace of any of the style  or imagination that marked his best feature horror films, such as "Nightmare on  Elm Street." Instead, he has hit rock bottom with this hokey, ill-conceived  cross between "Eyes of Laura Mars" and "48 HRS," which has failed pilot written  all over it and fails even minimal credulity tests both as a cop picture and  thriller.  </P> <P> James Remar -- a character actor attempting to make the leap from villain to  hero, a la Willem Dafoe -- is the crusty, hard-drinking, hard-driving veteran  of the force, so wired that he terrorizes suspects to the point of  incontinence. Illogically, while investigating a highly publicized serial  killer case, he's required to drag along a criminal psychology grad student,  Loryn Locklin, whom no one initially seems to realize is a gifted psychic.  </P> <P> The supernatural elements are unnecessarily confusing. Locklin keeps going into  strange trances where she seems to turn into someone else, and initially, we  figure she is telepathically interlocking with other characters (possibly the  impending victims), or maybe channeling one of Ramtha's Valley Girl cousins.  But eventually it turns out she has got wacky multiple personalities as well as  soothsaying talent. Not exactly someone you want on an LAPD ride-along program.  </P> <P> In any case, the average viewer's psychic powers will prove much better than  the heroine's rather low-wattage abilities. The identity of the killer is so  obviously telegraphed throughout that if you don't figure it out within the  first 45 minutes, you might check your pulse to make sure you haven't already  been his next victim.  </P> <P> "You know what?" a policewoman pal tells Locklin. "You are totally spooky!" Not  so with the tacky "Night Visions," which has to settle for totally contrived.  CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

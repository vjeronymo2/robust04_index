			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Housing starts continue to rise Housing starts were 54,300 in the three months to the end of August, up 15 per cent over the same period last year, government figures released yesterday show, Simon London writes. The annual rate of increase was slightly higher than during the previous three months, suggesting that housebuilders were anticipating an improvement in housing market conditions. However, the greatest increase came from housing associations, which started building 12,300 dwellings in the period, up from 9,100 last year. Private-sector housebuilders started 41,600 homes, against 37,500 last year. Analysts pointed out that the figures cover the period immediately before last month's half percentage point increase in base rates. Tarmac, the UK's second largest housebuilder, said last week that house sales had halved since the rate rise.</p>

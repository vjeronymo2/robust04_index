			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Michele Kayal: "Gulf Between Czech Republic </F> and Slovakia Growing Wider"]    [Text] Barely a year after the split of Czechoslovakia,  world economic organizations have begun to recognize differences  between its two successor republics and are showing alarm over  the situation in Slovakia.    The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  and  the European Union both reported this week that while the Czech  Republic is ticking along with optimism and steady economic  reform, Slovakia is hampered by government policies and the  outlook of its public.    The OECD report on the countries' economic conditions and  prospects rules out the possibility of economic growth in  Slovakia in the near future and puts the blame squarely on the  shoulders of politicians. The government's slowdown of economic  reforms, which the report contends took place in the first weeks  after separation, has eroded the country's stability and been  the main culprit in this year's ballooning state budget deficit  and depletion of hard currency reserves.    The OECD judges that the uncertain situation has limited the  flow of foreign investment, and that the economy will be at best  stagnant in 1994. It predicts a likely drop in gross domestic  product and a 3 percent rise in unemployment, to 18 percent.    The Czech Republic, on the other hand, is pronounced a  miraculous example of a country that has liberalized and  privatized its economy without any appreciable unemployment. But  more significant restructuring lies ahead, the report notes, and  a doubling of the unemployment rate to 8 percent in 1994 is  likely as workers in newly privatized companies are laid off.    The report also faults the country's banks for buoying  unprofitable state enterprises and predicts the imminent failure  of several state-owned and private companies.    The OECD's findings were supported by the European Union's  EuroBarometer report, which surveyed more than 1,000 people in  16 Central and East European countries. Figures showed the Czech  Republic outdistancing the other Visegrad countries (Poland,  Hungary and Slovakia) in all of the four studied indicators:  country direction, support of the market economy, satisfaction  with democracy and human rights. Slovakia is having the most  difficult time, surveyors note, with all of those indicators in  decline.    Confidence in the country's direction increased 28 percent  in  the Czech Republic over 1993 while dropping 32 percent in  Slovakia. Most Czechs in the EU report said they believe their  current path is a correct one, while an absolute majority of  Slovaks feel the opposite.    A majority of Czechs believe that creating a market economy  is the best route for their country's future, while Slovaks are  divided: Support for the market economy has fallen 11 percent in  Slovakia since last year's survey. By the same token, Slovaks  registered the highest degree of dissatisfaction with the speed  of economic reform, with 15 percent more than last year saying  it should be moving faster.</p>

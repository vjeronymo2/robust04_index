Lamba met the  Pakistani foreign secretary the other day and presented six  proposals to lessen the existing tension between Pakistan and  India. The proposals were related to matters like Siachen  glacier, the Line of Control [LOC] in Kashmir, Sir Creek,  delimitation of the maritime boundary, reactivation of the camps  formed by the joint commission in 1988, and steps to create a  parity [between the two countries] in the peaceful nuclear  program. The Pakistani authorities have not yet examined the  proposals in detail. However, expressing an initial reaction,  the Foreign Office has said there is nothing in the Indian  proposals which can boost Pakistan's hope for a solution of the  issues, adding that these are nonpapers. Diplomatic sources say  that indications are that India will consider reducing its  forces along the LOC if Pakistan agrees to these proposals and  starts implementing them. It will, in fact, not solve any  problem.    It had been India's fashion from the very beginning to  emphasize talks on secondary subjects instead of the main  issues. But if the primary and basic issues are resolved, then  it will automatically lead to the resolution of secondary issues  as well. The whole world knows that the main dispute between  Pakistan and India is the sole issue of Kashmir. But India  persistently avoids any concrete and positive talks to resolve  it. The first time Kashmir was acknowledged as an issue was at  the recent foreign secretary-level talks between the two  countries in Islamabad. However, no progress toward a solution  of the issue could be made due to India's arrogance. And now,  in the current proposals, India totally omitted the Kashmir  issue. Since the prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, declared  that only purposeful talks will be held with India, holding  talks on secondary issues instead of the real ones will only be  a waste of time. Hence, the rejection of the proposals is a  correct decision.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Pakistan central bank in independence move Pakistan's central bank is expected to be given more independence on monetary and administrative policies in a presidential ordinance due next week, senior officials said yesterday, writes Farhan Bokhari in Karachi. Plans for greater central bank independence were announced recently in the economic reform programme of Mr Moeen Qureshi, the caretaker prime minister. He is due to leave office after elections on October 6. The proposals under consideration include allowing the State Bank of Pakistan to recruit its own staff members without seeking clearance from the federal government in Islamabad, new powers to control the money supply and independence in regulating the activities of commercial banks. The new measures are meant to control the chronic problem of a large budgetary deficit, caused by several years of uncontrolled government spending. The new ordinance is expected to allow the central bank to clearly set the limits for deficit financing without government interference, Mr Mohammad Yaqub, the bank governor said this week.</p>

ADB said the plantation project, which is to cover 9,000  hectares, will increase annual wood production by 128,000 cubic  meters and to reduce pressure on exploitation of natural forests.    The bank noted that the overwhelming dependence of Lao  economy on forest resources has led to a rapid decline of forest  cover in the country.    To check the rapid depletion of the country's forest  resources, the Lao government has launched a new system of  forest resource management to classify forest land into  production, protection and conservation, and reforestation areas.    The plantation project, a part of the new system, is to be  carried out in eight districts in Vientiane Prefecture and the  Provinces of Vientiane, Bolikhamsai and Savannakhet to  reestablish tree cover on unstocked and degraded forest lands.</p>

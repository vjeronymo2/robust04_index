			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (11): Oil refineries lose their fat - The Aramco-Samarec merger has created a company that may be without equal 'Integration' has for so long been such a buzzword of Saudi Arabian oil policy that perhaps it should have come as no surprise when the kingdom announced in June that it was to merge Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil producing company, with Samarec, the previously separate refining and crude marketing arm. Nevertheless, industry analysts in and outside the kingdom professed bafflement at the timing of the move, asking why Mr Hisham Nazer, the oil minister, had decided to submerge Samarec, originally his creation, into Aramco after putting such effort into establishing its distinct identity. Rumours circulated in the industry that the move was a setback to Mr Nazer and that his ministerial tenure was threatened. All of which is roundly rebutted by senior Saudi officials. The timing, they say, was 'irrelevant'. When Samarec was set up in 1989, they say, it was considered an appropriate transitional step towards the eventual establishment of a wholly-integrated national oil company. Its creation gathered 12 previously disparate refineries and marketing operations overseen by Petromin, the oil ministry, into one. The decision to merge with Aramco, says one official, 'had been devised ever since Mr Nazer began restructuring the oil ministry' - something which inadequately explains why Samarec had commissioned a corporate plan for 1993-97 from Arthur D. Little, the consultants. What Saudi officials do not say, but oil executives and some Aramco staff in the kingdom do, is that Samarec's bureaucratic management style had come to contrast increasingly poorly with that of Aramco, which inherited from the US oil majors which created it a pervasive and efficient western corporate culture. 'Samarec was overspending; it had a lot of fat and Aramco had been sniping at it for years,' says the Riyadh representative of one foreign oil group. What the merger is producing, therefore, is not just one of the world's biggest integrated oil companies, but also a wholesale change of management ethos in Saudi Arabia's vast oil refining and marketing operations. Six months into the merger - which officials say is now operationally complete - Aramco's mark is already clear on what had been Samarec's style and strategy. In style, Aramco officials see the task essentially of retraining the 11,000 Samarec workers it has inherited and, perhaps more pertinently, tuning them to Aramco's work ethic. The joke in Dhahran is that when Aramco staff arrived in Jeddah, turning up at the Samarec office at Aramco's standard 7am, they were stopped by police incredulous that anyone would be there at such ungodly hours. 'The hardest part of the merger will probably be the culture change,' remarks one western oil executive. In scale, the merger has created an oil company that, it could be argued, is without equal. Aramco is the sole custodian of almost all Saudi Arabia's 258bn barrels of oil reserves - a quarter of the world's total - and 186 trillion (million million) standard cubic feet of gas reserves. As the state's oil producer, it accounts for about an eighth of total world crude output and a fifth of world trade in oil. To this, Aramco has added a total of 394,000 barrels a day of refining capacity at the kingdom's three domestic refineries in Riyadh, Jeddah and Yanbu and the kingdom's interests in the joint venture Yanbu (250,000b/d) and Jubail (240,000b/d) export refineries, along with that in the 325,000b/d Rabigh plant, which is a joint venture with Mr John Lakis, the Greek businessman. Aramco already ran the Ras Tanurah refinery in the eastern province, with a capacity, after fire damage in 1990, of 300,000 b/d. The administration of the merger, according to Aramco staff on the 100-strong task force which undertook most of the work in July, has been swift and relatively smooth. So far, most of Samarec's 11,000 staff have kept their jobs - the great bulk being staff at the refineries - and only a few senior executives have been moved from its former Jeddah headquarters to Aramco's base in Dhahran. Aramco has created a fifth 'business centre' to run the refining and marketing operations, headed by Mr Abdelaziz al-Hokail, an Aramco senior vice-president. But while the transition team say every effort was made to ensure that none of Samarec's operations was disturbed during the merger, the same does not apply to what had been the company's ambitious expansion and upgrading project, where the process of Aramco-isation has had an immediate effect. Before June, Samarec was well advanced with plans to upgrade all its domestic and joint venture refineries at an initial estimated cost of Dollars 4bn. Foster Wheeler, the US engineers, had been contracted to oversee the plan, the first phase of which was to have been completed by 1996. But immediately after the merger, Aramco put the entire project under review - where by early December it remained. As one Dhahran official puts it: 'The planning work had been done, but it had not been done by Aramco - and an Aramco man doesn't like to go ahead with something unless he's looked at it very closely himself.' Officials say the upgrade project has not been shelved, though there may be 'some shifts' in priorities. Aramco has meanwhile released Foster Wheeler, while keeping on Brown and Root, the engineering group, to proceed with a Dollars 1bn upgrade of the Ras Tanurah plant planned before the merger and, it would appear, to serve as consultant on any future upgrading at the newly inherited refineries. Industry executives suggest that most or all of the Aramco refineries will eventually be upgraded. 'From a basic technical point of view they ought to be doing something,' says one. 'But how much and when depends on a number of variables.' Chief among these, some analysts suggest, may be the government's present budget deficit, and the opportunity Aramco's review presents both to re-cost Samarec's plans and perhaps also to defer or at least extend one of the kingdom's costliest industrial projects.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        FOREIGN TRADE (MILLION RIYALS)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year         Exports*     % change     Imports**     % change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1968         9,117.8                    2,578.3 1969         9,496.2        4.2         3,377.5       31.0 1970        10,907.2       14.9         3,196.8       -5.4 1971        17,302.7       58.6         3,667.5       14.7 1972        22,761.2       31.5         4,708.3       28.4 1973        33,309.1       46.3         7,310.2       55.3 1974       126,222.9      278.9        10,149.2       38.8 1975       104,411.7      -17.3        14,823.0       46.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1976       135,153.5       29.4        30,691.0      107.0 1977       153,208.6       13.4        51,662.0       68.3 1978       138,242.0       -9.8        69,179.7       33.9 1979       213,183.4       54.2        82,223.3       18.9 1980       362,885.0       70.2       100,349.6       22.0 1981       405,481.0       11.7       119,297.7       18.9 1982       271,090.1      -33.1       139,335.1       16.8 1983       158,443.9      -41.6       135,417.2       -2.8 1984       132,299.2      -16.5       118,736.6      -12.3 1985        99,535.8      -24.8        85,563.6      -27.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1986        74,377.0      -25.3        70,779.6      -17.3 1987        86,879.7       16.8        75,312.6        6.4 1988        91,287.7        5.1        81,581.7        8.3 1989       106,294.5       16.4        79,219.4       -2.9 1990       166,339.2       56.5        90,138.5       13.8 1991       178,974.1        7.6       108,881.3       20.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Includes re-exports ** CIF.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Finance and National Economy, Central Department of Statistics  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

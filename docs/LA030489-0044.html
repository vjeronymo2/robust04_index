			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS DOWNEY COLUMN HAD NO PLACE IN SPORTS  </P> <P> I am shocked and amazed at the senselessness and duplicity of Mike Downey's  "Having a Field Day" column. It had absolutely nothing to do with the world of  sports; and was a self-serving and misguided attempt at satire, fueled in large  part by the womanizing of two politicians and a preacher.  </P> <P> It simply failed to make any point whatsoever, except to disparage women and to  demonstrate Downey's lack of creativity and reliance on tired sexual innuendo.  All this from a writer who criticized the swimsuit edition as having no place  in sports.  </P> <P> GARY ROSS  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

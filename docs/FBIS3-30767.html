			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 7 Feb (TANJUG) -- The White Rose and the  New Byzantium-Orthodox Concord today warned the NATO Council  that if Bosnian Serbs positions were attacked, these  nongovernmental organizations would mount a "complete and total"  blockade of the Danube "for a one-year period."    It is noted in a statement signed by Radomir Smiljanic,  president of the White Rose and of the Danube Blockade Council,  that "we all genuinely and deeply mourn the innocent victims of  Sarajevo, but at the same time we wish to draw attention to the  fact that for the fourth time the unscrupulous propaganda  machine of the Bosnian Muslim government and world agents have  used the same trick."    "The suffering of the innocent is used to move the world  public and NATO's military power against the Serbs and to  undermine the Geneva peace process," the statement says and goes  on to warn the NATO Council "under no circumstances to take  military action or mount air strikes against the Serbs in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina."</p>

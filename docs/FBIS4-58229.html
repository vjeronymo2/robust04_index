			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "exclusive" report from London] </F>   [Text] Observers recall the Committee for the Defense of  Legitimate Rights [CDLR], established by a group of Saudi  religious scientists and thinkers months ago. The committee was  widely highlighted by world media as the first of its kind in  Saudi Arabia, which is ruled completely by the royal house of  Sa'ud.    The Saudi regime did not receive the shock with much  patience. The regime pursued members and supporters of the  committee. It arrested many of them, dismissed many from their  jobs, and prevented their travel abroad. The step came in the  wake of two important developments: The first was the  establishment of the much awaited Shura Council, which is  appointed by the king and whose decisions are just  recommendations to him, to take or leave as he pleases --  indeed, it would be unimaginable for this council to deviate  from the regime's directives -- and the second was an operation  to contain the opposition, which took London as its  headquarters. Most of its leaders returned to the kingdom. The  conditions for their return were regarded to be greatly in the  interest of the Shiites. The Shiite opposition closed down their  AL-JAZIRAH AL-'ARABIYAH magazine, which they issued from London.  The government even bought the paper's archives at the  exorbitant price of 200,000 pounds sterling, despite the little  information they contained on the ruling family and its  activities.    As a result, the Sunni opposition found itself under siege.  A move was needed to stir the stagnant water. Therefore, the  group which established the CDLR decided to follow in the  footsteps of the Shiite opposition by working abroad.  Therefore, the committee's spokesman, Dr. al-Mas'ari, left for  London with a fake passport -- his original passport was  withheld by the regime. Dr. Sa'd al-Faqih traveled with him.  Last week, the two men began their political activity after  asking for political asylum in Britain.    The committee's opening statement explains the reason for  their actions and the basis of their moves in the future.    The CDLR statement said the committee transferred its  activities to London after every means of expression and reform  in the kingdom become impossible. The statement also said:  Repressive methods used against the reformists have increased  and have included preventing their travel, expelling them from  their jobs, and denying them the right to practice any work.  They are being pursued, interrogated, detained, imprisoned, and  tortured and are being threatened with death.    The statement appealed to Saudi nationals, those who support  the removal of injustice and who would like truth and justice to  prevail, to cooperate with it.    AL-SABIL has learned from sources close to al-Mas'ari that  before his departure, the committee contacted all effective  forces and figures in Saudi society to arrange matters. It won  great support for this course of action. Al-Mas'ari's  activities abroad are supposed to be coupled with great activity  at home.    Al-Mas'ari enjoyed wide-scale coverage in Western media. It  was learned that the Saudi government contacted London with a  view to returning him to the kingdom or preventing his political  work. However, the British government rejected the Saudi demand  because it infringed on British laws. The Saudi government also  pressured Dr. al-Faqih's family to force him to return, but  al-Faqih said he would not return.    In light of the above, al-Mas'ari will be the Saudi  opposition's vigilant eye abroad. He will convey what is  happening in his home country to the media abroad. His presence  will spur the opposition at home into action, especially when he  establishes a magazine or a daily newspaper in the name of the  opposition, which is expected soon.</p>

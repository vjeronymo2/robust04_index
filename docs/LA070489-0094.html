			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SO-SO 3RD;  </P> <P> A PECULIAR MIX OF WORK AND PLAY MARKS SEMI-HOLIDAY CELEBRATION  </P> <P> The workaday world was presented with a dilemma Monday, the third of July. It  was what some people were calling a "semi-holiday," an inconvenient lull  between a weekend and the Fourth of July holiday, and it created a peculiar  sort of day, part vacation, part work.  </P> <P> Most businesses and government offices were open, but few seemed to function as  they do most Mondays. From the commute to the volume of work, even to the way  people were dressed, there was a different feel to the day. The freeways ran  more smoothly, the workload was lighter, the pace more pacific, relaxed.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are working, true, but a lot of people took off," said David  Venable, a peace officer for the city of Los Angeles. "It's not as hot, not as  busy. It makes it a lot nicer to work. I love it."  </P> <P> Like Christmas and Thanksgiving, the Fourth is one of a few nationally  recognized holidays that cannot be rescheduled to create a three-day weekend.  The third of July would just not seem right.  </P> <P> Like the Friday that follows Thanksgiving, Monday was one of those days that,  for many, spoils a long weekend. Others simply ignore the fact that it isn't  really a legitimate holiday and enjoy.  </P> <P> One of the earliest signs that something was different came at rush hour Monday  morning. Freeway traffic was holiday-light, said those who monitor the jams and  congestion.  </P> <P> Rick Ruiz, a deputy to City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, said he was able to  whiz into work, from his home in Santa Monica, up the Santa Monica Freeway to a  downtown Los Angeles City Hall parking lot in just 20 minutes.  </P> <P> "It was the way you always dreamed it would be and never is, except during the  Olympics and on holidays," Ruiz said. "There was absolutely no traffic."  </P> <P> By mid-afternoon, heavier congestion was reported at some spots, especially  along beach-bound thoroughfares. The beach, along with the malls and libraries,  is where many of those who were able to duck work ended up.  </P> <P> "Today is pretty much like a Sunday," said Lt. Warren Rigby of the county  Lifeguard Service.  </P> <P> He estimated that the crowd Monday on the county's central section beaches,  from north of Marina del Rey to Topanga Canyon, at 200,000 people but predicted  that number could more than double today.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are making a four-day weekend of it," Rigby said.  </P> <P> Many private companies and manufacturing firms chose to give their employees  Monday off, perhaps more out of pragmatism than generosity.  </P> <P> "We have floating holidays, and so they figured this would be a good time to  give us one," said Kevin Brosnihan, 27, an engineer with the El Segundo office  of Rockwell International. "Probably no one would show up anyway."  </P> <P> Brosnihan and a co-worker, Madelyn Netkovick, used the extra holiday to cruise  on their racing bikes from Hermosa Beach to Marina del Rey, a trip they made in  about an hour. The bike path was more crowded than on a normal weekday, they  said, but nothing compared to a Sunday or a full-fledged holiday.  </P> <P> Because of the day's semi-holiday status, some office workers who did have to  report were ambivalent about what to wear.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Casual Clothes  </P> <P> At the Auto Dealer Center of First Los Angeles Bank, people were working  normally but had been given the option to report in casual clothes. Many were  dressed in T-shirts or sun dresses, and the boss, Assistant Vice President  Gerald Hammen, fed them with pizzas as reward for having to work on a day that  many others had free.  </P> <P> "The pressure on us is greater today because we don't have tomorrow," said  Hammen, dressed in an open-collar, cotton shirt with short sleeves that showed  off 30-year-old Navy tattoos from his days in the service.  </P> <P> Post office branches were open. Workers reported in the morning that patronage  at window service was lighter than usual, but it picked up as the day wore on.  Many restaurants and bars that cater to the corporate crowd were closed or  stayed open only long enough to serve lunch.  </P> <P> The county courts were open and running normally, according to a spokeswoman,  as was the Pacific Stock Exchange -- though the trading volume was reported to  be one of the smallest this year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fewer Calls  </P> <P> At city halls in Los Angeles and in the suburbs, receptionists, secretaries and  others were grateful for the reduced walk-in traffic and fewer phone calls --  though many calls were queries about whether offices were open.  </P> <P> "It's nice and quiet, and we're getting a lot done," said one secretary at  Santa Monica City Hall.  </P> <P> In West Hollywood, City Hall receptionist Brad Confer said offices were staffed  at about half-force.  </P> <P> "We've got a skeleton crew today," he said. "Everyone's home sleeping in or out  sunning themselves."  </P> <P> In downtown Los Angeles, crowds had thinned out in City Hall's construction  services office, where on normal days lines of people submitting plans or  seeking permits usually wind past counters, down a long hall and out a door.  </P> <P> "Usually, you have to spend the whole day just to submit plans," Art Yanez,  designer for a Tarzana architectural firm, said as he rolled up blueprints for  a residential project. "Today, I've been here just an hour, and I'm almost  ready."  </P> <P> For one visiting Briton, the unofficial holiday Monday was a source of  confusion. Terry Croft, a flight attendant for British Airways on a layover in  Los Angeles, said he found some stores open, others closed, and he wondered  just how many days it takes Americans to celebrate this holiday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Matter Debated  </P> <P> "We were just debating whether we'd be busy (on the flight home) tomorrow, it  being the Fourth," Croft said as he strolled down Santa Monica Pier. "I dare  say we will."  </P> <P> Since the first Fourth of July anniversary in 1777, roughly 30 have fallen on a  Tuesday. Observance of some holidays, such as Veterans Day and Washington's  Birthday, were switched to a predetermined Monday in legislation signed by  President Lyndon Johnson in 1968. The law, designed to give Americans three-day  weekends, went into effect in 1971.  </P> <P> In the case of Veterans Day, the change met with considerable opposition from  veterans groups, which noted that the original date, Nov. 11, coincided with  the signing of the armistice that ended World War I. After protests, the  holiday was restored to Nov. 11.  </P></p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A mixture of messages - A survey of agencies reveals optimism and uncertainty about the future The events of one day last month summed up the currently mixed messages coming from UK advertising agencies about prospects for business. Abbott Mead Vickers reported a slight drop in its pre-tax profits for the first half of the year, although chairman David Abbott said he saw signs that 'widespread cutbacks in client spending seem to be a thing of the past'. The group felt 'considerable optimism' as it looked forward to 1994, he added. A few London streets away and on the same day, agency Gold Greenlees Trott issued a warning that profit forecasts by the City for the year ending next April were over-optimistic. This was because the recovery in both advertising and sales promotion had been slower than anticipated. The result had been the deferral and reduction of spending by a number of clients, said GGT. The same mixed messages come from the latest annual survey by accountants Touche Ross of advertising agency profitability in 1992.* The past year has been one of 'uncertainty, tentative optimism and ultimately disappointment,' finds the survey. At the same time, there appears to have been an encouraging halt in the long-term decline of operating margins and operating profits are beginning to increase. The firm's latest annual survey is based on the results of the top 50 agency groups by billings. The combined pre-tax profits of the groups were wiped out by Saatchi and Saatchi's Pounds 600m write-off of goodwill, following the group's decision to acknowledge there had been a 'permanent diminution' in the value of goodwill on earlier acquisitions. Ignoring Saatchi's write-off, average profits fell 2 per cent on the previous year. For the first time, the survey includes some international comparisons for the largest quoted groups. By most measures, the US-controlled groups outperform their European competitors. For example, operating profit margins of UK-based quoted companies averaged 6.7 per cent last year, compared with a 13.8 per cent average for the US companies. The UK average, dominated as it is by the poor margins of Saatchi and Saatchi and WPP, masks the sound performances of Abbott Mead Vickers (15.5 per cent) and Gold Greenlees Trott (12.4 per cent), points out Touche Ross. An analysis of sources of profit from the published accounts of the largest quoted UK groups also shows that it has been more difficult in the past year to make profits in the home market than abroad. While there was no real growth in the UK in 1992, markets in Germany, Austria, Portugal, Belgium and Greece grew by between 8 per cent and 40 per cent. Profits from US operations outshone those for the rest of the world. Redundancy and reorganisation have again been a feature of the year, finds the survey. The top 50 agency groups have reduced the number of staff they employ by 5 per cent over the 12 months. An examination of those agencies which have retrenched shows that, overall, 'biting the bullet can and does work. It is not, as many think, the beginning of a downward spiral', finds the study. While the recession may have been the catalyst that has created the crisis for agencies, in many areas of activity it has merely focused attention on problems that have existed for some time. Concludes Touche Ross: 'The indications are that agencies have begun at last to tackle many of these problems. The many job losses and massive rationalisation costs testify that this has not been without pain.' *Tenth annual advertising agency profitability survey, edited by David Miles.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Recently more and more positive moves have been  taken in deepening state-owned enterprise reform. Following 6  and 9 June, when the Jiangxi machine tools plant and the  Nanchang steelworks were turned into state-owned,  limited-liability companies, a series of 32 wholly state-funded  companies, which were listed as pilot enterprises by the  provincial government, will be employing this operational  mechanism. This marks that Jiangxi has entered a new stage in  comprehensively reforming state-owned enterprises in accordance  with a modern enterprise system.    Since the beginning of this year, the provincial government  has actively promoted experiments in reforming industrial  enterprises. On 5 January this year, the governor's and vice  governors' work meeting adopted a decision on selecting 32 large  and medium-sized state-owned enterprises to conduct experiments  in forming wholly state-funded limited-liability companies, and  approved the 10-point proposal formulated by the provincial  commission for restructuring economy and the provincial economic  commission. Since then, each of the enterprises accordingly has  set up an experimental leading group; done an active job in such  basic work as checkup of warehouses, assessment of assets, and  revaluation of assets; readjusted the economic structure in  strict accordance with the stipulations of the Company Law;  optimized the disposition of resources, with the stress on  system upgrading; and established a new structure under which  property rights are clearly defined, government and enterprise  functions are separated, and management is scientific; thus  speeding up the pace of establishing a modern enterprise system.    It has been learned that the province's 32 selected pilot  enterprises occupy an important position among the large- and  medium-sized enterprises, and their products are in line with  the state's industrial policy, are marketable, and can produce  good economic results. Their leading bodies are of sound  quality and their enterprise management has a solid foundation.  They have managed to operate in accordance with the  stipulations of the Company Law and to separate state ownership  from the property rights of the enterprise legal persons,  avoiding reliance on administrative organs. Hence, the state's  once-unlimited responsibility for enterprises has become limited  responsibility.</p>

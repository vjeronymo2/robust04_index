			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Trade surplus at july record JAPAN posted another huge increase in its trade surplus in July, which reached Dollars 9.24bn (Pounds 4.9bn) on a customs cleared basis, 40 per cent higher than a year ago, the Finance Ministry said yesterday, Steven Butler reports from Tokyo. The figure is the highest ever recorded in July and puts Japan on course to achieve the record trade surplus this year that many economists have predicted. The trade surplus has been rising as the weakness in the Japanese economy puts a damper on demand for imported goods, while Japanese companies seek to unload excess inventories on overseas markets. The higher value of the yen compared with last year has also added to the magnitude of the surplus. The politically sensitive bilateral surplus with the US soared by 27.3 per cent in July to Dollars 3.83bn. Japan's surplus with the European Community rose by 35.3 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn. Japan enjoyed brisk exports of office equipment, cars, semiconductors, electronic parts, and motors and engines. Total exports grew by 10.8 per cent to Dollars 29.47bn, while imports increased by just 1.1 per cent to Dollars 20.23bn. The sluggish pace of imports came in spite of a 27 per cent rise in the value of crude oil imports. Japanese officials have sought to explain the persistent rise in the trade surplus over the past year as a product of special factors such as the strength of the yen or the weakness of commodity prices. It has become increasingly obvious, however, that Japan's efforts in the late 1980s to restructure the economy by relying more on domestic demand have simply failed. Frustration has grown among Japan's trade partners over the apparent inability of the government to take effective measures to stem the surplus.</p>

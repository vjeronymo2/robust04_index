			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE RECORD: A BLENDING OF STYLES IN CELEBRITY CHAMBER GROUPS  </P> <P> Celebrity chamber music, the superstars getting together to form a supernova,  proving that they can submerge their egos in the interests of intimate  ensemble, is more often a lark for the performers than a service to the  composer. But the exceptions can offer memorable rewards.  </P> <P> Deutsche Grammophon in notes for its new recording of the complete Beethoven  string trios (427 687, 2 CDs) offers no information on the performance history  of the ensemble composed of violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, violist Bruno  Giuranna and cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. The results, however, indicate that  they did not meet in a studio, shake hands and sit down to sight-read some fun  stuff. These performances not only crackle with virtuoso intensity: they are of  a piece, and they are Beethoven.  </P> <P> Not a trace of flippancy here. Even in the hyper-extended Opus 3, rhythms are  precise, phrases fully formed. And in the three trios of Opus 9, Beethoven's  splendid warm-ups for the Opus 18 quartets, Mutter/Giuranna/Rostropovich,  whether assuming a single voice or as three individuals, give us the full quota  of fiery drive, conversational elegance, Olympian serenity -- whatever the  music calls for. The darkly rapturous slow movement of the Trio in D, Opus 9,  No. 2, says it all. A splendid achievement.  </P> <P> Celebrities of the recent past, violinist Henryk Szeryng, cellist Pierre  Fournier and pianist Wilhelm Kempff assembled in 1970 for the first and only  time to contribute the six big Beethoven piano trios to Deutsche Grammophon's  massive, limited-circulation Beethoven bicentennial release. The trio  recordings return now as a readily obtainable, mid-priced DG set (415 879, 3  CDs).  </P> <P> The results are curious, with Szeryng, normally the aggressive player,  deferring to the senior member, Kempff -- the dozing man's pianist -- in  matters of tempo (slow, when his is  </P> <P> the opening gambit, slowed-down when he is preceded by Szeryng) and dynamics  (narrowly soft).  </P> <P> Kempff dominates not through physical strength but strength of will, imposing  his underemphasis, his miniaturization, presumably in the interests of Good  Taste and Classicism, in which intensity and music-flexing were at one time  verboten.  </P> <P> Add to Szeryng's frustration and Kempff's browsing Fournier's earnest,  gray-toned cello and you wind up with, well, very little.  </P> <P> Another mid-priced reissue (EMI/Angel Studio 63124, 3 CDs) offers the piano  trios with opus number as well as some snippets without recorded in 1970 by the  young, powerhouse assemblage of violinist Pinchas Zukerman, cellist Jacqueline  du Pre and pianist Daniel Barenboim. Their playing here, whether or not always  in accord with the chamber music ideal of thinking with a single mind, was --  and is -- so imbued with vitality and affection, to say nothing of sheer  mechanical skill, that academic critical standards become irrelevant.  </P> <P> While the perfection of an interpretive concept may be the end-all of chamber  music, if what emerges after years of ensemble gestation is playing of solid  proficiency, one would much rather have the stars in less than perfect  alignment.  </P> <P> These thoughts are inspired by Germany's dozen-year old Abegg Trio -- violinist  Ulrich Beetz, cellist Birgit Erichson, pianist Gerrit Zitterbart -- offering  every last scrap Beethoven wrote for their combination of instruments on four  individual Intercord CDs (860.860 through 860.863).  </P> <P> But the humor of, say, the flashing finales of Opus 1, No. 2 or Opus 70, No. 2  elude these people; the heavenly arches of the 'Archduke' are flattened out in  their rhythmically square reading, etc.  </P> <P> Much is made in Intercord's program notes about the performers' adherence to  the fast tempos indicated by Beethoven's original markings (as recalled by  Czerny).  </P> <P> OK, but Abegg speed plus Abegg stolidity do not add up to liveliness. It might  be noted in this connection that the more or less ad hoc  Perlman-Harrell-Ashkenazy trio, in EMI/Angel's 1987 set, play nearly everything  faster, and far more imaginatively, than the Abegg without citing (or, perhaps,  even being aware of) historical precedent.  </P></p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / India orders closure of N-reactors INDIA'S Atomic Energy Regulatory Board has ordered the closure of eight nuclear power stations for an inspection of turbines, generators and associated components. The decision to close the nuclear plants one by one follows the recommendations of an expert committee set up to investigate the cause of a fire at the Narora plant near Delhi in March. The Madras nuclear power plant in operation for the past two years at Kalpakkam, one of two in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, will be the first to be shut down, by July 31. Mr A Gopalakrishnan, chairman of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, said there was 'no specific doubt about the operation of pressurised heavy water reactor stations in the country', but the decision to shut down the stations in sequence had been taken 'as a matter of abundant caution'. The committee's report concluded that the Narora fire earlier this year, the first accident at a nuclear power station in India, had resulted from a rare combination of 'fatigue failure' of two steam turbine blades and 'deficiencies in the cabling system' leading to a loss of electric power supply. The total loss of power and an unprecedented 17-hour blackout of the station could have been avoided if the board's earlier recommendations for segregating cables and provision of fire barriers had been adequately followed. The plant's safety systems had worked well, according to the report, which is why there was no leakage of radioactivity. 'We want to be totally reassured that such a course of events do not reoccur in other power stations equipped with similar turbo-generators,' said Mr Gopalakrishnan. All nine Indian atomic power stations, which produce about 3 per cent of India's power, are equipped with turbo-generators manufactured by the UK's General Electric Company and the Indian government-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals. However, the Tarapur nuclear plant near Bombay is excluded from the shutdown because it uses enriched uranium-light water technology, and the board conducted a safety review at the station only recently. Inspection and modifications, if required, would begin simultaneously at all plants, and are expected to take two to three weeks to complete after each plant is shut. Stations which are shut down for maintenance, like the second Madras station, will be similarly tested before being allowed to resume operations. The government, which has denied charges by environmentalists that India's nuclear power programme does not follow international safety standards, plans to build as many as 15 more nuclear power reactors in the next 10 years, to ease the power crisis in the country.</p>

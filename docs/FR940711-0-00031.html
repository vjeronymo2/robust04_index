Section 981.441 is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;981.441 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Credit for market promotion activities, including paid advertising. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) In order for a handler to receive credit for his/her own promotional activities from his/her pro rata portion of advertising assessment payments, pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;981.41(c), the Board must determine that such expenditures meet the applicable requirements of this section. Credit will be granted either in the form of a payment from the Board, or as an offset to the advertising assessment if activities are conducted and documented to the satisfaction of the Board at least two weeks prior to assessment billings. Credit, hereinafter termed ``Credit-Back'', will be granted in an amount not to exceed 662/3 percent of a handler's proven expenditures for qualified activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The portion of the handler assessment for which credit may be received under this section will be billed, and is due and payable, at the same time as the portion of the handler assessment used for the Board's administrative expenses, unless the handler(s) conduct and document activities at least two weeks prior to assessment billings. In the latter case, handlers' advertising assessment obligations will be reduced according to the amount of proven activities approved by the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The Board shall grant Credit-Back for qualifying activities only to the handler who performed such activities and who filed a claim for Credit-Back in accordance with this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Credit-Back shall be granted only for qualified promotional activities which are conducted and completed during the crop year for which Credit-Back is requested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The following requirements shall apply to Credit-Back for all promotional activities:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Credit-Back granted by the Board shall be that which is appropriate when compared to accepted professional practices and rates for the type of activity conducted. In the case of claims for Credit-Back activities not covered by specific and established criteria, the Board shall grant the claim if it is consistent with practices and rates for similar activities. To this end, the Board may issue guidelines for qualifying activities from time to time as warranted. For activities in markets other than the United States and Canada, paragraph (e)(5) of this section shall also apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The clear and evident purpose of each activity shall be to promote the sale, consumption or use of California almonds, and nothing therein shall detract from this purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) No Credit-Back will be given for advertising placed in publications that target the farming or grower trade. No Credit-Back shall be given for any outdoor advertising or sponsorships in the California almond growing counties of Butte, Colusa, Fresno, Glenn, Kern, Madera, Merced, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tulare counties, except that, outdoor advertising in these counties which specifically directs consumers to a handler-operated outlet offering direct purchase of almonds will be eligible for Credit-Back.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Credit-Back shall be granted for those qualified activities specified below, except that Credit-Back for travel expenses will not be allowed in any case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paid advertising directed to end-users, trade or industrial users.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Credit-Back shall be granted for money spent on paid advertising space or time including, but not limited to, newspapers, magazines, radio, television, transit and outdoor media, and including the standard agency commission costs not to exceed 15 percent of gross.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

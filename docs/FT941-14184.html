			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Arts: Today's Television Britain's ice skating stars Torvill and Dean are in an almost impossible position at the European Figure Skating Championships in Copenhagen which are covered in Ice Skating (8.00 BBC1). There will be disappointment not only if they fail to win but if they fail to repeat that clean-sweep of sixes which they achieved with their 'Mack And Mabel' number at the same venue in 1982. Today is the first time their new free dance routine will be tested internationally. There are several ways of dealing with nuisance phone callers. If you have the chutzpah you can outdo them at their own game. Keeping a referee's whistle by the phone and blowing it hard can also be effective. But our favourite is to put the receiver down quietly on something soft and let the nutters talk to themselves. Public Eye considers the problem (8.00 BBC2). Further Abroad is a series that viewers either love or loathe. Jonathan Meades is a presenter whose idiosyn-cratic style and attitudes I enjoy, but cause some critics to howl in rage.

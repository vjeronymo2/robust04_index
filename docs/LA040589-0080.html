			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CAPSIZED BARGE SPILLS LYE INTO OHIO RIVER  </P> <P> Authorities said Tuesday that there was no immediate threat to wildlife or  water supplies from a barge loaded with 160,000 gallons of lye that ran aground  and capsized on the Ohio River.  </P> <P> The barge was one of 15 being transported by a tugboat around a sharp bend when  it broke away and ran aground near the rocky shore, Lt. Cmdr. Arthur Adkins of  the Coast Guard said.  </P> <P> Cleanup and removal of the barge is expected to take weeks.  </P> <P> The accident occurred about 20 miles southwest of Parkersburg at Long Bottom,  Ohio, and Murraysville, W.Va., near where a barge also carrying lye ran aground  two years ago.  </P> <P> No leaks were detected in the latest incident, Adkins said, but small amounts  of the lye solution, known as sodium hydroxide or caustic soda, may be seeping  through vents in the barge.  </P></p>

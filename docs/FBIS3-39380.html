			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`I Am Coordinator General....'"] </F>   [Excerpts] Cavaco Silva has disclaimed any responsibility  in the Health Ministry affair and praised Leonor Beleza's  courage and honesty. In yesterday evening's interview with TVI,  the head of government gave his assurance that there are no  cases of corruption being kept under wraps. He avoided speaking  about the Totta [Bank]. [passage omitted]    Throughout the interview, conducted by journalists Artur  Albarran of TVI, Jaime Antunes of the SEMANARIO ECONOMICO, and  Luis Delgado of DIARIO DE NOTICIAS, there were many questions  which went unanswered, since Cavaco Silva frequently asserted  that he or his party had formed no opinion on certain matters.    One of the matters left unclarified was that of Cavaco  Silva's possible candidacy for the presidency of the republic.    The PSD [Social Democratic Party] leader confined himself to  repeating that he intends to fulfill his "pledge to the  Portuguese people until 1995" -- the year of the legislative  elections -- and will decide only afterward "what to do,  including returning to academic life."    With respect to the current holder of the post, Cavaco  maintained that he maintains "completely normal relations" with  Mario Soares, despite the political disagreements in several  areas, and emphasized the view upheld at the last PSD National  Council meeting, that his party should help the current  president to complete his term "with dignity."    The revision of the Constitution was also raised by the  three  journalists, with Cavaco Silva citing the section on the  electoral laws as one which, in his opinion, needs improvements.    "There should be improvements to the Constitution aimed at a  better link between the electorate and the elected," he  asserted, and to this end he suggested the formation of smaller  constituencies.    He also maintained that the electoral laws -- for the  Assembly of the Republic and for the local authorities -- should  "facilitate the formation of majorities." In the legislative  elections, "it should be possible for a party to achieve a  majority with 39 percent or 40 percent of the votes."    He said that "greater effectiveness in municipal  administration" is necessary, and advocated the candidacy of  independents and groups of citizens. He did not forget the  extension to emigrants of the vote for the presidency of the  republic -- a PSD "banner" over the past few years.    Asked about the revision of the president's powers, he  confined himself to repeating: "My party has not defined a  stance on that matter."    Cavaco also advocated keeping the figure of the minister of  the republic -- "I believe that he has made an important  contribution to national cohesion and to championing the  autonomous regions' interests in the government" -- a statement  which must not have pleased his party colleagues in the Azores  and Madeira.    The economic balance sheet for 1993 took up part of the  interview, with Cavaco asserting that economic growth improved  in the second half of the year, but acknowledging that  "investment remained very depressed."    With respect to the devaluation of the escudo, he said that  those who advocate it "are advocating unemployment" -- an  implicit criticism of [Socialist Party Secretary General]  Antonio Guterres.    He recalled that "interest rates fell by 5 percent" last  year, and added: "I am convinced that they will fall further.  The essential thing is to maintain our course."    "My major concern is unemployment. It is my major priority,"  he stated, before asserting: "I was tremendously disappointed  not to have achieved social consensus," but he reaffirmed that  that this was owing to political reasons.    The prime minister said little about the Totta case,  claiming  that it is a private enterprise, that the government confined  itself to enacting the privatization law, and that it now rests  with the courts to establish whether it is being observed.    At the end of the interview, there was still time for Cavaco  to state that in Bosnia "some punitive actions are justified in  view of the atrocities."</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Management: Teaming up for development The use of multi-disciplinary 'project teams' is rightly becoming the rage. Organisations are realising that it brings a string of advantages  - in terms of speed, cost and quality - over the traditional practice of passing projects from one narrow specialist department (or 'function') to another, each of which does its work in turn. Two particular spurs to this trend are the widespread introduction of total quality management, and the growing need to accelerate the time it takes to bring new products and services to market. But few companies have really mastered how to manage their project teams. Some have made the mistake of relying on a 'lightweight' approach, in which a relatively junior person is given limited powers of co-ordination, and the key resources - including specialists on the project - remain under the control of their respective functional managers. Others have gone an important step further, but not far or systematically enough. Sensibly, they have not only moved all the members of the team to a single location ('co-located' them), they have also appointed 'heavyweight' project managers: senior people with responsibility for the work of everyone involved in the project. But they have failed to follow a set of detailed organisational and leadership principles which pioneering companies have demonstrated to be vital to the success of 'heavyweight' teams. These principles are discussed in a new book by two of Harvard Business School's leading professors, Steven Wheelwright and Kim Clark*. An extract is also published in the current California Management Review**. Their work focuses on the management of product development, but much of it also applies to a wide range of other team processes, in both manufacturing and service industries. Examining the challenge of managing heavyweight teams, the academics warn that they may not merely conflict with the functional organisation  - an obvious risk - but may also undermine senior management's influence and control. Wheelwright and Clark outline six principles to minimise such difficulties: Creation by senior management of a clear mission for the team, in the form of a project charter which sets out broad performance objectives. Creation by the project leader and core team (as distinct from its subsidiary members) of a detailed contract book, against which it is willing to be evaluated. This should include a detailed work plan, an estimate of the resources required, and an outline of the results to be achieved. Staffing of the core team throughout the project by, typically, one member from each primary function of the organisation. Other staffing principles include, wherever possible, not allowing a core member of the team to occupy a similar position on another team. Project leadership in a very different style from that used with lightweight teams. Heavyweight leaders not only manage, lead and evaluate other members of the core team. They also champion the basic concept around which the product, process or service is being shaped. They spend time out of the office, talking not just to project contributors inside and outside the company, but also to customers, dealers and so forth. This includes gathering market data at first hand. Team member responsibilities are wide. As well as each member's own functional responsibility (for example, for all appropriate marketing expertise), each core member also shares responsibility for the team's overall performance. An executive sponsor is needed in senior management. This person acts as a channel for communication with top management, and as coach and mentor for the project and its leader, while also 'empowering the team to lead and act'. Creating a team that really is 'heavy' - one with effective leadership, strong problem-solving skills, and the ability to integrate across functions  -also requires changes in the day-to-day attitudes and behaviour of engineers, designers, manufacturing and marketing specialists, conclude the Harvard duo. *Revolutionizing Product Development.

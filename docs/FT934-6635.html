			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / EDS to process tax data: Pounds 1bn Revenue computer contract awarded to US company The contract for operating the Inland Revenue computers which process data for income tax and corporation tax has been awarded to EDS-Scicon, a subsidiary of General Motors. This is the first time that a government has contracted out the data processing of confidential tax information, although EDS already processes sensitive data for the US defence department. The company will be required to carry out all processing of confidential information in the UK. Access to the information will not be allowed from outside the UK. The contract is said by the Inland Revenue to be worth 'well over Pounds 1bn over the next 10 years', making it Europe's largest data processing outsourcing deal. It overtakes the Pounds 900m contract for British Aerospace data processing which was awarded last week to Computer Sciences Corporation. A consortium of CSC and IBM was the other bidder on the shortlist for the Revenue contract. Subject to discussions on the details of the contract, about 2,000 civil servants in the Revenue's Information Technology Office will start the transfer to EDS-Scicon in April. The transfer is expected to be covered by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 1981. Civil service terms and conditions will therefore be preserved for staff who transfer. The Revenue expects that a 'strategic partnership' with EDS will make it easier to upgrade the department's computer operations using new systems development techniques. This will make it easier to change the tax system over the next decade with the arrival of self-assessment, assessment of all tax on a current-year basis and the abolition of separate tax schedules. The department is reorganising its operations to improve customer service in part by making a single tax office responsible for each taxpayer. Bulk clerical and processing work will be concentrated in large regional back offices. The decision to award the contract to a US company was criticised last night by the IRSF tax staff union. Mr Clive Brooke, union general secretary, said it was regrettable that the staff had not been allowed to bid. EDS has also won a five-year contract to provide information technology services for the new parking enforcement regime in London, under which boroughs are responsible for enforcing restrictions and collecting fines. The company will also provide management services to the Parking Committee for London, which co-ordinates the new scheme.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] On the evening of 10 February, President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari replied to coffee growers' proposals,  requests, and demands during a meeting to assess the 1993-94  coffee harvest season and analyze proposals for the 1994-95  season. After listening for an hour in the Carranza Room in Los  Pinos Presidential Residence to the serious crisis coffee  growers face because of drops in international coffee prices,  Salinas announced 10 guidelines to help coffee growers: First,  36 million new pesos will be earmarked to help low production  zones; second, the National Solidarity Program [Pronasol] will  transfer Inmecafe [Mexican Coffee Institute] facilities to  coffee growers organizations; third, savings banks, guarantee  funds, and credit unions will be revamped to increase their  financing capacity; and fourth, all Inmecafe facilities  transferred to coffee organizations will be registered within a  month. President Salinas details the fifth measure:    [Begin Salinas recording] Both the Pronasol Enterprise Fund  and the National Finance Bank are ready. We are going to back  up all projects if they are economically viable. [end recording]    The other measures are as follows: sixth, the National Rural  Credit Bank will receive 100 million new pesos to grant farming  credits and to restructure expired portfolios; seventh, the  National Foreign Trade Bank will receive $200 million to help  coffee exports; eighth, the Mexican Coffee Council [Consejo  Mexicano del Cafe] will boost portfolio restructuring with  private banks; ninth, coffee growers will be incorporated into  the IMSS-Pronasol [Mexican Social Security Institute-Pronasol]  program to improve their health conditions; and 10th, Salinas  announced an additional non-budgetary offer:    [Begin Salinas recording] We started out with 140 million  new  pesos. We are now ready to more than double these funds, which  will amount to 333 million new pesos, to help coffee growers.  [applause] [end recording]    President Salinas said that the solution to coffee growers'  problems will be laid in a slow, yet different and profound  process.    Arturo Jimenez from La Selva de Las Margaritas, Chiapas  State; Jorge Aguilar from La Sierra Madre de Motozintla; Marcelo  Herrera of the Independent Central Organization of Agricultural  Workers and Peasants [Central Independiente de Obreros Agricolas  y Campesinos]; Fernando Celiz of the Coordinating Board of  Coffee Organizations [Coordinadora de Organizaciones de Cafe];  and Rafael Arellanes of the National Coffee Producers Union  [Union Nacional de Productores de Cafe] were among the speakers.</p>

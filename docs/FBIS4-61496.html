			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia and Kazakhstan intend to continue  consultations soon to word an inter-governmental treaty on  Moscow's lease of the Baykonur space center.    A top Russian Space Agency official disclosed to INTERFAX  that the agency's General Director Yuriy Koptev is to meet with  Kazakhstan's Deputy Premier Galym Abilsiitov in Almaty to  discuss possible solutions to the issue.    The treaty must tally with the interstate agreement "On the  basic principles and terms of using the Baykonur space center,"  signed by the presidents Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev  in Moscow on March 28. The latter accord legally entitles  Russia to use Baykonur and the adjacent town of Leninsk during  20 years and prolong the lease, if it wishes, for yet another 10  years. Russia's annual pay for the use of these facilities is  set at 115 million dollars.    As INTERFAX has learned, pending his trip to Almaty, Koptev  met on Wednesday with the Russian Aero-Space Forces' Vladimir  Ivanov to coordinate a single position on the status of Russian  servicemen at Baykonur. The Aero-Space Forces are responsible  for launching all spacecraft and boosters from Baykonur.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY ETHICS PANEL BALKS AT MAKING FPPC A LEGISLATIVE WATCHDOG  </P> <P> The Assembly Select Committee on Ethics, contending that legislators should  police themselves, rejected a proposal Thursday to give an outside enforcement  agency -- the Fair Political Practices Commission -- the power to watch over  lawmakers' conduct.  </P> <P> Attempting to piece together a code of ethics for the Legislature, the panel  agreed to restrict the size of honorariums and gifts legislators may receive  but stopped short of imposing a ban on such outside payments. Ultimately, the  panel agreed that honorariums should be banned if legislators receive a  corresponding salary increase.  </P> <P> The decisions came during the third in a series of unusual public meetings in  which the panel is drafting new rules designed to clean up the tarnished image  of the Legislature.  </P> <P> In recent months, Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) has been indicted on a  charge of forgery and Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) has been indicted on  charges of extorting payment of honorariums in exchange for action on specific  bills.  </P> <P> "What we're all about here is trying to improve the image of this body (the  Assembly)," said Assemblyman Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad), who sits on the  newly created Ethics Committee.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, several members of the committee expressed the view that problems  of conflict of interest and payment of honorariums are not as serious as some  outsiders have suggested.  </P> <P> "There really isn't that big a problem with conflict of interest," said  Assemblyman William H. Lancaster (R-Covina), a member of the panel and chairman  of the virtually dormant Joint Legislative Ethics Committee.  </P> <P> And Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) argued that the ethical  problems posed by the receipt of speaking fees from groups with an interest in  legislation "pales" when compared to the much larger amounts of campaign  donations doled out each year by the same interests.  </P> <P> One of the key issues facing the committee Thursday was whether to bring in the  Fair Political Practices Commission to enforce conflict-of-interest laws in the  Legislature.  </P> <P> Because of a loophole in the Political Reform Act of 1974, legislators are  exempt from outside enforcement of laws prohibiting them from voting on matters  in which they have a financial interest. By contrast, local elected officials  throughout the state are subject to scrutiny and potential fines by the Fair  Political Practices Commission.  </P> <P> Although the Legislature has its own joint ethics committee with the power to  look into conflict-of-interest allegations, it has shown an extreme reluctance  to investigate members of the Legislature. Under Lancaster's chairmanship, the  committee has met only twice since 1985 and has not initiated any  investigations.  </P> <P> Freshman Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo), who ran on a platform of ethics  reform, urged his colleagues on the panel to bring in the political watchdog  commission to take action against any legislator who has a conflict of  interest.  </P> <P> "If we are going to be serious about reform in this area, we should put the  Legislature in line with other elected officials and have FPPC enforcement," he  said. "If we're going to leave conflict of interest to the in-house ethics  committee, then we're not really changing anything."  </P> <P> But by a vote of 7 to 1, Lempert's proposal was rejected. Instead the committee  decided to broaden the jurisdiction of the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee  so that it could become more aggressive in policing members.  </P> <P> Vasconcellos and other members of the panel argued that the Legislature should  not give an outside agency the authority to investigate its members.  </P> <P> "I'm not about to do that to myself or anybody else," Vasconcellos said. "I  think we can police ourselves adequately."  </P> <P> In dealing with the issue of outside income, the panel voted to place an annual  limit of $1,000 on all honorariums and gifts to a legislator from a single  source. Honorariums could not total more than one-third of a legislator's  salary, which is now $40,816.  </P> <P> In addition, honorariums would be paid only for substantive appearances, not  simply for meeting with an interest group. Legislators who receive an  honorarium would have to report their scheduled appearance at least a week in  advance and afterward provide the newly constituted ethics committee with a  transcript or tape recording of their speech.  </P> <P> In the long run, the panel agreed it would favor an outright ban on honorariums  and a limit on earned outside income equal to one-third of a legislator's  salary. However, the committee agreed that such restrictions would have to be  linked with a constitutional amendment creating an independent panel that would  have the authority to substantially increase legislators' salaries.  </P></p>

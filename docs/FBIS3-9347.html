"Ukraine and Poland are two big partners in our subregion,  and the deepening of their mutual relations may have a  significant meaning for the entire region, and may become an  example of jointly naming and solving concrete problems," said  Zlenko during a press conference on the second and last day of  his visit to Poland.    The Ukrainian guest said he is satisfied with the talks with  Polish politicians. He said he discussed with Polish Foreign  Minister Andrzej Olechowski Ukraine's possible access to the  France-German-Poland axis.    He said he also discussed the filling of the security vacuum  in central and eastern Europe and the creation of a joint  collective security system.</p>

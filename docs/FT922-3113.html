			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Buoyant British Land rises 7.4% MR John Ritblat, chairman of British Land, yesterday called the turn in the UK property market. 'For the first time since 1989 we think we have now seen the worst,' he said. His remarks accompanied the announcement of a 7.4 per cent rise in profits from Pounds 31.0m to Pounds 33.3m for the year to March 31. Net assets per share fell 18 per cent from 401p to 329p. Mr Ritblat, a veteran of the 1974 property crash when British Land's share price dropped to 3.5p, said this property slump was 'far more serious' than that of the early 1970s. However, he said he thought that investors in good quality property were beginning to come back to the market, even though it would take several years for rental values to improve. 'Markets may be flat and difficult, but we believe that they will respond to a selectively improving trend,' he said. Mr Ritblat said he did not expect further write-downs in his portfolio this year. He hoped that writing down book values by 60 per cent over three years in the City of London, the worst-affected investment market, had 'removed any further downside from the equation'. British Land's Pounds 2bn portfolio fell by 10.48 per cent with a 31 per cent drop in the value of its City of London property, a 22 per cent fall in the rest of London, a 7 per cent rise in provincial property and a 1 per cent fall in its overseas properties. The overall yield on the property moved up from 7.2 per cent to 8.1 per cent. The general decline in property values was partly offset by new purchases, which were valued at more than cost. British Land has spent about Pounds 900m on property during the downturn. Last year it bought Pounds 230m of property and sold property worth Pounds 100m. Gross rents rose by 30.6 per cent to Pounds 127m. The company's gearing has risen from 72 per cent to 98 per cent, treating convertible capital bonds as equity. Earnings per share rose from 10.8p to 12.5p. A final dividend of 4.28p was declared, making a total of 6.35p (against 5.75p last time). British Land's share price rose 10p to 214p. Lex, Page 20</p>

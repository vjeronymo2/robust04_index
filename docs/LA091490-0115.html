			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A 22-year-old man, shot and wounded by police last week, was charged Thursday  with three felony counts, including assault with a firearm on a peace officer,  a deputy district attorney said.  </P> <P> Sean White of Southeast San Diego was also charged with being a felon in  possession of a firearm and for being a felon with a concealed firearm, said  deputy Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Al Williams.  </P> <P> White, a 1985 graduate of La Jolla High School and former captain of the  football team, was on parole after pleading guilty to the October, 1986,  kidnaping of a Navy enlisted man.  </P> <P> Because of the prior felony, White could have an extra five years tacked on to  his sentence if convicted, Williams said.  </P> <P> White was arrested last Wednesday after allegedly starting to draw a  semiautomatic pistol on a San Diego Police officer.  </P> <P> The officer fired five shots, hitting White once in the stomach and once  grazing his back.  </P> <P> When White collapsed, an additional weapon -- a sawed-off shotgun -- fell out  of his jacket, police said.  </P> <P> White was released Monday from Mercy Hospital. He is being held at the County  Jail and has a preliminary hearing scheduled for Sept. 26.  </P></p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Barclays' chief promises to give up some powers: Buxton to meet shareholders over concerns at quality of management MR Andrew Buxton, chairman and chief executive of Barclays Bank, yesterday responded to investors' criticism of the bank's top management by promising that 'a significant part' of his responsibilities would be passed to a new senior executive during this year. Mr Buxton, whose bank last week reported a Pounds 242m pre-tax loss and halved its final dividend, acknowledged that he bore a share of the blame for a rapid growth in property and construction lending in the late 1980s which contributed to bad debt provisions of Pounds 2.5bn for 1992. He told the Financial Times he accepted that shareholders had worries about Barclays' management, but believed these were not overwhelming. 'I acknowledge that some shareholders are concerned, but I have not got the impression that they want to fire the whole of the management team,' he said. Mr Buxton's remarks follow expressions of discontent from fund managers holding about 15 per cent of the bank's shares over the quality of its management. Some investors believe that Mr Buxton, who was appointed managing director of the bank in May 1988, should resign. Mr Buxton said the bank was considering appointing either an outsider or one of its existing senior executives to a new senior post. This might not carry the title of chief executive, but whoever was appointed would have to be seen clearly to be taking over broad responsibilities. 'There is no point in bringing someone in from outside, or appointing someone from within, who did not take a significant part of my responsibilities away from me,' said Mr Buxton, who is to hold a series of meetings with large shareholders over the next two weeks. Mr Buxton said the bank's interim dividend of 9.15p was likely to be reduced this year, but only as part of a 'realignment' of the new annual dividend of 15.15p. He said the bank was convinced that the new level of its annual dividend, reduced by 28 per cent from 21.15p, was sustainable. Although most institutions appear to favour the bank bringing in a new chief executive from outside, there has been concern that the appointment of an outsider could lead to senior figures such as Sir Peter Middleton, the deputy chairman, leaving because their responsibilities would be reduced. Mr Buxton said he was 'working closely' with Sir Peter and Mr Alastair Robinson, the head of the banking division and an executive vice-chairman, to ensure that no member of the existing senior management team was surprised or offended by whatever change took place. He did not believe he was in danger of losing executives such as Mr David Band, BZW chief executive. 'That is not my impression of their mood. If I suddenly jumped something on them without consulting them, I am sure they would be extremely upset, but I am not going to do that,' he said. Mr Buxton said he acknowledged his share of responsibility for the expansion of lending in the late 1980s after he was appointed managing director under Sir John Quinton, the former chairman. He bore responsibility both as a board member, and as a senior executive. 'I was a member of the board then, and the board ultimately takes responsibility for the bank. I also acknowledge that - with hindsight - when I became managing director I wish I had jumped on the problem of expansion earlier,' said Mr Buxton, who was appointed chairman in January. He added that bad debts from the 1980s should not overshadow an 18.4 per cent rise in operating profits in 1992. 'The management team has performed pretty well if you look back at the past two years. Our decisions have been constructive and good for shareholders.' Called to account for past practices Page 18</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["DPRK FM Spokesman Urges United States To Cancel Deployment </F> of Patriot in S. Korea"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- If the United States  finally deploys new-type missiles, turning a deaf ear to our  just demand for an immediate stop to the deployment of Patriot  missiles in South Korea, it would entail grave consequences,  said a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea in a statement today, urging the  United States to ponder over it.    The statement says:    Forty-eight Patriot missile launching pads and a more than  800- men missile unit are moving to South Korea from Texas, the  United States, on order from the U.S. President on March 21, and  they will reportedly arrive in South Korea toward the end of  April. This proves that, from the very beginning, the United  States had no intention to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula through dialogue and negotiations but has used the  "nuclear problem" as a means of isolating and stifling the DPRK.    We sternly denounce the U.S. shipment of Patriot missiles to  South Korea as a deliberate act to openly break the agreed point  of the DPRK-USA joint statement on refraining from nuclear  threat to the other and push the situation on the Korean  peninsula to the brink of war.    The United States is bringing Patriot missiles to South  Korea, laying the blame for the collapse of the dialogue at the  door of the DPRK. This is a deliberate, dangerous military  action to make the military situation of the Korean peninsula  all the more unstable and, further, cause another war.    Though the U.S. authorities are now claiming that the  Patriot  is a "defensive weapon," they cannot justify its deployment in  South Korea with any pretext.    From the topographical point of view, the Patriot missile  can  be used for the purpose of strike at any place of the Korean  peninsula, which is not large. It is known to everyone that its  target can be changed by the kind of the warhead it is tipped  with. The U.S. shipment of new-type Patriots in South Korea is  nothing but an open aggressive act to threaten the DPRK  militarily and make a forestalling strike at it.    The United States reveals its intention to keep hold on  South  Korea indefinitely as its forward base in the Far East and  continue to play the role of the MP [military police] in this  region by deploying the improved missiles.    The decision of the United States to deploy the new-type  Patriot missiles in South Korea is an illegal act of wantonly  violating the Korean Armistice Agreement and ignoring the  armistice machine.    The armistice agreement clearly stipulates that military  equipment and combat materiel shall not be introduced into the  Korean peninsula.    In the past days, the United States shipped into South Korea  nuclear arms and many other kinds of equipment of new types in a  covert manner, fearful of the armistice agreement. This time,  however, it openly declared the deployment of the new-type of  Patriot missiles in South Korea and is forcing it in broad  daylight. This shows that the U.S. authorities pay no heed to  the armistice agreement and armistice machine, and they throw  away any international commitments like a pair of worn-out shoes  if it is to attain their aim.    It must not be overlooked that the South Korean authorities,  wearing its own nuclear helmet under the U.S. "nuclear  umbrella," officially asked for the deployment of the Patriot  missiles, clinging to the coattails of outside forces as ever.  This clearly shows that the South Korean authorities have  joined the United States in the nuclear kickup to stifle the  DPRK and that they are not interested at all in the  implementation of the "joint declaration on the denuclearisation  of the Korean peninsula."    The behaviour of the South Korean authorities makes it plain  that they are more zealous in frustrating the DPRK-USA talks  than in realising the exchange of special envoys.    The United States must immediately stop the deployment of  the  missiles posing a great threat to peace and security of the  Korean peninsula and the Far East, and the South Korean  authorities must discontinue at once their treacherous acts  harming the fellow countrymen.</p>

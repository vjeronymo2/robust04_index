			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Setback for Russian budget Russian government attempts to win approval for its austere 1995 budget were dented yesterday when Mr Mikhail Zadornov, parliamentary finance committee chairman, said the proposals were unacceptable in their present form. 'The forecast and estimates. . . . are not realistic,' he said during parliamentary hearings. Voices have already been raised against the budget's severity, and the balance of support for radical reform within the government is itself unclear following the reshuffle of senior ministers. Mr Yevgeny Yasin, the new economics minister, defended the budget, saying conditions were ripe for a new stage of reform, given that the decline in industrial production was bottoming out and the growth in savings provided the opportunity for investment. He stressed the government's commitment to producing economic stabilisation next year, predicting that inflation would fall from 270-280 per cent forecast for the current year to 70 per cent in 1995. He would also press for tax cuts for industry next year, presumably on the basis that a lowering of the rates may encourage greater compliance.</p>

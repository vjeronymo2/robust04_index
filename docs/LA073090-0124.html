			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES TYPICALLY COST LESS OUTSIDE U.S.  </P> <P> Question: When I was in Canada visiting my son, I ran out of my blood pressure  medicine Dyazide. My son's physician was kind enough to write me a prescription  for a month's supply.  </P> <P> To my amazement, when I got the prescription filled, it cost only half as much  as it would have at home. I specifically asked the pharmacist if this was a  generic drug instead of the brand name, but she showed me the bottle of Dyazide  she had used to fill it. She said that drugs are less expensive in Canada than  the United States.  </P> <P> Answer: Americans spend more for their medicines than virtually anyone else. We  have received letters from people who have traveled to Mexico, Canada and a  number of European countries and discovered that the drugs they were taking  cost far more here.  </P> <P> Foreign governments often control the prices of pharmaceutical products. This  usually means their citizens pay 30% to 50% less.  </P> <P> Next time you visit your son, you might want to consider stocking up. You can  bring back up to three months' supply of your medication, but go equipped with  a letter from your doctor and a signed statement of your own promising that the  medicine is for your personal use.  </P> <P> Q. I was alarmed when I read about how heat and humidity can wreck medicine. I  do not have air-conditioning and the temperature has gone over 90 degrees this  summer. Should I be keeping my pills in the refrigerator?  </P> <P> A. Check with your pharmacist. The refrigerator is too cold for some  medications and too humid for others. The pharmacist can check on storage  requirements and tell you if the heat is likely to do your pills any harm.  </P> <P> If he suggests you keep your medicine in the refrigerator, make sure your  container is airtight so it can keep out moisture. If it has a child-proof cap,  the container should be sealed in a plastic bag to protect the pills from  humidity.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANADIAN AIR FORCE JETS COLLIDE OVER W. GERMANY; 1 KILLED  </P> <P> Two Canadian fighter jets collided over this southwestern German city during  the evening rush hour Tuesday, killing one of the pilots and showering sections  of Karlsruhe with flaming debris, officials said.  </P> <P> The dead pilot was identified as Capt. Timothy K. Leuty, 30.  </P> <P> West German television said his parachute apparently failed to open after the  4:10 p.m. collision.  </P> <P> The other pilot, Capt. Reginald deCoste, 35, ejected safely and landed on a  highway, breaking both heels. He was listed in good condition.  </P> <P> At least two people on the ground were also hurt.  </P> <P> The single-seat CF-18s, Canadian versions of the American F-18, had taken off  from Baden-Soellingen Air Base near Rastatt, about 25 miles southwest of  Karlsruhe, police said.  </P> <P> The aircraft crashed in areas of this city of 285,000 that were sparsely  settled, setting off small brush fires, police said.  </P> <P> Canadian air force officials said there were no munitions on board the craft,  which were apparently involved in training maneuvers.  </P> <P> The crash is expected to rekindle a debate over the dozens of military training  flights crisscrossing West Germany's skies each day.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 22 (CTK) -- Slovakia will likely  apply for European Union (EU) membership after the ratification  of its association agreement with the EU by the parliaments of  the "Twelve," State Secretary in the Slovak Foreign Ministry  Lubor Bystricky told CTK today.    "It can happen next year," he added.    "However, when Slovakia applies for EU membership will  depend  primarily on the process of ratification of the association  agreement by the individual [EU] states. Neither from the  formal, nor from the political points of view would it be wise  to jump the gun in this process. It could be perceived as an  expression of unprofessional impatience," Bystricky said.    "It would also be of no use to apply for membership only out  of prestige," Bystricky said, referring to the necessity of  adjusting Slovakia's norms to the EU ones.    Bystricky said his comments did not refer to Hungary or  Poland which have already applied for EU membership.    He said he expected the association agreement to be ratified  by the EU countries' parliaments by the end of this year,  despite the fact that to date only Denmark, Great Britain and  Portugal have done so.    "Slovakia will apply for fully-fledged membership at the  next  EU Council session," Bystricky said, adding that it could  achieve its goal "at the turn of the millennium."    However, a necessary prerequisite for this to become reality  is that "there are not any changes in the internal political  development in the autumn parliamentary elections and that  forces rejecting the "four European freedoms" -- freedom of  movement for work force, capital, goods and services -- will not  gain the upper hand, Bystricky said. Under the association  agreement, conditions for their introduction must be created in  Slovakia in ten years.    He said that the measures like an import surcharge or  certificates (on goods imported to Slovakia) do not run counter  to the efforts at integration. "The government could not afford  to introduce measures that would be at variance with the  association agreement; the agreement provides for sanctions if  this happened," Bystricky said. He also dismissed the suspicion  of an alleged discrimination of Czech exporters, unlike EU  exporters, and spoke in favor of as quick as possible conclusion  of a Slovak-Czech agreement on mutual recognition of  certificates on goods quality on the basis of EU norms.</p>

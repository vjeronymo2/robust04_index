			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Opposition assurance on Maastricht stance LABOUR'S pro-Maastricht faction yesterday won assurances from the leadership that nothing would be done during the debate on ratification that could be interpreted as helping the Tory Euro-sceptics. The pledge came from Mr Jack Cunningham at the weekly meeting of the parliamentary Labour party where those seeking outright opposition to all closure motions cutting short debate on amendments to the treaty clashed with others committed to qualified support. In an attempt to calm the debate on tactics, the shadow foreign secretary said Labour's business managers intended to continue to keep their cards close to their chests. The main goal was to stress Labour's objections to aspects of the bill, primarily the lack of UK adherence to the social chapter on workplace rights. The government believes the chapter, which lays down maximum working hours and minimum working conditions, would constrain business and harm the economy. But Mr Cunningham also assured the pro-Europeans that Labour was not in the business of 'wrecking' the bill. During a 20 minute discussion, Mr Roy Hattersley, the former deputy leader, made clear that he would not oppose a guillotine, or restricted timetable, for debate on the bill if the government moved one. Mr Giles Radice, the pro-Maastricht MP for Durham North, also expressed disquiet that Labour's message might be misinterpreted as being opposed to the broad thrust of the treaty. For the dogmatic oppositionists, Mr Dennis Skinner (Bolsover) argued forcefully for the maximum of disruption. 'It's a hostage to fortune if an opposition helps the government to gag people from continuing to speak,' he said. A closure motion would help the government get on to the 'more evil' aspects of its legislative programme such as coal and rail privatisation, he argued. On tactical timing, a spokesman said that if the government 'ran away' from the closure motion it would be showing it did not have the courage to debate the policy in prime time.</p>

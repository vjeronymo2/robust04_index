			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Arjo plans flotation in London and Stockholm ARJO, the international healthcare group based in Sweden, is planning to come to the market this autumn in London and Stockholm with a share offering worth up to SKr1.75bn (Pounds 145m). Up to 70 per cent of the shares will be offered in London to international institutions, up to 20 per cent to retail investors in Sweden and the rest to US and other continental European investors. Arjo, which claims to be a world leader in hygiene and lifting systems for elderly and disabled patients, was the subject of a leveraged buy-out in December 1990 from Malmros International, a Swedish conglomorate. Arjo aims to eliminate its borrowings - now SKr1.3bn - through the flotation. Last year Arjo reported a pre-tax loss of SKr4.6m on sales of SKr809.1m. Operating profits of SKr124.7m were overshadowed by financial charges of Skr129.3m. At present Arjo's two largest shareholders are CWB Capital Partners and Warburg Pincus Investors, who will each hold about 38 per cent of the share capital before the offer. Arjo said that CWB Capital Partners would be selling a small proportion of its shares, leaving it with a holding of 10 to 15 per cent. Warburg Pincus intended to increase its holding by subscribing for new shares with funds from the redemption of Arjo debt securities. Arjo said Warburg Pincus would have between 20 and 25 per cent of the shares after the offering. Existing shareholders will sell no more than SKr250m of shares, Arjo said. Mr Hans Lindstrom, chief executive, said yesterday that Arjo made 97 per cent of its sales outside Sweden, with markets in 40 different countries. The main customers were hospitals, nursing homes and home care organisations. Last year Germany accounted for 26.8 per cent of group sales, with the US on 18.6 per cent and the UK on 15.7 per cent. Half the manufacturing is based in Sweden, 25 per cent in the UK and 15 per cent in the US. SG Warburg Securities will sponsor the listing in London, while Carnegie Fondkommission is to sponsor the Stockholm listing. SG Warburg Securities will also act as global co-ordinator for the offering, with James Capel and Carnegie Fondkommission as co-lead managers.</p>

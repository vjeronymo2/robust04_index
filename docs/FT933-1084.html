			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Commodities (Week in the markets): LME metal stocks top 4m tonnes LME WAREHOUSE stocks of all base metals topped the 4m-tonne mark for the first time ever this week, underlining the parlous state of the world metals markets as traders wait with increasing impatience for the promised world economic recovery. More than half the total was in aluminium stocks, which rose this week by 31,850 tonnes to a record 2,187,175, so it was fitting that that metal should be among the weakest on the exchange. The three months position closed last night at a five-month low of Dollars 1,119.50 a tonne, unchanged on the day but Dollars 19 down on the week. The contract had begun the week with a test of resistance around Dollars 1,140 a tonne, but when this prove unbreachable the price quickly slipped back. It rallied half-heartedly on Thursday morning as part of the general LME response to the political turmoil in Russia, but, like the other metals, it was soon back on its downward course. Aluminium did not register the biggest proportionate fall on the week, however, that was the lead market's dubious distinction. Despite rallying Dollars 7.25 yesterday the three months lead prices ended Dollars 8.25 down on the week at Dollars 380.50 a tonne. In the absence of fresh news traders attributed the earlier fall to a seven-year low to long-liquidation against a background of depressed consumer interest. Enjoying better fortunes this week were two of the exchange's biggest recent losers - tin and nickel. Three months tin edged down to a fresh 20-year low of Dollars 4,377.50 a tonne on Monday before the technically-inspired sellers who had driven the market ever lower in recent weeks decided that enough was enough and switched to being technically-inspired buyers. The ensuing rally was halted by resistance above the Dollars 4,600-mark on Thursday, but yesterday the three months price was able to move on to Dollars 4,627.50 a tonne, up Dollars 240 on the week. There was nothing technical about nickel's late strength, which left the three months contract Dollars 43.50 up on the week at Dollars 4,390 a tonne. On Thursday it was announced that Inco of Canada, the biggest producer of the metal, was to discuss production cuts and other cost-reducing measures with unions. The move came within days of the LME three months nickel price dropping below the equivalent of Dollars 2 a lb, the level many analysts had identified as the 'crunch point' at which some big producers might be forced into the retrenchment they have been so stubbornly resisting in the face of soaring stocks, swollen by a big increase in shipments from the former Soviet Union, and plummetting prices. Zinc was also a gainer early in the week, as the market built on last week's technical rally. But trade and merchant selling was attracted as three months metal moved above Dollars 900 a tonne and the price ended the week Dollars 1.50 down on balance at Dollars 892 a tonne. The copper market continued the slide started by the sudden ending last week of the supply squeeze that had been propping up nearby delivery positions until the three months price hit bottom on Tuesday at Dollars 1,733 a tonne. A period of consolidation ensued and by yesterday's close the price had recovered to Dollars 1,766.50 a tonne, down Dollars 2 on the week. A more direct consequence of the ending of the squeeze was the disappearnce of the cash delivery premium over three months metal, which had recently been as high as Dollars 80 a tonne, and its replacement by a discount that reached Dollars 20 a tonne this week before narrowing to Dollars 15 at yesterday's close. (Except when nearby availability is tight cash metal usually trades at a discount to forward positions, reflecting the costs of holding physical metal - principally storage, insurance and lost interest.) Cocoa continued to be the star turn at the London Commodity Exchange this week, the December futures position following last week's Pounds 47 rise with a further Pounds 33 advance to Pounds 936 a tonne. That was trimmed back to Pounds 918 at yesterday's close, but market sentiment remained bullish and some traders were looking for an early test resistance at Pounds 949 a tonne, the peak reached in the summer of 1990. The more cautious noted, however, that this week's rise could be explained largely by the weakness of sterling against the US dollar, in which most international trade in cocoa is conducted. The LCE's robusta coffee market continued to display the hesitation that had characterised last week's performance, following the exceptionally big gains of the preceding month. Having been boosted largely by growing confidence in the resolve of producers to make their export retention scheme work the market's bullish mood appeared to be fading with the approach of the start of the scheme next Friday. As the market, which some traders thought had become a little 'overbought', bowed to US selling pressure the November robustas price retreated by Dollars 69 to Dollars 1,225 a tonne in the first half of the week. The fall was partly due to doubts circulating in the market about Brazil's ability to finance the necessary withholding of coffee beans from the market. That ghost was laid, however, by an announcement from Brasilia that financial arrangements for the scheme were already in place and the London market gained in confidence. Renewed buying took the December price up to Dollars 1,299 a tonne yesterday, but then the rally ran out of steam and by the close it was back at Dollars 1,264 a tonne, down Dollars 30 on balance.  -------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------------------- Aluminium       +17,400    to    2,187,175 Copper           +3,650    to      567,875 Lead               +750    to      287,650 Nickel           +1,296    to      114,618 Zinc             +5,350    to      794,800 Tin                -115    to       21,305  --------------------------------------------------</p>

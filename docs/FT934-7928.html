			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Nigeria in new bid to end strike THE INTERIM government of Nigeria yesterday moved its talks with the unions from Lagos to Abuja, in a bid to end a general strike over higher fuel prices. The military-appointed government is expected to offer public-sector workers a rise in transport allowances to offset higher living costs. Last week it imposed a 600 per cent increase in fuel prices, which it says is necessary to wipe out public-sector deficits and restore the state-owned refineries to working order. The Nigeria Labour Congress' strike call has been largely ignored in the north, where fuel prices have been high for over a year. The main impact of the strike has been on public transport, domestic airlines, manufacturing industry, the port at Lagos and the big banks. Banks and shops were closed in many states yesterday and traffic remained light. There has been no disruption to oil production. 'My union will strike when the time is right,' said Mr Frank Kokori, head of Nupeng, the oil workers' union.' The fuel price is a sideshow, the real issue is Nigeria's political instability.'</p>

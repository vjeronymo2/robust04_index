			<p>BFN     [Text] There is every indication that a protocol on  refugees return to North Ossetia's Prigorodniy region will not  be signed on Saturday, the Federation Council's Vice Chairman  Ramazan Abdulatipov, who is currently in the zone of conflict,  has said in an interview with Interfax.    "We should not rush with signing this document since we need  a coordinated protocol that would be implemented in full," he  stressed.    It is for precisely for this reason, he stressed, that a  meeting between him and North Ossetian leaders would be  expedient.    "Only after all points of the protocol were agreed, a  meeting  between the presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia would  make sense. We do not need one more unfeasible document," he  remarked.    "It will take decades to stabilize the situation after that  horrible tragedy, and Ingushetia's president has chosen a  correct course toward bringing the refugees back stage by  stage," Abdulatipov said.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> A COMPUTER WITH TASTE  </P> <P> A California chemist said last week that by using new knowledge about the  chemical structures of sweet things, he has taught a computer to predict what a  molecule will taste like before it is created.  </P> <P> The work may reduce the need for special panels of human tasters to review  everything food chemists concoct.  </P> <P> Murray Goodman of UC San Diego said his computer model can forecast whether a  type of molecule known as a peptide will be sweet, bitter or tasteless.  </P> <P> Using the model, "We can take a sweet peptide and move a single carbon atom  from one slot to another and lose the taste entirely," Goodman said during a  national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston.  </P></p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Legal &amp; General rises to Pounds 75m - Strong recovery on general insurance side bolsters midterm profits A STRONG recovery in the performance of its general insurance business helped Legal &amp; General, the composite insurer, to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 72.5m to Pounds 75m for the first six months of 1993. The underlying increase was stronger since last year's profits were bolstered by Pounds 31.5m from the sale of the UK investment management businesses to the L&amp;G Society Life Fund. Earnings per share rose to 6.5p (6.2p) and the interim dividend is being lifted from 6.2p to 6.5p, an increase of 4.8 per cent. Mr David Prosser, group chief executive, said the results 'demonstrated the strong management actions taken to improve performance.' Profits from worldwide life and pensions business increased from Pounds 75.4m to Pounds 77.7m. In the UK, total life and pensions profits grew by 8 per cent to Pounds 59.7m reflecting underlying growth in the portfolio and an increase in the number of maturing policies. Total premium income for the half year rose from Pounds 692.1m to Pounds 950m, with new business up by 27 per cent to Pounds 122.7m. Annual premiums of Pounds 74.1m compared with Pounds 73m and new single premiums doubled from Pounds 235.1m to Pounds 486.1m. Overall growth in new premiums reflected the gradual emergence of the economy from recession, said Mr Prosser. L&amp;G had also benefited from tighter control of distribution channels. A small profit of Pounds 200,000 was recorded on general insurance business. The most important factor here was an improvement in the mortgage indemnity account following the establishment of significant reserves in recent years. The account broke even in the first half compared with a loss of Pounds 26.4m last year. Profits from property insurance amounted to Pounds 8.8m, mainly as a result of rate increases and a fall in weather-related claims. Total worldwide funds under management reached Pounds 28bn at the end of June, a rise of Pounds 3.3bn since the beginning of 1992. COMMENT Legal &amp; General appears to have put some of its recent troubles behind it with the effects of management changes bearing fruit. Yesterday's profit figures have followed news of a pick-up in new business growth. The 4.8 per cent interim dividend increase indicates a full year dividend of about 20p, leaving a prospective yield of more than 5 per cent, well above the sector average. Strong asset backing will also provide underpinning, while reduced exposure on the domestic indemnity front should lead to less volatility in the share's performance. However, L&amp;G has significantly outperformed the market since last autumn, indicating that investors have discounted some of the recovery already. The picture is also clouded because of concern about the future of the endowment market - in which L&amp;G is a big player - after the government's decision this year to impose new disclosure rules on commissions. All this will limit the stock's potential.</p>

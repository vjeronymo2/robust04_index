			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Property: A capital start in London's long haul - After three years in the doldrums, the UK capital's office sector is showing signs of life London's office market is back in business. For the first time since 1988, the volume of new office construction starts in central London is set to increase this year, albeit from rock-bottom levels. Even speculative development is once again viable, in certain locations. 'The opportunities, finance and willingness should be in place for a marked increase in developer activity in central London in 1994-95,' according to DTZ Debenham Thorpe, surveyors. Is London, therefore, experiencing another of its traditional development cycles? Or is a more fundamental change under way? Research group Applied Property Research suggests the latter, in a report on the London office market, published this week. 'Structural changes, which are fundamental to the central London office market's long-term health, are beginning to happen,' the report says. Changing employment patterns, new transport links, more flexible leases and the increasing obsolescence of old buildings are highlighting the polarisation between properties that suit tenants' needs and those that fail them, says APR. 'In the traditional property cycle, even poor quality products let in a good market. This will no longer be the case,' says APR. Central to this argument is the view that the letting prospects for some offices are so poor that they are likely to be demolished or decommissioned when they fall vacant. 'For the first time in the postwar period, there is now evidence that the market is exerting pressures which will lead to a decrease in the total office stock,' says APR. It argues that the area of land devoted to offices in London will decline because new development will only take place in central locations. In these areas, the expansion in property stock as a result of redevelopment is more limited than in fringe locations, where development is often on virgin office land. Moreover, existing office buildings are being sold for conversion to residential use, in both prime and fringe locations. The statistics on office vacancies underline the wide gap in the prospects for buildings and locations. The overall availability of offices in London fell from 17 per cent to 14 per cent in 1993, according to DTZ Debenham Thorpe. But in the core areas of central London there was a 45 per cent fall in the volume of new space available and a 12 per cent decline in the volume of second-hand units. In the fringes, the volume of new space declined by a fifth while the volume of second-hand space increased by 3 per cent. In the West End, there is a relatively limited supply of large new buildings, with only five new buildings of more than 50,000 square feet on the market. Last year demand for buildings totalled 3.8m sq ft, the highest annual total since 1989. There has been an upturn in speculative development, with the Prudential and Great Portland Estates both starting projects. In mid-town, an area including Holborn, Covent Garden and Bloomsbury, prospects are mixed. Covent Garden market is proving relatively robust but Holborn is suffering, partly because big tenants such as British Telecom, British Gas and the Ministry of Defence are likely to vacate large areas of space over the next five years. According to DTZ, although the availability of buildings in mid-town dropped by 30 per cent, to just 9 per cent of the total stock, this was due less to the (small) rise in take-up than to the withdrawal from the market of 700,000 sq ft of old office space. In the City, underlying rents are increasing markedly, says APR. In the first half of 1993, lettings were occuring at 'net effective rents' - which allow for rent-free periods and other inducements - of no more than Pounds 10 per sq ft in new buildings. Net effective rents for the best new space in the City are now back in the 'low Pounds 20s' and likely to exceed Pounds 30 per sq ft within a year. In Docklands, vacancy rates stand at 44 per cent, although total take-up of 781,000 sq ft in 1993 was the highest since 1987. APR argues that Docklands is set to become a serious option for central London tenants. Three factors stand in Docklands favour. First, the availability of high-quality space. Second, competitive prices, of about Pounds 12-Pounds 15 a sq ft, with the first five years of a 15-year lease rent free (though not in Canary Wharf). Third, Docklands will begin to acquire a critical mass in the next couple of years, particularly when Credit Suisse First Boston, Mirror Group and London Underground complete their relocation to the area. The prospects for the City fringes, which are littered with vacant and derelict office sites, are poor, according to APR. It believes the City fringes faces a bleak outlook because of the abundance of empty buildings and general urban dereliction. Many office occupiers, which in the past had no choice but to locate in the City fringe, can now get decent second-hand space in more central locations on the flexible terms they require. Because the prospects for offices are so poor, the process of converting offices into residential use is most active in the City fringes. By December 1993, 53 planning permissions and applications had been submitted to the authorities for residential development on office land or conversion of office buildings. 'The City fringe is in the firing line of structural change,' says APR.</p>

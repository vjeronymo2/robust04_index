			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 CALLS TO 911 END WITH VERY SPECIAL DELIVERIES  </P> <P> Twice within a 24-hour period, emergency telephone operators in Orange County  helped talk expectant mothers through their deliveries before paramedics  arrived, authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> Two impatient infants gave little notice of their arrivals, entering the world  only minutes after their worried fathers called 911 for assistance, Orange  County Fire Battalion Chief Kevin S. Brame said.  </P> <P> For the pair of dispatchers involved in the deliveries, the births were special  occasions that won't soon be forgotten.  </P> <P> Dispatcher John Gray handled the first call on Wednesday morning from Richard  Stamps of Orange, who called to say his girlfriend Jacqueline Holly was about  deliver their child.  </P> <P> "He told me that she was on the toilet about to give birth, and I immediately  told him to get her off the toilet and lay her down on the ground with her legs  spread and knees bent," Gray said.  </P> <P> Gray said he has instruction cards that help him tell callers what to do, but  as he started reading the initial steps, the baby had already advanced to the  final card.  </P> <P> "It's rare that we get beyond the first couple of steps before the paramedics  arrive," he said.  </P> <P> Stamps' mother took the information from Gray and relayed it to her son.  </P> <P> "She told me that the baby was out, and I couldn't believe it. I said, 'All the  way out?' and she said, 'Yes,' " Gray said. "There was a pause for a moment  after that."  </P> <P> Gray continued with post-birthing instructions until the paramedics arrived to  care for the healthy baby girl, named Jasmine Holly, who weighed 7 pounds, 4  ounces.  </P> <P> "It's really rewarding to bring in a life like this," Gray said.  </P> <P> At 5:34 a.m. Thursday, dispatcher Heather O'Darrow received the second delivery  call.  </P> <P> Only an hour before, O'Darrow had a traumatic Sudden Infant Death Syndrome  call.  </P> <P> "The SIDS call was really upsetting, but delivering the baby was very exciting  and upbeat. It was a very happy moment."  </P> <P> O'Darrow said she also had a quick delivery.  </P> <P> "By the time I was on Step A the baby was already on Step F," she said.  </P> <P> Within three minutes of the call a healthy baby boy was born. His proud  parents, Charles and Terry Gero of Mission Viejo, thanked O'Darrow for her  assistance as the baby cried in the background.  </P> <P> "It was really great," O'Darrow said. "That's the type of thing that makes this  job so worthwhile."  </P></p>

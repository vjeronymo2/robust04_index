Three tubular specimens  were extruded from an 85 wt. % primary SiC (SiC') mass and  fired in a siliconizing packing at temperatures between  1900-2200C for 5.5 to 6 h in a resistance furnace. During  firing, the specimens were arranged in a symmetrical fashion  relative to the tubular graphite heating element. Sintering of  the green extrusions and structural formation was more readily  effected by the addition of process carbon to the raw material  and by the formation of carbon residue released during  thermopyrolysis of the binder. These carbons, together with the  carbide-forming elements present in the packing, helped to form  secondary SiC (SiC''). In order to alloy the SiC with aluminum,  an aluminous substance was also added to the packing. After they  had cooled, the specimens were fired a second time. It was found  that this method of forming SiC components creates a layered  structure in which SiC'' grains are alloyed with aluminum, and  that this structure promotes consistent electrical resistivity  throughout the component cross-section. The degree of alloying  can be monitored by X-ray microspectrometry. Electrical  resistivity can be estimated within the framework of a  generalized model of conductivity in a multi-component medium,  in which SiC forms a continuous matrix, and SiC' grains make up  a discrete phase.

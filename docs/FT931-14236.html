			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Trial arbitration scheme for Canadian securities CANADIAN securities dealers and the Vancouver Stock Exchange are launching an experimental arbitration service to provide a quick and relatively inexpensive way of resolving disputes between stockbrokers and clients. The service initially will be confined to claims of less than CDollars 25,000 (USDollars 19,500). Members of the Investment Dealers' Association, including most of the firms trading on the VSE, will be required to submit to binding arbitration if this is requested by a disgruntled client. Neutral arbitrators will be provided by the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre. The new scheme is an effort to defuse criticism that the self-regulatory efforts of securities dealers and stock exchanges have failed to provide adequate protection to investors or sufficiently harsh penalties on wrongdoers. Under the rules, the arbitrator will be required to submit his findings within 60 days of a hearing. The arbitrator will also apportion costs, which are typically expected to total about CDollars 1,200, excluding legal fees should the parties decide to be represented by lawyers. The IDA said it would set up a national arbitration system if the British Columbia project proves successful.</p>

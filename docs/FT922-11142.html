			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Third world 'may set up trade blocs' DEVELOPING countries cannot be expected to spend as much on environmental protection as rich countries. They may also have to set up their own regional trade blocs if the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation talks are not concluded soon. These warnings were delivered by Mr Alejandro Foxley, the Chilean finance minister and chairman of the joint IMF/World Bank development committee, whose meeting today is expected to focus mainly on trade and environmental issues, ahead of the Earth Summit to be held in Rio de Janeiro this June. He said poor countries were worried that industrialised nations would 'sneak in' new protectionist barriers under the guise of tougher environmental standards. Poor countries should be allowed to phase in environmental controls over a long period. On trade, Mr Foxley said developing countries were deeply disappointed that their unilateral efforts to liberalise trade had elicited little response from industrialised countries. Rich countries still spent Dollars 250bn (Pounds 141.2bn) on agricultural protection, five times the amount of development aid.</p>

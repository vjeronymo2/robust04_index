			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Ghaffar Mustafa: "Roads in Mecca Cost 8 </F> Billion Riyals"]    [Text] So far the total cost of the construction of roads  in Mecca has been more than 8 billion Saudi riyals [SR], and  about SR50 million is spent on them every year for maintenance.  All parts of Mecca have been linked to each other, and all parts  of Saudi Arabia have been linked to Mecca, in order to make it  easy to reach and depart from the Holy Mosque and to enable  pilgrims to reach any area of Mecca and the holy places in a  short time. In addition, the capacity of the roads has been  increased. Furthermore, the network of tunnels that currently  exists is about 28 km long, and it includes 53 tunnels of  differents widths and lengths.    In addition to the work done on completing the blueprint for  organizing the road network and the completion of the second  phase of the circular road for the southeastern area of the holy  places, a circular road has been constructed that is 7 km long  and 30 meters wide and a connecting road to the highway between  Mecca and al-Kura has also been built. Implementation is also  taking place of the second phase of connecting Roads 1, 6, 7,  and 8 between the new circular road and the old circular road,  in addition to implementation of the construction of eight  parking areas for rest stops for pilgrim buses and locations for  establishments that deal with pilgrims.    Another thing taking place now is the leveling and  preparation of an area for two parking areas north of the King  Faysal Bridge and construction of the second circular road which  is 8.5 km long. This road goes through 14 double tunnels and has  seven high points for regulating traffic between the circular  road and the main streets leading to and from the Holy Mosque  and the holy places. In al-Muzdalifah there are four model  parking areas, of which three are along the King 'Abd-al-'Aziz  Road and one along Highway 5.    The Secretariat of the City of Mecca says that its services  extend to providing lighting for the streets and roads in Muna,  al-Muzdalifah, and 'Arafat, and that the lighting network gets  its electricity from a network of underground cables.    The secretariat also says that this network is continuing to  be expanded in order that its capacity be increased in  accordance with the field studies and programs dealing with the  needs of each area. In addition to the services of a road  network and a network of lighting for the streets and roads, the  secretariat also provides pilgrims with means of making it  easier for them to participate in the pilgrimage rites and other  services, including the construction of a number of  slaughterhouses for the slaughter of sacrificial animals. This  slaughtering is forbidden in the tents and along the streets and  roads because of the concern about maintaining public health and  cleanliness and in order to make sure that the slaughtering is  done in a way that corresponds to Islamic law and meets health  standards. There are five such slaughterhouses, all of which  have places for slaughtering both by machine and by hand,  refrigerators to keep the meat fresh, and living accommodations  for the persons who work there. The total capacity of the  slaughterhouses is between 800,000 and 1 million head of sheep  and cattle.</p>

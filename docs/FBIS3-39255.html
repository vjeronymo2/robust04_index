There is, however, "still a great deal of detailed work and  formulating to be done." Lambsdorf does not share the concern  of several U.S. politicians who think that state subsidies to  industry might be increased following the coming into force of  the Geneva agreements. Yet, there "is a tendency toward  promoting industry in all countries." Promotion of industry is  in better hands with companies than with the state, which he  considers "on the way to a republic governed by commisars," due  to the great number of technological boards.    Lambsdorff said that the annual World Economic Summits  "should be abolished rather than continued in the existing  form." Returning to smaller agendas and, thus, more intensive  discussions would make sense.    In the FDP politician's view, the way the United States  treats Japan is "extremely wrong." Prime Minister Hosokawa's  reform efforts could have an enormous influence on the economic  situation, which would profit the United States. The pressures  that U.S. trade policy frequently exerts are "the wrong  approach." Trade relations can never be seen from a bilateral  point of view, but they should always "be seen through  multilateral eyes."    Lambsdorff strongly criticized the United States and  Europe's  policy on the Balkans. He said Serb politicians are simply  amused when once again there is talk of a NATO air strike,  because "two days later the whole thing has been forgotten." At  the moment, "Europe and the United States are making fools of  themselves."    Lambsdorff welcomed President Clinton's performance during  his latest trip to Europe. "Europe must be interested in the  U.S. President remaining capable to act and negotiate," the  former FDP chairman said. On 10 February, Lambsdorff will give  a talk on "Continuity or Change" in Washington, and on 14  November in New York, he will speak about "Germany's Economic  Challenges."</p>

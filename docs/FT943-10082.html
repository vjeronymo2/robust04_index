			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / UK companies' profits hit by using Japanese work methods British companies which are big users of Japanese-style manufacturing methods - such as 'just-in-time' stock control and total quality management  -have smaller profit margins than low users or those which do not use them at all. This is the surprising conclusion of a study released today by Cambridge University, which has examined the use of Japanese methods by 68 UK manufacturers, and their profitability, between 1986 and 1992. The study found that significant improvements in manufacturing efficiency could be made through the use of Japanese methods by UK companies, but 'translating these manufacturing improvements into enhanced financial performance in a fluctuating economic environment is much more problematic'. Dr Nick Oliver, a lecturer in management studies at Cambridge, said the study had 'quite profound implications' for the use of such methods in the UK. It found that sales per employee were greater for the high users of the methods from 1987 onwards, and by the end of 1992 were about 30 per cent higher than those of the low users. But these 'lean' companies using Japanese methods had lower profit margins than their competitors. This may have been due to a collapse in their profitability during the recession of the early 1990s, during which they fared worse than their buffered counterparts. One of the high-user companies in the study revealed that its de-stocking programme had led to problems in ability to meet customer demands, and in fluctuating market conditions it had lost orders to competitors. The low users of Japanese methods averaged 64 days of stock compared with 48 days for the high users, Dr Oliver suggested one other explanation could be that the Japanese production methods required willing co-operation from the workforce rather than mere compliance. In return, workers may have received guarantees that their jobs were safe, resulting in companies operating with too many staff.

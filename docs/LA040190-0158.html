			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECHS ARE MATED POORLY;  </P> <P> DAVIS CUP: CAPTAIN CHANGES PLANS, PAIRING KORDA AND SREJBER, WHO LOSE TO LEACH  AND PUGH. U.S. TAKES 2-1 LEAD.  </P> <P> The Petr Korda fever that swept through Prague Friday night struck  Czechoslovakian Davis Cup Captain Frantisek Pala, who was suffering the next  morning from illusions of grandeur.  </P> <P> Because Korda, the world's 26th-ranked player, played so brilliantly in a  three-set victory over No. 5 Brad Gilbert of the United States, Pala believed  he could put a doubles team on the court to challenge perhaps the world's  finest pair, Rick Leach of Laguna Beach and Jim Pugh of Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> Pala's team was Korda and Milan Srejber, who prolonged their agony Saturday at  the Prague Sports Hall in a second-round Davis Cup match for only 1 hour 43  minutes before losing. The score was as tedious as the match, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.  </P> <P> "I had expected that the first- and second-best players in doubles in the world  could play well," Pala said. "I expected that."  </P> <P> So why did he waste Korda and Srejber, who must play singles today? Korda will  meet Aaron Krickstein in the first match, and Srejber will meet Gilbert in the  second. The United States leads, 2-1, and needs only one victory to advance to  the semifinals in September against Austria, which eliminated Italy Saturday.  </P> <P> Veteran Tomas Smid, who had expected to play Saturday with Karel Novacek and  looked disappointed when he did not, told the Czech press Thursday that Pala  had said he would sacrifice the doubles to rest his singles players for the  final two matches.  </P> <P> "With the match tied, 1-1, you have to try everything to get the second point,"  Pala said of his change of heart.  </P> <P> Korda and Srejber have had Davis Cup success as a team, beating West Germany's  Boris Becker and Eric Jelen in five sets last year and Switzerland's Heinz  Gunthardt and Jakob Hlasek in four sets earlier this year.  </P> <P> But neither victory came after Srejber had played five sets less than 24 hours  before, as he did in a loss to Krickstein Friday night. That match included  three tie-breakers and lasted three hours fifty-seven minutes. Considering that  Srejber complained afterward of neck and leg pains, he did not seem a logical  choice for doubles.  </P> <P> That, no doubt, was obvious to Pala in the first game, when Srejber, a 6-foot-8  power player who overwhelmed Krickstein with his serve in the first set Friday  night, was broken by Leach and Pugh.  </P> <P> Thus was established a pattern that continued throughout the match. The first  time Srejber served in each set, the Czechs lost.  </P> <P> "Of course, I was tired," Srejber said. "On the other hand, my opponents  returned serves very well. I have never, ever played against such good  returners."  </P> <P> Once they broke Srejber early in each set, Leach and Pugh could coast. The only  time the U.S. pair faltered was when Leach lost his serve in the second set.  </P> <P> It was quick work for Leach and Pugh, playing only their second Davis Cup match  since replacing the long-time U.S. pair of Ken Flach and Robert Seguso earlier  this year against Mexico at La Costa.  </P> <P> This was their first real test because they were playing away from home, where  Davis Cup crowds are notoriously hostile to visitors. But Leach and Pugh were  so dominant that the Czech crowd of about 14,000 never got into the match.  </P> <P> The fans could be heard only when derisively whistling at Srejber.  </P> <P> Now that newly democratic Czechoslovakia has free speech, Pala said he expects  Smid to say, "I told you so."  </P> <P> "Tomas Smid is not one to be afraid to say what he wants to say," Pala said.  </P> <P> No doubt looking forward to appearing solo again, Korda was almost smug when  asked what kind of match he expects against Krickstein, ranked seventh in the  world.  </P> <P> "That's up to Aaron Krickstein, not me," he said.  </P> <P> Srejber, ranked 59th, understandably was less secure when asked whether he  expects to be ready for Gilbert.  </P> <P> "We shall see," he said.  </P> <P> UPSET: Ivan Lendl, the world's top-ranked player, is defeated by No. 35 Jim  Grabb in a $500,000 tournament at Chicago.

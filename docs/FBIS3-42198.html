The campaign,  which lasted until 0900, targeted the areas of Ka'abish,  al-Thalath Tawabiq, 'Izbat 'Fakihah, Kafr al-Mansi, al-Jabal,  Bulaq, and the pyramids. The security forces captured 148  suspects, including seven extremist terrorist elements, and  seized a quantity of automatic and semi-automatic weapons. All  the defendants were referred to the prosecution for  interrogation.    Major General Fahim Husayn, assistant interior minister for  al-Jizah security, ordered the al-Jizah security forces to raid  the terrorists' lairs in coordination with the state Security  Intelligence Service. Secret information received confirmed the  terrorists' intention to carry out operations targeting the  police, especially during the Police Day celebrations. The  security forces launched their raids at 0500 yesterday in the  areas of Ka'abish and al-Thalath Taqwabiq. They arrested 88  suspects, including the seven extremist terrorists.    A responsible security source said that one of these seven  terrorists was involved in the recent incidents in Imbabah,  Bulaq, al-Dakrur, and al-Ma'sarah. The source added that the  interrogation of the group confirmed their membership in a new  organization that planned to attack policemen, especially on  Police Day.    The AL-AHRAM AL-MASA'I correspondent learned that the raids  were carried out by more than 80 officers and about 300 soldiers  equipped with modern weapons and armored vehicles and supported  by a number of fire engines in anticipation of any clashes with  the extremist elements.    The raids were carried out without any resistance from the  targeted elements and not a single bullet was fired.    At the same time, another group raided the areas of Kafr  Tuhurmis and the villages of 'Abd-al-'Al and al-Mashabik. Some  46 suspects were arrested and the prosecution began their  interrogation.    A security source said that the interrogation of the  terrorist group is being held in total secrecy and the release  of their names will be delayed.</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Walker regrets trusting directors Mr George Walker, the former head of the Brent Walker leisure group, yesterday said at his trial that he had trusted the main directors of Goldcrest, the company's film division, to run it properly. The prosecution alleges that Mr Walker organised the profit-boosting fraud carried out through Goldcrest. Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director, both deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify accounts. Mr Walker said at the Old Bailey that he placed great faith in Mr John Quested, a former Goldcrest managing director, and Mr Donald Anderson, the subsidiary's former finance director. He trusted them so much that he signed documents authorising money transfers without reading them. With hindsight, he regretted this. The trial continues today.</p>

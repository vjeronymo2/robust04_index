			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Arts: Hungarians at odds with soloist Before the war the Hungarian State Symphony Orchestra could proudly claim that it worked with some of the leading conductors of the day, including Ansermet, Klemperer, Walter and Busch. All that changed with the cold war, when even the best of the eastern European orchestras found themselves on the sidelines. To judge from its Barbican concert on Wednesday, the Hungarian State Symphony Orchestra is not really one of their number these days. Top orchestras from Prague and Dresden, St. Petersburg and Leipzig have shown what they can do in London; the Hungarians, for all their virtues, cannot match that level of style and sound quality. The orchestra's principal conductor is Ken-Ichiro Kobayashi, who took up his post in 1987. He may run up to the podium with a spring in his step, but unfortunately his physical energy does not always communicate itself to the performances. Wagner's Overture to Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg was played with studied grandeur, as though he wanted us to be sure that this was serious music-making. In Brahms's Violin Concerto there were two performances going on: Kobayashi and the orchestra anxious never to sound anything other than measured and sober, the soloist Lydia Mordkovitch always wanting to ignite sparks of passion from the violin bow, if she could. In all the more agitated passages Mordkovitch was inclined to overheat the emotion without respite, but she had life and made every note count. I was glad she was there. Moving on to Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra, Kobayashi and his Hungarian players were released from any duty to try to sound teutonic. The conductor allowed more urgency and speed. The playing found more attack. In its combination of a fairly big string sound, bright but not strident brass, able if self-effacing wind, the orchestra has some strengths on its side. The red-blooded flair that closed the finale showed that Kobayashi has tasted paprika in the last seven years, after all.

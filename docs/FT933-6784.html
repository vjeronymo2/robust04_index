			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Ferfin issues figures on alleged irregularities FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin) yesterday fired a warning shot in the run-up to what is expected to be a decisive week for the troubled Italian group, Montedison's new management yesterday issued the first official figures on an alleged L435bn irregularity in its 1992 accounts. The figures shows that on May 24, Financing and Investments, a non-consolidated Curacao-based subsidiary, lent Dollars 133.9m and FFr839m (equalling L435bn) to a Virgin Islands company called Exilar. On Monday, shareholders at Montedison, Ferfin's main subsidiary, will vote on whether to extend legal action against former management. Earlier this month, the group's new executives, imposed by its main creditor banks, obtained a L500bn temporary sequestration order on assets of six former managers and the heirs of Mr Raul Gardini, its former chief. On Tuesday, shareholders in Ferfin will decide on the plans to slash the nominal value of shares to L5 from L1,000. It is then proposed the shares be consolidated on the basis of 200 for one to restore the nominal value.</p>

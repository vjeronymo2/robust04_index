			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 4 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--An official  of the Security Bureau of China National Nuclear Corporation  recently said that in the past 40 years since the founding of  China's nuclear industry, no environmental pollution incident  had ever occurred; although China's nuclear industry developed  later than in other countries, its operation had always been in  a good condition.    According to the results of the "Assessment of Radiation  Environmental Quality Over the Past 30 Years in China's Nuclear  Industry," the average radiation level of the environment within  80 kilometers around the nuclear facilities was just 0.01  percent higher than the level of natural radiation [tian ran ben  di zhao she 1131 3544 2609 1646 3564 1410], and the effect on  the environment was extremely slight.    In the last 10 years, China's nuclear industry has made  substantial progress in the management of radiation waste and  the handling of the old nuclear facilities that were no longer  in operation. At the same time, marked results were achieve in  the establishment of perfect standards and regulations for  environmental protection and in the aspect of international  cooperation.    The official said: Alongside the achievements, some problems  also exist. For example, environmental monitoring was somewhat  weakened, the quality of monitoring has declined somewhat,  personnel and equipment are aging, the quality of the  environment has to be further improved, and the professional  quality of environmental protection personnel has to be further  enhanced.    Reportedly, environmental protection work in China's nuclear  industry is now focused on the handling of waste, and the  management of nuclear waste is being strengthened. Laws and  regulations will be enforced strictly, monitoring will be  strengthened, modern means will be used to improve the process  of environmental assessments so that the quality of the work in  this regard will be enhanced, procedures will be simplified, the  environmental protection industry will develop on a considerable  scale, and personnel training will also be strengthened.</p>

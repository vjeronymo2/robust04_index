			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: How UK currency sickened in a poisonous atmosphere - Peter Norman, Economics Editor, recounts the escalating war of words over sterling between the German Bundesbank and the British Treasury SUNDAY September 6 began miserably in Bath. It was pouring with rain outside the city's elegant Royal Crescent Hotel. Inside, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, appeared distracted and anxious to get away. Nearby, Mr Norman Lamont, the host of a weekend meeting of European Community finance ministers and central bankers, had his nose buried in the day's newspapers and appeared not to notice his distinguished guest. If one episode was the catalyst for the extraordinary row that has since blown up between the UK and Germany over monetary and economic policy, it was that weekend meeting in Bath. On the previous day, in the elegant surroundings of the city's 18th-century Assembly Rooms, the UK chancellor abandoned the wide-ranging agenda that he had set for the talks and pressed Mr Schlesinger to cut his interest rates. Mr Lamont, rightly, saw this as the key to boosting economic growth in Europe and especially in Britain, where the government was faced with the prospect of a recession turning into a slump. The chancellor was a man under pressure, with a weakening pound in the European exchange rate mechanism and the absence of any sign of an end to the UK's prolonged recession. Eight days later, after the surprise Italian lira devaluation of September 13, the Bundesbank obliged, with a minimal  1/4 -point cut in its internationally important Lombard rate to 9 1/2 per cent and a  1/2 -point cut in Germany's discount rate to 8 1/4 per cent. But in Bath Mr Schlesinger, as just one member of the bank's 18-man ruling council, was in no position to deliver the chancellor's wishes. Mr Lamont's insistence was so fierce that the 68-year-old Bundesbank chief was on the point of walking out of the meeting. He was held back when Mr Theo Waigel, the Bonn finance minister, urged Mr Lamont to call off his attacks. Mr Lamont nevertheless came away from the discussions proclaiming victory. The meeting had agreed a four-point statement that confirmed the then existing exchange rate structure of the ERM and included a Bundesbank promise not to increase interest rates 'in present circumstances'. But the hollowness of Mr Lamont's achievement soon became apparent after the Bundesbank president on the following day distanced himself from the agreement not to realign the ERM exchange rates. But Bath alone cannot explain the bitter divisions that have emerged between Mr Lamont and Mr Schlesinger and pitched the UK Treasury against the independent Bundesbank. It is now clear that the divergence of the two economies under the impact of German unification imposed intolerable strains on the relationship between two countries that were once natural allies in European economic and monetary affairs. By the late summer, the UK government was convinced that the ERM was forcing it to maintain a stricter monetary discipline than was warranted by the depressed state of the domestic economy. It had earlier weighed the possibility of a devaluation but rejected it in a widely publicised speech by the chancellor in July. Not only would a devaluation be politically risky it would also shatter the government's efforts to make sterling a strong currency. At the same time, the Bundesbank, alarmed by Germany's fiscal deficits and the cost of reconstructing east Germany, saw no scope for a relaxation of its interest rates. This lack of economic convergence was exacerbated by somewhat differing perceptions in Frankfurt and London of the way in which the ERM should operate. The scene was therefore set for the Treasury and the Bundesbank to differ sharply in their assessment of events that led up to 'Black Wednesday', September 16, when sterling was forced to leave the ERM. These differences show through in the statements issued two days ago by the Bundesbank and the British Treasury. The two statements show no meeting of minds over the immediate causes of sterling's departure from the ERM in the days following the lira's devaluation in the European Monetary System. The British government firmly believes that the final straw for sterling was the contentious interview given by Mr Schlesinger to Handelsblatt, the German business daily, early in the week of Black Wednesday. In line with frequent German practice, a condensed advance copy of the interview was made available to the German press by Handelsblatt on the evening of Tuesday, September 15. This contained the remark, attributed to Mr Schlesinger, that 'the situation in the EMS could have been further eased if there had been a more comprehensive realignment' at the time of the lira devaluation. This, according to the UK, caused sterling to crash through its DM2.778 ERM floor in late trading on Tuesday after which it proved impossible to support the parity on Black Wednesday despite two emergency increases in British interest rates to 15 per cent from 10 per cent. The Bundesbank eventually disowned the remarks but too late to influence financial markets. This week's statement from the Bundesbank failed to recognise the UK concerns about the supposed statement from Mr Schlesinger. Instead, it underlined how Mr Schlesinger, in the final version of the interview as published on September 17, made remarks supportive of the pound. The German statement failed to acknowledge that by that time sterling had been forced out of the ERM. The episode indicates that the German authorities are at best naive in assuming that markets will wait to react only to authoritative versions of interviews. By the time the first condensed version of Mr Schlesinger's supposed remarks emerged there were already widespread suspicions that the Bundesbank had wanted a broader ERM realignment than the lire devaluation of September 13. In part, these suspicions reflected Mr Schlesinger's cool reaction to the Bath communique promising no ERM realignment on September 5. They also mirrored a general awareness that the Bundesbank had been increasingly unhappy at the way the EMS - under the pressure of the drive in the EC to economic and monetary union - had become a system of quasi-fixed exchange rates since its last major realignment in January 1987. These background factors gained added weight from suggestions circulating in financial markets that Germany had actively sought a sterling devaluation in the weekend talks in which the lira's devaluation was decided. On this point, the Bundesbank and UK Treasury positions also appear opposed. This week's Bundesbank statement indicates that the German central bank at least thought a formal sterling devaluation was justified after it had applied to the federal government in Bonn on September 11 for negotiations among the EMS countries on a realignment. The UK Treasury said on Wednesday night that 'no request was made by the German authorities to the UK that weekend that it, too, should realign'. According to monetary officials involved in the weekend talks (who incidentally are neither German nor British), the Bundesbank did want sterling to be devalued. But it did not go so far as formally to request such a move. According to one official, both the Spanish and UK authorities were 'sounded out' to see whether they would follow the Italian move, but nothing came of these approaches. This is a plausible explanation for a crucial mystery surrounding the events leading to Black Wednesday. However, no confirmation of the 'soundings' has been forthcoming from Frankfurt. Yesterday, the UK Treasury insisted that 'neither the German government nor the Bundesbank had proposed that sterling be devalued along with the lira'. There is a clear imbalance between this week's statements from the Bundesbank and Treasury. The bulk of the bank's statement concerns the nature and amount of support given to sterling by the German central bank. It underlines that D-Mark sales in support of sterling were the largest compulsory interventions ever undertaken for any partner currency in the EMS. It is understood that the support of sterling exceeded in volume terms the support provided for the French franc last week. On the other hand, the UK Treasury statement pays scant attention to what clearly was a very major effort to support sterling by the Bundesbank. The obsession of Mr Lamont and the Treasury with the events immediately before Black Wednesday conveniently obscures the more fundamental weaknesses of sterling that forced it to leave the ERM. The UK's weaknesses were not lost on Mr Schlesinger, who is above all an economist. As foreign exchange market tensions began to build ahead of the September 20 French referendum on the Maastricht treaty, he was heard increasingly to express concern inside the Bundesbank at the UK's growing trade deficit at a time of prolonged recession. He would recall that the ERM was established in 1979 as a system of fixed but adjustable parities. Later, after the crisis of sterling's departure from the system, he used a press conference in Washington at the time of the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to express his wish that the ERM could return to the principles of its founding fathers with an acceptance that parity changes, if necessary, should be carried through in a timely manner and without crisis. The Bundesbank's guiding light is the so-called Basle-Nyborg agreement of September 1987, in which EC ministers and central banks agreed some changes to the rules of the ERM which were designed to ensure that the costs of defending an unrealistic parity should fall on the weak currency countries in the system. The Basle-Nyborg agreement established that intervention to protect a currency should ideally be carried out above its ERM floor and that resort should be made to interest rate increases to support a soft currency in the system once its weakness became dangerously apparent. The Bundesbank also interpreted Basle-Nyborg as a reaffirmation of its right, negotiated in 1978, to be able to call on the Bonn government to negotiate a realignment of parities when tensions in the system were becoming too strong. On these criteria, the management of the ERM was found by the Bundesbank to be wanting in the increasingly volatile trading conditions of August and September. The British authorities, for example, were both unwilling and politically unable to raise interest rates in August, despite sterling's weakness against other ERM currencies. The French government persistently refused to allow a relignment of currencies, arguing, until the system began to break apart, that no such measure should be permitted before the Maastricht referendum. In the final days before sterling's departure from the system, the UK authorities failed to hold the pound above the lower intervention point against the D-Mark and let it fall its floor. For these reasons the German authorities appeared less than mortified when sterling finally succumbed to speculative pressures and quit the ERM. Their attitude was not lost on a British government that had anchored its entire economic policy and political prestige on a sterling parity of DM2.95. However, it is unlikely that relations between Germany and the UK would have deteriorated so far without the poisoning of personal relations between Mr Lamont and Mr Schlesinger. The UK's brief experiment with a fixed exchange rate regime has foundered in mutual recriminations between Mr Lamont, who is fighting to preserve his job, and Mr Schlesinger,who is striving to safeguard his reputation as the guardian of German monetary stability.</p>

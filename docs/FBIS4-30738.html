			<p>BFN     [Text] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is ready for  coalition talks with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] but  these talks will be much more difficult because the Socialists  have gained an absolute majority in the Hungarian parliament.  This was stated by party Chairman Ivan Petoe, who added that  the coalition consultations could begin as early as next week.  However, Peter Hack, another SZDSZ leader, described as  doubtful the possibility of a coalition agreement after a  Socialist Party victory of such magnitude. According to Hack,  the electorate has unambiguously placed its trust in the hands  of one party and the SZDSZ would not be able to play an emphatic  coalition partner role if it were to participate in the  government.</p>

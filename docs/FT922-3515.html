			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Letter: EC leaders failed to explain subsidiarity Sir, 'Unnecessary in its goals, obscure in its language, incompetent in its detail, the Maastricht Treaty has few redeeming features,' wrote Martin Wolf ('A break in the march of history', June 6). His article fails to support such an assertion. Moreover, in declaring that 'nothing in historical experience suggests such a structure is feasible, let alone desirable,' Mr Wolf reveals an unwillingness to learn from, or even understand, history. Martin Wolf is, however, right in stating that the treaty is basically about power - but not the abuse of power nor the balance of power. Recognising the long-term limits of intergovernmental co-operation, the Maastricht Treaty continues the policy of European integration and interdependence. Moreover, it introduces the principle of subsidiarity, ie that the Community shall act 'only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community.' Unfortunately, Community leaders have failed to explain to the people - let alone convince them - that the principle of subsidiarity guarantees that there will in future be no unnecessary interference from Brussels.

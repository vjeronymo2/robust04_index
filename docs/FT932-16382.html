			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Lufthansa in partnership talks with American Airlines LUFTHANSA of Germany is in advanced partnership talks with American Airlines, one of the 'big three' US carriers. The negotiations reflect the German carrier's continuing efforts for a strategic link with a large US carrier to boost its position on the transatlantic airline market. Lufthansa, which derives about 30 per cent of its annual revenue from its North Atlantic routes, has faced particularly fierce competition across the Atlantic following the acquisition of Pan American's European services, which include a Frankfurt hub, by Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines. Lufthansa said it was in talks with a number of US carriers, including American Airlines although in the light of its financial difficulties it was unlikely to take a share stake in any airline. American acknowledged that 'at any time, we're talking to any number of foreign carriers' about partnership arrangements, and said that such discussions had been stepped up in the wake of the approval for the British Airways-USAir code-sharing deal. However, the US carrier stressed that talks were centred on joint marketing and code-sharing arrangements, and were not likely to involve an equity investment. Lufthansa has stepped up its search for a US partner following British Airways' Dollars 300m (Pounds 198m) investment in USAir and Air France's co-operation agreement with Air Canada which, in turn, links the French carrier to Continental Airlines of the US. Lufthansa is also reacting to merger talks between Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines. Already, KLM has a stake in Northwest, of the US, while Delta and Swissair have cross-equity links. Lufthansa held talks with both American Airlines and USAir about two years ago.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Royal Oak to reopen Hope Brook gold mine ROYAL Oak Mines, a small but growing Vancouver-based gold producer, is reopening BP Canada's Hope Brook gold mine in south-western Newfoundland. The mine was shut last year because of environmental and operating problems. Production is to resume following the arrangement of a new CDollars 20m (USDollars 16.6m) five-year aid package from the federal government. Royal Oak last month bought the Hope Brook assets from BP Canada in a deal worth CDollars 9m. The new owner also assumes the remaining CDollars 14m of an earlier federal government loan. Hope Brook has set a production target of 50,000 ounces in the last six months of 1992 at an average cash cost of USDollars 300 an ounce. Royal Oak is revising the underground mining operation and the milling process to keep costs down. Alcan Aluminium has won the right to resume a CDollars 1bn expansion of its Kemano hydro-electric plant in north-western British Columbia. The Federal Court of Appeal in Ottawa reversed a lower court ruling that the project should undergo a full federal environmental review. The original case was launched by native and environmental groups. The federal cabinet early in 1990 exempted Kemano II from the full assessment and Alcan spent nearly Dollars 500m on river diversion before halting construction. Alcan needs the extra power to expand its Kitimat smelter.</p>

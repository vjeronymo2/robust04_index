			<p>BFN     [Text] Coal miners in Karaganda (Kazakhstan) are into the  second day of a strike called by the independent unions of  mineworkers. As many as nine pits are affected and depending on  the shift, 500 to 700 miners stay away from work. In an  interview with INTERFAX on Thursday [19 May], local prosecutors  qualified the action as legitimate.    Union spokeswoman Olga Krivodanova said the management of  the  Karagandaugol company had offered the unions to set up a  conciliatory commission to try to settle differences. The union  leaders are ready to enter negotiations but do not want to  suspend the strike while the management is studying the miners'  demands.    Krivodanova stressed that the administration had had enough  time to examine the package, which it received six months ago.  She said the strike would not be called off until an  appropriate agreement was signed. Management officials and  union leaders are scheduled to meet on Friday to discuss the  dispute.    The spokeswoman also said that large sums of money were  brought to the pits to clear the management's debt in back wages  for April. "The administration is trying to defuse tension,"  Krivodanova said.    The company employs more than 100,000 workers, but only  6,000  of them belong to the independent unions.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Books: The despair of being Kenneth THE KENNETH WILLIAMS DIARIES edited by Russell Davies HarperCollins Pounds 20, 827 pages I MUST first of all declare an interest, as I appear fitfully in these pages as Kenneth's producer of the five shows we did together. This is revealed in the tone of voice, often disapproving, that he reserved for those with whom he was working. But what does not emerge (perhaps expurgated by Russell Davies, as I am one of the few members of Kenneth's circle still alive) are the many occasions when we were together as friends long before we became colleagues; and the latter years, when we had drifted so far apart professionally but resumed our friendship in what was to be the last year of his life. These diaries certainly have an unputdownable quality about them, with the appeal of eavesdropping on the conversation of a unique personality. The entry for April 8 1988 reads like an unmitigated howl of pain. And yet I have singled this day out because I realise that it was the last time I was to hear from him. As we were neighbours, he delivered this note to me by hand: My dear Michael 8.4.88 Thought of you ALL DAY yesterday. Tried to phone but your office no. which I have proved useless. Wanted to ask if you'd seen the news about the death of Myra De Croot? It is extraordinary cos she'd written to me saying she was coming over to do Chat Shows here]] apropos her part in NEIGHBOURS]] Must have been a very sudden death. She was 51. (Thanks) for your card this morning. Yes - the ULCER is back with a vengeance. Made me give up the fags. Said if the Zantac doesn't work THIS time I'll have to be operated on + the surgeon added 'Sooner the better because let's face it, you're no chicken . . .' They kept me in the Cromwell for 2 days - tests etc. - Oh] How I HATE these places] Love Kenneth. I have quoted this letter because there is still the glimmer of humour which Kenneth tried to retain when talking among his friends, saving his desolation for the diary. The tone of the reviewers of the diary has reflected that strain of despair that underpinned Kenneth's existence. But the diaries were not the whole of his existence; they cannot, do not, convey the exhilaration that his very presence would produce. He surely must have been the funniest man to have a conversation with; admittedly this would usually mean the conversation would quickly devolve into a one-sided affair because his erudition was skilfully blended with his sense of the ridiculous, and he knew that he was most loved at his most outrageous. The role that he seemed to play in public dwindled into a self-disgusted observer of his own foibles when alone with pen and paper. This is the most startling revelation of his diary. That he could have the prescience to record, when only 21, while having a coffee in Fortes among his fellow homosexuals, 'How many future tragedies were present tonight', explains perhaps that he was always half in love with easeful death. These diaries have enabled me to see in retrospect why so often our professional sorties, starting out with hope and optimism, ended in a state of stress. He realised that he did not seem to belong to any category of artist - 'too good for tat, not good enough for the truly art-purposeful Theatre.' The legacy of Kenneth will be for all to share in the recordings of his BBC shows; even now they are able to provoke hysterical laughter. For myself, I have a constant personal reminder of the contribution he made to my career as an impressario. The success of Share My Lettuce was for both of us a crucial turning point; he became a comic actor of the first rank and I had the conviction to continue as a producer after two disastrous starts. I see every day of my working life, in the entrance to my office, a scroll which he had designed and calligraphed and which reads: Presented to Michael Codron by the members of his company in the production entitled SHARE MY LETTUCE on the occasion of its third London opening at the Garrick Theatre, subsequent to the runs at the Lyric Theatre at Hammersmith and the Comedy Theatre, Panton Str.</p>

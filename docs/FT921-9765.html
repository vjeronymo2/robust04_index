			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / BAA begins to throttle back on costs: Sir John Egan wants to change the way the UK airports operator undertakes investment projects in future Sir John Egan, BAA chief executive, is determined to stop costs taking off at London's Heathrow airport. The privatised airports operator is expected to apply for planning permission later this year to build a new fifth terminal at the world's busiest international passenger airport: an even bigger project than the Pounds 400m new terminal complex BAA opened last year at Stansted airport. But timing of the application remains in doubt because Sir John wants to halve the original Pounds 1.6bn estimated cost of building terminal five at Heathrow to around Pounds 800m. 'We will only proceed the moment we see a project where the costs are acceptable,' he warned, after rejecting last week the latest plans drawn up by his staff. 'It was a good project but not a great one,' he explained. The former Jaguar chairman, who took over the running of BAA from Sir Norman Payne last year, seems convinced his group can provide the necessary 30m passenger a year additional capacity at Heathrow by the turn of the century, with a more cost-efficient terminal five project than previously planned. He does not want a repeat of the Stansted experiment. BAA could never have foreseen that its new Pounds 400m terminal at Stansted would open during the worst crisis to hit civil aviation in 40 years. But Sir John also acknowledged there was no need to spend so much at Stansted. Since taking over, Sir John has sought to change the way BAA undertakes new investment projects. 'When you spend about Pounds 300m a year in building new things, you've got to make sure you are cost effective while meeting the world's best standards,' he said. Sir John said he was first alerted to the need to transform the company's approach to new investment projects by large US carriers such as United Airlines and American Airlines which started services to London for the first time last year. 'They asked me why it took twice as much time and money to build in the UK as it did in the US,' he said. 'The problem in the UK is that there is a managerial muddle, impractical designs by architects and the fact that sub contractors accounting for about 70 per cent of the total costs don't get a look in until a project is started and the project then constantly changes,' he explained. He has already applied his new approach of designing buildings around their functions and future income streams at Glasgow airport - rather than allow what he calls 'the whimsy of managers and architects' to take over. BAA last week announced it was investing Pounds 60m to develop Glasgow's international passenger facilities. 'We started with a project costing Pounds 110m. It took us a year to get it down to Pounds 60m and I expect after another six months of detailed work we can get it even lower,' he said. The planning inquiry alone for the terminal five project at Heathrow is expected to take up to four years and cost BAA between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m. 'We won't embark on this investment until we have a robust project,' Sir John said. BAA is also developing an express rail link between Heathrow and Paddington station. But Sir John is adopting the same cautious approach to the project. 'I don't want a Channel Tunnel but a high-quality line,' he said. BAA has started tunnelling tests in the Heathrow area with the target of seeing the rail link enter service by 1995-96. BAA is still negotiating with British Rail the Pounds 235m funding of the Heathrow line. Originally BAA was to pick up 80 per cent of the cost and BR the rest. However, there is a query over BR's contribution as well as the future of all rail links between central London and the three BAA London airports of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. Privatisation of BR or parts of it could give BAA the chance to take charge of the rail links to its London airports. Sir John is cautious on such a prospect. 'Running railways is not part of our core business but I don't think it is impossible to create a nice quality solution which all the major players find attractive,' he said. Focusing on BAA's core airports and retailing businesses have become the priority for Sir John. 'Our core businesses are more profitable than any diversifications. What I want to do is build up our critical skills and once these grow we will see where we can diversify,' he said. He emphasised that Gatwick was not for sale, in spite of speculation earlier this year. 'What Gatwick needs is a marketing drive to make it fully competitive with Heathrow,' he said. Stansted would also ultimately pay for itself. It suffered a setback this month when Air France and Crossair of Switzerland said they were suspending flights from the airport because these services were losing money. However, traffic at the airport grew 100 per cent to nearly 1.8m passengers last year after the new terminal was opened. But the airport is still short of the 5m passengers a year it needs to break even. Sir John wants to expand BAA's profitable airport retailing operations by doubling retail space at airports over the next three years. He is also seeking to export the company's retailing and airport design expertise. It is competing for the design contracts of the new Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur airports and is developing the retailing and catering businesses of Pittsburg airport. At home, Sir John has spent his first year driving down costs by reducing staffing by around 20 per cent from 10,000 to 8,000 people. 'The company had never seriously examined its productivity. We have significantly improved it with the staff reduction programme,' he said. The company aims for productivity improvements of 3 per cent a year. Although passenger traffic is recovering after last year's slump caused by the Gulf war and the recession, BAA is expected to report a decline of about 18 per cent in pre-tax earnings for its financial year ending next March compared with the previous year. The City of London forecasts pre-tax profits of about Pounds 200m for the year compared with Pounds 246m. The lower profits will also reflect provisions for staff cuts, property and the possible sale of Prestwick airport in Ayrshire. After two years of zero passenger growth at its airports, Sir John sees signs of an upturn. 'We are sluggishly starting to get a little growth but we are fearful one swallow does not make a summer,' he said.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Six months to 30 September 1991 (pounds m)   1991    % change Heathrow                                     154.3     20.0 Gatwick                                       60.7    (12.2) Stansted                                     (12.8)  (243.2) Scotland                                      20.9     25.5 Other business                                 2.4     32.6 Hotels                                        (2.0)   (95.4) Lynton                                        10.1     16.3 Corporate                                     (0.1)     na Group operating profit                       233.5      4.5 Provisions                                   (54.5)    172.7 TOTAL                                        179.0     (10.7)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Thirty years ago, however, they did not even have  their own independent "status" and were included as "rural  sidelines" as the was the job of chicken raising by old women.    In 1958 following communization, in order to adjust to the  specific environment at that time, villages in all localities  began to run various types of small factories, called  "production-brigade-run enterprises," which were characterized  by groups of indigenous industries producing things like  chemical fertilizer, pesticide, cement, steel, and processed  food. That year, they achieved a output value of 6.25 billion  yuan. In the 20 years that followed, the production-brigade-run  enterprises had ups and downs in their course of development.  By the end of 1978, the number of production-brigade-run  enterprises rose to 1.52 million, which offered jobs for a  surplus rural work force of 28 million people, and achieved an  output value of 49.1 billion yuan that year.    Their real big development, however, began since reform and  opening up. In the past 15 years, China's township and town  enterprises suddenly have stood up and leapt onto the new stage  one after another. Their total output value in 1983 exceeded  100 billion yuan and in 1987 leapt to nearly 500 billion yuan.  In 1991, their output value broke through 1 trillion yuan for  the first time. In 1993 total output value reached 2.9 trillion  yuan, net profits came to 160 billion yuan, the taxes they  turned over to the state totaled 95 billion yuan, exports  totaled 190 billion yuan, and they had 112 million staff and  workers, exceeding the total number of the staff and workers of  state-run enterprises.    In as short a time as 15 years, township and town  enterprises  have grown from a tiny and tender seedling to a big strong tree  and have become an important pillar of the entire national  economy. They already account for one third of China's total  industrial output value, and they have become the main body of  China's medium-sized and small enterprises. They are important  income earners for the national economy, an important force that  supports and strengthens agriculture, a major form of shifting  the surplus rural work force, and a major force that promotes  the development of cities and towns in rural areas.    True, in their course of development, township and town  enterprises still have problems, such as, their layout is not  rational enough, they are excessively scattered, their  technology, equipment, personnel quality, and management  expertise are still rather low, government and enterprise  functions are not separated and ownership and management are not  clearly defined, and their development in eastern, central, and  western China is still unbalanced. These problems need to be  resolved in the course of their future development. We have the  reason to believe that as long as we unswervingly continue to  walk on the right road, township and town enterprises will  surely be able to have a brighter tomorrow which will draw  worldwide attention.</p>

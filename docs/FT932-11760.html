			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Keating backs Miyazawa on trade protest AUSTRALIA yesterday expressed strong support for Japan's rejection of President Bill Clinton's call for a 'managed trade' regime to help reduce the US trade deficit with Japan. During talks in Canberra, Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, told Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese premier, that Australia was 'concerned' by the US proposal, which was rejected by Mr Miyazawa this month. Mr Keating told Mr Miyazawa that he admired his 'forthright and strong' opposition to the US proposals, which Mr Clinton believes would reduce the trade deficit by setting targets for certain sectors. Australian officials said the two prime ministers agreed to oppose managed trade, which Mr Keating fears would damage trade between Japan and third countries. Japanese officials said the talks made clear that Australia and Japan shared a common view on managed trade. However, Mr Miyazawa said later that there was no need for the two countries to 'get together to oppose the US'. 'I don't think the US will exercise managed trade. I told President Clinton it would not be practical or good. All the countries in the Pacific are against managed trade.' The talks, which follow Mr Keating's visit to Japan in September, confirmed earlier indications that Canberra is emerging as a close ally of Tokyo, especially on trade issues. Mr Miyazawa said the talks marked 'a new era' in relations with Australia, which he described as 'an invaluable friend'. Australia is one of the few countries to run a significant trade surplus with Japan. The only difficult moment in the talks appears to have come when Mr Keating raised the sensitive issue of Japan's closed rice market, which Australian farmers want to see opened to imports. Mr Miyazawa gave no ground on allowing foreign rice imports, but Australian officials said he indicated that Japan was considering other market access initiatives in an attempt to stimulate agreement in the Uruguay Round talks on Gatt. 'Japan is determined to strike a positive stance on the problem of access to the market,' he said after the talks. Mr Miyazawa also said he supported suggestions by Mr Keating that the 15-country Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation Process (Apec) could be strengthened to encourage liberal trading in the region. Mr Keating has called for solid progress at Apec's next ministerial meeting in Seattle in November and urged a framework for harmonising trade and investment rules and resolving trade disputes between members.</p>

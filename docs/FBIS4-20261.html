			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Adriano Moreira, chairman of the ad hoc  parliamentary committee to monitor the situation in East Timor,  has resigned because he believes the issues of how to help the  cause of human rights in Timor and of how to hand Macao over to  China need to be reconsidered. Speaking to Renascenca, Adriano  Moreira said his decision to stand down did not mean the end of  the parliamentary committee:    [Begin recording] [Moreira] What this is about is the fact  that the way circumstances have evolved turns the issue, as far  as Portugal is concerned, into the issue of Portugal's policy in  the Pacific region. Both Macao, which is extremely important,  and Timor, the most serious of challenges in view of the adverse  conditions surrounding the cause of recognizing the rights of  the Timorese, are components of the question. With  circumstances having, in my opinion, evolved in this direction,  it seems necessary to me not only to have the matter discussed  by the House, but also to propose that the instruments for  intervention in this area be changed.    [Unidentified correspondent] What instruments do you  advocate?    [Moreira] They concern, first, the definition of the  government's responsibilities vis-a-vis Macao, and, second, the  intervention of the assembly itself in the general question of  Portugal's interests in the Pacific, which includes the Timorese  question.    The president of the Portuguese Assembly has shown the  greatest interest in this manner of posing the question, and  said he will be raising it at the meeting of parliamentary party  leaders.

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TATTOO BAN MAY BE ALTERED TO ALLOW MAKEUP  </P> <P> A ban on tattooing in Torrance may be modified to allow the application of  permanent makeup, in which pigment is added to the skin around eyes, mouths and  eyebrows.  </P> <P> This week, City Council members said they would like to change their  30-year-old ordinance outlawing tattooing to allow both permanent makeup and  cosmetic reconstruction, in which pigment is used to hide scars or return  damaged skin to more natural tones. The council told staff members to prepare  possible amendments to the city's anti-tattooing law for consideration Dec. 19.  </P> <P> Three cosmetologists were ordered to stop their tattooing services several  weeks ago when a woman seeking a business license to offer permanent makeup  protested the license's denial by showing city officials advertisements from  the three businesses. One cosmetologist appealed the order to the council.  </P></p>

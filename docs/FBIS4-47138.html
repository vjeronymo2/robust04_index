			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Kuryanovych: "New Wave--a Breeze or a </F> Tidal Wave?"]    [Text] Lvov--The "TV--Brand-New Minute" sticker is affixed  to the TV set at the headquarters of New Wave. This points  symbolically to the young age of the organization and the  average age of its members. However, the poetic name New Wave  has a strictly political implication, which is determined by the  formula: New ideas for the society, new elite for the  authorities.  <H5>  The Forerunner </H5>   The "wave" rippled through the political surface of the Lvov  area on 15 February of this year. The idea came to Mykhaylo  Kosiv and was very simple: to unite the people with democratic  views for participation in the election, with no regard to party  affiliation or independent status. The project was supported by  Mykhaylo Kosiv's colleagues in the parliament--Ihor Hryniv,  Viktor Pynzenyk, Taras Stetskiv, and Ihor Yukhnovskyy. Young  people--Levko Zakharchyshyn, Yuriy Kolotiy, Ihor Koliushko,  Oleksandr Kryvenko, Oleksandr Pavlenko, and others--joined the  well-known politicians. For politicians from these circles, the  participation of New Wave in the election was determined by two  tasks: to get its candidates elected to the Supreme Council and  to coordinate the pre-election efforts of the  national-democratic center (first of all, New Wave, the NRU  [People's Rukh of Ukraine], and the URP [Ukrainian Republican  Party]) in order to have as many democratic deputies elected as  possible.    Out of 11 candidates on the New Wave list, four were elected  to the parliament (we do not count Mykhaylo Kosiv, who was  officially registered as an NRU member, but do include in this  number Ihor Yukhnovskyy, who was nominated by New Wave, although  he later left it). The average number of votes given for one New  Wave representative was 16,100 (followed by the KUN [Congress of  Ukrainian Nationalists]--16,000, the NRU--15,300, the UNA  [Ukrainian National Assembly]--9,100). Most of the New Wave  members who lost the election ranked among the top five  candidates in their districts. New Wave has a long "second  string," which, in the absence of leaders already elected to the  Supreme Council, may play in the local elections.    However, it would hardly be correct to give credit for a  measure of New Wave's success in the election solely to the  organization. The seats were won primarily by those who have  well-known political names (with the exception of Ihor  Koliushko). That little-known New Wave members who, in terms of  their potential, are worthy of a seat, were not elected may be  put down as a demerit to the association precisely as an  organization.    New Wave has virtually failed to accomplish its second  task--to consolidate national-democratic forces. As Yuriy  Shveda, the chairman of the New Wave secretariat, said in a  conversation, the Ukrainian Republican Party resolved to act on  its own and, judging by the result, clearly overestimated its  potential. Contacts with Rukh were more fruitful; in some  districts, the NRU acted in concert with New Wave, although the  latter itself compromised more frequently, perhaps even to the  detriment of its own interests. In four districts, the Rukh  people, while not running their own candidates, did not place  the nominees of New Wave on their support list; in another four  districts, New Wave and Rukh competed against each other.    The election has objectively determined the place of New  Wave  among the leading political forces of the region: the  NRU--292,000 votes, the KUN--239,000, New Wave--177,000, the  URP--134,000, the UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National  Assembly-Ukrainian People's Self-Defense Forces]--103,000. These  "big five," having won approximately 58 percent of the votes of  the total number of the voting electorate and more than 82  percent of the votes given for candidates with a party  affiliation, will undoubtedly determine the political reality of  the Lvov area in the immediate future.    This electoral analysis prompted the organizers to consider  the feasibility of New Wave not only as an electoral  association, but as a permanent political organization. It was  registered on 6 May of this year, and on 9 May, the first  convention of the New Wave public organization was held.  However, will New Wave be of strictly regional significance? To  answer this question, let us add a few strokes to its portrait.  <H5>  The Magnitude and the Direction </H5>   New Wave is a public organization, but its registration  document specifies that it aims to participate in the political  process. In the words of Yuriy Shveda, it does not desire to  become a party, because party discipline and hierarchy scare  away the intellectual elite who do not wish to subordinate their  thinking and actions to firm party norms. Finally, the status of  a public organization makes it possible for members of parties  to participate in it without quitting the parties. Members of  the PDVU [Party of the Democratic Revival of Ukraine], the  "Green" Party, the Social-Democratic Party, the Republican  Party, the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, and the Union of  Officers of Ukraine will run for New Wave in the local election.    As of the moment it was founded, New Wave numbered 152  members. The Council, consisting of Mykhaylo Kosiv (chairman),  Ihor Hryniv, Ihor Koliushko, Viktor Pynzenyk, Taras Stetskiv,  and Yuriy Shveda (chairman of the secretariat--New Wave's  working organ), is the leading organ of the party. Rayon  organizations have been formed in Gorodok, Kamenka-Bugskaya,  Zhidachev, and Dublyany. New Wave allows collective memberships;  requests have already been filed by the Union of Architects of  Ukraine and the Oblast Association of Handicapped. According to  Shveda, in the immediate future the Association of the Left and  the Student Fraternities of the Polytechnical Institute and the  Forestry Institute may join New Wave. Yuriy Shveda responded  thus to the question of whether the organization is to be a mass  or an elitist one: "We would like our ideas to spread and enjoy  mass support; in turn, this would give us an opportunity to  implement our ideas through the parliament. Our attitude toward  the qualitative composition of the organization is very  discriminating, and we will prevent its penetration by the  underclass in every way. This is not to say that the path to the  organization is closed for workers or peasants. Admission to New  Wave is not made contingent upon one's education and social  status."    As Yuriy Shveda said, New Wave is a national-democratic  organization of a centrist, liberal orientation, although  social-democratic views will also be manifested in it. New Wave  believes that a transition to capitalism will have to be made  sooner or later, and proposes to do it urgently in order to  overcome the crisis sooner. Its main programmatic principles are  to build up an independent Ukrainian state, develop a democratic  society, and carry out immediate, profound economic reforms. It  is important that New Wave does not restrict itself to  programmatic slogans, but also has substantial studies, in  particular, an economic reform program developed under the  guidance of Viktor Pynzenyk. As far as the notion of national  democracy is concerned, said Shveda, there are organizations  that stress the first part of this combination of words, whereas  others stress the second part. For its part, New Wave strives to  organically combine them.  <H5>  Allies </H5>   The New Wave leaders count among such the  national-democratic  organizations with a centrist orientation, primarily Rukh and  the Ukrainian Republican Party, as well as the Congress of  Ukrainian Nationalists, which, to the mind of Taras Stetskiv,  while based on nationalist ideology, is not an extreme force on  the pattern of the national-radicals. Yuriy Klyuchkovskyy,  chairman of the Rukh Lvov Regional Organization, and Oleh  Pavlyshyn, chairman of the URP Lvov Oblast Organization, fully  agree that it is feasible to form a bloc of New Wave-NRU-URP-KUN  (with the addition of smaller organizations--the DemPU  [Democratic Party of Ukraine], the PZU [Green Party of Ukraine],  the SDPU [Social-Democratic Party of Ukraine]). However,  attempts to form a bloc have already run into insurmountable  obstacles now, before the local election. Yuriy Shveda thinks  that the position of the leaders is at issue, their desire for  their own organization to be the leader in the bloc. Oleh  Pavlyshyn put the problem [word illegible] down to  contradictions in attitudes toward certain candidates in  elections, but upon reflection noted that competition for the  greatest influence, which cannot but occur among the leading  forces, is also to blame. Ivan Hubka, chairman of the leadership  of the KUN Lvov Oblast Organization, considers Rukh and the URP  possible allies, although he complains about misunderstandings  during the pre-election coordination of candidacies. As far as  New Wave is concerned, to his mind, it does not have a national  enough orientation. On the contrary, Rukh leader Yuriy  Klyuchkovskyy believes that New Wave has shown itself to be a  sufficiently national organization. If we sum up the positions  of party leaders, it is easy to come to the conclusion that  there are no fundamental obstacles to forming a bloc. However,  small differences are frequently impossible to overcome if the  leaders are not prepared to compromise for the sake of pooling  their efforts.  <H5>  Non-Allies </H5>   As Shveda and Koliushko said, New Wave will not cooperate  with the left (i.e., the Socialists and Communists) and the  extreme right (the All-People's Rukh of Ukraine, the Ukrainian  Conservative Republican Party, the Ukrainian National Assembly,  the Social-National Party of Ukraine), as a result of  ideological differences. The attitudes of the right and the left  toward New Wave differ. Yuriy Shukhevich, chairman of the UNA,  called New Wave and the PDVU organizations that are hostile to  Ukrainian nationalism and, correspondingly, the UNA. Oleksandr  Holub, first secretary of the CPU [Communist Party of Ukraine]  oblast committee, describes New Wave as a "bourgeois-democratic"  organization, but does not rule out the possibility of  cooperation, noting that New Wave has bright political  personalities.  <H5>  New Wave and the Local Authorities </H5>   The attitude toward the local authorities is very critical.  Yuriy Shveda believes that most local organs of power,  especially in the oblast, are organs that have become  "self-contained," are not in touch with the public, and look  after their own corporate interests in order to keep their  positions. To Shveda's mind, the authorities have failed to  create conditions for the economic development of the oblast and  have turned out to be incapable of the substantive analysis of  the condition of the economy and the preparation of programs for  its optimum development. Such pronouncements differ from the  position of the URP, which has nominated the current chairman of  the Lvov Oblast Council, Mykhaylo Horyn, to that position. For  its part, New Wave suggests that the voters vote for Stepan  Pavlyuk, the director of the Ethnographic Institute and a former  Supreme Council deputy. The KUN supports Myroslav Senyk,  chairman of the state property fund. Rukh is to make a  determination at the next meeting of the regional council on 7  June and choose between the two candidates, Senyk and Pavlyuk.  However, the three organizations--New Wave, the NRU, and the  KUN--have agreed on the candidate for the position of mayor of  Lvov--on Rukh member Vasyl Kuybida. This indicates that the  positions of New Wave, Rukh, and the Congress of Ukrainian  Nationalists are drawing closer and opens prospects for closer  cooperation during the election. For its part, the URP has  altogether broken away from them; its leadership has resolved in  agony (by a vote of seven to five) to support for this position  URP member Semkiv, sympathy for whom has, incidentally, also  been announced by extreme right radicals.    In addition, New Wave has nominated its candidates for the  oblast council in 36 districts, and for the city council in 47  districts.  <H5>  New Wave and the Supreme Council </H5>   Ihor Koliushko responded in the affirmative to the question  of whether the members of parliament who ran for New Wave  consider themselves its representatives in the Supreme Council.  A group of New Wave men--Viktor Pynzenyk, Taras Stetskiv, and  Ihor Koliushko--joined the Reforms parliamentary group; Mykhaylo  Kosiv joined the NRU faction, and Ihor Yukhnovskyy--the  Statehood group. Undoubtedly, New Wave nominees are sufficiently  prominent figures not to be lost amid the mass of deputies.  There is a different question: Will they proclaim themselves to  be New Wave representatives? This may be of fundamental  significance if New Wave does not intend to remain a mere  regional organization.  <H5>  Prospects </H5>   Will New Wave remain a regional organization, or will it  strive for an all-Ukrainian status? Yuriy Shveda noted that  relations are already being established with organizations whose  views are close to New Wave in Ternopol, Ivano-Frankovsk, and in  the Khmelnitskiy and Zaporozhye areas. Ihor Koliushko believes  that the creation of an all-Ukrainian organization is possible  primarily on initiative from below rather than from the center,  and in the long term such a process is quite realistic. One  thing is indisputable: The future belongs to the organization  that will be able to unite centrist, national-democratic, and  democratic currents in various regions of the state. To date,  there has not been such an organization in Ukraine--all  political forces are of a monoregional, and therefore marginal  nature. Does New Wave constitute an attempt to contradict this  rule?</p>

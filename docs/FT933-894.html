			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Council review to speed up MR John Gummer, the environment secretary, is expected this week to announce plans for accelerating the review of local government's structure in England and Wales. The review will be completed by the end of next year, it is hoped, in line with the wishes expressed by Sir John Banham, chairman of the local government commission for England, in an address to the annual conference of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities last week. Sir John has accepted a full-time job as chairman of Tarmac, the construction company, but has not announced plans to leave the commission. Provisional plans for restructuring four groups of English counties - Derbyshire; Cleveland and Durham; North Yorkshire, Humberside and Lincolnshire; and Somerset, Avon and Gloucestershire - have come up against strong opposition from local authorities and business leaders. Counties and districts have so far offered contradictory proposals. But authorities that have not already been visited by the commission have started to agree plans to put to the commission. Cambridgeshire district councils last week agreed estimates of the transition costs involved in six alternative new structures. All the options would cost at least Pounds 11.7m initially. There are complaints that the process, currently scheduled to last until 1997, is too lengthy.</p>

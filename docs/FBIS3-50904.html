			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bolivian economic growth in 1993 continued along the  same lines as in the last four years -- it was "modest" and  "insufficient to meet the huge demands of the people." This is  the opinion voiced on 29 December by the Bolivian Private  Businessmen Confederation [CEPB] on the behavior of the economy  during 1993. The CEPB pointed out that this year the Bolivian  economy followed the same pattern as in previous years.    According to the document released to the press by CEPB  Chairman Carlos del Chazal, the underlying reasons for this  "modest" growth are the relative stability of prices, and above  all, the social stability achieved on the basis of dialogue and  consensus, especially with regard to relations between employers  and employees.    The change of administration in August did not alter the  economic policy, particularly the monetary policy. One may  rightly venture to say that in the eyes of Bolivian businessmen,  1993 was a year without major jolts, in which problems and  disssatisfactions were expressed by other sectors of Bolivian  society.  <H5>  The Damned Fiscal Deficit </H5>   One of CEPB's concerns was, for example, the steady and  relentless increase in the fiscal deficit, which is estimated to  reach 6.5 percent of the GDP by the end of the year. This was  undoubtedly the largest deficit in four years, since it totaled  4.6 percent in 1992. The CEPB document stresses that the fiscal  imbalance was real in spite of the significant and sustained  increase in tax revenues. CEPB's most serious concern lies in  the fact that the deficit is financed with foreign resources, by  running into debt, the level of which cannot be sustained for  much longer.    And yet, what is still more disturbing is that most of  government spending is earmarked for current expenditures, thus  curtailing resources and possibilities for public investments,  both in the development of human resources as well as in the  upgrading of the productive infrastructure that would enable  ending "bottlenecks that hinder private productive activities  from achieving greater dynamism and development."  <H5>  Policies and Indicators </H5>   The most salient aspect of the monetary policy furthered by  the Bolivian Central Bank is the curbing of inflation to levels  below 10 percent. The exchange rate behaved in a way comparable  to the controlled inflation pattern.    According to the CEPB analysis, these factors contributed to  the improvement of the real exchange rate for the exporting  sector. The CEPB contends that "the increase in the country's  international reserves constitutes another factor that provides  stability in the short term."    Among the most significant events, the CEPB mentioned the  passing of the new General Law on Banks and Financial  Establishments, which will enable the establishment of new  financial institutions to democratize credits and benefit vast  business sectors, which will in turn be instrumental in creating  new jobs and wealth.    These encouraging accomplishments made by the Bolivian  economy contrast with some other negative and restrictive  aspects, like the increasing prevalence of making transactions  in U.S. dollars and high interest rates. The CEPB believes that  "the cost of money, together with rules of the game that are not  altogether clear, conspire against private investments, and  therefore, against employment and economic growth."    The document released by Chazal cites preliminary estimates  by the National Statistics Institute of a 3.2-percent GDP growth  due to "opposing behaviors." On the one hand, the dynamism of  agriculture and the mining industry, and on the other, the slump  in sectors like the manufacturing industry and construction  [sentence fragment as published].    With regard to foreign trade, the imbalance continues, so  much so that it is estimated that the deficit of the 1993 trade  balance will be as high as in the previous year, i.e. more than  $500 million. The document states that "we meet our needs by  resorting time and again to the rest of the world at the expense  of domestic economic development."    The Bolivian businessmen's closing assessment of the  economic year includes a review of the national economy's  prospects and projections. The administration must first engage  in modernizing the state by completing the great structural  transformations and changes initiated. These transformations  and changes must be completed with the constitutional reforms.  These great reforms will redefine the state's role and will  guarantee effective economic freedom and responsibilities for  the entrepreneurial segment.    Entrepreneurs trust that the fiscal deficit will be reduced  in 1994, that it will be controlled better, and that it will be  financed with real resources.    This must be achieved without resorting to increased taxes,  but rather by attempting to increase the number of taxpayers and  reducing tax evasion. This will prevent the "crowding out"  [preceding two words in English] phenomenon, "which prevents the  private segment from making more effective contributions to  investments." Within the framework of the expected  modernization and without considering the removal of the powers  of the state, the entrepreneurs propose the following:    -- To transfer the large public enterprises, including the  deregulation of the markets in which they are operating, thus  eliminating the harmful public monopolies.    -- To reform education, thus allowing our country to have --  in the middle and long term -- qualified human resources, the  basis for any development process.    -- To restructure the social security system in order to  improve the standard of living of the workers through  appropriate health and housing contributions -- and to reform  the retirement funds through an individual capitalization  system, which will also contribute to financing substantial  investments required to grow at a faster pace and democratize  the ownership of capital.    The Bolivian entrepreneurs emphasize: "We will continue to  contribute to improving the standard of living of the population  through the production of wealth and the creation of jobs. This  process will be more dynamic if the state establishes the  conditions required to guarantee an increased flow of national  and foreign investments."</p>

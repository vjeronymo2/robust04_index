			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the context of ADRs, the Commission believes that, in most cases, the relevant underlying equity market is the primary market on which the security underlying the ADR trades. This is because, in most cases, the market for the security underlying the ADR generally is larger in comparison to the ADR market, both in terms of share volume and the value of trading. Because of the additional leverage provided by an option on an ADR, the Commission generally believes that having a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place, between the exchange where the ADR option trades and the exchange where the foreign security underlying the ADR primarily trades, will ensure the integrity of the marketplace. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  The Commission further believes that the ability to obtain relevant surveillance information, including, among other things, the identity of the ultimate purchasers and sellers of securities, is an essential and necessary component of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26653 (March 21, 1989), 54 FR 12705 (order approving the trading of options on the International Market Index (``IMI''), an index comprised of ADRs traded in the United States based on foreign securities). In this approval order, the Commission specifically required that there be comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements in place between the Amex and the foreign exchanges on which the securities underlying the ADRs trade so that a substantial percentage of the Index was covered by comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the current proposal, however, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to permit the listing of options on an ADR without the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with the foreign market where the underlying security trades, as long as the U.S. market for the underlying ADRs is at least as large as the market for the underlying foreign security. Specifically, the proposed listing standards require that 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign security occur in the U.S. ADR market, which consists of the Amex, the BSE, the CBOE, the CHX, the CSE, the NASD, the NYSE, the PSE, and the Phlx. The proposal further requires that for the continued trading of the ADR options the percentage of the world-wide trading volume occurring in the U.S. ADR market must not fall below 30%. The Commission believes these standards will ensure that the relevant pricing market for the options on ADRs is the U.S. ADR market rather than the foreign market where the security underlying the ADR trades. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the Commission believes that the proposed method for determining whether the trading volume in the U.S. ADR market meets the required percentages is adequate to ensure that the U.S. ADR market is and continues to be the price discovery market for the foreign security underlying the ADR option. Specifically, the PSE has represented that it will calculate the trading volume for the previous three months in the underlying ADR, the underlying foreign security, and other related securities which can affect the pricing of the underlying foreign security. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  To list an ADR option without the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement, the proposal requires the combined trading volume for ADRs overlying any class of the foreign issuer's stock, occurring in the U.S. ADR market, to be not less than 50% of the combined world-wide trading volume for all classes of the issuer's stock and all ADRs that overlie any of these classes. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 4, and accompanying text. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In summary, the Commission believes that in cases where a substantial percentage of the world-wide trading volume for the underlying ADR, the underlying foreign security, and other securities relevant to the pricing of these securities occurs in the U.S. ADR market, <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  the U.S. ADR market operates as the price discovery market for the foreign securities ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  stocks and ADRs) underlying the ADR options. In these cases, the Commission believes that the U.S. ADR market is the instrumental market for purposes of deterring and detecting potential manipulation or other abusive trading strategies in conjunction with transactions in the overlying ADR options market. Therefore, because the PSE, and all the other U.S. self-regulatory agencies which make up the U.S. ADR market are members of the ISG, the Commission believes that there is an effective surveillance sharing arrangement to permit the exchanges and the NASD to adequately investigate any potential manipulations of the ADR options or their underlying securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We note that it is appropriate to view the U.S. ADR market as a single market even though it is made up of several national securities exchanges and the NASD. The Commission notes that all of the markets on which or through which these ADRs could trade are linked together by ITS. The Commission further notes that one market, the NYSE, typically operates as the primary exchange on which trades in U.S. ADRs are executed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

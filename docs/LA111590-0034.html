			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FALLEN ANGEL: LANDON'S TIFF WITH NBC;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THE VETERAN ACTOR, PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR HAS TAKEN HIS NEW SERIES  TO CBS AFTER A RUN-IN WITH NBC'S BUSINESS AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT.  </P> <P> After more than 30 years on NBC as an actor, producer, writer and director  involved in three long-running series -- "Bonanza," "Little House on the  Prairie" and "Highway to Heaven" -- Michael Landon has taken the highway to  CBS.  </P> <P> Today, Landon begins filming the two-hour pilot for "Us," the story of a man  renewing family ties after 17 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit. And  with that pilot, Landon, 54, ends what he called in a 1988 interview with The  Times an "exclusive" professional relationship with NBC. Although never under  contract to develop new series only for that network, "I do it out of loyalty,"  Landon said then.  </P> <P> That loyalty is over.  </P> <P> In an interview at his office at Columbia Pictures Television -- which is  producing the "Us" pilot that Landon wrote -- Landon said he took the project  to CBS because those in charge of NBC's business affairs department rewarded  his years of service by being "just plain rude, flat out rude" to him.  </P> <P> "It basically had (nothing) to do with Brandon Tartikoff (chairman of NBC  Entertainment Group) or (NBC Entertainment President) Warren Littlefield or any  of those guys (in the entertainment division)," Landon said. "It basically had  to do with a corporate attitude on the part of West Coast business affairs.  </P> <P> "It was just an attitude -- not with me, because I don't really discuss  anything with them -- but with people who have been with me since I've been at  NBC -- my agent, my business manager. Kind of the same kind of attitude you'd  give someone who just came in off the street, whom you had never met. . . .  </P> <P> "My post-production people received (an) award every year from NBC for the only  show that promptly delivers every single episode without presenting a problem,  and instead of having an attitude of 'Hey, that's terrific,' it's the attitude  people end up having with their relatives: 'Hey -- they're just around.' "  </P> <P> Landon said that he had discussed "a number of series possibilities" with NBC  but had been met with unwillingness to listen to his ideas. He said that he  never specifically presented NBC with the concept for "Us." He added that  Tartikoff and Littlefield tried to persuade him to come back to NBC after  hearing of his rift with the business affairs department, but by then it was  "too late."  </P> <P> When asked who specifically was responsible for offending the Landon team,  Landon gave the name of John Agoglia, president of NBC Enterprises -- "who will  have no idea what we're talking about," Landon said sarcastically.  </P> <P> Agoglia said that he was, indeed, mystified by Landon's complaints:  </P> <P> "Mr. Landon and I have known each other for a long time; I am a little  disappointed by his comments. There are certain jobs in the industry where you  are relegated to wear the black hat, and I guess (chief of) business affairs is  it. To my knowledge, other than a small finishing-up of old business, we don't  have anything outstanding with Michael, nor did we have any major argument or  disagreement. . . . Maybe Mr. Landon's anger is misdirected."  </P> <P> As to Landon's charge that NBC was not interested in meeting with him, Agoglia  said such decisions are made by the entertainment division, not the business  department, and "I can't imagine that Brandon or Warren would not immediately  respond to Mr. Landon wanting to present an idea. . . . Michael is a great guy.  We'd love to have him back at NBC anytime."  </P> <P> Tartikoff was equally bemused by Landon's anger, but said that it possibly had  to do with a financial concern. (Landon said that the disagreement had nothing  to do with money.)  </P> <P> "The world has changed; the economics of television has changed," Tartikoff  said. "I don't know whether it was fair or not, I don't know specifically what  the allegations were, I just know that Landon was being asked to deficit  something in a way that he hadn't been asked before, and he was offended by  that.  </P> <P> "I don't really have the power to go to those people (the business affairs  department) and say: 'You have to give Michael Landon what he wants -- I demand  it,' " said Tartikoff. "That wouldn't be my style anyway, but that's not the  way the company works."  </P> <P> In any case, Landon seems happy to be resurfacing on CBS. The two-hour pilot,  which has no scheduled airdate, will kick off the hour drama series, slated for  fall of 1991. Landon portrays Jeff Hayes, who gets another chance at life when  he is found innocent after 17 years in prison, and begins to travel the country  writing a Charles Kuralt-style newspaper column about the people he meets.  </P> <P> Traveling with him are his father (Barney Martin), who must learn to accept him  after years of anger over his son's alleged crime, and his 17-year-old son  (newcomer Casey Peterson), whom he never had the chance to get to know.  </P> <P> Landon said that his new character would represent a departure from his  "Highway to Heaven" character, Jonathan Smith, an angel serving a probationary  term on Earth trying to win his way back to heaven by performing good deeds.  </P> <P> "I think this will have a bit more edge to it -- it's hard to be flawed if  you're an angel," Landon said. "It'll give me an opportunity to do an hour show  that doesn't have to wrap up everything at the end of an hour, and clean up all  the loose ends. If the family characters are interesting enough -- and getting  men to talk to each other is a kind of interesting proposition . . . you can  have fun, you can have dramatic moments. And I don't have to be on the same  sets all the time -- we can move around and meet a lot of different people in  this country, because it's going to be based on a lot of things that are  actually happening, from (stories in) little newspapers you don't hear of very  much.  </P> <P> "It's not a show where you're going to be able to guess exactly what's going to  happen," Landon added. "It's like life is."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 28, BNS -- Higher import tariffs in  Russia for certain Estonian-made goods will be effective from  July 1, 1994, the Estonian Foreign Ministry press office quoted  an official statement by the Russian Embassy as saying.    Tariffs as valid before March 15 this year will remain in  effect until June 30. This means that exporters in Estonia who  have already paid the Russian tax under the higher rates can get  back their money or leave it as pre-payment for next  consignments, the ministry adds in its remarks.    The Russian Government in a ruling from March 14 imposed  higher tariffs on some articles of imports from Estonia. The  new tariffs for farm products, confectionery and bakery  products, textiles, were established at two times the rate used  for imports from other European countries.    Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets in an interview  with the Interfax news agency earlier this month said Moscow is  not going to revise the new tariffs in the near future.</p>

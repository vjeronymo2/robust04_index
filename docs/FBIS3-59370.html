The period from 1978 to 1984 was one of high speed growth  during which peasant net income increased from 115.9 yuan to  298.71 yuan a year in a 157.7 percent increase, or 17.1 percent  per year. The period from 1985 to 1988 was one of low speed  growth in which peasant net income increased from 298.71 to  480.22 yuan per year in a 60.8 percent increase, or 12.6 percent  per year. The period from 1989 to 1992 was one of slow growth  during which peasant net income increased from 480.22 yuan to  618.72 yuan per year in a 28.8 percent, or 6.5 percent per year.    Despite the sustained increase in total peasant income  during  these three periods, the speed of income increase slowed  markedly. This was particularly true for the period 1989 to  1992 when, after deducting for price increases, real income fell  2.9, 0.7, and 1.7 percent respectively. A series of bad effects  chain reactions ensued, the first of which was a widening of the  gap between peasant income elsewhere in the country. In 1980,  the gap between peasant net income in Ningxia and peasant net  income nationally was only 16.23 yuan. In 1990, it was 60 yuan;  in 1991, it was 100.50 yuan; and in 1992, it widened to 165  yuan, Ningxia's income ranking falling from eighteenth place in  the country in 1990 to twenty-third place in 1992. The second  effect was a widening the gap between city and countryside. In  1978 the gap between the region's average per capita peasant net  income and city and town residents' income spent on living  expenses was 1 to 2.78. This narrowed to 1 to 2.04 in 1988, but  widened to 1 to 2.5 in 1992. Third was an increase in the  number of low income needy families. In 1992, 21 percent of  rural households in the region had an income of less than 300  yuan; and 9.4 percent had an income of less than 200 yuan. Of  the households having an income of less than 300 yuan, 47  percent were in mountain regions, and of the households having  an income of less than 200 yuan, 22 percent were in mountain  regions. This was a 9 and 6 percentage point increase over 1991.  Fourth was a decline in income from production and sales. In  1990, investment in fixed assets used for production declined 21  percent, peasant per capita spending for the purchase of fixed  assets used in production declining from 61.70 to 48.40 yuan.  Fifth was slow increase in total rural commodity retail sales.  Between 1990 and 1992, the annual increase in total rural  commodity retail sales fell from 16.5 to 6 percent in a 10  percentage point decline. Between 1989 and 1991, peasant real  consumption fell about 50 yuan.    The deep-seated reasons for the decline in the speed of  peasant income growth in the region since 1989 are primarily as  follows:    1. Failure To Eliminate Longstanding Notions That  Emphasize Grain Output Rather Than Cash Income. Frequently,  rural areas are judged in terms of their grain production, and  rural work is judged in terms of whether grain production has  increased, so much so that slight fluctuations in grain  production greatly intensify the chain reaction of fluctuations  in peasant income. The guiding thought in rural work emphasizes  increase in agricultural product output and supply to the  neglect of increase in peasant income. Up until 1978, the  demand for farm products greatly exceeded supply. Farm products  were in short supply, so the development of production to  increase supplies and fill the markets became the focus of rural  work. Since 1988, farm product production and supply largely  satisfy needs, but the guiding thought has not been promptly  readjusted. As before, it departs from the goal of increase  peasant income. This is a subjective reflection of the decline  in the speed of increase in peasant income.    2. National Economic Development Policies Do Not Favor  Agriculture Sufficiently. Investment in agriculture has  declined, infrastructure has aged, and reproduction capacity has  become weak. The distribution of social benefits favors  industry and the cities, and sacrifices the interests of  agriculture and the peasants. The long emphasis only on  applying agricultural accumulations to the development of  industry ignores the role of industry suckling agriculture in  turn. Despite several readjusts of agricultural product prices,  the price scissors between industrial and farm products tends to  widen, the peasants suffering a serious loss of benefit. Up  until 1988, agricultural and sideline product procurement prices  rose faster than prices of the means of agricultural production,  so the price scissors narrowed and peasants gained real benefit.  In 1988, the overall agricultural and sideline product  procurement price level rose 1.75 times over 1978 in an average  annual 10.6 percent increase. Meanwhile, during the same period  prices of the agricultural means of production rose 50.2 percent  over 1978 in an average 4.2 percent annual rise, which was 6.4  percentage points lower than the agricultural and sideline  products procurement price. Peasants benefitted to the tune of  150.70 yuan, which was 41.4 percent of the increase in net  peasant income for the same period. Since 1989, the rise in  prices of rural industrial goods has exceeded the rise in prices  paid for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products.  Between 1988 and 1991, the price scissors between industrial  and agricultural goods widened 31.5 percent in an average annual  7.9 percent increase, the peasant gaining little but losing  much. Comparison of 1992 with 1988 shows a peasant per capita  loss of 124.95 yuan as a result of the rise in prices of  agricultural means of production. This is 90.2 percent of the  138.50 yuan increase in peasant per capital net income for the  same period. In addition, because of the restraints of the  traditional planned economy, development of the rural economy  did not follow the path of the market economy. It emphasized  production and slighted commodity circulation. Markets did not  develop in a sound manner, channels for the circulation of  agricultural products did not work well, and difficulties buying  alternated with difficulties selling, large quantities of  agricultural products piling up in inventory, the increase in  peasant income suffering as a result.    3. Irrational Rural Economic Structure. With the  advent of rural reform, the structure of rural industry has  gradually changed from the heavily weighted emphasis on primary  industry, on farming within the primary industry, and on grain  production in farming to the joint development of primary,  secondary, and tertiary industries, farming, forestry, animal  husbandry, sideline occupations, and the fishing industry.  These changes in the rural industrial structure have changed  the sources of peasant income, and increased peasant income.  Peasant family net income from the primary industry declined  from 83.2 percent in 1983 to 78.1 percent in 1988. The  percentage derived from farming, the primary source of income  within the primary industry, fell from 79.8 to 72.6, while  peasant net income from forestry, animal husbandry, sideline  occupations, and the fishing industry rose from 20.2 to 27.4  percent. Peasant net income rose from 175.10 yuan in 1980 to  480.22 yuan in 1988. This included 91.69 yuan more from  secondary and tertiary industries, which was 30 percent of the  total, and 53 yuan more from forestry, animal husbandry,  sideline occupations, and the fishing industry, which was 25.7  percent of the total. Since 1989, rural tertiary industries  have had hard going. Rural industry restructuring languished.  Between 1989 and 1992, output value of rural primary,  secondary, and tertiary industries stood still at around 68, 22,  and 10 percent respectively, and the output value of farming,  forestry, and animal husbandry stood at 70, 5, and 22 percent  respectively. Peasant family net income secondary and tertiary  industries, and from forestry, animal husbandry, sideline  occupations, and fishing declined. At the same time, growth of  the primary industry and farming slowed markedly. Between 1989  and 1992, net income from the primary industry and farming  increased 2.3 and -2 percent, an increase far lower than the  16.5 and 46.5 percent of the period 1985 to 1988. Since  readjustment of the peasants' industrial structure was in limbo,  problems in increasing peasant income became greater and greater  causing a steady year-by-year decline in peasant income.    4. Irrational Peasant Employment Structure. Since  the advent of rural reform, the development of rural  non-agricultural industries has enabled a large amount of  surplus rural manpower to move out of agriculture into  non-agricultural pursuits. Consequently, the structure of rural  employment has entered a new stage. Changes in the make-up of  peasant employment have widened the sources of peasant income.  The peasants have moved from dependence on the distribution of  income from agriculture to dependence on distributions of income  from both agricultural and non-agricultural pursuits, which has  increased their income. Between 1978 and 1988, peasant income  derived from non-agricultural production increased from 2.08 to  95.69 yuan in a 45-fold increase. This was an average annual  46.6 percent increase and accounted for 28.9 percent of the  increase in peasant income from production. Thanks to the  effects of state macroeconomic improvement of the economic  environment and rectification of the economic order since 1989,  large amounts of manpower have returned to farming. In 1990,  manpower employed in non-agricultural pursuits fell five  percentage points from the previous year. As a result of the  return of manpower to agriculture, peasant income from  production fell 4 and 7.2 percent respectively in 1989 and 1990  in comparison with the previous years, and the increase in  income from non-agricultural pursuits slowed appreciably.  Between 1989 and 1992, net income from non-agricultural  pursuits increased by an average 14.6 percent per year, 32  percentage points lower than during the previous 10 years.  Large amounts of manpower continue to linger in rural villages,  restricting increase in peasant income.    5. Slow Development of Town and Town Enterprises.  Since the beginning of rural reform, town and township  enterprises have suddenly come to the fore to become a main  integral part of the rural economy and the entire national  economy as well. They have also become an important means for  increasing peasant income. Peasant income obtained directly  from town and township enterprises nationwide amounts to 193  yuan per capita, or 24.6 percent of annual per capita income.  In Ningxia, it is 116 yuan, or 18.85 percent of annual peasant  net income, 77 yuan less than the national figure.    6. Peasant Burdens Heavy. First of all,  agricultural production costs have increased. During 1991 and  1992, 64 and 62 percent of the increase in peasant earnings in  Ningxia was eaten up by increased costs. Second, taxes have  increased. In 1992, peasant tax payments in Ningxia averaged  9.80 yuan per capita, a 6.7 and 13 percent increase respectively  over 1990 and 1991, and higher than the increase in peasant net  income for the same period. Third is an increase in collective  withholdings. In 1992, withholdings averaged 15 yuan per  capita, up 36.2 and 35.4 percent over 1990 and 1991. Like  taxes, withholdings increased faster than peasant net income.  Fourth is other unjustifiable burdens, which add to peasant  burdens, causing a severe loss of peasant income.    The whole point of rural reform and development during the  1990's has been to increase peasant income and to bring rural  villages up to a comfortably well-off standard of living.  Peasant income is the main indicator of a comfortably well-off  rueral standard of living, the speed of its increase having a  direct bearing on rural progress in achieving a comfortably  well-off standard of living. Therefore, the guiding thought and  approach in our work must take the goal of a comfortable  well-off standard of living as the be all of rural work. We  must make peasant income increase the key element in development  of agriculture and the rural economy, truly changing away from  the former sole pursuit of output and output value in  agriculture and the rural economy to the improvement of benefits  across the board, and increasing peasant income. The main  reasons for posing the issue in these terms are as follows:    First, increasing peasant income is essential to maintaining  the unflagging interest of peasants in production. Following  implementation of the family output related contract  responsibility system in rural villages, both simple  reproduction and the expansion of reproduction fell to peasant  households. A substantial portion of peasant income for the  previous year had to be applied to reproduction in the following  year. If income does not increase or increased only slowly, the  peasants' capacity for reproduction is bound to be weak. When  agricultural inputs are inadequate, not only is current  agricultural production impaired, but changes in agricultural  production methods and progress in the modernization of  agriculture will suffer too. If the peasants toil all year and  the granaries are full but their pockets are empty, and there is  no improvement in their clothing, food, and housing, maintenance  of their interest in production will be difficult. Once  agricultural production no longer enjoys the enthusiastic  support of the peasants and begins to slide, the entire national  economy loses its most fundamental sustenance.    Second, increase in the effective supply of agricultural  products, including increase in the total amount, improvement in  the selection offered, and raising quality is a basic goal in  the development of agriculture. Furthermore, attainment of this  goal depends on how well the peasants are or are not rewarded.  Nowadays peasants decide what they will grow on the basis of  their expectation of the income to be made. If we resurrect the  old methods of jacking up targets and issuing compulsory orders,  matters may turn out differently that we expect. Unless the  situation of increasing output only to recieve no or little  increase in income is changed, stable agriculture also becomes  an empty phrase.    Third, the main mark of modern agriculture is improvement of  the organic make-up and technical make-up of capital, reducing  the amount of manpower and its contribution. This means that  the peasants and the rural collective economy organization must  possess substantial accumulated funds.    Fourth, past thinking about the development of agriculture  emphasized the role of peasants as a source of products, but  neglected their role as a market. This is one of the reasons  that the national economy has found it difficult to shake off  the market slump. Rural villages are a vast market, and  peasants are the largest customers for industrial goods.  Changes in rural purchasing power have a direct bearing on the  prosperity of industrial markets, which affects, in turn, the  economic returns of industrial enterprises. Facts show that the  market capacity of the urban population is not enough to support  the sustained rapid growth of industry, but development of the  rural market depends on increasing peasant income.    Fifth, attainment of a comfortably well-off standard of  living for the people of the whole country by the end of the  present century is an important strategic goal in the  development of China's economy. The key to realization of the  comfortably well-off goal lies in rural villages, and the  difficulty in attaining it also lies in the rural villages.  Calculations show that peasant attainment of a comfortably  well-off standard of living will require a per capita net income  of 1,200 yuan (at constant 1990 prices). At this rate, per  capita peasant net income in Ningxia will have to reach 1,000  yuan by 2000, i.e., an annual 6 percent rate of increase. This  includes a per capita annual income of 1,300 in river valley  areas, or an annual 8 percent increase, and a per capita annual  income of 650 yuan in mountain regions, or an annual more than 6  percent increase. These are 1 percentage point higher than the  speed of increase for the nation as a whole. Clearly, the use  of every possible means to increase peasant income is an  extremely daunting task that will brook no delay. Unless  peasant net income in the Ningxia Autonomous Region can be  increased substantially, the region will be unable to enter a  comfortably well-off standard of living period along with the  rest of the country.    Sixth, peasant income is not just an economic issue but a  political issue as well. It affects not only the overall  development of the national economy, but also affects relations  between industry and agriculture, between city and countryside,  and between the Party and the peasantry, as well as the  stability of society and the consolidation of socialist  political authority in rural villages. The Party's and the  government's repeated emphasis on various vigorous measures to  solve the peasants' burdens problem has as it goal increasing  peasant income.    Agriculture is the region's greatest strength, and it is  also  the main source of peasant income. Talk about increasing  peasant income other than through agriculture is unrealistic.  Non-agricultural industries are also an effective way to  increase peasant income, and talk about increasing peasant  income without non-agricultural industries is likewise  impossible. Although non-agricultural industries have developed  slowly in Ningxia, they show tremendous development potential.  Therefore, a policy of emphasis on both agriculture and  non-agricultural industries must be part of the guiding thought  for increasing peasant income. Agriculture cannot be emphasized  at the expense of non-agricultural industries, nor can  non-agricultural industries be emphasized at the expense of  agriculture. Coordinated development of both agriculture and  non-agricultural industries should form the foundation for  steady increase in peasant income.    1. Close Attention to the Peasant Income Problem,  Making Increase in Peasant Income a Long-term Strategic  Task. Increasing peasant income is a concerted expression  of the Party's wealthy people policy, and it is the urgent  desire of the broad masses of peasants. Once the food and  clothing problems of the broad masses of people are solved, the  income problem becomes the problem that concerns them most. The  key to doing something about this rural economic task of  increasing peasant income lies in doing something about the main  contradiction between rural reform and development. The  peasants wholeheartedly support the Party and the state's policy  of reform and opening to the outside world because these  policies enable them to obtain very many tangible benefits. CPC  committees and government at all levels should do all possible  to increase the peasants' income, truly making it the basic  point of departure and point of return in rural work, make in a  key task in future rural work, and correctly handle the  relationship between development of the economy and increasing  peasant's income, and between the peasant's immediate attainment  of wealth and long-term economic development. They must proceed  from local realities to draw up realistic plans and genuine  measures, and carry them out one by one. Cadres at all levels  must further change their thinking, get away from erroneous  conceptions, eradicate the tendency to think that rural work  means working on agriculture, and that agriculture means grain.  In evaluating a place's work from now on, more must be looked  at than just how much grain is harvested or how much output  value increases. More attention must be paid to how much peasant  income increases. Those in charge must fulfill the functions of  their office, and administration means staying the course. In  appraising achievements in an official career, it is important  to look at whether the person has genuinely and sincerely guided  the peasants in developing the economy, in increasing their  income, and in being highly effective so that the peasants can  gain a genuine sense of the advantages of the Party's wealthy  peasant policy through the work of cadres at all levels. Only  when they have such a work objective and guiding thought can  cadres at all levels more wholeheartedly guide the peasants in  becoming wealthy, and find more ways to riches.    2. Intensify Rural Reform; Persist in Using Reform To  Spur Development; and Use Development To Spur Increased  Income. The goal of China's economic system reform is  establishment of a socialist market economy system. This means  enabling the market to play a basic role in the allocation of  resources under state macroeconomic regulation and control,  economic activity thereby abiding by the laws of value, and  adjusting to changes in supply and demand, so that the  allocation of resources produces greater benefits. The setting  of this goal places new requirements on, and poses new tasks for  rural reform. After rural villages instituted the family output  related contact responsibility system, although the peasants had  relatively independent decision making authority, under the  planned economic system, agricultural production continued to  follow the former leadership methods in which growing areas were  rigidly assigned, and even production methods were stringently  set. The peasants lacked true decision making authority, and  the increase in peasant income was severely limited. With the  development of a rural socialist market economy system, the  production orientation will change, production being conduction  according to market demand. Whatever the market needs will be  produced, and whatever is profitable will be produced.  Unprofitable crops will not be grown. The market supply and  demand situation and price fluctuations will be a reflection of  this demand. Development of production on the basis of the  market orientation will mean that both government and the people  must make some fundamental changes. Government has to change  its functions and leadership methods, become aware of, study, a  nd thoroughly understand market signals in a timely fashion, and  pay attention to regulating the market well. Using this as the  orientation for economic activities, government must produce  companion policies, and organize the peasants to produce to meet  market demand. The peasants must orient toward the market  instead of toward the government, and change from reliance on  the government to reliance on market demand in reaching their  own decisions. In this way, the peasants can effectively  increase their income according to the laws of market economy  activity. In addition, a market economy is an economic form  that encompasses both cities and the countryside, and the entire  national economy. It cannot be built solely on the rural  villages. It must knit together and dovetail every aspect of  cities and the entire national economy. This means that the  dual system of city and countryside separation must be  demolished and barriers between cities and the countryside  eliminated, the existing household registration control system  that separates cities and the countryside reformed, the peasants  encouraged to play a part in commodity circulation in the  cities, and take part in the building of cities, thereby  changing and building a new relationship between the cities and  the countries. This will provide the peasants more space to  exercise their talents and increase their income. It will  actively guide a greater flow of the elements of production from  cities to rural villages, thereby increasing rural vitality and  strength for the development of productivity. The area thus  affected is very broad. One important such area is the complete  opening up of the urban labor market to allow surplus rural  labor to flow into the industries and positions in cities that  need manpower. At the same time, it will actively organize an  exchange of manpower with economically developed areas, and  gradually open up the international labor market.    3. Active Readjustment of the Make-up of Rural Industry  To Develop High Yield, Premium Quality, High Returns  Agriculture. As orientation toward the market increases,  farm product prices are further decontrolled, and the clash  between a steadily growing population and a gradually  diminishing amount of cultivated land becomes worse and worse,  accumulating the large amounts of money required for investment  in agriculture by increasing income from limited cultivated land  will be impossible. Prospects of increasing peasant income by  increasing grain procurement are also becoming dimmer and  dimmer. Likewise, controlling prices of the agricultural means  of production cannot solve the problem fundamentally, and the  national treasury will be unable to bar the burden of continued  fiscal subsidies. Low return agriculture is already far from  being able to meet peasant income growth needs. Therefore, no  time should be lost in setting about the vigorous readjustment  of the rural industrial structure. Development of high yield,  premium quality, high return agriculture is bound to become the  inevitable choice to improve overall returns from agriculture  and increase peasant income. The development of high yield,  premium quality, high returns agriculture is the basic future  trend of development of China's agriculture, and it is also an  important way for the peasants to become wealthy and begin a  comfortably well-off standard of living during the 1990's. It  marks the entry of China's agriculture into a new historical  stage. This stage is characterized by, first, a change in  China's agriculture from traditional agriculture to modern  agriculture. Modern agriculture requires not only high yields,  but premium quality and high returns as well. This is what  distinguishes it fundamentally from traditional agriculture.  Second is the transformation of China's rural economy from a  semi-self sufficient to a commodity economy, and a commodity  economy is market oriented. It takes not only quantity but  quality to achieve dominance in markets. Only quality products  can compete, gain a market share, and produce returns. Finally,  the standard of living of China's people is changing from  subsistence to comfortably well-off. One extremely important  mark of this change from subsistence to comfortably well off is  substantial improvement and rise in the people's food, clothing,  housing, and travel. All these are related to agriculture;  every one of them is related to the rise in the quality of  agricultural products. These features of the era mean that high  yield, premium quality, high return agriculture must abide by  both natural laws and market laws. Advanced technology and  scientific methods must be employed, labor-intensive and  technology-intensive production are needed, and natural and  social resources must be developed and used in multiple ways,  all production elements combined in an optimum way to the  maximum extent possible for greater per unit yields, premium  product quality, and high overall returns that yield economic,  social, and ecological benefits. Developing a high-yield,  premium quality, and high benefit agriculture requires expansion  of the growing area for cash crops, livestock feed crops,  melons, fruits, and vegetables in the internal make-up of  agriculture while ensuring steady increase in grain production  at the same time. Development of forestry, animal husbandry,  sideline products, fishing industry, and agricultural and  sideline processing industries must be accelerated as part of  the readjustment of the rural economic structure to lengthen the  agricultural production chain and widen the agricultural  production realm. Only a rational and effective restructuring  can make the rural economy expand from the farming industry to  processing industries, from the production realm into the  commodity circulation realm, from undertakings that yield small  returns to those that yield large returns, and from  labor-intensive to technology-intensive industries, thereby  gradually following a course of high yield, premium quality, and  high return development.    4. All-out Development of Town and Township Enterprises  To Open Many Avenues for Rural Employment. The trend of  future rural economic development suggests a gradual decline in  the primary industry portion of the rural industrial structure,  and a gradual in the tertiary and secondary industries portion;  a gradual decline in amount of manpower employed in agriculture,  and a gradual rise in the amount of manpower employed in  non-agricultural pursuits, particularly in town and township  industries; and a gradual decline in the rate of increase in  peasant income coming from agriculture, and a gradual rise in  the rate of increase in peasant income coming from other than  agriculture. As the most active growth point in rural economic  development today, town and township enterprises have become a  major source of peasant income. Over the long term, town and  township enterprises offer potential for increasing peasant  income in the Ningxia Autonomous Region, town and township  enterprises also offer hope. Take a firm grip on the key that  town and township enterprises are means having a firm grip on  the key to increasing peasant income. The main difference  between rural economic development in Ningxia and coastal area  lies in the difference between town and township enterprises.  The gap between peasant prosperity is manifested mostly in the  level of development of town and township enterprises.  Therefore, we must make all-out development of town and  township enterprises a strategic emphasis for development of the  rural economy and the entire national economy as well. We must  regard it as the key to increasing peasant income. Adherence to  a guiding policy of multiple wheel drives, multiple track  operations, highlighting strengths, rational dispersal,  step-by-step advance, and all-out development, no matter the  form of ownership and no matter the form of operation, so long  as it increases peasant income, and some long as it increases  local economic strength, everything should be done to encourage  development and to provide active support. Development of town  and township enterprises requires suiting general methods to  specific circumstances, and providing tailored guidance. In the  relatively economically backward southern mountain region, a  beginning should be made with the processing of agricultural and  sideline products, and rational use of resources, needed support  provided to quicken the pace of development in a planned way.  In the irrigated areas in which water is diverted from the  Huang He where economic conditions are relatively good,  particularly in places where the town and township enterprise  base is relatively good, the starting point should be somewhat  high. Efforts should be made to bring about a gradual change  from labor-intensive to capital-intensive and  technology-intensive industries, steadily improving product  quality and returns. Rural market towns and small cities are  the main places from which agricultural, sideline, and local  specialty products enter cities, and from which industrial wares  enter the countryside. They support rural secondary and  tertiary industries. We must hasten the building of rural  market towns and small cities and towns, encourage the peasants  to go into cities and towns to operate secondary and tertiary  industries, and we must draw up corresponding favorable policies  to increase the intensity of efforts in this regard. In this  way, we can enable small cities and towns to play a turnkey role  in the development of rural secondary and tertiary industries  for the opening of peasant employment avenues that increase  peasant income. In addition, we must channel surplus rural  manpower to shift into cities and towns and to flow across  jurisdictional lines. We must both encourage peasants to enter  market towns and small cities, and also permit the peasants to  enter large and medium-size cities under certain conditions so  that they can engage in secondary and tertiary industries more  securely, and have more secure employment channels.    5. Vigorous Fostering of Rural Markets To Guide the  Smooth Entry of the Peasants Into the Commodity Circulation  Realm. With the founding of the socialist market economy  system, the extent of peasant reliance on markets is bound to  become greater and greater, and peasants must enter the  circulation realm if they are to increase their income.  However, in Ningxia, the backwardness and incompleteness of  rural markets is extremely glaring. A powerful integrated  system for supplying the means of production and for promoting  the sale of farm products is lacking, and financial, technology,  labor, and information markets have yet to appear. This greatly  limits increase in peasant income. Therefore, the fostering of  rural markets has become an urgent need in development of the  rural economy to increase the peasants' income. The fostering  of rural markets must rely on the small cities and towns, the  advantages they offer in terms of geography, communications,  energy, technology, and location being used for further  development of country fair markets and specialized markets  centering around agricultural and sideline products. We must  energetically develop all sorts of wholesale markets, and  actively explore futures markets for the gradual formation of an  agricultural products system in which country fair markets are  the foundation, wholesale markets are the hub, and futures  markets are the vanguard. In addition, we must actively foster  and develop land, manpower, finance, technology, and information  markets. Only when a fairly complete rural market system exists  can the peasants be linked to the market economy and the  peasants be guided toward a smooth entry into the commodity  circulation realm, thereby being able to increase their income  consistently.    6. Truly Reduce Peasant Burdens To Protect Peasant  Interest in Production. Reducing the peasants' burdens is  a major economic and political issue for protecting the  peasants' interest in farming, safeguarding social order,  consolidating rural socialist political authority, and cementing  relations between the Party and the masses, and between the  cadres and the masses. We must resolutely abide by the State  Council's and our own regions applicable policy regulations for  reducing the peasants burdens, strictly control township  collection of fees and collective withholdings, not increase  peasant assessments on any pretext, and do all possible to  reduce peasant losses of benefits in every regard, making sure  to return to the peasant the benefits that belong to them in the  first place.

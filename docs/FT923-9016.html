			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Italy set to move step nearer to privatisation THE new Italian government's privatisation plans will overcome a big hurdle today when special shareholders' meetings of the four biggest public-sector groups approve their transformation into joint stock companies. The change in legal status is a crucial step towards the flotation of some, or all, of the groups. The companies include IRI, Italy's biggest public-sector holding, ENI, the state-owned energy and chemicals group, ENEL, the electricity generating authority, and INA, the state insurance agency. While approval for the change is not in doubt, the focus will be on the composition of the groups' boards of directors which are also up for renewal. The new boards should offer a clear indication of the balance of political forces within the government over privatisation. 'You'll have to count how many old faces move out and how many new ones come in,' said a senior supporter of privatisation in the government yesterday. 'If there are more new faces than old, it means we've succeeded.' However, that is not a foregone conclusion. Some executives who owe their jobs to party allegiances are resisting change. The Christian Democrats and the Socialists, the two biggest parties in Mr Giuliano Amato's coalition, are also divided. The composition of the boards had still not been decided last night. Observers, however, expect them to be slimmed down, giving representatives from the Treasury, now the companies' shareholder, much greater say. The board of directors of ENI, the biggest of the four, currently has 15 members. 'The new boards should be much smaller - 10 people at the most,' said one official. Officials expect the current, politically appointed, chairmen of the four companies to be reconfirmed. However, it is thought the mandates of the four  -Mr Franco Nobili at IRI, Mr Gabriele Cagliari at ENI, Mr Franco Viezzoli at ENEL, and Mr Lorenzo Pallesi at INA - may be cut from their present multi-year terms. Their powers may also be curtailed. Once the assemblies are over, bankers expect little movement on privatisation until October, by which time a six-member committee of bankers and economists, set up by the Treasury last week, will have presented its findings. 'Once we've received their suggestions, we'll put things in shape and decide how to proceed,' a senior official said. The pace may disappoint foreign bankers who have postponed their holidays in the hope of submitting privatisation proposals to Treasury officials. Mr Perio Barucci, the Treasury minister, has turned down all such meetings until he receives the privatisation committee's recommendations. 'Then the bankers will have their chance,' said the official. The government has already indicated its willingness to float more than 49 per cent of public-sector companies' shares - a virtually impassable barrier in the past. Flotation of IRI's Finmeccanica subsidiary and ENI's Agip and Snam operations is due to go ahead as planned later this year. However, ministers are considering sending a much stronger signal to the markets, possibly by disposing of the government's controlling stake in a big, prestigious state-owned company, such as one of the public-sector banks. The change in status should coincide with final approval in the Senate, the upper house of parliament, of the government's decree law which put the transformations into effect. Although changing to joint stock company status had been discussed at length by the previous government of Mr Giuliano Andreotti, execution has been one of the main achievements of Mr Amato. The positive economic effects of a national labour accord could push Italian interest rates down another 2.5 percentage points by the end of this year, a union leader said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Milan. Mr Sergio D'Antoni, general secretary of the CISL union, said such a drop in the Bank of Italy's official discount rate would shave some L40 trillion (million million) of interest payments off the government's budget deficit. Mr D'Antoni said that although the government had not made any promises or outlined any specific interest rate target in negotiations with unions to reform Italy's wage-indexation system last week, 'it was clear to everyone that it was one of the objectives'. 'We certainly weren't joking when we reached an agreement of that kind,' Mr D'Antoni said, referring to the unions' decision to accept the wage plan.</p>

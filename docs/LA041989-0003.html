			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL BOARD GRAPPLES WITH BLACK-LANGUAGE ISSUE  </P> <P> No one at Tuesday's school board meeting argued with the fact that too many  black students in San Diego city schools speak and read standard English  poorly.  </P> <P> But an uncertain Board of Education danced around the controversial issue of  whether such students should be helped by creating separate classes to teach  them standard English.  </P> <P> District administrators admitted that not enough is being done for black  students who come to school speaking a nonstandard English learned at home,  known as Ebonics, which most researchers now recognize as a separate oral  language with its own rules of grammar and structure.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Efforts Have Lagged Recently  </P> <P> But rather than special language training, which might involve pulling black  students out of regular classes for 30 minutes to an hour each day, the  administrators suggested a renewal of efforts to make teachers more aware of  the language gap. Those efforts, while first begun in 1979, have lagged  significantly among district priorities in recent years.  </P> <P> Language-arts administrator Jesse Perry argued that special pullout programs --  under way in Los Angeles, Richmond, Fresno and several other districts in the  state and nationally -- go against San Diego's integration philosophy and rely  too heavily on work sheets that emphasize grammatical exercises.  </P> <P> Trustee Shirley Weber found Perry's report inadequate, saying teachers need  specific strategies for moving black children from Ebonics to standard English,  not simply more workshops in sensitivity training where teachers are taught not  to criticize blacks for having a different oral language background.  </P> <P> Weber, a San Diego State University professor who has researched the Ebonics  issue, said that if structured second-language type programs such as those in  Los Angeles work to bridge the gap between home language and standard English,  they should be pursued. Black achievement, when taken as a group, falls far  below that of Asians, Caucasians and Latinos when measured on standardized  tests, and Weber cites the disparity week after week in calling for action.  </P> <P> "What is more important, the integration thing or getting kids to the point  where after the first or second grade they do not have difficulty" making the  switch between Ebonics and standard English? Weber asked.  </P> <P> "We take LEP (limited English-proficient) kids out of class every day for  special instruction. I don't want blacks to be the sacrificial lambs for  integration."  </P> <P> During the hourlong discussion, other board members appeared to accept Weber's  view that Perry's proposals are not enough as they heard more of what  constitutes "black English" and why it differs from regional dialects and other  language variants that do not have separate syntax and grammar from standard  English.  </P> <P> But they hesitated in endorsing efforts that would involve black students being  taught as a distinct group. Trustees Jim Roache and Ann Armstrong were both  </P> <P> bothered by pullout programs because, in Roache's words, "Someone would come  down here and say we have separate but equal."  </P> <P> Most educators today accept the existence of Ebonics as a legitimate oral  language, which has its roots in a common West African pidgin that slaves  developed to overcome differences in their tribal languages and to communicate  with one another and their English-speaking slave masters.  </P> <P> It is the predominant language among many urban blacks today and is used at  least some of the time by an estimated 80% of blacks -- not in business or  professional settings but informally at home and among friends.  </P> <P> Examples of black English phrasing include, "The boy, he be goin' to school."  "She cain't play till she do her homework." "I ate my toas', den I run to  school."  </P> <P> Most black students have a knowledge of a combination of black language and  standard English structures to varying degrees, and some are able to make the  transition to standard English for oral and written communication much easier  than others, according to Ebonics authorities such as Orlando Taylor of Howard  University in Washington.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fewer Bridges Today  </P> <P> But Weber said that though some black students in San Diego city schools can  make that transition, too many do not and end up as high school students who  cannot functionally write or read standard English.  </P> <P> When Roache asked Weber how she managed her own transition as a student, Weber  attributed her success to a combination of luck and the fact that she had black  teachers throughout her schooling "who knew how to help me make the bridge . .  . but that isn't true today" for black students.  </P> <P> And, Weber added to a question from colleague Kay Davis, she still uses Ebonics  in certain social situations, such as at times while talking with her children.  </P> <P> "You get to the point where you switch unconsciously, almost like coding,  without having to think about it. . . . The ability (to make the transition) is  tied to exposure, but often that is connected with" socioeconomic status, she  said.  </P> <P> Weber emphasized to board President Susan Davis that she is not suggesting that  Ebonics be taught similar to the way Spanish- or Vietnamese-speaking students  receive social studies or math in their native language while they learn  English.  </P> <P> "You couldn't teach (Ebonics) in a classroom even if you tried; it's not a  written language, it's not something you would want to learn," Weber said.  </P> <P> Roache told Perry he wants to see some "objective assessment of the needs in  the district. How many students may be out there? If there, we do have an  obligation, so what are we going to do to address curriculum needs? And is  there a curriculum out there we can use to do that?"  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto  Fujimori said today in Lima that Cuba does not pose a threat to  the Americas, and that an embargo against Cuba or against any  other country in the world is therefore unjustified.    Fujimori made this statement after his return from Colombia,  where he attended the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena  on 14 and 15 June.    Fujimori, who visited China and Japan before his visit to  Colombia, said that what Latin America is currently spending on  weapons should be invested in development.    Commenting on Peruvian domestic policy and former President  Alan Garcia, who has been in asylum in Colombia since June 1992,  Fujimori said: "I cannot accept an agreement with or even  negotiate with a person who destroyed the country."    Recently there has been conjecture about a possible  rapprochement between the government and the American Popular  Revolutionary Alliance (APRA), the party led by Alan Garcia, who  ruled Peru from 1985 to 1990.</p>

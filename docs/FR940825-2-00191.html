This priority proposes a program of research to promote greater access to emerging telecommunications technology by individuals who have communication disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The coming decade is likely to bring advances in the way people communicate over distances. Access to greater bandwidth in the telephone network will lead to new advances, new devices and new services, such as switched video, TV-phones, or voice-to-print (Hinton, OSEP Final Report, ``Advanced Technologies for Benefit to Persons with Sensory Disabilities,'' 1992). Already low-cost facsimile technology, answering machines, and voice mail are changing office communications. Computer-based information services abound, and telephones themselves are no longer standard. Persons with speech impairments are increasingly at a disadvantage with voice recognition and voice mail telecommunication systems because they are designed for standard speech which is clear and contains prosody information. The employment status, social, and family life of persons with disabilities could be affected by their access to advances in telecommunications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires private employers, State and local governments, employment agencies, labor unions, and joint labor-management committees to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities, including those with communication disabilities. The ADA also requires State and local governments and public accommodations to make available auxiliary aids and services available where necessary to ensure effective communication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, requires the Secretary, through the Director of the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, and the Administrator of the General Services Administration, to ``develop and establish guidelines for Federal agencies for electronic and information technology accessibility designed to ensure, regardless of the type of medium, that individuals with disabilities can produce information and data, and have access to information and data, comparable to the information and data, and access, respectively, of individuals who are not individuals with disabilities.'' Section 508 also provides that the guidelines ``shall be revised, as necessary, to reflect technological advances or changes.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

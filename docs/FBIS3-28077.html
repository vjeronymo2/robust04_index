			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yi Chong-hyon: "The Two Faces of the U.S.--the </F> Police and the Arms Dealer"]    [Text] The "world's police" that always talks about peace  and imposing sanctions on countries selling weapons, the United  States is, in fact, the greatest arms trader. The United  States' sensitivity to the export of weapons by other countries  is part of their sophisticated strategy to sell their "own  commodities."    The WALL STREET JOURNAL of 28 January reported that "since  the end of the Cold War, the United States has become the  greatest exporter of conventional weapons" and that "in  particular, the United States achieved record weapons sales of  $340 million last year." Weapons sold by "the police" have  seeped to third countries where disputes frequently take place  to become lethal weapons there.    The WALL STREET JOURNAL denounced the United States  regarding  this for "actively exporting weapons while urging other  countries to refrain from exporting weapons under the pretext of  world security."    Last year, the United States assumed a hard-line attitude  and  imposed trade sanctions on China for exporting missiles to  Pakistan. Even though China strongly denied the charge, world  opinion supported the "defense of peace" position of the United  States that strong measures be taken against suspected  arms-selling countries. Although an excuse, the cause of world  peace seemed plausible. However, according to the WALL STREET  JOURNAL's report, the United States sold a total of 484 missiles  in the five years from 1989 to 1992. This is almost eight times  the 63 missiles China exported.    It is unreasonable for the United States to strongly slander  China for arms sales which are so slight in comparison to its  own sales, and it is unreasonable for it to do so under the  pretext of peace while continuing its own sales.    It has been learned that arms dealers even manipulated  disputes for their own interests. The world is anxiously  watching the two faces --"police" and arms dealer--of the United  States.</p>

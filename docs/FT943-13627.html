			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Mayhew sparks N Ireland talks row Sharp differences have emerged between the British and Irish governments over whether the republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland is the key obstacle to the stalled peace process. The Irish government has responded with annoyance to an interview with Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in the Daily Telegraph yesterday in which he emphasised that the republic's territorial claim to the province was the central issue to be resolved in drafting a joint 'framework document' aimed at encouraging Northern Ireland's parties to return to the negotiating table. An Irish government spokesman emphasised that any new constitutional arrangement for the province had to be 'balanced'. He said: 'What we are seeking is a balanced constitutional accommodation as expressed in the (Downing Street) declaration, not some constitutional one-way street.' Last Friday in Brussels Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the British and Irish prime ministers, agreed to postpone a planned July summit until the autumn to allow more time for differences to be resolved. The political situation in the province is expected to be high on the agenda, with security, when Mr Major meets Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, and other senior UUP figures in London today. The meeting was portrayed at Westminster last night as the latest in a series of discussions with leaders of the province's main political parties. Mr Major met Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, last week. A meeting with Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, is understood to have been pencilled in for July 26. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said yesterday that he was 'surprised' at the comments attributed to Sir Patrick and did not agree that the republic's territorial claim was the central issue. He said a 'number of issues remain to be resolved, and all of those will have to be resolved together'. The Irish government has emphasised that the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, the basis of Westminster's rule over Northern Ireland, should be modified as a quid pro quo for modifying the claim. Mr Dermot Ahern, a prominent backbencher of Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail party and co-chairman of the Anglo-Irish joint parliamentary body, yesterday accused Sir Patrick of trying to 'cherry-pick' aspects of last December's Downing Street declaration.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Susanne Lintl: "Slovenia Is Banking on Austria's </F> EU Membership"]    [Text] In Ljubljana, President Thomas Klestil has noted  "great interest in 12 June," the day of European Union [EU]  referendum in Austria. EU membership was the main topic of  talks held by Klestil with his counterpart Milan Kucan at the  beginning of his visit to Slovenia on Wednesday [1 June]  morning. "President Kucan has indicated that this decision is  not only of importance for Austria. We are bearing  responsibility for the future course and fate of our neighboring  states," Klestil concluded. The Slovene side expects and  appreciates this responsibility. Klestil: "Milan Kucan said  that it is good when a child has a godfather at its side -- as  we are for the Slovenes."    President Klestil also voiced Austria's concerns about the  Krcko nuclear power plant near the Austrian border. He was  assured by Kucan that an early warning system for nuclear  accidents would be installed between Vienna and Ljubljana. A  group of experts is to work out the details of the agreement  soon.    Regarding the minority rights of the ethnic Slovenes in  Carinthia, which are laid down in Article 7 of the State Treaty,  Klestil emphasized that he regarded the State Treaty as being  fulfilled. "This, of course, does not mean that unsolved  minority issues will be solved on the basis of goodneighborly  relations." [as published]    In his talks with Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, President  Klestil, who is accompanied by Provincial Governors Josef  Krainer and Christof Zernatto, discussed a railroad agreement  between Austria and Slovenia. Vienna is mainly interested in  extending the line from Graz to Maribor and Koper to establish  an efficient link to the Adriatic coast. The 2.4-billion  schilling agreement should be signed within the next few weeks.</p>

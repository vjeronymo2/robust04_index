			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Macedonian Duties on Slovene </F> Imports"]    [Text] Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM] this week began charging two duties totaling 15  percent on the bulk of Slovene imports: a 7.5-percent levy and a  7.5-percent special duty designed to spread the tax burden.    The new duties apply to all classes of goods that make up  Slovenia's most significant exports to Macedonia:    -- furniture and other wooden products,    -- poultry,    -- paper and cardboard,    -- tires,    -- washing powders,    -- cosmetics,    -- household appliances.    This effectively means that the bilateral free trade  agreement signed in 1992 is no longer in force.</p>

To Be  Brought Up on Friday"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Rorschach, 2 Feb (ATS) -- The wreckage discovered  in Lake Constance on Tuesday evening [1 February] is that of the  Cessna 425 which disappeared nine days ago. The twin-jet plane  was identified by underwater cameras, the St. Gallen canton  police said on Wednesday in a press conference. The operation  to recover the plane will be carried out on Friday.  Preparations began on Wednesday.    The recovery work will be carried out with caution, in case  radioactive material is present within the wreckage, a  representative of the Swiss Alert Center explained. Experts  from the Paul Scherrer Institute of Wuerenlingen for the  monitoring of radiation are at the scene. However, it is very  unlikely that cesium will be found on board.  <H5>  Prague Rules Out Transport of Cesium </H5>   Bruno Fehr, chief of the St. Gallen criminal investigation  department, does not believe radioactive substances will be  discovered. In Prague, whence the Cessna came, an assurance has  been given that the customs checks found nothing suspicious.  Moreover, the two businessmen on board were certainly known for  their trade in rare metals but not radioactive metals. The  pilot's partner said she knew nothing of such a cargo.    According to Mr. Fehr, in addition to the police and the two  German businessmen, two Czech women were on board the plane when  it crashed. However, there is no certainty about that. The St.  Gallen police are focusing their efforts on identifying the  victims, the police chief explained. The investigation into the  radioactive metal and the activities of the businessmen is in  the hands of the German criminal investigation department in  Wiesbaden.  <H5>  No Bodies Detected </H5>   A camera from the Langenargen (Germany) Lacustrian Research  Institute transmitted pictures of the Cessna's registration  number -- D-IEFW -- at 1100 hours [1000 GMT]. However, it was  impossible to see whether there were bodies inside the plane  which is lying on its back.    Preparations for lifting the plane have already begun, Peter  Gruetter, commander of the St. Gallen canton police, explained.  Weather permitting, the wreckage will be brought to the surface  on Friday. A representative of the Federal Civil Aviation  Office also said that the Cessna from Prague, which was  preparing to land at Altenrhein, was due to take off again en  route for Paris.  <H5>  Mysterious Order </H5>   Several aspects of the investigation are still unresolved.  In  particular, it is not known why one of the businessmen told  Altenrhein airport that he would bring a money order worth more  than 4,000 francs. Moreover, investigations have been carried  out in cooperation with the Zurich-Kloten airport police,  following the emergence of rumors about the presence of  radioactive material in the duty-free goods depot.</p>

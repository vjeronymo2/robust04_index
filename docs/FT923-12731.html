			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Buoyant Unisys reports third profitable quarter UNISYS, the long-struggling and heavily debt-laden US computer manufacturer, yesterday continued its turnround by reporting a third consecutive profitable quarter and its highest gross profit margins in three years. The company reported net income of Dollars 105.4m, or 45 cents a share. That compared with a loss of Dollars 1.3bn, or Dollars 8.24 a share, a year ago when the company took Dollars 1.2bn of restructuring charges. Revenues dipped from Dollars 2.20bn to Dollars 2.09bn but the company said the earlier period included Dollars 63m of revenue from a subsidiary which has since been sold. Mr James Unruh, the chairman, said the results 'exceeded our expectations, with all major operating units meeting or exceeding their key goals for the quarter, despite a mixed economic environment. 'Second-quarter cash flow from operations exceeded Dollars 275m and the operating margin of 9.7 per cent was the highest in nearly four years.' The company, he added, was ahead of schedule in its plan to reduce costs and expenses by Dollars 800m by the end of this year. Operating expenses in the second quarter were 11 per cent below the same period of last year. Total debt net of cash declined by more than Dollars 250m during the quarter to Dollars 2.1bn. The company said orders declined slightly in the period, compared with a year ago, with strong gains in US information systems partly offset by a decline in European orders. Mr Unruh said the US information systems business had recorded its strongest second-quarter gain in orders in four years. 'However, we continue to remain cautious about economic conditions in Japan and Europe,' he added. For the six months the company reported net income of Dollars 153.7m, or 56 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 1.4bn. or Dollars 9.03 a share, last year.</p>

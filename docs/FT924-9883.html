			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (4): Cartel at the cross-roads - Neil Buckley on how a weakened Opec is responding to the New World Order GONE ARE the days when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries could hold the world's oil market to ransom. But it still plays a dominant role. The immediate Dollars 1 rise in world oil prices after Opec's May meeting decided to roll over its second quarter output ceiling provided ample demonstration of that. Some observers suggested this was a small piece of sabre-rattling ahead of June's Earth Summit in Rio, to show Opec's opposition to plans for a carbon tax. However, the cartel still has an unenviable capacity for internal disputes and for failing to do what it set out to do. What had been expected to be an easy meeting of its ministerial monitoring committee in Geneva in September ended with the second-largest producer, Iran, publicly dissenting from the agreement that Opec's market share in the fourth quarter of 1992 should be 24.2m b/d, excluding any increase in production by Kuwait. Meanwhile, its second-smallest producer, Ecuador, announced it was pulling out of full membership of the organisation and returning to associate membership status. The disagreements confused the oil market and helped to lessen the meeting's upward pressure on oil prices. Opinions differ about what may happen at Opec's next meeting on November 25. Some believe Iran will press hard for the meeting to address what is potentially the thorniest issue: how the cartel will handle the eventual return of Iraq to the oil export market. United Nations sanctions banned Iraq from exporting oil after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Since then, many of Opec's members have been pumping at close to capacity, while its biggest members have increased their output to make up for the shortfall in supply. Saudi Arabia has been the principal beneficiary, raising its output from 4.9m barrels a day in 1989, to close to 8.4m b/d in recent months, an increased market share it will be loath to relinquish. Iran, by contrast, has only raised its output from 2.8m b/d to 3.5m b/d. The republic has made repeated statements about the increase in its production capacity, which it says is already 3.8m b/d and will reach 4.5m b/d next year. It may also press for Opec to adopt some kind of general principle in November on how it will respond to the return of Iraq. Mr Joe Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, believes that while the November meeting may discuss Iraq, it is highly unlikely to agree anything. 'Why rock the boat? There is no need to deal with the issue until it actually hits them.' In the absence of public agreements or disputes about Iraq, November's meeting is expected to have little impact on oil prices. Most analysts expect it to adopt a similar agreement to that reached in September, referring not to an 'output ceiling' but instead to a projected 'market share' for the first quarter of 1993, likely to be unchanged from the last meeting, or to show a modest rise to between 24.5m and 24.8m b/d. This would reflect the reality of how Opec now operates. Mr Stanislaw says the September meeting established that Opec has adopted a market-oriented approach, which is based on a rising market for Opec oil, unlike the situation in the 1980s when Opec's market shrank. While the numbers Opec announced at the end of its meetings were once output ceilings, they have in effect become production floors, below which output will not drop, but with the tacit agreement that output may increase to meet market demand. Analysts point out that most Opec members are in debt and are keen to maximise revenues. However, many believe it is the biggest producer, Saudi Arabia, that is really driving Opec's policy. Mr Hisham Nazer, Saudi oil minister, told journalists in September he would not talk about the kingdom's production plans but stressed these were part of a careful, long-term strategy. Analysts believe this strategy is to maintain its share of Opec production, and ensure there is enough oil to meet demand, and avoid price spikes that would damage the world economy or risk lowering oil's share of the energy market by prompting consumers to switch to cheaper fuels. Within these constraints, however, Saudi Arabia is happy to get whatever price it can for oil. It wants to provide, in the words of Mr Stanislaw, 'enough oil to satisfy demand but not so much that it prohibits producers from gaining that extra dollar or two that consumers do not seem to mind paying'. This would explain Saudi Arabia's behaviour at Opec's May meeting when it failed to make its expected call for a 1m b/d increase in the output ceiling  - a move which boosted oil prices and prompted some observers to talk of a 'policy change' marking the kingdom's transformation into a price hawk. Mr Nazer warned in September against becoming obsessed with the Dollars 21 a barrel objective for the Opec basket of crudes  - adopted in July 1990  - saying this was a 'reference' price, not a 'target'. However, he seems happy for the price to move towards Dollars 21 provided this is supported by fundamentals. Indeed, if reports are true that Mr Nazer rejected demands from Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, for a cut in Opec output, because he thought this was not necessary to push prices towards Dollars 21, recent analysts' forecasts suggest he may have been right. In the disagreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, however, may lie the seeds of a wider split concerning Opec's role. If Saudi Arabia sees it essentially as a kind of market regulator, it is clear from Iran's accusations after the meeting that other other countries were 'not serious' about pushing up prices  - and the likely departure of Ecuador  - that other, poorer members, see things differently. For them, Opec is a cartel whose job is to manipulate production to achieve a certain price. Ecuador's ostensible reason for leaving is that it is unhappy with its quota and wants to increase oil revenues to help pay off its Dollars 13bn foreign debt. It may also be wondering if its hopes for economic improvement would be better served by other organisations such as the International Monetary Fund, where not being an Opec member could strengthen its negotiating position. The danger for Opec is the 'domino effect': other smaller  - and even larger  - members starting to question the benefits of membership. But it could perhaps withstand losing some members. 'The only people that really matter in Opec are the big producers. It has been an organisation of six members and not 13 for some time now,' says Mr Vahan Zanoyan of the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington research and advisory group. But some analysts argue that the smaller members play an important role in building consensus and support for different points of view, and diluting the impact of personal differences. There may, however, be countries willing to replace any that leave. The former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan has already expressed interest in joining, and there is speculation that Kazakhstan, or even Russia, might follow suit, offering an intriguing vision of how Opec may respond to the New World Order.</p>

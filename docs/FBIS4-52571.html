			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Loyal Party Cell Movement"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  describes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's historic work  "Let Us Strengthen Party Cells" as a highly important guideline  in strengthening the party cells as required by the revolution  in its new, higher stage of development, immensely increasing  the fighting efficiency of the Workers' Party of Korea and  effecting a revolutionary upswing in socialist construction.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is quoted as saying:    "After the training course held at the proposal of the  Central Committee of the party for the party cell secretaries  from all parts of the country in 1991, a vigorous movement was  launched to create loyal party cells throughout the whole party  under the slogan, `Let us make all the party cells loyal cells  ', and their militant function and role have been enhanced as  never before."    Comrade Kim Chong-il's work "Let us strengthen party cells"  fully encompasses the principles in making all party cells  remain unfailingly loyal to the party and the leader, ranging  from proper party life, guidance and work with the masses to the  enhancement of the role of party cell secretaries.    The paper says in a by-lined article:    The loyal party cell movement has been waged vigorously  throughout the party over the last three years. As a result, a  new change has taken place in the ideological and moral traits  of our party members, the singlehearted unity of the leader, the  party and the masses further consolidated and a constant  innovation and upswing effected in socialist construction.    Our party members think they can neither live nor make  revolution apart from the embrace of the dear leader, and they  are all determined to become vanguard fighters and rifles and  bombs to defend the party and the leader with their lives.    Amid the vigorous loyal party cell movement over the last  three years, tens of thousands of party cell members wrote  letters pledging loyalty to the dear leader, and he replied to  the members of a many party cells.    In the course of making loyal party cells, our party  members'  revolutionary spirit of absolutizing and unconditionally  implementing the party policies has risen beyond comparison.    Today the entire party members and other working people are  constantly working new miracles and performing feats in all  sectors of socialist construction, with the firm belief that  their leader, their party, their chuche idea and their socialism  are the best.</p>

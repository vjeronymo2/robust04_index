			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Sema group One can only stand back and admire the elegant way in which Paribas has effectively transferred half its 39 per cent stake in the Anglo-French computer services group Sema to France Telecom. Last week's transaction was particularly sensitive because it had to be carefully constructed so as not to offend UK Takeover Panel and Stock Exchange rules. Thanks to the creation of a joint holding company for the stake - 50.1 per cent owned by Paribas, 49.9 per cent owned by France Telecom - there is no question of control of Sema having changed hands. The two investors' obvious interest in acquiring Schneider's 10.5 per cent Sema stake is accommodated by a six year put option which falls neatly within the Panel's regulations on creeping control. The proposed asset swap between France Telecom and Sema, meanwhile, does not breach the Stock Exchange rule on connected parties and capital transactions since France Telecom is not directly interested in a 10 per cent stake. Paribas and France Telecom - notwithstanding Paribas' apparent intention to divest - insist they will pay for any Schneider shares which come their way in exact proportion to their interests in the holding company. No doubt Paribas has a long term commitment to Sema. Nevertheless minority shareholders would probably be happier if they had more precise details of the prices negotiated between Paribas and France Telecom, and between these two parties and Schneider. If the put option is fully exercised, after all, the joint company will end up within a whisker of 50 per cent.</p>

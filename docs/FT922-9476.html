			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Changes to bankruptcy and parole - Scotland THE GOVERNMENT is proposing a light and relatively uncontroversial legislative programme for Scotland. The first of two bills is designed to close loopholes in bankruptcy legislation. Since the 1985 Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act, many debtors use sequestration to solve their debt problems. A debtor transfers his assets to a trustee, who then petitions for sequestration and for his appointment as permanent trustee under the 1985 Act. As the debtor's estate has few assets, the fees for the trustee managing the estate are met from public funds, at a total cost in 1991-92 of Pounds 18.5m. The government proposes that new powers be given to the accountant in bankruptcy (a civil servant) to administer sequestrations. The other measure will reform parole arrangements. Prisoners serving sentences of less than four years would be released after serving half their sentence instead of two-thirds as present. Prisoners serving sentences of four years or more would be eligible for parole at half-sentence instead of one-third. Prisoners who commit another offence between release and the end of their sentence would be recalled to serve the remaining part of their term. The legislation would bring Scottish practice roughly into line with changes in England and Wales under the 1991 Criminal Justice Act. A BILL will promote the use of Welsh in Wales by requiring public sector bodies to set out schemes for providing services in Welsh, and by establishing a statutory Welsh Language Board.</p>

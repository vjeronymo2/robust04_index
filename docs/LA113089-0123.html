			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATO MINISTERS SAY RISKS REMAIN, REAFFIRM NEED FOR STRONG DEFENSE  </P> <P> Defense ministers of the Western Alliance on Wednesday reaffirmed the need for  a strong defense. They acted at the close of a two-day meeting that concerned  itself mainly with the rapid changes taking place in Eastern Europe and reports  of a projected reduction in U.S. troops in Western Europe.  </P> <P> The officials, representing the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, said political developments in the Warsaw Pact countries have  presented the West with "new opportunities" for forging a lasting peace in  Europe.  </P> <P> But they added that potential risk is involved, because the Soviet Union has  retained its military capability.  </P> <P> Underlying the commitment to Western defenses was uncertainty about U.S.  military plans. There have been reports that in the years ahead, the Bush  Adminstration will reduce by as much as two-thirds its forces in Western  Europe.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney sidestepped the issue at a press conference  Wednesday by promising that the United States would make no reductions without  consulting its partners in the alliance.  </P> <P> The reports of a U.S. troop reduction have confused some allied planners  because U.S. troop levels are regarded as a bellwether of what will happen to  their own defense budgets.  </P> <P> "It is difficult," a Dutch official said, "for us to tell our public that we  need to keep paying for defense when they hear that the United States is going  to reduce its forces."  </P></p>

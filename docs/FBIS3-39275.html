			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Christophe Chatelot in Bucharest: "Romania: </F> Paris and Bucharest Sign Agreement on Illegal Immigrant  Repatriation"]    [Text] On Friday 11 February in Bucharest, the French and  Romanian Foreign Ministries signed a repatriation agreement  concerning Romanian nationals staying illegally in France.    Both parties have agreed, among other things, on the  criteria  to be used to determine Romanian citizenship of "indesirables"  who have discarded their identity papers to avoid being turned  away. In return, Romanian authorities have asked France to  simplify the visa delivery procedure for Romanian businessmen.    Officially, some 3,000 applications for refugee status have  been submitted to the French authorities by Romanian nationals.  However, "this figure does not give an accurate picture of the  actual numbers of illegal aliens," say French authorities.    For comparison purposes, 23,000 Romanian illegals have been  repatriated from Germany in the last few months as part of an  agreement comparable to the one concluded with France; Bucharest  already has similar agreements with Sweden, Austria, Poland, and  the Czech Republic.    According to immigration figures of the International  Migration Office (IMO), 9 percent of Romanians over 15 years of  age want to leave Romania. In 1993, Western countries only took  in 18,000.</p>

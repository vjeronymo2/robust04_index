Borgstrom, Director, Office of NEPA Oversight, EH&hyph;25, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, D.C. 20585, (202) 586&hyph;4600 or 1&hyph;800&hyph;472&hyph;2756. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In January 1991, the goal of the Reconfiguration program was, as it is now, to make the Complex smaller, less diverse, and less costly to operate. At the time, the projected production levels were much smaller than historic levels, but much larger than they are today. The document that provided the framework for the original proposal was the January 1991 Reconfiguration Study. That document was the result of many months of effort by a task force which thoroughly reviewed the status and capabilities of the weapons complex against projected future requirements. As a result of that effort, the Department envisioned that the future Complex would consist of fewer sites, and that missions might be relocated to achieve consolidation, greater efficiency, and significant long-term cost savings. Indeed, as a result of the Secretary's decision last year approving the nonnuclear consolidation proposal (which had been separated from the original Reconfiguration PEIS effort), weapons complex functions will be terminated at three sites and significant cost savings will be achieved within a short period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the Reconfiguration PEIS was to establish the locations for the future weapons complex missions. It was envisioned that, once future mission locations were established through the PEIS process, project-specific environmental analyses would follow the PEIS and cover in detail the projects necessary to implement the PEIS decisions at each site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within the Reconfiguration PEIS scope, potential relocation and consolidation of the ``nuclear'' missions of the complex (i.e., plutonium and uranium component fabrication and processing, weapons assembly and disassembly, tritium supply and recycling, and fissile materials storage) were being analyzed. In order to relocate any of these missions at the assumed levels of production, major new construction would have been required, entailing significant (billions of dollars) ``up-front'' cost with a ``pay-back'' period significantly longer than for nonnuclear consolidation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the end of the Cold War, the projected long hiatus in the need for new nuclear weapons production, and the budget constraints that are anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future, the framework presented in the January 1991 Reconfiguration Study no longer fits current circumstances or supports any realistic proposal for reconfiguration of the nuclear weapons complex. Therefore, the Department intends to separate the Reconfiguration proposal into two parts, and will prepare a PEIS on each part. The first PEIS is the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS, which will address the need for tritium. The second is the Stockpile Stewardship and Management PEIS, which will address the rest of the complex.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist in the development of a Stockpile Stewardship and Management proposal, the Department intends to involve stakeholders in early 1995 through a meeting in advance of formal scoping. The goal of this approach is to enable stakeholders to have an active role in developing the Stockpile Stewardship and Management proposal, rather than reacting to a proposal developed solely by the Department. The Department expects to develop a proposal after this initial meeting, and to issue a Notice of Intent before public scoping meetings later in 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department currently has no capability for the production of tritium, which decays at a rate of approximately five percent per year, and which is required for every active weapon in the stockpile. Current projections indicate that new tritium is required to be available in the 2011&hyph;2015 time frame. Depending upon the alternative selected, it could take up to fifteen years or more for a tritium source, once selected, to begin producing tritium. Not only is planning for a new, assured tritium supply required to begin now to meet projected stockpile requirements, but the Department must meet a statutory deadline of March 1, 1995, to issue a PEIS addressing tritium supply alternatives. Therefore, the Department intends to separate the tritium supply and recycling alternatives from the future Stockpile Stewardship and Management proposal. The following discussion outlines the history of the Reconfiguration program, and the current proposal for tritium supply and recycling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Original Reconfiguration Plan (February 1991 to July 1993)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> An NOI to prepare a PEIS for Reconfiguration of the Nuclear Weapons Complex was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5590). That NOI proposed to study the options presented in the Nuclear Weapons Complex Reconfiguration Study (DOE/DP&hyph;0083) of January 1991. A series of 15 public scoping meetings were held around the country to solicit comments regarding the Reconfiguration proposal. At that time, alternatives for a new tritium supply facility were being evaluated in a separate New Production Reactor (NPR) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In November 1991, however, in response to nuclear weapons stockpile reductions which delayed the need for a new tritium supply facility, the then Secretary of Energy announced that the analysis of NPR alternatives would be incorporated into the Reconfiguration PEIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An IP for the Reconfiguration PEIS was published in February 1992. The IP summarized the comments received during scoping, including incorporation of the NPR analysis into Reconfiguration, described the scope of the Reconfiguration program, the alternatives that were to be evaluated, and the methodology for preparing the PEIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

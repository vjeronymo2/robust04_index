			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Total launches feasibility study for second refinery Total, the French oil company, yesterday launched a feasibility study for the construction of a second refinery unit to make up to 50,000 tonnes a year of the ETBE 'green fuel' additive out of surplus crops, writes David Buchan in Paris. The company had already started, in July, a study for a joint project with Eridania Beghin-Say, the food company, and the French associations of wheat and sugar beet growers to build a first refining unit of 50,000 tonnes a year of the additive, which can replace lead as an octane-enhancer in petrol and is seen as an increasingly useful outlet for French farm surpluses. Total's partners in the second project, which would also be in one of the oil company's existing refineries in Normandy or northern France, are the beet and wheat growers, plus the Ethanol Union, a group of 19 distillers of ethanol from sugar. Total said yesterday that it would next month be making a final decision on the two projects, which are roughly estimated at costing about FFr50m (Pounds 5.7m) each. If both projects get the green light, Total's biocarburant output might eventually overtake that of its French rival, Elf-Aquitaine, whose Feyzin refinery near Lyons currently has a capacity to turn out 75,000 tonnes of ETBE a year. But Total warned that it first wanted some long-term assurance from the French government that the present tax exemption for biocarburants, first introduced in the 1992 budget, would be maintained for the life of its ETBE units.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 2 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban President Fidel  Castro announced that among the measures to be implemented for  the country's economic recovery is an increase of electricity  rates because of the excessive rise in consumption.    This measure was announced by the Cuban president during the  close of a special session of the National Assembly of the  People's Government (ANPP) (parliament) convened to review and  find solutions to the economic crisis facing the country.    There is no other option; in Havana alone, the consumption  of  electricity has increased 24 percent because of the use of  electric stoves due to the lack of other fuels, he said. He  added, however, that the government will not rest a minute until  it finds a solution to this situation.    As for the increase of tobacco prices, the president asked  for prudence and that estimates be made before the application  of the measure because of its effect on the population.    During the inauguration of the event the day before, Finance  Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez recommended an increase in  cigarette prices in a report to the ANPP, which could provide  the government with 2 billion pesos in taxes per year, (a peso  is equivalent to the dollar at the official exchange rate).    Fidel Castro pointed out that the decisions to be adopted in  this area are aimed at overcoming the current crisis, which he  compared to the 10-year war period of 1868-78, the first Cuban  attempt to militarily achieve independence from Spain.    In this regard, he pointed out that even though many  considered it impossible, four years after the collapse of the  socialist bloc, "here is Cuba, in the Caribbean, and 90 miles  from the United States."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview With Seiichi Toshida, director general of the </F> Research Bureau, Economic Planning Agency (EPA), on 17 December  1993; place not given: "A Turning Point for Leading  Industries...."]    [Text] Perceptions Worse Than Reality    [KANKAI] Speaking from the standpoint of reading business  trends, I am afraid this year [1993] has been a very difficult  one for you: in June, for example, you declared that the  recession had bottomed out, and yet in November the word  "recovery" once again disappeared from your monthly economic  report. I wish you'd begin by commenting on the point I've just  raised.    [Toshida] It isn't just this year; after all, it has been  that way since the year before last. Just this November, we  took the liberty of making a sort of tentative conclusion that  "the economy had peaked in April 1991," which means that two and  a half years have elapsed since the peak. This year, all of us,  both in and outside the government, started off with an  expectation that the economy would get on the recovery track  beginning in the fall. In early spring, a view gained ground  that things were indeed moving in the direction that seemed to  bear out our earlier expectation.    It was in that context that in June we took a look at the  overall situation as existed at the time and came up with an  assessment that somehow the economy would not deteriorate any  more than it already had and that things would get back on the  road to a slow recovery starting in the fall as we had expected  earlier. At that time, as things stood, there were some  reasonable bases to our assessment: the so-called stock  adjustment and inventory adjustment were making considerable  progress; in June, a supplementary budget was adopted for new  comprehensive economic measures, the practical impact of which  seemed certain to be felt in earnest beginning in the fall; and  even the problem of bad assets among financial institutions was  being dealt with--sort of--by a clear initiative to encourage  the banks to aggressively write off such bad assets. In that  sense, we had the feeling that we were gradually getting a  handle on those problems then facing us.    In reality, however, we ended up facing a situation totally  unexpected--you might call it a case of Murphy's Law, which is  omnipresent lately: "No sooner had we declared the bottoming out  of the recession than the economy took another turn for the  worse." I think the rising yen was the biggest factor after  all, but what made it worse was that we had a cool summer with a  long rainy season, which resulted in a bad rice crop. As a  result, it became clear that the scenario we had  envisioned--that the economy would get on a recovery track  beginning the fall--was not going to materialize.    That's why in November we dropped from the monthly economic  report our earlier prediction of gathering momentum for a  recovery, the prediction which we had held to during the summer  with expectations.    In that sense, what was difficult was not just our work;  rather, I think it was the not-so-simple economic movement that  made our work correspondingly difficult. I also think that this  view is shared by those in the private-sector businesses as well.    [KANKAI] The "QE" [Quick Estimate] (national income  statistics bulletin) came out just the other day for the months  July through September, the period you called "a cool summer  with a long rainy season." The report painted a picture which,  I should say, was somewhat better than what had been  anticipated: contrary to general expectations, the report showed  a fairly high rate of growth for that particular period. I  suspect that from this report some could draw a conclusion that  the real economy might not have been so bad after all.    [Toshida] I think we are dealing with a question of  yardsticks--the standard by which we decide "what is the range  that is bad." "Good is when Japan's economy itself is in the  plus territory; bad is when it is in the minus territory"--if  this is the standard by which we measure things, obviously we  could say that 2-percent growth isn't bad. But the thing is,  the April-June quarter had negative growth, and what gain there  was in the July-September priod was barely enough to make up for  it. So, if you average it out, the conclusion is that the  economy was hovering near the bottom just as we had anticipated;  therefore, it cannot be said that the July-September performance  was anything particularly good. But from the standpoint of  those who had noisily predicted that the bottom would fall out  of the economy, the actual performance in the July-September  period may very well be rated as having exceeded expectations.    The 2-percent growth may be given its due appraisal if it  had  served as a catalyst toward firming up the economic base to  bring about better conditions beginning in the fall; in reality,  however, while the 2-percent growth was in progress, the reading  of business conditions by companies themselves and consumer  confidence kept on cooling off disproportionately to the actual  state of the economy. And it is these negative psychological  factors that have been affecting the real economic activities  during the October-December period and will continue to do so in  the days ahead. This has been the trend.    In the eyes of the general public, the state of the economy  must have seemed worse than it actually was, especially if such  psychological aspects were also taken into account; yet,  regrettably, I believe the economy has been lacking the strength  to negate such psychological cooling-off effects.  <H5>  Industrial Production Holds the Key to Business Recovery </H5>   [KANKAI] Looking at the factors directly underlying business  conditions, I have the feeling that not everything there is  totally negative. In your process of studying economic trends  ahead, what is it that you are watching most carefully in terms  of indexes or indicators that are key to your discerning a turn  toward recovery?    [Toshida] To put it plainly, whether or not there is a clear  sign of an upward move in industrial production--this, I think,  is the key. Industrial production registered the worst  single-month decline in October. Subsequently, it zigzagged  during November and December, following a torpid trend. If only  it begins to show an unmistakable upward trend, even little by  little, I believe it will have salutary ripple effects on other  sectors of the economy. As to the reason for the stagnancy in  industrial production, it clearly boils down to low levels of  shipment and weak demand. On the demand side, there are many  influencing factors, including the housing and public investment  indexes, both of which look bright at the moment; I think  industrial production, more than anything else, provides an  early indicator that reflects the aggregate impact of all these  factors that govern demand.    So, we watch production for a clue to the immediate trend,  but it is employment we pay attention to when we are thinking  about the conditions a little bit more into the future. The  reason is this: If the employment picture is such that  consumption is negatively affected by it, it is bound to impact  on the levels of factory shipments and consumer demand, the two  factors which I've just mentioned. That's why, as a matter of  approach, we judge the current picture by production. But I  think the question of employment adjustment will inevitably come  up when we are to look at the near-term future outlook.    [KANKAN] Employment is a lagging index, is it not? I gather  what you are saying is that you need to watch the employment  picture quite closely because of its effect on consumpiton.    [Toshida] That is correct. Let's take a look at the demand  side of the picture: In the past, when all was said and done,  demand was given the initial push by exports and public  investment; only when that initial phase was clearly proving  effective did the next phase--plant and equipment investment and  consumption--come into play. Speaking of consumption: again in  the past, because consumption as a whole was being supported at  its base, rarely did it fall by any drastic measure. This time  around, however, demand could not count on exports, for one  thing; then on the consumption side, too, unlike the tendency of  the past when consumption seldom nosedived, sluggishness is the  notable feature.    Moving on to the third element which is plant and equipment  investment: This is being affected negatively by the prospect  that attempts by business firms to dispose of their excess  property holdings, such as office buildings and other  structures, will be a time-consuming proposition; thus, not much  can be expected of this element in the near term. Consequently,  a popular view now is that it is essential for consumption to  provide a measure of firm support to demand. It is in this  connection that I believe the impact of the employment picture  on consumer confidence may very well hold an important key to  this question.    As we touched on at the beginning, what changed the picture  between June and the fall was this: Consumer confidence, and  business psychology to a lesser degree, showed some improvement  around June, but then it began cooling off once again in the  fall. As for the reason, I think it was a sense of uneasiness  touched off by the fear of spreading employment adjustment or  personnel cutback. In this sense, when we talk about the  employment index we don't simply mean the jobless rate or the  ratio of effective labor demand to effective labor supply; what  really affects consumer confidence, I believe, is the question  of how widespread and how deep are these personnel reductions.  <H5>  A Structural Turnabout of Japan's Economy--Pros and Cons </H5>   [KANKAI] The view attributing the current recession phase to  two factors--the effect of the bubble's collapse and a cyclical  force--has been around for some time now, but lately another  view, which goes beyond that, seems to be gaining ground,  pointing to the possibility that Japan's economy may be faced  with a structural turning point. But the question is whether it  is indeed at a turning point or not. Let's say it is, then my  question is, what are the areas must one observe closely in  order to be able to come to such a conclusion?    [Toshida] This is an extremely difficult question; for one  thing, I think it can reasonably be argued that a structural  turning point is at hand. In any event, the crux of the  question lies in the industrial sector. There is a view that  the automobile industry and the electric machinery industry,  which have been the leading industries thus far, could be at a  turning point of sorts. Some see this as a problem arising from  the strong yen. Although there is a school of thought that, had  it not been for the strong yen, both of these industries  would've been able to make it out all right, when it comes to  the question of their strength to pull the nation's economic  growth, I am afraid they will no longer be as strong as they  have been in the past 10 years or so. What kind of industries  will be leading the Japanese economy in the days ahead? This, I  think, is going to become a question of increasing importance.    There is another aspect to the question of structural  turnabout. That is, some seem to think that various systems  within the Japanese economy may have reached their limits. In  some sense, this is a question of degree. There is no denying  that the systems have gradually become antiquated and therefore  need to be repaired; still, until two or three years ago, the  popular view had been that the Japanese-style systems may be  superior. Internationally, if anything, there clearly remains a  strong tendency to try to learn and adopt the Japanese-model  systems. Given this circumstance, it somehow seems too hasty  for the originator to say that all of these systems should be  discarded and replaced with something else; this is why I  believe it behooves us to give the question a little more  thought. In general terms, if for instance there are too many  regulations, of course those things ought to be rectified, but  to say just for that reason that the Japanese economic system as  a whole is bad would be.... Such an argument, I am afraid, would  make those countries trying desperately to study and adopt the  Japanese system feel that we are pulling the rug from under them.    In last year's Economic White Paper, we gave major  points of this question an analytical once-over, which did not  lead to a conclusion that the Japanese-model system as a whole  had better be changed. The picture that emerged from our  analysis is this: That each of the segments of our economic  system has its own historical background, which makes it  sensible to give them partial repairs while retaining their  bases; that not all mountains can be made to look like Mt.  Fuji--some may look like this way and others that way, but all  of them are linked and integrated at the bottom. There is no  way one can draw a conclusion that the whole system had better  be changed by shifting from one mode to another. It is in this  connection that one gets an impression that perhaps the drastic  impact of the bubbble's collapse somehow got mixed up with the  argument for a structural changeover.    [KANKAI] I touched on the structural question because you  raised the issue of structural reform in your World  Economic White Paper for this year. Obviously,  circumstances are different for each country, but my impression  is that you are analyzing this issue based on the premise that  not just Japan but all other countries must come to grips with  the question of post-Cold War economic order and global economy.    [Toshida] As far as that goes, following the successful  conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT trade negotiations,  Japan has already done a quite a bit in opening up and improving  the transparency of its domestic markets. The times are such  that we need to take those steps. In this connection, that we  are faced with the need for structural reform to accommodate  these changes is most typically reflected in the case of rice.  In that sense, I think your point is well taken.    Still, if that line of thinking and the subject of  short-term  recession are hastily linked together in the manner of  short-circuiting, I am afraid it will create misunderstandings  on the question of structural reforms that are a matter of  medium- and long-term concern. If you say business conditions  will not improve without structural reforms, you are apt to  paint an extremely pessimistic picture. Some may take it to  mean that no improvement can be expected for a period of years.  It may also lead to another kind of misunderstanding--that  implementing structural reform is useless or may do more harm  than good to the business situation. I think it behooves us to  consider structural reform correctly and pretty much as a  medium- and long-term proposition and to accept the fact that  its effects, too, will only be felt over the medium and long  terms.    Without question we will have to undertake structural  reform,  but to say that business conditions will never improve without  it or that it will have nothing but negative impact on business  is, I think, a case of going too far in mixing up the subject of  business conditions with the medium- and long-term structural  question.  <H5>  Will Listen More to Private-Sector Views </H5>   [KANKAI] At present the EPA, of course, is evaluating  business conditions on the basis of all kinds of indicators. In  this connection, I am sure you are aware of the presence of a  school of thought that has, for quite some time now, been  saying, among other things, that the economy is shifting from  goods to services. I suspect that some in this school may be  wondering whether the indicators being followed by the EPA might  not be giving too much weight to goods and too little to  services. What is your feeling on this? Do you, for instance,  see the need for reviewing your selection of indicators?    [Toshida] It is very difficult to seize, in a timely  fashion,  the trends in the service sector, and this is clearly due to the  limited availability of data. This is why I think we ought to  make up for the lack of data on the service sector by such means  as holding hearings. It so happens, however, that in the  current situation, as you know, the nonmanufacturing sector,  too, is not doing very well. But during the high-yen slumps of  the past, even if the manufacturing sector was doing poorly, the  nonmanufacturing sector was doing well; so, it was possible to  point to the nonmanufacturing or service sector and say that the  overall picture was such and such. Today, perhaps to a lesser  degree, the nonmanufacturing sector, too, is behaving generally  the same way as is the manufacturing sector; my sense,  therefore, is that the point you raised is not causing much of a  problem to our grasping of the business trend.    In any event, looking back, I believe we have learned quite  a  bit from the development related to the so-called bubble  economy, especially its impact on the financial sector, for  example.    [KANKAI] You have not reached the point where you feel you  should reexamine, for example, the specific items covered by the  DI (diffusion index), or have you?    [Toshida] Of course that is one of the things we will have  to  do, but my feeling is that it might be better to wait until  business conditions improve a little more and everyone is in a  calmer frame of mind before we take such steps. But we are  continuing our basic studies: for instance, we have requested  the Business Cycle Base Dates Determination Committee, which has  been practially decommissioning itself after each time it  completed the job of determing the peak and trough of a business  cycle in the past, to make itself a standing group because we  would like groups such as this to serve as the forums for  continuous debate. It is always too late to fuss over the  indicators' being good or bad when business conditions have  already become dubious; it is like trying to figure out how to  make a rope after.... This is why even members of this committee  themselves are saying, "Surely it is a question worth asking:  Wouldn't it be a good idea for us to meet regularly to keep an  eye on business trends and to discuss the modality of economic  indicators while the situation is still relatively stable?"    [KANKAI] Just the other day--I believe it was in  November--for the stated purpose of listening to the voices of  outsiders, a businessmen/economists forum was set up as your  personal advisory body. Trying to figure out where exactly an  organ of this nature fits in, I am wondering whether listening  more closely to outside voices is your only reason for having it  or if you have something else in mind.    [Toshida] In the private sector, the so-called think tanks  have achieved a great deal of progress and growth; there are  quite a few of them around, all working very hard and publishing  the results of all kinds of analyses they conduct. Looking  back, in the old days--some 20-30 years ago--the EPA's Research  Bureau, acting to some degree as if it had a monopoly of the  market for economic research, used to handle that kind of work.    Now, however, the bureau has many competitive counterparts  sprung up in the private sector. So, a thought has occurred to  us which, if I may explain at the risk of being misconstrued,  goes like this: Would it not make sense if we tried to let these  outside gurus teach us some of their ideas? After all it used  to be.... We were the ones who provided all the ideas, so there  is no reason why we shouldn't be on the receiving end for a  change. Basically, we want them to teach us some fresh ideas  that have escaped us and therefore will be a pleasant surprise  to us. I believe it is a good idea if possible to let people  with different views debate various issues which we present to  them.    In this sense, what I have in mind is not the normal  deliberative council process, in which the council's view is  "solicited" on an idea or proposal formulated and presented by  the secretariat. Rather, I want to see the forum's participants  truly face one another with different opinions so that we can  listen to their debate and enjoy instructional benefits from it.  This is my aim. Take forecasting, for example: as you know,  some see the outlook bullish, others bearish. What is the  difference in their standpoints that lead them to come up with  different forecasts? I intend to ask the forum to take up this  question. Not just the question of forecasting but other  questions as well, such as the question of how to come to grips  with the problem of bad assets, because I believe there are  different ways of looking at these questions. I think it would  be nice if the forum taught us not just different options, but  also the different arguments behind them.  <H5>  Recovery of the U.S. Economy--Premature? </H5>   [KANKAI] Because we touched on the global economy earlier,  let me ask you how you see the current state of the U.S.  economy. Also, in view of the extraordinary amount of attention  the United States is paying to Asia of late, which was evident  at the APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] meetings, I  would like to hear your views on Asian economies.    [Toshida] The aspects of the globlal economy which we have  to  keep an eye on are widening more and more, creating a  non-too-easy task for us. It used to be that we considered the  global economy as something we looked at as a prelude to our  consideration of the future direction of Japan's economy; now,  however, when it comes to subject matters such as the APEC which  you've just mentioned, inevitably it raises the question of  strategy as to how--to what direction--Japan intends to lead the  global economy, and it is we at the EPA's Research Bureau who  must provide necessary background information for the  formulation of such a strategy. We are proceeding with this  awareness.    As for the U.S. economy, I think the consensus now is that  it  is moving, albeit slowly, from a smooth recovery to an  expansionary phase. Even so, there is a question about whether  the structural problem of the U.S. economy has been truly  resolved or not, and opinions are divided on this point between  the fairly optimistic and the fairly pessimistic. I personally  believe that the popular view of the U.S. economy used to be  overly pessimistic but has now turned a little too optimisitic.    U.S. enterprises have intrinsic strengths. This time around,  too, they have regained their profitability by going ahead with  restructuring; yet, when it comes to the U.s. economy as a  whole, one has to wonder whether the problems inherent in it  have really changed by any significant degree. The U.S.  Government, meanwhile, seems to have realized that there may  well be a limit to domestic procreation of its economic growth  potential. So it came up with the idea of boosting its economic  growth potential by "latching onto"--perhaps this is a poor  choice of word--Asia that has an extraordinary possibility for  development. This, I believe, is the reason why the Clinton  administration has begun taking great interest in the APEC.    As can be surmised from what I've just said, truly Asia's  growth and development potentials are by far a cut above those  of others within today's global economy. It is all the more so  because China has entered into the picture. Of particular note  is that the Asian economy as a whole is beginning to move along  very well. Moreover, this favorable development is likely to  continue because there are various positive factors helping the  Asian economy. The development process of an economy is like  the process of a business cycle: once it starts to move  smoothly, or to put it another way, once it enters into a  favorable cycle, it tends to stay on that track. This, I am  inclined to think, is what can be expected to happen in Asia as  a whole. For starters, the United States is keenly interested  in Asia; the strong yen, among other things, is driving Japan  into placing increasing emphasis on investment and production  overseas; and then there are big countries such as China and  Vietnam that are poised to move toward market-oriented  economies. Given all these factors, the smooth development of  Asia as a whole is likely to continue.    What should Japan make of this Asian outlook and how should  Japan deal with it as a matter of foreign policy? These, I  should think, are questions of extreme importance. Because of  the involvement in the picture of such major powers as the  United States and China, these questions are, in some sense,  difficult ones to answer; in another sense, however, I think  they present significant themes worth tackling for us.    [KANKAI] What is your view on the EC or the European  economy?  They say the economic picture in the United Kingdom has  improved somewhat.    [Toshida] The assessment that the EC's economy is at its  trough this year but will begin to improve next year [1994] is  probably on the mark. Because, for one thing, the German  economy seems to be moving toward a gradual improvement.  Nevertheless, that the much touted union will greatly  invigorate the EC's economy as a whole is a prospect not so  easily attainable. How to overcome the different interests and  idiosyncrasies of its member nations poses a very difficult  problem. Even in Japan, there are regional differentials which  we have been trying to eliminate for the past 20-30 years  without much success. So, it only follows that there be some  doubt about whether things will go smoothly when individual EC  countries remove their fences to become integrated. Naturally  some countries would want to maintain their traditional high  standards. The question is, would things work out all right  when these countries are put together with others that are  trying to catch up with the former's high standards? I believe  this is the crux of the matter.    [KANKAI] Now, if you have anything else to add, please go  ahead.    [Toshida] In closing, if I may be allowed to indulge in some  self-advertisement, we at the EPA have a rather difficult task  of trying to get Japan's economy back on a smooth growth track  and we are working very hard on it. But, as you know, we are  often subjected to such criticisms as "the government's  perceptions are wishful" or "the government's way of looking at  things lags behind reality." But perhaps these criticisms are  in some sense not as substantive as they may sound if you  consider the fact that it is the private sector that is pulling  Japan's economy by means of market mechanisms. When it comes to  the question of medium- and long-term economic directions I  believe the government and the policymaking authorities must  bear a heavy responsibility for them, but it is a little  different story when it comes to the economic activity occurring  right now. Recently, some people praised us for having closed  the gaps between us and the private sector with respect to  certain projections; no sooner were we praised than the stock  prices fell; then there were people who scolded us for saying  that business conditions were not likely to recover  readily...(laughter).    In this sense, now is truly the time for business managers  of  the private sector to demonstrate their capability. We at the  EPA have learned a lot during the currrent recessionary phase;  in the process, we have been able to improve many aspects of our  work in comparison with the way they were handled in the past.  I know this will sound funny, but let's take the narrative  style of our monthly economic reports, for example: There were  periods in our past history when the readers of our reports  could not be sure, because of the way the reports were worded,  whether the business conditions of the period were bad or what.    During the current recession, however, the monthly reports  we  have been putting out are so worded that future historians  reading them would immediately know that the economy was in a  slump in this period. In the process of preparing these  reports, we have, as I briefly touched on earlier, been creating  opportunities for us to listen to the views of those in the  private sector. Also, recently we initiated a minithesis series  entitled Research and Analysis Viewpoints, the  purpose of which is to enhance the timeliness of our research  products. When business conditions are fluctuating as much as  they are now, if research takes too much time, people's  perception of the problem itself may have changed by the time  the research results are produced. This is part of the reason  that we are putting out minitheses without waiting for the  annual white paper time. I think it is fortunate that because  of the recession we have made progress in certain aspects of our  work; likewise, I believe those of the private sector, too, can  make progress on account of the recession. What I mean by this  is that they can go forth with forward-looking restructuring  measures, which is what I hope they would do. This is my  thought toward the coming new year [1994].</p>

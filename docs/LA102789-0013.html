			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW SPIN ON REFUGEE LAW  </P> <P> For several years, members of Congress have tried but failed to persuade the  Reagan and Bush Administrations to allow illegal aliens from war-torn Central  America to remain in this country until the turmoil there subsides. Now the  most recent legislation designed to help Central American refugees may win  approval because its authors have included provisions protecting a third group  of aliens who may be in danger if they go home -- citizens of the Peoples  Republic of China.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, the House of Representatives approved a bill that would  delay deportation of illegal immigrants from China, El Salvador and Nicaragua  for three years. The bill, by Reps. Joe Moakley (D-Mass.) and Bruce A. Morrison  (D-Conn.), also lays out conditions under which a similar "temporary protected  status" could be granted to refugees from other countries by the Justice  Department's Immigration and Naturalization Service.  </P> <P> Proponents of the measure want the new refugee rules to replace the current  system through which INS sometimes grants a special status, "extended voluntary  departure," to immigrants from strife-torn nations. They argue that the current  system is arbitrary, discretionary and inconsistent. That has certainly been  the case with Central Americans. At the height of formerPresident Reagan's  covert war against Nicaragua, persons opposed to the Sandinistas were  encouraged to seek refuge here. Yet people fleeing the bloodier Salvadoran  civil war were denied asylum because the U.S. government did not want to  embarrass a friendly government in San Salvador. Now that Nicaragua's war is  winding down with the Sandinistas still in power, the INS also is starting to  turn down asylum requests from Nicaraguans.  </P> <P> Extending the bill to cover Chinese nationals in the United States was a stroke  of political genius by the authors, whose bill has already benefited from the  outpouring of sympathy Americans have shown for Chinese dissidents in the wake  of the June massacre in Beijing. In the House vote, the measure won support  from congressmen who had opposed it in the past. If it passes the Senate and  gets to President Bush's desk, it will pose a very uncomfortable political  dilemma for him.  </P> <P> The Administration could get around the Moakley-Morrison bill simply by  granting extended voluntary departure to Central Americans and to Chinese  refugees. Since it's already allowed within the law, that would be easy and  preferable. But if the Administration remains rigid in dealing with Central  American refugees, the proposed new law will be both necessary and desirable.  </P></p>

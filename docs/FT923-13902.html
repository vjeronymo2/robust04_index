			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Patten turns on the charm HONG KONG got a taste of a real politician yesterday when Mr Chris Patten, the colony's new governor, held an audience of 800 spellbound for half an hour as he outlined his vision for the last five years of British colonial rule. His vision was based on hard realities, but served up with noble thoughts. He held up as the prize of success 'a shining example to the world of partnership and co-operation'. However, he was not blind to the need for a close working relationship with the colony's future landlord, China. It was a vintage performance which launched his governorship in a way not done before. Mr Patten was anxious to convey the image of a man running Hong Kong, rather than running to Whitehall to seek approval for his every decision. But, while his audience was impressed by the fluency of his oratory, few were unmindful of what he faces. As one senior civil servant noted: 'We'll have to see how Beijing reacts.' A member of his Executive Council, or cabinet, noted: 'What he said sounded good, now all he has to do is do it.' Ms Emily Lau, an outspoken advocate of democracy, said: 'I remain to be convinced' that he is Hong Kong's hope for greater democracy. Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, was more generous, even though Mr Patten did not address the democracy issue head-on. 'I thought it was the speech of a consummate politician,' he said last night. 'He managed to please everyone and offend no one.' Mr Patten stressed his belief in the maintenance of Hong Kong's freedoms. He said the colony should retain a low-taxation environment. He also saw much to be done to develop social policies, particularly for education, the elderly, and for the environment. He said nothing to offend China. One of the many difficult tasks in front of him is to build trust with Beijing. He has to convince China's leaders that the political structure he fashions is one which it is in their interests to accept. He offered an olive branch, promising candour and co-operation in matters concerning the transfer of sovereignty. But Mr Patten was not on bended knee; he said trust was a mutual exchange. This will be put to the test in the coming weeks as he oversees Hong Kong's negotiations with China about financing the colony's new airport. It is thought in Hong Kong that China's disagreement with the financing cloaks a fear that Mr Patten will introduce participative democracy. His vigorous assertion that his government will be 'executive-led' was calculated to allay that fear but no one is betting serious money that it will. Mr Patten got Day One right; he has 1,815 days to go.</p>

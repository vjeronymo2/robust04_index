			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Continental places Dollars 4.5bn order with Boeing - Rolls-Royce engine deal could be worth more than Dollars 600m CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier which recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, is placing a Dollars 4.5bn order with Boeing to update and simplify its fleet. The order could be worth more than Dollars 600m to the UK's Rolls-Royce, which will supply some of the engines for the aircraft. In total, the Continental deal covers firm orders for 92 aircraft, to be delivered between January 1994 and the year 2005, with options for another 98. However, a portion of the purchase agreement - for 50 Boeing 737s and 25 Boeing 757s - essentially reinstates an order placed by Continental before it went into Chapter 11, and which was then cancelled by the carrier while it was in bankruptcy. The new element is Continental's decision to acquire 12 wide-body 767-300ER aircraft, with options for another 18, and five of the new 777s, with options for a further five. The Continental 777s will be the longer-range B model of that aircraft. Continental also announced for the first time that the new fleet of twinjet 757s will be powered by Rolls-Royce engines. In addition to the 25 firm orders for this aircraft, it has options on a further 25, and Rolls-Royce said the potential value of the order could exceed Dollars 600m. The first delivery date for the 757s is May 1994, and the final deliveries would be made in March 1997. Delivery dates for the optioned aircraft begin in 1995 and continue through to 1998. The first 777s, meanwhile, are due to be delivered in August 1997, and the final delivery date on the firm order aircraft is April 1998. Continental said the airliner, carrying GE engines, would be used to replace 747s on longer-haul international routes. The firm-order 767s are due to be delivered between 1995 and 1999, and will also appear in Continental's fleet for the first time. The most numerous part of the order is for the 50 737s, with engines made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric in the US and France's Snecma, with options of another 50. The firm orders will be delivered between January 1994 and July 1997. The US airline said the overall size of its fleet - currently about 325 aircraft - should not change substantially over the next three years.</p>

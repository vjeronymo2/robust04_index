			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ART NOTEBOOK: MORE FIRST-TIME ART COLLECTORS SEE GALLERIES AS COMMODITY BROKERS  </P> <P> With inflation in the con temporary art market at an all-time high, it is not  just serious collectors who are looking to turn a profit on their investments.  </P> <P> According to several Los Angeles-based galleries, the lure of investment  potential is trickling to people who are just beginning to buy and collect  contemporary art. The Tamara Bane Gallery in West Hollywood, which has recently  presented exhibitions by up-and-coming artists Aldo Luongo and Mark Kostabi,  will be presenting a pop art show this summer featuring works by Kostabi and  graffiti artist Keith Haring, among others.  </P> <P> "It's unbelievable," says Robert Bane, gallery president. "We don't  specifically sell for investment purposes, but our clients are definitely more  investment-oriented now."  </P> <P> Tamara Bane, gallery vice president, concurs with her husband's assessment,  pointing out that limited-edition art -- lithographs and serigraphs -- by Mel  Ramos, expected to sell for $4,000 to $6,000, has been fetching $45,000 in the  inflationary market. "People who have never been serious investors are  realizing that modern art is a pretty secure investment," she says, "and it  seems to be escalating."  </P> <P> "Today, investment potential seems to be the first thing on everyone's mind,"  says Jan Turner of the Jan Turner Gallery in Los Angeles. She recently curated  a show of the works of painter Carlos Almaraz. Turner says that Almaraz' works  in the $3,000 range are appreciating by more than $1,000 a year -- "and I don't  see an end to it. If the bottom drops out, it won't be in just the modern art  market, but in the economy in general."  </P> <P> Candace Lee of the Saxon-Lee Gallery in Los Angeles concurs but adds, "It's not  really affecting us, because our business is in the secondary art market -- art  that sells for the second time." Lee, who recently returned from the Chicago  Art Fair, noted that this year the European galleries represented there had  only brought investment-quality, blue-chip work for consideration, rather than  works by new or emerging artists.  </P> <P> Even small galleries such as Contemporary Images of Woodland Hills are feeling  the ripples from the inflation at the larger galleries. Co-owner Ruth Banarer  says, "People are looking for names. They're very careful in what they're  buying. Even if they're purchasing prints, they're purchasing collectable  prints as opposed to decorative prints -- not so much things to hang in their  home.  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ROLL: After a year or so of inactivity, the Santa Monica Art Tool  will finally be rolling down the beach from Ocean Park to the Pacific  Palisades, beginning today at 9 a.m.  </P> <P> Sculptor Carl Cheng created a 9-by-12-foot concrete roller, similar to one used  to pave asphalt, and installed it on the Santa Monica beach in the spring of  1988. It has a surface of indentations that, when driven over the sand, imprint  a miniature landscape of Los Angeles. The mini-cityscape, titled "Walk on  L.A.," will be 2 inches high and 3 miles long.  </P> <P> The Tool will also roll down Santa Monica Beach at 9 a.m. this summer on June  11, July 3 and 23, Aug. 20, Sept. 4, and Oct. 30. For further information call  the Santa Monica Arts Foundation at (213) 458-8350.  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA DREAMINGS: The first museum exhibition of Australian aboriginal art  to tour the United States, "Dreamings: The Art of Aboriginal Australia," is on  exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History through July 29. It  is co-sponsored by the Westfield Group and the CAZ Gallery of West Hollywood.  </P> <P> In conjunction with the exhibit, the Westside Pavilion in West L.A. will be  celebrating Australia through July, with banners throughout the shopping center  and an information desk at the west end of the pavilion.  </P> <P> Shoppers who stop by the information desk and join the museum will be given a  gift certificate to Koala Blue, Olivia Newton-John's Australian boutique on the  third floor of the mall.  </P> <P> For more information, contact the Natural History Museum at (213) 474-6255.  </P></p>

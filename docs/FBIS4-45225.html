			<p>CSO     [Text] Bombay, April 21--The narcotics cell of the city  police today destroyed 5,278 kg of drugs valued at Rs 425 crores  in India, and many times this amount in the international  market, at Reti Bunder, Sewri.    The narcotic and psychotropic substances destroyed included  heroin, mandrax, hashish, opium and ganja. The drugs were  destroyed after following the special procedure laid down by the  NDPS [expansion not given] Act. It has to be followed since the  courts have as yet not delivered judgment in the various cases  filed by the police.    To preserve the evidence, representative samples and  photographs of the drug seized are taken in the presence of  metropolitan magistrate. The specially-constituted NDPS courts  have to be then approached for permission to destroy the drugs.    The Act provides for their pre-trial destruction since there  is always a fear that they might be stolen or substituted.  Besides, a lot of space has to be provided for storage.</p>

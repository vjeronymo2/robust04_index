			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH: ROUND ONE OF COUNTERPUNCH, A NEW WEEKLY CALENDAR FEATURE OF  COMMENTARY AND OPINION. LEADERS IN ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT AND RELATED FIELDS  WILL OFFER THEIR PERSPECTIVES ON VITAL ISSUES OF THE DAY AND THEIR RESPONSES TO  COLUMNS AND REVIEWS.;  </P> <P> FOR THE LOVE OF 'NIGHTINGALE' -- A FEAR FOR ITS EXISTENCE  </P> <P> It is 6 a.m. on Monday, June 18. I am drinking my morning coffee and reading  the opening paragraphs of Sylvie Drake's review of our production of the  American premiere of Timberlake Wertenbaker's "The Love of the Nightingale" at  the L.A. Theatre Works space in the Edgemar complex in Santa Monica. It is  becoming increasingly clear with each line that the critic and I have vastly  different views on this one.  </P> <P> Although Drake had kind words for the production and the performers, we parted  company on the evaluation of the play itself. Fair enough. But what is so  awesome is that with the best intentions in the world and by doing her job, the  reviewer of a major paper can wreck the many weeks of work and the artistry of  people whose dedication and keen intelligence I have watched, as producer, on a  daily basis. The reviewer can obliterate the work, for what is theater without  the audience? My heart sinks, knowing that without the blessing of The Times,  even with all my producerly resources, I haven't a prayer of attracting the  public to see this important, new production, worthy of a major company.  </P> <P> I read hundreds of plays, listen to scores of ideas for plays. I know when a  work sings off the page. When Timberlake handed me the final draft of  "Nightingale" in 1988, written for the Royal Shakespeare Company, it sang to  me. It dazzled me with its promise and the glory of its words. I knew it would  reach the audience head and heart in equal measure -- ideas received with a  visceral jolt. That is my measure for what I want to offer the audience.  Timberlake unfolds her secrets like an origami, intricate and spare with a  poetic beauty full of surprises.  </P> <P> "The Love of the Nightingale," adapted from a Greek myth, is, as Drake  acknowledged, "heady stuff" that "ranges freely through compelling issues of  rape, conspiracy, censorship (symbolized here by inflicted physical silence),  chauvinism, war, slavery and revenge." That is why I produced the play.  </P> <P> Sitting in the audience on opening night, I was thrilled by the author's  extraordinary talent; her commitment to big ideas, filtered through masterful,  witty and purposeful language, is a welcome relief from the television comedies  and kitchen-sink dramas that dominate current U.S. theater.  </P> <P> I was proud to have produced this feast for the audience, who, I noted, did not  cough, sneeze or squirm (a good sign to the producer). To the contrary, as the  play progressed -- a swift hour and 35 minutes straight through -- laughter  gave way to gasps and murmurs. The audience seemed to lean forward, almost in  unison, toward the actors, with rapt attention, transfixed by the power and  horror and theatrical beauty of the events spilling forth in a mounting  crescendo of pain, compassion, irony, love and tenderness. The ultimate reward  for our labors is knowing that the audience confirms our vision.  </P> <P> Peter Mark Schifter has given us a gorgeous, well-directed production,  hauntingly scored by Thomas Pasatieri and beautifully sung by Marnie Mosiman.  The fine actors in the large cast, including Robert Foxworth, Brenda Varda,  Carolyn Seymour and Roger Smith, deftly weave us in their spell.  </P> <P> I love "Nightingale," and I fear for its existence. This is written to  encourage audiences to see the play and judge for themselves. Having produced  in Los Angeles for 15 years, I am inordinately proud of this show, as I have  been of "Greek," "Decadence," "The Shaper," "Latina," "Bouncers," "Wooman  Lovely Wooman," among other controversial but substantive works I have invited  the audience to see.  </P></p>

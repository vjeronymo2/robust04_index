People would like to see for themselves what the  atmosphere was like on the island. Statistics showed that in  1993 alone, around 240,000 people in Taiwan sent in applications  to visit Jinmen. Jinmen, the "war front" of yesterday, which  had been shrouded in mysterious veils, has turned into a hot  spot, which tourists are vying to visit.    Jinmen is located in the Xiamen Bay, only 2,310 meters away  from mainland China at the nearest point. That being the case,  it had long been the outpost in the confrontation between Taiwan  and the mainland; in addition to the 40-some-year enforcement of  martial law on the island, Jinmen had become an "out-of-bounds  area" in the hearts of the people in Taiwan. Jinmen comprises  15 isles of various sizes, with a total area around 17,800  hectares, of which the two largest isles, Dajinmen and  Xiaojinmen, account for 85 percent of the total area. According  to 1988 statistics, its population was approximately 45,718  (excluding troops stationed on the island); the number of people  of Jinmen origin scattered all over the world was estimated to  be 140,000.    Most inhabitants in Jinmen engage in farming. The root and  tradition of their habits in life could be traced back to  Fujian's Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, and the residential houses on  the island were mostly built after the traditional architectural  style of southern Fujian. There are 40-some historic sites on  the island, along with many places of scenic beauty. The famous  lion-shape god [feng shi ye 7685 3740 3639,] a unique  traditional sign of Taiwanese of Fujian origin is a peculiar  object for human study, and was said to be a patron saint that  had power to control storms and dispel evils and monsters, a  popular belief; its duplicates can be found almost everywhere on  the island.    Aside from historic sites, the military installation and  sites leftover from the CPC-KMT [Kuomintang] confrontation are  full of attraction to tourists. For example, the Guning Museum  of War History, and the Qionglin Underground Village.    Since martial law was lifted and the island was opened to  tourists, Jinmen has undergone drastic changes. The opening up  has brought the island swarms of people as well as opportunities  for business. Taiwan-Jinmen airline tickets are sold out most  of the time, despite several flights back and forth every day.  The greatest opportunity for doing business is the tourist  industry. According to the press, hotel rooms are in short  supply in Jinmen, and all financial groups were vying for  stationing on the island to initiate building projects in a big  way. Thus, many overseas Chinese or Chinese residing overseas  of Jinmen origin, including those from Brunei, the Philippines,  and Singapore, as well as foreign businessmen, have come to  invest in the island one after another; that has simultaneously  brought along development of the catering business, the movie  and television industry, as well as the motor-driven toy  industry. Some businessman said that whatever there were in  Taipei, there would be in Jinmen, too; thus, gambling, drug  addiction, and pornographic businesses were on the rise.  Consequently, Jinmen, which used to have a simple social  amosphere, was under violent attack.    Because of foreign investment swarming in, prices of  Jinmen's  real estates rocketed almost overnight. The indexes published  by Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior showed that price hikes of  Jinmen real estates topped Taiwan; last year, land prices went  up by 60 percent over the same period of the previous year.  Today, Jinmen's land price is approximately NT $300,000 [New  Taiwan dollars] per ping [0988, approximately 36 square feet, a  Japanese unit], and its land has become the most sought after in  Taiwan.    To meet long-range demands, building of various  infrastructure projects and tourist installations has  accelerated. The Jinmen civil aviation station that costs NT$  820 million will be completed and delivered to use by the end of  1995; by then there will be 25 airliners coming in or going out  everyday; it is hoped that will bring Jinmen more tourists.  Besides, the government has decided to build a "national party"  in Jinmen, which will add some attraction to Jinmen's scenery.  The people's greater concern is whether or not the  establishment of transport, trade, and postal relations will  first be implemented in Fujian's Xiamen, which is very close to  Jinmen; should that be the case, Jinmen's prospects will be  brighter still. Just like Taiwan's media put it: The golden  gate is open when Jinmen is opening up. How can anyone remain  indifferent facing such temptation!</p>

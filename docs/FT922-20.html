			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Medeva set to expand in the US MEDEVA, the fast-growing niche pharmaceuticals company, has signed a conditional agreement worth Dollars 28.6m (Pounds 15.4m) to acquire International Medication Systems, a Californian-based pharmaceuticals manufacturer. The consideration consists of Dollars 24m for the company and deferred payments of Dollars 4.6m for royalties on a new patented heart-attack product called Carbicarb. Medeva said yesterday that IMS's net assets were Pounds 10m at the end of last year. Medeva is financing the deal through additional dollar borrowings. It said, however, that its policy was not to build up significant long-term loans. The group has raised Pounds 196m over the last two years. IMS, which manufactures specialised injectable delivery systems, had turnover of Dollars 39m last year but only broke even before interest costs. Medeva said it expected the net effect of IMS not to be significant in 1992 but that it would make a net contribution from 1993.</p>

This opinion was  expressed in an interview on BBC radio by UK Defense Secretary  Malcolm Rifkind, commenting on the decisions of the session of  the North Atlantic bloc council which has ended in Brussels. He  stressed that London feels no special enthusiasm for the policy  of intimidation by air strikes because British servicemen form  part of the NATO forces on the ground engaged in delivering  humanitarian aid to the population.    Ending the war in former Yugoslavia is not the task of the  United Nations: It cannot be achieved by military measures from  outside, the head of the military department pointed out. The  international contingent's objective is to ensure the normal  delivery of humanitarian aid to tens of thousands of innocent  people.</p>

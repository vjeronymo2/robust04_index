			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Charity probe into trust linked to friend of Nadir A UK-based organisation linked to Mr Ramadan Guney, the Turkish-Cypriot businessman who stood bail for Mr Asil Nadir, is being investigated by the Charity Commission. It emerged last night that the affairs of UK Turkish Islamic Trust, a registered charity with links to Moslem groups, are under investigation by the commission. Mr Guney is registered with the commission as the chairman of the trust. The commission last night refused to go into details. But a commission official indicated the potential seriousness of the investigation. He said: 'Following representations which suggest the administrative control of the charity was inadequate, we have made our own enquiries and established that there are causes for concern.' It is understood that the commission has requested that the trust put its affairs in order, and strengthen the trustee body as a first step. Mr Guney, a north-London Turkish-Cypriot whose business interests include running cemeteries, was ordered in July by an Old Bailey judge to surrender Pounds 650,000 he promised as part of a record Pounds 3.5m bail which Mr Nadir skipped in May, when he fled to northern Cyprus rather than face charges of false accounting and theft. Mr Guney was given six months to pay and warned he could face two years in jail if he defaulted. Mr Justice Tucker, the judge in the case, said during the court proceedings that he was satisfied that Mr Guney had played no part in Mr Nadir's flight. However, the judge added that Mr Guney had not taken all reasonable steps to ensure that Mr Nadir turned up to face trial. In his appearance before Mr Justice Tucker, Mr Guney based his defence on the Serious Fraud Office's failure to let him surrender his surety when the case was first transferred to the crown court. The judge ruled that none of the parties involved had ever considered that Mr Nadir had been surrendered into the custody of the court, so that his sureties were still responsible for his appearance at trial. The scheduled date for the trials of Mr Nadir and an associate, Mr John Turner, is October 4. However, sources close to the SFO indicated last night that the trial of Mr Turner might not begin then because of Mr Nadir's continuing refusal to return to the UK.</p>

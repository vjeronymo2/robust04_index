			<p>BFN     [Text] Comrat BASAPRESS, 16/6/1994 -- Yesterday Dumitru  Motpan, Moldovan Parliament deputy speaker [and chairman of the  ruling Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova -- PDAM], took part  in a Comrat conference of agricultural-industrial managers  dedicated to agricultural reform. In his speech, Motpan said  that "in the near future the Chisinau Parliament will examine  the draft law on official language with a series of  modifications introduced by the responsible parliamentary  commission." The current law on official language was approved  by Moldova's Parliament on 31 August 1989. It does not contain  the term "attestation." This term was later added by the  Language Department and now is perceived by non-Romanian ethnics  as a scarecrow, said Dumitru Motpan. Asked about what kind of  modifications were made, Motpan told BASAPRESS that first "the  period for studying Romanian will be prolonged through 1996 to  enable people to perform their duties." The requirement to know  the language of the population in localities where officials  perform their duty is valid for all leaders regardless of their  nationality, stated Dumitru Motpan. The Gagauz-eri-Gagaouzia  draft law stipulates that the local administration will use  Gagaouzian and Russian in its office work. Correspondence with  the Moldovan leadership and economic units will be made in the  official language and Russian.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On officially the last day of Austria's negotiations  for European Union [EU] membership the tough positions of the  two sides remain unchanged. The major obstacles to a conclusion  on schedule continue to be the issues of transit and agriculture.    Yesterday evening in Brussels, Foreign Minister Mock no  longer ruled out the possibility that the talks might be broken  off. He said literally that a crisis where one might go home  has certainly arisen. Greek EU Chairman Pangalos said that he  would deplore such a step very much. He did not want to rule  out a successful conclusion of the negotiations despite the  current crisis.</p>

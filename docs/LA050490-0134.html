			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> PARENTS ORGANIZING ALL-NIGHT GRAD BASH  </P> <P> Parents at Westminster High School, determined to make this year's graduation a  safe one, are organizing the first all-night graduation party in the school's  history.  </P> <P> A committee of about 20 parents is organizing a June 14 "grad night" event,  which will take the school's 409 graduating seniors on an all-night boat cruise  around Long Beach Harbor before returning to the school for breakfast.  </P> <P> "The purpose is to provide them with good memories but also to keep our kids  safe," said parent Joey Van Camp, the event organizer.  </P> <P> "We were really alarmed by statistics that showed a significant increase in  deaths of young people during the month of June, when most graduations take  place."  </P> <P> Westminster High is the last of the six schools in the Huntington Beach Union  High School District to hold a parent-organized party on the night of  graduation.  </P> <P> Van Camp, whose son Scott is a graduating senior, said each student will be  charged $45, which will cover the cruise, food, dancing and photos.  </P> <P> There will be a casino room on the ship, and door prizes such as stereos,  televisions and trips will be awarded.  </P> <P> "The basic idea of this kind of event is great," Van Camp said. "The kids want  something to do on graduation night, and we don't want to have to worry about  them. This satisfies everyone." GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

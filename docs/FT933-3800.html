			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES markets in London had a quiet session, trading within narrow ranges as professional traders took a cautious view of equity markets, writes Terry Byland. In stock index futures, the September contract, which expires at the end of next week, reached both the peak and the low of the session within two hours of the opening. At the official close, the September contract was trading at around a three-point premium to the cash market; fair value on the contract is now at zero. Trading volume was low at 9,409 contracts. There was some roll-over into the December position, which held on to most of its estimated 21-point fair value premium, on 2,406 contracts. Turnover in traded options fell from Thursday's 41,557 contracts to 22,360, with the FT-SE contract less active at 6,371 contracts against 10,188. The Euro FT-SE (3,631 contracts) headed the list of individual options, with BT (3,040) close behind as investors reacted to the increased competitition in the mobile phones market.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature no. 66 (556) </F> compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] On Wednesday the Georgian parliament continued the  discussion of the documents on a settlement in Abkhazia signed  in Moscow last Monday. On Tuesday the debate produced no  results.    According to a correspondent for Interfax, the opposition  working against the Moscow agreements failed to make  constructive proposals that would offer an alternative to the  agreements. Boris Kakubava even tried to raise the question of  confidence in the head of state Eduard Shevardnadze. However,  the proposal did not win support from the majority.    The chairman of the provisional committee for the state of  emergency Jaba Ioseliani asked the opposition: "What do you  want then? If you want war, say that openly, but it you want  peace, it should be approached step by step, for instance  through such documents as those signed in Moscow."    Shevarndnadze's personal representative Aleksandr Kavsadze  thinks that the Georgian-Abkhaz agreement signed in Moscow on  the return of refugees and displaced persons is going to become  a foundation for resolving the main question: the sending of a  UN peace-keeping force to Abkhazia. According to him, the two  sides agreed on further steps to continue settling the conflict  by political means. On Friday Sochi will host the first session  of the four-sided commission (Georgia, Abkhazia, Russia and the  UN) for the return of refugees. The session is expected to  continue in Geneva on April 12. The final decision should be  made then on the sending of a peace-keeping force. On April 19  in Geneva the status of Abkhazia should be discussed by  international experts and lawyers.    In the opinion of the head of the Abkhazian parliament  Vladislav Ardzinba, the Moscow accords open up prospects of a  peace settlement. He thinks that the main thing now is the  observation of the agreements by all the sides. In an interview  with Interfax he said Abkhazia would observe the agreements.    He is convinced that with an unstable situation in Georgia  only the deployment of a peace-keeping force on the dividing  line between Abkhazia and Georgia can guarantee peace.    Meanwhile, the head of the Georgian security force Igor  Georgadze has told a news conference in Tbilisi that there are  no hostilities at the moment in Abkhazia. However, he could not  say whether this can be accounted to the Moscow accords.    He did not rule out the possibility that the recent acts of  terrorism in Tbilisi were related to the war between criminal  clans that amassed fortunes on the hostilities in Abkhazia.  According to the security chief, the investigation of all the  cases will be completed in the nearest future. Georgadze said  security forces have proofs of links between high-ranking  officials who were in charge of the military policy in Abkhazia  with the looters who operated there. He said all the ties are  being investigated.    Answering a question from Interfax whether Georgia is  conducting intelligence activities in other countries Georgadze  said: "He have our hands full with our own problems in this  country."</p>

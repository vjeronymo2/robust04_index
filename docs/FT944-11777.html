			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / People: Half a pair for Hi-Tec's Mackness Frank van Wezel, founder of Hi-Tec Sports, is splitting his job as chairman and chief executive and handing over the chief executive's baton to Terry Mackness, 50, head of the group's important US operations. Hi-Tec Sports, which specialises in making sporting shoes and leisure wear, has had a chequered stockmarket history. Its performance has been hit by fierce competition from bigger sports shoe manufacturers. Last month the shares fell sharply after the group reported a first half pre-tax loss of Pounds 7.1m which was inflated by exceptional charges for restructuring the business. In addition to worries about the group's performance, the City has also been concerned that van Wezel, whose family controls over half the equity, exercises too much control. In March 1993 two well-known non-executive directors resigned from the Hi-Tec board only a few weeks after they had been appointed, thus leading to speculation that they had not been able to get along with van Wezel's management style. Mackness will divide his time equally between the UK and the US, the group's two main operating areas. Formerly with Cadbury Schweppes and Imperial Tobacco, Mackness joined Hi-Tec as marketing director in 1981. In 1986 he took charge of the group's UK operations before moving to California as president of Hi-Tec USA in 1989. Since then Hi-Tec's North American turnover has grown from Dollars 9m to Dollars 48m last year. Hi-Tec's shares, which traded over Pounds 2 in 1992, were unchanged at 41p yesterday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Japan on Monday [21  February] welcomed NATO's suspension of air strikes against the  last Bosnian Serb guns snowbound on the hills around Sarajevo.    "Our country hails the avoidance of air strikes," Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference.    "We hope this will lead to a first step toward peace not  only  in Bosnia but also in the former Yugoslavia as well," the top  government spokesman said.    A deadline for the Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons or  surrender them to United Nations peacekeepers expired at  midnight Sunday GMT with some of the weapons still in place on  the snowy mountains around Sarajevo.    But NATO agreed not to launch air strikes after Yasushi  Akashi, a Japanese national who serves as the UN special envoy  in Sarajevo, said he sees no need to do so, at least for the  moment.    Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito also welcomed NATO's  suspension of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, saying it  is a great step forward toward a peaceful solution to the  problems in the former Yugoslavia.    Saito told a press conference Japan will steadily implement  its contribution plan hammered out earlier this month after a  government mission toured the former Yugoslavia in early January.    Under the plan, Japan will not participate in UN  peacekeeping  operations there "at present" but will extend humanitarian  assistance of between 10 million and 15 million dollars to  international organizations.    Tokyo also plans to boost economic and technical aid to  Macedonia.    Saito also welcomed Russia's initiative in persuading  Bosnian  Serbs to begin a major withdrawal of heavy weapons around  Sarajevo.    He said, however, the latest avoidance of air strikes is not  the final solution since the problems in the former Yugoslavia  are deep- rooted, and called on all concerned parties to try to  solve the problems through peaceful means.</p>

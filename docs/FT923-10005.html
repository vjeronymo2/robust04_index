			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Books: How Catholics came in from the cold THE CATHOLIC FAMILIES by Mark Bence-Jones Constable Pounds 19.95, 341 pages LIKE Arlott on cricket or Elizabeth David on cooking, Mark Bence-Jones' books about the British aristocracy are well-known for mixing anecdote and magisterial knowledge into a marvellously engaging read. Today, figures such as the Duke of Norfolk and the Marquis of Bute belong so recognisably to the Great and the Good that it is startling to recall for how long Catholics were shut off from the political and official life of the nation. The first of the series of Test Acts in 1672 debarred Catholics from holding office or sitting in parliament. By 1778, though, the date at which Bence-Jones begins his history, the advantages of not squandering their fortunes in electioneering had left a surprisingly large number of landed Catholic families still prosperous despite a century of recusancy fines, defections to Anglicanism and forfeitures for treason, real or alleged. Full Catholic emancipation came in 1829, although the first Relief Act of 1778 had made exercising the functions of a Catholic priest or running a Catholic school no longer an offence punishable with life imprisonment. The next boost to the Catholic cause came with the Oxford Movement in the mid-19th century when a rash of defections from Anglican high society had the aristocratic classes gossiping frantically about who was rumoured to be wavering and who was next to fall. Curiously, only Disraeli, among the novelists of the day, seems to have captured the mood of a nation so ill at ease with itself religiously. Bence-Jones evokes brilliantly the dawn abductions and last-minute conversions which featured in this twilight battle for hearts and souls, so similar in atmosphere (as Graham Greene realised) to the morally ambiguous world of the modern spy thriller. Like the true story-teller, Bence-Jones knows when to purple his prose. His popes have a habit of saying things like 'Sta tranquilla, figlia mia'; his Catholic youths tend to be slim and elegant, with large and melancholy eyes. His women seem to fall into three categories: 'pretty and lively', 'ugly but cheerful' or 'selfish and mean.' If the elegant youths do not develop into devilishly handsome men (Teddy Howard, for example, a cardinal and cousin of the Duke of Norfolk, was 'the best-looking ecclesiastic in Rome'), they become eccentrics like 'Silly Willy' (William, 10th Lord Clifford of Chudleigh), 'Dirty Bertie' (Cuthbert Riddell of Swinburne), or Charles Waterton who, despite such habits as scratching the back of his head with the big toe of his right foot and pretending to be a dog under the hall table, was furious at being referred to in the Ornithological Dictionary as 'the eccentric Waterton.' Combining old-fashioned genealogical history with a marvellous eye for detail, Bence-Jones covers scandals and trials, from Mrs Fitzherbert's dangerous liaison with the Prince of Wales to the dowager Lady Tichborne's search for her elder son, Roger, whom she was determined to believe had not been lost at sea off the coast of Australia and would one day return. In response to her advertisements in the Australian press, she received a letter from a butcher in Wagga Wagga claiming to be Sir Roger Tichborne, her long-lost son; he had, he said, survived shipwreck and had lived under an assumed name ever since. Like the hero of Depardieu's film, The Return of Martin Guerre, the Claimant, as he was known henceforth, managed to fool most of the people almost all the time despite inaccuracies such as his education at 'Winchester College, Yorkshire' (to which the dowager replied: 'I think my poor dear Roger confuses everything in his head'). The Claimant's family knowledge and resemblance probably owed more to his being a distant illegitimate relation. Despite a wave of public sympathy surrounding his trial in 1873, he was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment. Turning to this century, with the book's examples of selfless public and, notably, military service, the surface picture is of the Catholic families increasingly merging with the British establishment. The perspective, however, is always double: between London and Rome, dominions temporal and spiritual. All in all, it is a fascinating history and one which today's whiggishly agnostic historians have neglected too readily.</p>

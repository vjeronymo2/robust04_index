			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Sport: When Germany is in love - Tennis Love affairs can be painful. As Boris Becker, competing in the Dollars 6m (Pounds 4m) Compaq Grand Slam Cup for the first time, flailed his way to ignominious defeat at the hands of the young South African, Wayne Ferreira, in the first round last Wednesday, women in the crowd at Munich's Olympiahalle were reduced to tears and grown men were biting their lips. A national hero had died. Germany fell in love with Boris in 1985 when, at the age of 17, he won the first of his three Wimbledon titles. He was the first German, the first unseeded player and the youngest male ever to win the world's greatest title. In December that year, I was in the same Olympiahalle to see Boris beat both Stefan Edberg and Mats Wilander as Germany went down honorably to Sweden 2-3 in the final of the Davis Cup. The scenes of emotion among the fanatical German supporters that weekend were extraordinary. Becker's reaction to the chanting, the stamping and the tears of joy was even more extraordinary. 'When I looked into their eyes I was frightened,' he said afterwards. 'At that moment I could understand what had happened to us at Nuremburg.' Eight years later the tears of joy have become tears of sorrow. Becker looks older than his 26 years. Life in the fast lane has taken its toll. At heart Boris is a generous soul, but the soul is in torment. He has agonised about his place in the universe, has contributed anonymously to good causes, has wrestled with the penalties of fame and wealth and has tortured himself over the rival claims of duty to country and self as he has pursued the No 1 ranking. He has also changed coaches with bewildering rapidity and has finally broken with his manager and mentor, Ion Tiriac. All that has been painful enough but love, too, has brought personal pain. The disturbing outburst of racial hatred against his fiancee Barbara Feltus forced the couple to consider moving abroad for the arrival of their first child early next year. The man who has replaced Becker in the hearts of his countrymen is 25-year-old Michael Stich, who this afternoon plays Edberg in a semi-final that repeats their first round clash here last year. That was a highly emotional occasion for the German - not only because the match itself produced some of the finest tennis of the year as Stich came back from 1-4 down in the final set to win 7-6 6-7 8-6. It also marked a revival in the fortunes of a man whose epic Wimbledon victory over Becker in 1991 had not brought him the adulation at home that he deserved. When the two Germans met again at Frankfurt in the ATP Tour Championship that year the crowd left him in no doubt who was their favourite. During a mediocre 1992, Stich tried to come to terms with that difficult situation. A win over Becker in May on clay in Hamburg, his home town, was generously applauded by the north German fans. The win over Edberg in Munich, the city that he had adopted after meeting his former coach, New Zealander Mark Lewis, at the Iphitos Club three years earlier, at last established Stich as the rightful heir to Becker's crown. As he sat on court afterwards the emotion overflowed. 'I am not ashamed to cry,' he said. 'Maybe this was one of the most important matches I have ever played . . . just to prove to myself that I can still win, to prove to all the people out there who counted me off already.' Certainly that win re-ignited the talent that had lain dormant since Wimbledon 1991. In a blaze of powerful serving, skilful volleying and penetrating returns and passes, Stich swept past Richard Krajicek, Pete Sampras and Michael Chang to win the Compaq Cup and the Dollars 2m cheque that went with it. Stich had at last come of age. The maturing process has continued most impressively in 1993. Stich has enjoyed the sort of success that all players dream of but few achieve. True, he has not won any of the four Grand Slam titles, but the new German No 1 has done just about everything else. For the second time in three years his titles have included victories on all four surfaces (clay, grass, hard and indoor carpet), a feat last achieved by Ivan Lendl in 1989. The most recent of those titles, a magnificent win in four sets over the world No 1 Pete Sampras in Frankfurt three weeks ago, earned Stich the world No 2 ranking for the first time. It also revealed that he had come to terms with his countrymen's infatuation with Becker. 'I had to learn the last two years that there are always going to be heroes in a country. Boris was the one that caused tennis really to be recognised and he deserves the credit he gets.' Last weekend in Dusseldorf, Stich contributed three victories in leading the Beckerless German Davis Cup team to victory in the final against Australia. That tasted especially sweet. 'When the year began I did not expect us to win the Davis Cup. But I think I have showed that I am a good tennis player. I played two great tournaments in Germany and now every match I win is like a Christmas present to myself.' Perhaps the best present of all was the recent popularity poll in which he was voted Germany's 'Athlete of the year'. At last Michael Stich has become a hero in his homeland. A new love affair has begun.</p>

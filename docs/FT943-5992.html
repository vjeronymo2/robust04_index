			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Britannia cabin crews back strike Cabin crews at Britannia Airways, the UK's second-largest airline, have voted to take strike action in support of their annual pay claim. About 700 out of the 900 Britannia members of the British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association - part of the Transport and General Workers Union - voted. Some 87 per cent of these supported the strike, the union said. The union had rejected an offer of 3 per cent on basic pay, with an extra 2 per cent unconsolidated lump-sum payment. Britannia management has agreed to talks with the union today together with Acas, the conciliation service. In the meantime Britannia, in volume terms the biggest charter airline in the world and a subsidiary of Thomson Travel Group, the holiday company, is training volunteers from other parts of the group. The airline said it had secured more than the 400 volunteers it needed to replace striking cabin staff if they took action. Some 900 of the airline's 1,460 cabin crew belong to the union. The 400 volunteers are undergoing a four-day safety and emergency procedures course that will allow them to gain Civil Aviation Authority certification. Britannia said it was confident that it would be able to run a complete service with skeleton crews. The union said it would be taking selective strike action, probably over weekends, if negotiations broke down. It is seeking extra commission rates on duty-free sales on board aircraft. The company has rejected this, which it said would give staff a pay rise equivalent to between 11 per cent and 15 per cent. Mr Matthew Campbell, the union's airport officer, said staff did not think the pay offer adequately reflected changes to their rosters and working conditions. He cast doubt on the airline's ability to train replacement staff adequately in safety standards and called the proposed use of skeleton crews 'dangerous and unwise'. He said: 'I would not want to be flying with them with people being trained for four days.' Mr Roger Burnell, Britannia managing director, said: 'In the event of industrial action we believe the measures we have taken will enable us to maintain safe operations, albeit with reduced standards of catering and on-board services.'</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Inflation rate edges down The immediate outlook for inflation in west Germany has improved further this month, although long-term prospects are still clouded by rapid expansion in money supply, writes Christopher Parkes. Consumer prices in North-Rhine Westphalia, the region's most populous state, rose at an annual rate of 2.9 per cent in the month to mid-May, down from 3 per cent in April, according to new figures. Inflation in Baden-Wurttemberg was unchanged at 3.1 per cent. The figures supported economists' forecasts of an annual rate for west Germany of 3 per cent at most, after 3.1 per cent in April. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank's favoured indicator for potential inflation, the M3 measure of money supply, continued to exceed forecasts and the bank's 4-6 per cent target range for growth with a 15.8 per cent annualised increase during April. The bank said part of the reason was its handing over to the government of DM18.3bn (Pounds 7.3bn) in 1993 profits. It also singled out private sector lending as a factor.</p>

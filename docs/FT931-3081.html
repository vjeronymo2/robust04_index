			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: The world's tap seizes up - Demand for fresh water is growing worldwide as the supply is drying up. Bronwen Maddox begins a series exploring the quality and cost of this scarce resource Water, like energy in the 1970s, will probably become the most critical natural resource issue facing most parts of the world by the start of the next century. That bald and disturbing prediction, based on rising population growth and pollution, comes from the United Nations Environment Programme. It is contained in the survey of the world's environment, released last year. Nor is UNEP alone in warning that water resources, which tend to be taken for granted, are coming under strain. A recent report for the European Commission argued just that European growth could be constrained by a lack of fresh water caused by industrial and agricultural contamination. But Tom Garvey, deputy director general of the environment directorate in Brussels, speaking at this week's Financial Times European water conference, stressed that the Commission was also increasingly aware of the high cost of raising water standards further. As such statements make clear, the economic and political pressures accompanying the growing demand for water are the focus of growing worldwide attention. UNEP makes a good case that fresh water resources are scarce. The proportion of the planet's water that is fresh rather than salt is tiny: only some 2.6 per cent. Nor is it easy to reach: more than 99 per cent is held as ice or snow at the poles or is underground, and almost half the rest is locked up in living organisms, soil and air vapour. The rest is in rivers and lakes but poorly distributed across the surface of the world - Lake Baikal in Siberia, roughly the size of Belgium, accounts for a fifth. Meanwhile, demand for fresh water is rising, spurred mainly by population growth in developing countries and by the spread of agriculture. According to UNEP, the world's use of fresh water increased nearly fourfold in the last 50 years to 4,130 cubic kilometres a year. Agriculture soaked up more than two thirds of the total - the area of irrigated land has increased by more than a third in the last two decades. The growth in Asian demand is the fastest, and by 2000 UNEP expects Asia to use nearly two thirds of the world's water compared with just over half now. The increase in pollution in many countries is aggravating shortages further. A worldwide monitoring scheme, backed by UNEP and the World Health Organisation among other UN agencies, suggests that as many as 10 per cent of all rivers monitored are polluted. One of the biggest problems in both industrialised and developing countries is contamination by agricultural chemicals. The nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus lead to algal blooms - such as those that recently disfigured the Venetian and Baltic coasts - which kill river life by stripping oxygen out of the water. Organochlorine pesticides are also a concern as they accumulate in the food chain; UN agencies report that rivers in some developing countries such as Colombia, Malaysia and Tanzania show higher levels than in European rivers. Poorly managed irrigation can also lead to salinisation and degradation of agricultural soils, and irrigation remains notoriously inefficient, with around half of the water lost by seepage or evaporation before it reaches the fields. Industrialised countries have the additional problems of high levels of poisonous heavy metals such as mercury - the rivers Rhine and Meuse are considered to be two of the most polluted in Europe. While signatories to last year's treaties on marine pollution and dumping were divided about the deep seas' ability to absorb pollution, there is more agreement that the world's fresh water cannot adequately dilute these levels of pollution, and pollution control is needed to meet future demand for water. Despite these strains, some standards have improved. During the 1980s, the number of people without clean water has declined from 1.8bn to 1.3bn in the 1980s out of the total population of some 5bn. Two-thirds of people living in towns now have access to sanitation compared with 56 per cent in 1980. A big worldwide dam-building programme has helped to increase supplies: the world's rivers and lakes now feed into 36,000 large dams, half in China, compared with just over 5,200 dams 40 years ago, of which eight were in China. However, high population growth has held back the improvement in sub-Saharan Africa, while conditions in parts of Latin America are also critical, where little urban domestic waste is treated. Pollution control in industrialised countries has also shown some success: the Rhine and Meuse have seen concentrations of lead and zinc, arsenic, copper and mercury fall in the past 10 years. However, Garvey said that 'in spite of the efforts over the past two decades, it is disappointing that the state of the aquatic environment in the Community has not improved to the extent expected'. There are signs in some regions that pressure on fresh water supplies is beginning to hold back development. The UN, which estimates that water use is now growing at less than 1 per cent a year compared with 2.3 per cent in the mid 1970s, attributes the slowdown to shortages of water suitable for irrigation as well as to recession. It is also becoming clear that the cost of cleaning up and avoiding shortages is much higher than some early estimates decades ago suggested. The UK water industry has embarked on a decade-long programme of improvements which may eventually cost more than Pounds 45bn in 1990 prices. Around half of that is driven by European Community environmental directives; water companies and ministers across Europe now ask whether some of those standards are unnecessarily high. The Commission's environment directorate said on Monday that it would review almost all of its water directives this year in response to the charge that some were set more by environmental enthusiasm than by science. However, even extensive dam building and pollution control - if it can be afforded - will not solve all resource problems. Many regions pursue water policies that are inefficient or could prove hard to sustain - such as Israeli exports of citrus fruit, or rice-growing in southern California - purely for social or economic reasons like earning hard currency, preserving a traditional industry or preventing migration from the countryside to the town. In other regions, political tensions are likely to grow over the control of water supplies, even if ways are found to increase supplies. Nearly half the world's land is fed by water basins that cross national borders and well over 200 countries share important rivers and lakes. Natasha Beschorner, in an illuminating pamphlet last year entitled 'Water and Instability in the Middle East' for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, comments: 'Water is a useful reminder of dependency.' She adds: 'Israel, Turkey and Egypt . . . have little incentive to concede what they regard as a strategic asset, namely priority usage,' although she argues that water resources, overshadowed by the region's other political problems, can be overstated as a source of tension. Many have also forecast future political instability in the Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. The five countries Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Kirgizstan share two rivers, the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, and the Aral sea, once the earth's fourth largest inland body of water. The sea has lost nearly two thirds of its volume in the past three decades as the rivers that feed it are drained for growing cotton, which is sold overseas to raise hard currency. Beschorner is right that prophesies of crisis from water shortages are easily and too frequently made. However, the complexity of the problems across both the developed and developing world supports UNEP's belief that the question of where clean water will come from next - and how much it will cost - will remain high on the international agenda. The series will continue next week by examining water supply in the United States.</p>

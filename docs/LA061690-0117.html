			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> POLSKY AND ELGART PREMIERES  </P> <P> Ostensibly, they were sharing a program. But when Rose Polsky and Sarah Elgart,  along with their respective companies, actually put foot to board for  Thursday's Generator Eight Festival at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, the  divvying up looked far from even. Not to worry.  </P> <P> Polsky proved, with her entry (against three of Elgart's), that less is  emphatically more, that a subject plumbed and long thought about resonates in  the mind's eye -- while a hastily made collage vanishes with the first blink.  </P> <P> But Polsky does her best work as a soloist. In "Broken," which had its premiere  on this agenda, the compelling sections were those with the choreographer alone  and with Don Bondi, who danced in aggressive double-time around her as she  slowly evoked a hyper-personal and poetic consciousness.  </P> <P> The piece is about AIDS and focuses on a male couple, only one of whom is dying  at first. It engages a corps that, somewhat simplistically, portrays a  harmonious community coming to terms with this disease holocaust. And it relies  at times on melodramatic cliches as well as graphic enactments of illness and  tragic realizations.  </P> <P> But there are inspired moments, too, even without Polsky on the scene. When the  couple stands still, listening to a train on an inexorable course, one knows  what it must have been like to face such a transport to a death camp.  </P> <P> However, it is the narrator of this tale, Polsky, who manages to say more about  Pieta and pathos with a few divinely legible movements -- arcing, upper-body  turns and hand-flutterings and somnambulistic chaines -- than all the rest put  together.  </P> <P> For the remaining two-thirds of the evening Elgart held forth. Her premiere  "Sleepless," might not have seemed so shallow and thrown-together had it stood  alone. But following "Eleventhour" (also about AIDS) and "Zoo," one could  detect a sameness of method, and a glib, crank-'em-out mentality to her work.  </P> <P> What you get is a theme, more or less coherent, and a squad of dancers doing  semaphoric calisthenics or gestures-in-code. The kicker for "Sleepless"  involves a late-night disc jockey a la Jean Shephard, sitting at sidestage, and  an insomniac corps -- flailing, rocking, gyrating, waltzing, bumping and  humping to the groans of a band called Skinny Puppy.  </P></p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Investors look for decisive move by Fed - New York Rumbles of another interest rate increase are being heard once again on Wall Street and the stock market does not like such noises one bit. But despite investor fears that recent strong economic data will lead to another round of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve, the Dow Jones Industrial Average followed soaring bond prices Friday to post its highest gain in over a month. The market may spend this week deciding whether it will post more declines on fears of interest rate increases or continue to move in tandem with bond prices, which seem at last to be cheered by the prospect of another monetary tightening. Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, says sentiment is growing on Wall Street that the central bank will act quickly and decisively - positive news for markets that have been worn down in part by a long, drawn-out process of monetary tightening. 'There is a growing possibility that the Fed could hike interest rates in December,' he says. Still, he says there is less than a 50 per cent chance the Fed will act this month. The next meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee is scheduled for December 20. Last week's deluge of economic statistics reinforced fears that the Fed will have to act again quickly. Consumer confidence hit its highest level since 1990, the third-quarter gross domestic product figure was revised upward, and the National Association of Purchasing Managers index of business activity hit its highest rate in more than 10 years. The week closed with news that unemployment fell to its lowest level in four years. Mr Bill Dodge, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds, says part of the explanation for Friday's gain of more than 44 points by the Dow lies in the fact that the market became oversold at the end of November, having fallen almost 130 points in the past three weeks. 'The market is going to try and have a year-end rally,' he says. But he warns that any year-end gains will probably not be large or long-lasting. In the near term, he says, further interest rate increases could hurt stocks by eroding corporate earnings and making fixed income instruments attractive alternatives to stocks. Although economic news due out in the next five days is less important than last week's figures, investors will be able to take cues from some of the new statistics. Figures due out today will give an indication of consumer demand for cars and homes. Also important will be figures on productivity to be announced mid-week. So far this year productivity gains have kept wage inflation below other elements of the surging economy.</p>

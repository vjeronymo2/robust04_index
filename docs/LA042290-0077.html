			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRIBUTE TO UCI'S DANIEL ALDRICH -- AN EDUCATOR AND RENAISSANCE MAN  </P> <P> The media tribute to the late Daniel Aldrich, founder and chancellor of UC  Irvine until his retirement, is apt, appreciated and inspiring. It is a tribute  to the media writers and editors that this great person, neither politician nor  TV celebrity but an educator and something of a Renaissance man, should be so  honored.  </P> <P> In remembrance of Chancellor Dan, we grieve. Too briefly did this hero touch  our lives. Yet the light he lighted will forever glow.  </P> <P> The growing impact of his creative mind moved minds of all who knew this gentle  genius. Paired with his intellect was his caring heart. Mind governed by  compassion was his way.  </P> <P> He dared to dream great dreams, then worked to make those dreams come true,  using his time always to create better times.  </P> <P> Dan knew, as a man of soil, that from dark of night comes morning light, and  from the seed of death new life is born.  </P> <P> ALBERT JOHNSON  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

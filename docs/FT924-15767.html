			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Forte It seems perverse that Forte's shares should rise by 10 per cent in response to first half profit figures 43 per cent below those achieved during last year's difficult Gulf war period. The explanation is only partly that the City had been primed to expect bad news. The market is also wondering if the company's fortunes have passed their nadir. There are faint signs of improvement in hotels; the devaluation should bring more US visitors to London; last but not least Rocco Forte was uncharacteristically chipper in his presentation of the figures. But Mr Forte was doubtless well-groomed by his public relations people. His story hardly constitutes a convincing turnround. Room rates and occupancy are well below their level two years ago. The hotel business has managed gross cost savings of Pounds 26m and promises more, but on a net basis costs are virtually flat. Net debt is up more than 6 per cent despite Pounds 69m in cash receipts from the exercise of Eurobond warrants. Forte still shows no ability to trade its way into a more comfortable cash position. Perhaps that is why capital spending next year will be lower than in 1986. It might be different if the board were strengthened and Gardner Merchant successfully sold. The sale would provide the resources for expansion in Europe at a time when properties may be going cheap. As it is, the company seems to be hedging its bets, with mutterings about the possibility of attacking Europe through management contracts which do not require much capital. The remaining picture is of hatches battened down till economic recovery arrives. At 149p much of that recovery must be in the price.</p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Lucas Industries Lucas's fond hope that its dividend would be covered by earnings this year has surely perished in the continental car market pile-up. The company may justifiably claim that conditions have deteriorated at a rate no-one had predicted. Nevertheless, the UK had been in recession for well over two years before Lucas announced substantial cost reductions last October. It is hard to avoid the impression that Lucas waited for the market to rescue it, only to respond with too little action too late. Further cuts will be needed, including presumably in the dividend. Yet a full-blooded approach may have to wait for a new chief executive. Unfortunately, that appointment is taking so long that such a hot seat now looks difficult to fill. Lucas's share price has been buoyed this year by hopes of a bid from BTR. Its recent sag, however, suggests a recovery stock which has simply failed to recover.</p>

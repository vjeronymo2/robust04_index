			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: Hampers for posh people - With the first burst of sunshine, Lucia van der Post has been thinking about picnic hampers I SUPPOSE that there are a few people left with dividends, bonuses or pay rises to celebrate, and what could be a more convivial birthday or anniversary present than a splendidly sybaritic hamper? Alfred Dunhill, currently investigating its archive material in order to recreate the luxury products of yesteryear, has come up with a picnic case (photgraphed below) for which only champagne and the grandest of foods will do. At Pounds 2,995 this is not, you understand, the sort of hamper from which you unwrap a cheese sandwich and a can of beer - mais non, it requires a full fete champetre to fulfil its ambitions. It is, you will have gathered, the sort of picnic hamper that takes a bit of living up to. The Pic-Nic, the soubriquet by which Alfred Dunhill likes it to be known, is kitted out in regal style - Waterford cut crystal glasses, Wedgwood porcelain, proper cutlery in a leather-covered canteen, leather-covered flasks and Irish linen napkins, not to mention some very refined touches that the posh picnicking classes seem to go in for, such as napkin rings and coasters. The hamper as a whole when closed resembles nothing so much as a very smart leather-clad briefcase. For the moment it is only available at Alfred Dunhill, 30 Duke Street, St. James's, London SW1Y 6DL.</p>

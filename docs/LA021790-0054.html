			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE UNION FIGHTS RANDOM DRUG TESTING  </P> <P> The largest Los Angeles police union moved Friday to block a plan by Police  Chief Daryl F. Gates to conduct random drug testing of sworn officers, setting  the stage for a likely court fight as the LAPD tries to begin such testing by  June 1.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Protective League filed an unfair labor practices  complaint and formally notified LAPD officials that it is not willing to modify  its contract with the city, which now allows very limited drug testing.  </P> <P> "What's the purpose of having a contract?" asked Lt. George V. Aliano,  president of the 7,800-member union. He called Gates' drug testing proposal "an  attempt to reopen an issue already negotiated."  </P> <P> But LAPD spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said the department will proceed with  the plan to have a computer select personnel, from Gates on down, for drug  testing each day.  </P> <P> "We're going to do it as soon as we can," Booth said.  </P> <P> In declaring his unwillingness to negotiate on the issue, and promising  "appropriate legal action," Aliano said two-thirds of union members responding  to a survey opposed any modification of their four-year contract "in the middle  of its term."  </P> <P> Under current policy, random drug testing is allowed only with officers in  their first 18 months of employment. Special urine tests can be ordered for  veteran officers only when there is some evidence of drug use.  </P> <P> In November, however, Gates submitted a formal proposal to begin negotiations  with the union to extend the random testing to all officers. Gates said  citizens should have the assurance that the people who respond to emergencies  are not on drugs.  </P> <P> Under his plan, the LAPD's medical liaison staff would collect urine samples  for testing in the department's lab. A positive reading would trigger a test by  an independent lab -- whose confirmation of the finding would result in  termination.  </P> <P> At the time Gates announced his plan, Aliano had said he expected members of  his union to support testing because "they want to show they are drug-free just  like everybody else." But Aliano said the survey of members showed their  apprehension on a variety of questions raised by Gates' proposal.  </P> <P> "The real issue is reopening the contract," the union head said Friday. "That  would be like us trying to reopen the contract with the city every six months  to ask for higher salaries. . . .  </P> <P> "He (Gates) said, 'You don't know what they (members) want. Well, I found out  what they want. . . . I consider two-thirds a pretty good mandate."  </P> <P> Aliano said the union is willing to "put everything back on the table in March,  1992," when negotiations begin on a new contract.  </P> <P> Only a handful of police departments around the country now do random drug  testing of all officers.  </P> <P> But Gates, who has long sought such a program, was encouraged by a U.S. Supreme  Court decision late last year not to consider a union challenge to the Boston  Police Department's 3-year-old drug testing policy.  </P> <P> At issue is a state labor law requirement that management "meet and confer" in  good faith with a union before making significant changes in work conditions.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Protective League's official refusal "to meet and confer  on the issue of drug testing" was included in a letter hand-delivered Friday to  Parker Center police headquarters.  </P> <P> Booth said that, under LAPD officials' interpretation of court rulings, the  department met its legal obligation merely "by extending an offer to meet and  confer on the issue."  </P> <P> "This response is 'no,' to decline that request," he added. "The offer and the  request for a meeting is still there, as are the plans to proceed with the  random testing. . . . We're going to go ahead, with an implementation date of  no later than June 1."  </P> <P> In its second action Friday, the police union filed a complaint with the city's  Employee Relations Board. "This is the official way for me to say I'm not  meeting and it's unfair for (Gates) to try to get me to that table," Aliano  said.  </P> <P> An attorney for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, Cecil Marr, said the  union also might seek arbitration to settle the question of whether expanded  drug testing constitutes a reopening of the officers' contract.  </P> <P> "If we can't resolve this administratively by June 1, we'll have to go to  court," he said.  </P> <P> The union's survey of officers asked six questions, including whether any drug  testing should be done by the LAPD's Scientific Investigative Division or by an  outside lab, whether officers who admit to a drug problem should be allowed to  return to work after completing a rehabilitation program, and even whether any  testing should look for traces of steroids.  </P> <P> Aliano said he would not disclose the results of five of the six questions --  including the one seeking officers' general attitude toward random drug testing  -- because of their potential use in future contract negotiations.  </P> <P> "If you reveal how your membership feels, the other side knows if you're weak  or strong. I can't do that," he said.  </P> <P> In a statement released Friday, the union said: "The decision to not reopen our  contract in no way detracts from the sensitive nature of drug testing or the  Los Angeles police officers' concern about the drug problem in this city and  country. However, we are not part of that problem. . . . On this particular  issue we must protect ourselves and our legitimate right to negotiate. . . ."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BERNARDI, HALL DISAGREE ON ACTIONS, NOT ISSUES  </P> <P> The two candidates vying to represent the northeast San Fernando Valley on the  Los Angeles City Council traded barbs Tuesday night in Arleta during their  third debate.  </P> <P> But mostly what they proved to the 80-member audience at the Branford Park  Community Center is they do not differ greatly on solutions to most major  issues confronting the area. The difference is that while Councilman Ernani  Bernardi says he already is solving many problems, challenger Lyle Hall says  Bernardi has not done enough.  </P> <P> During the two-hour debate, sponsored by the Arleta Chamber of Commerce, Hall  said Bernardi's 28 years on the council represent "a legacy of neglect and  inattention to the 7th District."  </P> <P> "People are telling me that our communities aren't what they used to be," Hall  said. "Things have been ignored in our area. We aren't getting our fair share  of city services."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Johnny-Come-Lately'  </P> <P> Bernardi, who called Hall a "Johnny-come-lately," spent much of the debate  recounting his accomplishments, ranging from purchasing graffiti sandblasters  out of his council office budget to pushing for fences around public housing  projects. He read aloud letters of commendation sent him by city police, from  Chief Daryl F. Gates on down.  </P> <P> "If you don't have a record, you can blame the incumbent for everything,"  Bernardi said. "But then, all you people have is promises."  </P> <P> In the April 11 primary, Bernardi gained 41.5% of the vote, short of the 50%  plus one vote he needed to win. Hall came in second with 25.7%.  </P> <P> Bernardi, 77, lost a large chunk of his loyal district in 1986 as a result of  redistricting. Hall, 49, is on leave from his job as a Los Angeles city fire  captain; he was former president of the firefighters union.  </P> <P> While responding to questions posed both by the Chamber of Commerce and  audience members, Bernardi raised his voice and his fist frequently. Hall  maintained his composure throughout, often waiving his right to rebut  Bernardi's statements by saying he agreed with the incumbent.  </P> <P> Both candidates received hearty applause for their responses from large  segments of the audience.  </P> <P> A question from Eugene Hernandez prompted an exchange typical of the evening.  Hernandez asked Bernardi why he has not appointed more Latinos to city  commissions and committees. Later, Hernandez said he lives outside the district  but belongs to Local 535 of the Service Employees International Union and  supports Hall.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mayor Makes Appointments  </P> <P> In response, Bernardi said that under the City Charter, the mayor makes all  appointments and "I'll tell you the unfortunate reality: Most of them are heavy  political contributors to the appointer."  </P> <P> Hall agreed with Bernardi's assessment of the charter, but countered by  pointing out that "the lists of names that the mayor considers are provided by  the council members."  </P> <P> Several questions about crime, gangs and drugs brought familiar responses from  both candidates about the need for more police officers. Hall suggested using  more police reserves to patrol parks and shopping centers, while Bernardi said  funding should be increased so that police can work overtime rather than having  to take time off in lieu of overtime pay.  </P> <P> Hall also took a dig at one of Bernardi's endorsements, that of Arleta activist  and former Chamber of Commerce president Al Dib, who came in third in the  primary with 11.8% of the vote. Hall read from Dib's primary campaign  literature, which attacked Bernardi's absentee rate on the council and  concluded that "since Bernardi did not make the decision to retire himself,  responsible voters will have to make it for him."  </P> <P> After the debate, Dib denied any knowledge of the campaign mailer, which was  signed by the California Republican Assembly but paid for by Dib's campaign.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Didn't See It'  </P> <P> "My mailings person must have seen it, but I didn't see it until it came out,"  Dib said. "This was not put out by me."  </P> <P> Dib endorsed Bernardi in mid-April, saying Bernardi's decision to make this his  last term meant that he would "not owe developers and special interest groups  anything." He said Hall has "cold and icy" eyes and no track record in the  community.  </P> <P> However, some political observers have speculated that Dib, along with those  Latino activists who have endorsed Bernardi, are counting that Bernardi's  departure will offer them a better shot at the seat in 1993 than they would  have if Hall were to win.  </P> <P> So far, no other debates are scheduled before the June 6 election.  </P></p>

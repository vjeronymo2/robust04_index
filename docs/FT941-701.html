			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / People: Insurance companies pick new chairmen - Pearl Group John Sadler (above), 63, former deputy chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, is to be the next chairman of the Pearl Group, the UK life insurer which was bought by Australian insurance giant AMP in late 1989 for Pounds 1.2bn. He takes over in May when the present chairman Eric Lyall retires on his 70th birthday. Sadler, who began his career as a civil servant, is already chairman of the UK board of AMP and London Life, another member of the AMP Group. Pearl, which ranks among the top ten UK life companies, has over Pounds 10bn of assets under management and 10,000 staff. Sadler is a member of the board of IMRO, a trustee of the BT Pension Scheme, and was a member of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission from 1973 to 1985. He also looked at the issue of cross-media promotion for the DTI, but his recommendation that there should be a code of practice to cover how media companies promote their other business interests has yet to be implemented.</p>

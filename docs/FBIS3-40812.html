Narasimha Rao, on Wednesday announced that  presidents of Pradesh and District Congress Committee [PCC and  DCC] would henceforth be not allowed to contest the Assembly  elections.    The party rules in this regard would soon be amended, Mr Rao  said, while addressing a meeting of the Congress Parliamentary  Party (CPP) here on Wednesday morning.    The Congress president said: "If they (PCC and DCC chiefs)  (Pradesh Congress Committee, District Congress Committee) want  to contest the Assembly elections, they should resign the party  post first."    Coming down heavily on PCC and DCC presidents, Mr Rao said,  amid the thumping of desks by members that party posts should  not be treated as `stepping stones.' "It was a wrong practice on  the part of the PCC and DCC chiefs to contest the elections and  thereby confine themselves to their own constituency. They  should rather volunteer not to contest and work for all party  candidates," he added.    Mr Rao said if the PCC and DCC chiefs worked for all the  candidates contesting the elections they themselves could become  MLCs (Member of Legislative Council) or fight the next elections.    The Congress president concentrated his attention mainly on  the States going to polls next year, like Andhra Pradesh and  Karnataka, and stressed the full involvement of the party MPs  (Member of Parliament) in explaining the policies and programmes  of the government.    He said the pattern adopted in the last month's Assembly  elections in the northern States, sending district and  State-level observers three to four months before the elections  to work for the party, would be followed in the States going to  polls in the next year.    With regard to Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and other States,  where elections are due next year, State-wise in-depth study  would be undertaken and corrective actions would be taken. He  had expected that the PCCs and DCCs would take up this  responsibility, but from the feedback he had this has not  happened so far.    Mr Narasimha Rao said from now on the MPs of these States  should work out a methodology to face the challenges in the  coming elections. In the next few days, he would like to meet as  many party MPs as possible from these States for a general  assessment of the political situation in their respective States  and to evolve a strategy to be adopted by the party.    Stating that the situation in the southern States going to  polls was different from northern States, the Congress president  analysed the problems the party has to face in Andhra Pradesh  and Karnataka, such as internal squabbles and the phenomenon of  regional parties. The party's approach has to be totally  different if the Congress has to win against the regional  parties. Another factor which the party has to take note of is  the attempts of the Bahujan Samaj Party [BSP], headed by Mr  Kanshi Ram, to cut into the Dalit vote bank of Congress. The BSP  stands no chance of coming to power, but it might be able to cut  into the votes of the Congress.    He said in the normal course it was not easy to defeat the  Congress, which has a vote bank of 40 to 47 per cent of the  electorate. But, in a situation, where other parties forge a  united front with the sole objective of defeating the Congress  or where other parties raise religious and caste factors, the  party has an uphill task of politically facing the challenges.    To face such a challenge, the Congressmen and party MPs  should explain to the people the adverse impact that would have  if the Congress is defeated and the Opposition combine is  elected. The people should be educated on the fact that the  combine would disintegrate and there would be anarchy in the  country and hence it is not in their own interest and the  country's interest to elect such Opposition-combine. The people  should be educated how development would be relegated to the  back seat if the Congress was not returned to power.    Briefing reporters on the meeting, the Congress spokesman,  Mr  V.N. Gadgil, said the Prime Minister was the only speaker at the  meeting. The report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC)  on the securities scam did not figure at the meeting.</p>

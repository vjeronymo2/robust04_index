			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Yeltsin struggles to calm N Ossetia flare-up: A week of ethnic bloodshed that is the first outbreak on Russian soil since perestroika THE WAY they tell it in the regional capital of Vladikavkaz, the trouble started when an Ossetian tank accidently ran over and killed an Ingush boy. As with ethnic conflicts everywhere, one thing led to another and now, a week later, scores of Ingush houses have been set alight by the Ossetian majority. The week of bloodshed, the first on Russian soil since perestroika gave birth to ethnic conflict in the Soviet empire, has produced shock waves both in the mountainous region and Moscow. Russian president Boris Yeltsin is trying to fend off hardliners who say matters are spiralling out of control in Russia. Pre-emptively, he has deployed 3,000 elite troops and police, suspended the north Ossetian government and imposed rule from Moscow. But on Thursday, when a new truce was supposed to be in effect, black smoke rose in columns above burning Ingush homes in the district of Okyabrskaya, in the Vladikavkaz suburbs. The current fighting will eventually be stopped but the Moscow-backed crackdown looks likely at this point only to push the well-armed Ingush fighters underground and produce a guerrilla conflict in Russia's southern belly. In Vladikavkaz, local officials concede there is little if any room left for compromise. 'They should be done away with once and for all,' said north Ossetia's interior minister, General Georgy Kantimirov, of the Ingush fighters. 'When we have no armed bandits around we will be able to keep the peace.' The conflict is territorial. The Ingush are pressing an ancestral claim to part of north Ossetia - the Prigorodny region - plus half the capital of Vladikavkaz. Stalin expropriated the land from them in 1944, saying the Ingush had collaborated with Nazi Germany. The Ossetians naturally object to such a transfer of their territory and assert their own reading of the region's ethnic history. They say that Russian Cossacks were there before the Ingush. The stakes for settling the conflict soon are high, both in Moscow and the Caucasus. If Mr Yeltsin cannot demonstrate the ability to quell such trouble, he may not only strengthen the hand of his hardline critics but also lose face with the restive minorities of the federation's many other autonomous regions squirming to escape Moscow's grip. North Ossetia is only the latest hotspot in the explosive Caucasus region and Russian officials fear the upheaval there could worsen. Russia already has trouble in three autonomous republics there - Chechenia, Ingushetia and north Ossetia - and is trying to broker a peace in fighting between Georgia and its region of Abkhazia. Meanwhile, the undeclared four-year war between Armenia and Azerbaijan has deepened. Mr Yeltsin, though he claims only to want to get between the combatants, appears to have taken some risk by effectively siding with one Russian republic - north Ossetia - over another, Ingushetia. There already have been accusations that Chechenia, which is awash with weapons, is giving arms to the Ingush. The president of Chechenia, Mr Dzokar Dudaev, is openly hostile to Moscow and in the past often made calls to arms against Russia. There appears to have been no fighting so far in Vladikavkaz itself other than a shoot-out on Thursday night among comrades on the Ossetian side in the local Intourist Hotel in which several people were wounded. In the surrounding district of Prigorodny, almost all the fighting has been carried out by the north Ossetians, who have automatic rifles, bazookas and some armour. The Russian troops have established a puzzling kind of buffer-zone. Some main roads are completely open to traffic while others contain numerous, tightly-held roadblocks. The Russian troops mostly stand around nervously near their armoured personnel carriers as the bullets and artillery fly. They do not seem to have orders to fight. A few days ago, the Ingush attacked Russian interior ministry troops and, depending on who you speak to, seized between two and 10 Russian armoured personnel carriers. In one clash, the Ingush destroyed an APC with a bazooka, according to a Russian task force spokesman. Dozens of Russian soldiers have been taken hostage and an undisclosed number remain with the Ingush. No-one knows how long the fighting will go on. Mr Yeltsin said his force would remain one month, but the Russians in Vladikavkaz do not seem very optimistic about the outlook for peace. 'Some families will keep these mental scars for the rest of their lives,' said Mr Sergei Shoigu, Mr Yeltsin's deputy administrator in Vladikavkaz.</p>

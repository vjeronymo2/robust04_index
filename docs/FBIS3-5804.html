			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Cambodian First Prime  Minister Norodom Ranariddh on Friday [11 March] warned the Khmer  Rouge guerrilla group to accept a cease-fire as called for by  King Norodom Sihanouk or risk missing "the last train" to a  peaceful settlement.    "The last train will definitely leave and if they don't want  to join it...," Ranariddh told reporters at the Japan National  Press Club.    The Cambodian leader said the royal government, whose forces  are reportedly readying an assault on the Khmer Rouge's main  base at Pailin, "strongly supports" King Sihanouk's cease-fire  appeal recently conveyed to both government and Khmer Rouge  forces.    "We agree to proclaim such a cease-fire," he said, with  Co-Premier Hun Sen at his side. "The ball is now in the Khmer  Rouge camp."    The king, who is undergoing medical treatment for cancer in  Beijing, called March 7 for an "immediate ceasefire on all  fronts," as continued internecine warfare would spell "the death  of Cambodia and our race."    Ranariddh said the government wants to "leave the door  open...to those moderate elements of the Khmer Rouge to join the  national community."    Khmer Rouge radio on March 7 reportedly broadcast that Khmer  Rouge President Khieu Samphan had sent Sihanouk a letter on  March 5 in which he said the guerrilla group would fully agree  to a cease-fire on the basis of a proposal put forward by the  king on November 21.    In the proposal, which would require an amendment of the  Cambodian Constitution, the monarch suggested the Khmer Rouge be  given a role in the government if they turn over territories  under their control and integrate their guerrilla army into the  nation's unified armed forces. But Ranariddh said the Khmer  Rouge has not responded to the government call for a ceasefire  some months back.    He said the Khmer Rouge no longer constitute a "military  threat" to the government, but merely a source of insecurity.    "I think that the Khmer Rouge can definitely not any more  prevent Cambodia from going forward," he said.    The guerrilla group, which ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1978,  still controls an estimated 15 to 20 percent of the country's  territory.    Ranariddh, who was visiting Japan to attend an international  conference on Cambodian reconstruction, said that providing an  improved standard of living for the populace will deprive the  Khmer Rouge of its support base.    "To fight and to win over the Khmer Rouge in a lasting  manner, we do not need only arms and weapons. We need more than  that -- the development of the country," he said.</p>

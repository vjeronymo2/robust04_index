			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Health insurance that won't bleed you dry / A look at the options for budget-price treatment THE COST of private medical insurance has been rising by well above the rate of inflation. This, combined with the recession, has led to a wave of policy cancellations. So, insurers have been fighting back with new budget policies designed to cover the basics. Fear of long NHS waiting lists is the main reason many people think of buying private cover. While the government's much-trumpeted campaign to cut waiting lists might have reduced your chances of having to wait two years for a routine operation, many people are still waiting a year or more, often in considerable discomfort, for non-urgent procedures such as hip replacements or hernia repairs. One of the commonest devices used to lower the cost of private medical insurance is the six-week rule. This means that once a consultant has said you need to go to hospital, you use the NHS if it has a waiting list of less than six weeks for that operation. But if the wait would be longer than six weeks, you get private treatment immediately. The six-week rule is, however, one of the most misunderstood concepts in insurance. Many people believe it means they must wait six weeks for private treatment. The important thing to understand is that it means you should never have to wait more than six weeks for treatment, whether in the NHS or privately. You must remember, though, that signing up for private cover is not going to help you jump the queue if you already have a problem which needs treatment. Medical cover is the same as any other insurance: it is intended to pay out if the unexpected happens, not for certainties. If you have a medical problem already, most insurers will accept you for cover but will exclude treatment for that condition, or anything related to it, either permanently or for at least two years. This provides a powerful incentive to join a medical insurance scheme while you are young and healthy, and to stick with the same insurer. Apart from the six-week rule, the other main cost-cutting methods behind budget policies are annual cash limits, the exclusion of most outpatient treatment, and a limited choice of hospitals. Some schemes include all these elements, which can make them difficult to understand. Jan Lawson, of specialist intermediary Private Health Partnership, emphasises the importance of understanding exactly how a scheme works, and what is covered, when you join so as to avoid disappointment later. Both Lawson and Irene Gallimore of Medisure, another specialist broker, pick the Norwich Union Personal Care scheme as a budget policy worth considering. This policy is very basic, in that it excludes virtually all consultations and treatment as an out-patient. But it does not impose any cash limits on in-patient treatment and there is no waiting period. Gallimore also likes Norwich's Express Care Six, which is a comprehensive policy with a six-week rule. Unlike some six-week policies, it pays for consultations before it is clear whether you need private hospital treatment. But Lawson generally is wary of six-week rule policies because so many people find them confusing. Exclusions Most insurers have a similar list of basic exclusions, such as chronic or terminal illnesses (such as kidney failure and Aids), self-inflicted conditions (eg, alcohol-related), voluntary procedures (vasectomy, infertility treatment) and run-of-the-mill expenses such as dentistry and spectacles. Other exclusions can vary between insurers and policies. Gallimore says two to watch for are psychiatric care and pregnancy complications. Mental illness is surprisingly common and has a wide definition. If, for example, your teenage daughter developed the slimmers' disease, anorexia, a psychiatric exclusion would come into effect. Healthy pregnancy is excluded by all but a handful of policies but complications are covered by some, often with the proviso that 10 months must have elapsed since the policy started. As Gallimore points out: 'You don't get pregnancy waiting lists in the NHS'  -but it can be reassuring to know that, if there are complications, you can opt for private care. Choice of hospitals Hospital accommodation is usually graded A, B or C, according to the standard of the private rooms (not the quality of medical care). Some private hospitals have only grade A accommodation, while others offer a range. Hospital charges for ancillary services also vary, so some policies use only hospitals with lower charges. Some budget policies are restricted to basic accommodation, while others offer a choice. A few insurers go by post code, as hospitals in London and other cities tend to be in the upper price bracket. A 45-year-old in central London would, for example, pay Pounds 43.73 a month for a Norwich Union Expresscare Six policy, compared with Pounds 19.97 for someone living in a cheaper area. If your post code is highly rated, you could opt for a policy with a choice of grades, or with uniform rates for the whole country. WPA and Norwich both have policies which use only private beds in NHS hospitals. Another Norwich scheme, Local Care, makes you choose in advance the one hospital where you could receive treatment - but offers you a list of about 43 around the country. Other discounts One tip from Gallimore is to check if your employer, or any other group or organisation of which you are a member, has a group scheme which could give you a discount. Even holders of some credit cards are eligible for discounts. If you have no ready-made group, you could try persuading colleagues, friends or relatives to form one. Several insurers offer no-claims discounts. For each year you do not make a claim, your premium is reduced by a set percentage. This discourages people from making small claims, which push up administration costs. Lawson thinks no-claims discounts are a good idea but cautions that you should first check what the standard premium is: some insurers offer 'introductory discounts' of up to 30 per cent which means that, if you claim in the first year, you could find your premiums shooting up by that amount. A more predictable way of securing a discount is by agreeing to pay an excess - a fixed amount towards every claim. Again, this is intended to discourage small claims. Bupa has discounts for fixed excesses of Pounds 100-Pounds 250 while Ohra, a Dutch insurer, has a system which gives discounts of up to 37.5 per cent if you agree to pay up to 50 per cent of the standard annual premium. For a 45-year-old with a Medios policy using Band C accommodation, agreeing to a 50 per cent excess (Pounds 142.50) would cut premiums from Pounds 25.00 to Pounds 15.63 a month. With a 30 per cent excess (Pounds 116.28), premiums would be Pounds 20.63. Some insurers, such as the Norwich Union, give discounts for paying annually rather than monthly. How to buy Medical insurance is often sold through direct marketing - a leaflet is sent with your bank or credit card statement, or falls out of a magazine. The problem here is knowing how what you are being offered compares with other cover available. Lawson recommends comparing policy terms between a comprehensive policy and a budget one, so you can see exactly what is left out. 'The worst culprits are when some of the cheaper policies are being sold by direct mail,' she says. 'They are marketed as if they were full schemes.' If you are confused by the hundreds of subtly different schemes on the market, you could ask an independent financial adviser for help, or approach one of the specialist medical insurance brokers. Medisure operates a telephone advice line* which can help to narrow down which policies, from the vast range on the market, are most likely to meet your needs. Private Health Partnership, charges a Pounds 10 initial fee for an information pack and detailed questionnaire, based on which it recommends one or two suitable plans. It is then up to you whether you buy the policy and, if so, whether you buy it through PHP. Both Medisure and PHP earn commission on policies bought through them. If you buy through an independent intermediary, most offer a back-up service to help you when you make a claim, or if you have any problems with the company. *Medisure advice line: tel. 0272-702 122, Monday to Friday, 9-5, and ask for information on individual medical cover.

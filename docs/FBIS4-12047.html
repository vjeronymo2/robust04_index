			<p>BFN     [Text] The pilgrimage to the House of God is a religious  and political duty demanded of world Muslims by the blessed and  supreme God who ordered his great prophet to declare the  necessity of Muslims departing toward this house from the  furtherest corners of the world. While no one has the right to  question and doubt the necessity of this great duty and while  the need to adhere to this religious rite has an ever increasing  importance in today's world, is it right for some to obstruct  the path of departure of Muslims toward the House of God and to  be among those who obstruct the path of God and who hinder the  departure toward this House?    While some holy and religious cities easily welcome and  house  over two million pilgrims a day throughout the year, is it  dignified for an Islamic country such as Saudi Arabia, which  enjoys so much God-given wealth, to claim that it is not able to  provide suitable and necessary services for the pilgrims of the  House of God? Is it basically befitting for a wealthy country  such as Saudi Arabia to express inability and impotence in  providing services at the time of this religious duty of world  Muslim people?    If there really is a disability in the management of the  holy  sanctuaries and in provision of services to the pilgrims, it  would be suitable for this to be announced to Islamic  governments so that the affluent and able Islamic countries can  come to aid and assist the government of Arabia in a decent  administration of the pilgrimage duty. However, to prevent the  departure of enthusiastic Iranian pilgrims, who have waited for  years for their turn to visit the House of the Friend, the  government of Arabia has brought up the subject of accepting  quotas of one-thousandth or a thousand pilgrims per one million  population.    There are a number of significant issues involved here, the  first of which is the fact that the quota system has no basis in  religious laws and there are no references to this in either the  Koran or the tradition of the prophet. To the contrary -- the  prevention of visits to the mosques of God or blocking the path  of God and the House of God have been the subject of rebuke and  censure. Second, while many Islamic countries and Muslim  nations are not able to send as many pilgrims as their declared  quotas, should there be any constraints -- from the point of  view of religious law -- in increasing the quota of countries  such as Iran? Furthermore has the acceptance of 120,000  Iranian pilgrims caused any problems in the past?    Why should the government of Arabia accept more than the  announced pilgrim quotas from some other countries but when it  comes to the Muslim people of Iran the matter is left to  detailed accounting? It is possible to point to these nations  -- including Egypt -- whose population is less than Iran, but  the government of Arabia accepts tens of thousands more of their  pilgrims than their claimed quota.    The other important point is that this quota system was  planned and administered after the tragic killing of pilgrims to  the divine sanctuary in 1987. This indicates that the  government of Arabia has taken a political stance regarding the  pilgrimage and is playing a political game with the religious  duties of people. Of course, political experts and analysts  more or less understand the sensitivity and negative  consequences of such act.    While the Islamic world is facing an extensive military and  cultural offensive by the West and its regional agents and while  Muslims are the target of extensive anti-moral and anti-Islamic  bombardments through satellites or books such as apostate Salman  Rushdie's Satanic Verses and while in Bosnia, Palestine,  Kashmir, Somalia, and Algeria world Muslim are killed by  Westerners or their agents, is it suitable for this congregation  of pilgrims -- which is the most important gathering and  congress of Islamic unity against the above aggressions -- to be  limited or for religious duties to be restrained?    It is necessary for the government of Arabia to look at this  issue from a brotherly point of view -- which has always been  emphasized by Islamic Iran -- and to remove those officials who  might cause, even with a hint from foreigners, such unnecessary  problems between the two Muslim nations and countries and thus  prepare the grounds for a better administration of the glorious  religious duty of pilgrimage.    Presently Islamic Iran, according to the agreement of the  foreign ministers of the two countries in Oman, is preparing  itself for the dispatch of 120,000 Iranian pilgrims and is ready  to start the great operation for their transfer to Arabia.  Arabia's adherence to the Koranic principle of fulfilling  covenant, which is the very basis of international law and  relations, is a religious and moral duty that will in turn open  the way for the administration of ceremonies by the enthusiastic  pilgrims of the House of God.</p>

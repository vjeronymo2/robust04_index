			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Israeli-PLO negotiators inch towards full talks A month after the Hebron mosque massacre forced the suspension of Israeli-PLO peace talks, officials on both sides indicated yesterday that most of the terms for resumption of negotiations had been agreed. Israeli and PLO officials intend to meet again in Cairo on Tuesday to finalise arrangements for the temporary deployment of about 100 lightly-armed Norwegian observers in the West Bank town of Hebron, in accordance with a UN resolution passed last week, and for the recruitment of several dozen Palestinian policemen to serve in the town. Provided these details can be swiftly agreed, the two delegations will broaden their discussions and focus on the 'Gaza and Jericho first' autonomy deal - effectively resuming full peace talks. Before Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein massacred 30 Palestinians in Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs on February 25, the autonomy deal was close to completion. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, estimated yesterday that it could be ready for signing within three weeks. The Israelis have committed themselves to an accelerated withdrawal of most of their forces from Gaza and Jericho once the agreement is signed. It is also believed that the deployment of a first contingent of Palestinian policemen would go ahead. A senior US official indicated last night that such a deployment could begin by next Friday. Signs of a diplomatic breakthrough have done little to ease the tension in the occupied territories. Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza observed a general strike yesterday in honour of the Hebron massacre victims and a curfew was imposed on the towns of Ramallah and al-Birah. A Jewish settler shot dead a West Bank Palestinian who was kneeling in prayer by a highway in southern Israel.</p>

L. Lidov [deceased], M. A. Vashkovyak, </F> Institute of Applied Mathematics imeni M. V. Keldysh, Russian  Academy of Sciences; UDC 521.3]    [Abstract] At present, the gravitational constant  G is known to an accuracy of four significant figures  only, i.e., G = (6.67259+/-0.00085) x  10[.sup]-11[/] m[.sup]3[/] kg[.sup]-1[/]  s[.sup]-2[/]. Small spherical objects with inert masses of  m[.sub]0[/] and m are usually used to  ascertain G, but they cannot be launched into open  space, because too many factors produce disturbing influences.  The objects, therefore, must be contained in a shell that  protects them from such factors. The researchers here point to  the wisdom of using so-called quasisatellite orbits for the  work. The properties of those orbits are described with  perturbation theory and the calculation of periodic  quasisatellite orbits. In the latter case, only periodic orbits  with a rather large number of intersections k possess  the typical properties of quasisatellite orbits of the general  type. Perturbation theory enables the determination of the  approximate values of the initial parameters for orbits with  specific properties, i.e., a given number of intersections  k and given minimum and maximum separations of  m[.sub]0[/] and m.

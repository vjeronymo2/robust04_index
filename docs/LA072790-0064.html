			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 500,000 IN COUNTY TO GET NEW ZIP CODES  </P> <P> The U.S. Postal Service will introduce new ZIP codes for about 500,000 San  Diego County residents living south of Interstate 8 outside San Diego city  limits, Postal Service spokesman Ken Boyd said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The new ZIP codes, which should be introduced early next year, will have a 919  prefix, a code never used before anywhere.  </P> <P> The city of San Diego will remain covered almost entirely by ZIPs with 921  prefixes, and the part of the county north of I-8 will continue to have 920  prefixes. Those two ZIP prefixes are the only ones now in use in the county.  </P> <P> ZIP is an acronym for Zoning Improvement Plan.  </P> <P> The only residents and businesses affected will be those in South County and  San Ysidro, which will change to a 92173 ZIP code. Many post-office box holders  throughout the county have already received new ZIPs.  </P> <P> Boyd said, in what he termed "a very rough guess," that about 500,000 people  will be affected.  </P> <P> The change comes as postal officials are trying to streamline service in the  county with automated sorting systems, machines that read ZIP codes and sort  mail without human operators.  </P> <P> Introduction of a new ZIP code was inevitable because of the rise in the area's  population, Boyd said.  </P> <P> He said the postal service wants to have a second sorting plant operating by  the end of 1993. Bids on that structure, to be located off Interstate 15 near  Carmel Mountain Road, are scheduled to be taken in about a year. A sorting  depot on Midway Drive near Lindbergh Field now handles mail for the entire  county.  </P> <P> According to Mike Cannone, postal service communications manager in San Diego,  two things could happen once both plants are operating. The Midway Drive  facility might sort just city mail and the new plant county mail.  </P> <P> Or, the new plant might sort all mail coming into the county, while the Midway  Drive plant would handle all mail going out of the county, which would make the  best use of its proximity to the airport, Cannone said.  </P> <P> The Postal Service will begin its official by-mail notification of the ZIP code  change to residents and businesses within four weeks, Boyd said.  </P> <P> In San Ysidro, a community protest erupted two weeks ago after Postal Service  letters to post-office box holders there mistakenly stated that the community's  postal designation would be changed from San Ysidro to San Diego.  </P> <P> San Ysidro is one of two communities within the city of San Diego that does not  already have a 921 prefix. The Postal Service meant to inform them that their  their ZIP, not their city designation, would change.  </P> <P> "The mistake was made by someone who didn't realize the sensitivity of the  issue," Boyd said. "No wonder they were all up in arms." The people will get  letters within a week alerting them to the mistake.  </P> <P> The ZIP code for street addresses in the heavily Latino community will change  from 92073 to 92173, and post office boxes will be 92143.  </P> <P> The only locale within the city of San Diego that will not have a 921 prefix is  La Jolla, which will retain its 92037 ZIP for street addresses.  </P> <P> Cannone said two things make La Jolla different -- the fact that it has its own  postmaster, which San Ysidro does not, and its proximity to the other 920  prefix locations.  </P> <P> San Ysidro, on the other hand, will be wedged between 919 and 921 prefixes.  </P> <P> "ZIP codes are assigned because of the political realities and the operational  needs at the time," Cannone said.  </P> <P> He said Coronado will retain its 921 prefix.  </P></p>

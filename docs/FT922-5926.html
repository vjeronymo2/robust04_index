			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Flextech quits oil with Pounds 55m buy-out of Expro FLEXTECH is leaving the oil business which carried it to the USM just nine years ago in favour of children's television. The company yesterday announced a Pounds 55.3m management buy-out of Expro, its Aberdeen-based oil services subsidiary. Shareholders will get a piece of the action through a complicated deal which allows Flextech to pay Pounds 41.6m - amounting to 120p per share - in place of a dividend. The agreement is structured so shareholders, rather than the company, will pay tax on the sum. Mr Roger Luard, Flextech director, said the company would retain Pounds 14m of the proceeds to pay off debt and fund development of media interests. The main holding, an indirect 50.1 per cent stake in The Children's Channel, showed losses of Pounds 3m last year. Mr Luard said Flextech intended to concentrate on the opportunities for children's and family programming in the growing satellite and cable markets. By 1995 in the UK alone, he said, it was estimated that there would be between 8m and 9m cable subscribers, compared with just 500,000 this year. The Expro purchase was backed by CINVen, the venture capital group.</p>

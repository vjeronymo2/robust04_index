			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, 16 Apr (MENA)--'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Rifa'i,  Syrian ambassador to Turkey, has stressed that his country is  against the establishment of an independent Kurdish state in  northern Iraq, and that Syria will engage in methods other than  diplomacy to prevent this from happening.    In an interview with a MENA correspondent in Ankara,  al-Rifa'i pointed out that Iraq must be united as any other Arab  country. He noted that although the Syrian and Iraqi  governments have differences, the establishment of a separate  state in northern Iraq is another matter. The differences, he  added, will not prevent Syria from using its means to stand  alongside the Iraqi people in the face of this conspiracy. He  also stressed his country will not use the Kurdistan Workers  Party, which is outlawed in Turkey, as a source of pressure on  Ankara to reach a water sharing agreement.    Al-Rifa'i pointed out that Syria has as much right to the  water in the Tigris and Euphrates as Turkey does, adding that  the Syrian Government still wants an agreement among Syria,  Iraq, and Turkey on the Tigris and Euphrates water, because the  present situation cannot continue. He said his country is not  against Turkey's selling water to Israel, but it prefers for  Ankara to play the water card to put pressure on Israel to  withdraw from the occupied Arab territories.    Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said during his  recent  visit to Turkey that Israel is a democratic state. Ambassador  al-Rifa'i said that these remarks are meant to pacify the  Turkish people and to convince them that Israel is a  peace-loving country and that it is the Arabs who are rejecting  peace.    The Syrian ambassador stressed that Peres lied, since more  than 12,000 Palestinian prisoners are locked up in Israeli  jails. He added that Israel has failed to implement the  Gaza-Jericho agreement on time.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Regional party committee Secretary Zhao Fulin  carried out in-depth and conscientious investigations and study  in Guilin City on 20-24 May, trying to explore new ways and  means of revitalizing state-owned enterprises.    During his stay in Guilin, Zhao emphatically stated:  State-owned enterprises should fully engage in market-oriented  production, further tap latent potentialities, improve overall  performance, and comprehensively raise economic efficiency.  Over the last two years, Guilin City has energetically  implemented a series of State Council regulations aimed at  shifting operative mechanisms among industrial enterprises owned  by the whole people, as well as all regional measures to this  end, and carried out comprehensive enterprise reform in 35  enterprises on a trial basis with the result that some eight  enterprises have been omprehensively transformed while seven  others have trial-implemented an input-output contract system.  Besides, 10 enterprises have either adopted on a trial basis  the operative mechanism pertaining to township and town  enterprises or managed their production in exactly the same way  as township and town enterprises do. More than 40 enterprises  in the region have also reorganized themselves into joint-stock  companies with limited liabilities or companies with limited  liabilities. These reform measures have been implemented with  an eye to shifting enterprise operative mechanism and have  infused fresh vitality into the region's state-owned industrial  enterprises.    Zhao fully affirmed Guilin's achievements with respect to  reform and development in the last two years, saying: At  present, we should make energetic efforts to push ahead with all  types of reforms with a view to building a socialist market  economic structure. Moreover, we should make continued efforts  to delegate genuine operational decisionmaking powers to all  enterprises, readjust industrial structures, improve the  investment environment, invite more advanced foreign technology,  step up cooperation with hinterland units, and absorb more  foreign capital in order to accelerate technological  transformation and new product development.    Speaking of revitalizing state-owned enterprises, Zhao  emphatically noted: First and foremost, we should  conscientiously implement and carry out a recent State Economic  and Trade Commission decision on unfolding activities of  shifting operative mechanisms, improving management, tapping  latent potentialities, and increasing efficiency among all  enterprises across the country. To this end, all enterprises in  the region should earnestly carry out market-oriented  production, tap latent potentialities, further deepen labor,  personnel, and distribution systems reforms, and establish an  effective profit-related incentive mechanism and an effective  profit-related restriction mechanism. Only by tapping latent  potentialities will state-owned enterprises be able to  demonstrate bright development prospects. So long as they make  continue efforts to develop more readily marketable new products  and constantly improve product quality, state-owned enterprises  will certainly achieve excellent economic efficency; second, we  should strive to push ahead with property rights system reform,  establish a modern enterprise system conformable to a market  economy, capable of separating functions of the government from  those of the enterprise, and characterized by clearly defined  property rights, responsibilities and powers, and by scientific  management as well, this being a fundamental way out for  state-owned enterprises. Enterprise property rights system  reform, Zhao noted, can take a variety of forms, including  implementation of a joint-stock system. Apart from implementing  a joint-stock system, we should also try to set up companies  with limited liabilities and implement a joint-stock cooperative  system, transfer property rights by establishing joint venture  enterprises, merging enterprises, or establishing large groups  of companies. We should declare bankrupt on a trial basis and  in accordance with the law a number of long-standing loss-making  enterprises with no hope of recovery and even publicly auction a  number of long-standing loss-making small enterprises incapable  of repaying their debts. Nevertheless, these reform measures,  Zhao said, should be tried in light of actual conditions in the  enterprises concerned.    Zhao also called for studying and working out reform  measures  suited to the region's specific enterprises in accordance with  the state regulations concerned.</p>

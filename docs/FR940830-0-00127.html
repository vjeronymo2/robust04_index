L. 102&hyph;381, 106 Stat. 1374), and the pertinent regulations in effect on August 31, 1993, will be considered a proper certification filing for a waiver of payment of the maintenance fee due on August 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The affidavit of assessment work performed by a small miner claiming a maintenance fee waiver shall be filed with the proper BLM office pursuant to &sect;3833.2 and shall meet the requirements of &sect;3833.2&hyph;4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) For mining claims and sites covered by a waiver, the filing of a waiver certification pursuant to any of paragraphs (a), (d), (e), or (f) of this section will satisfy the requirements for filing of a notice of intention to hold pursuant to &sect;3833.2&hyph;5, when such notice of intention to hold is otherwise required. In such a case the payment of the $5 service charge per claim/site for processing the notice of intention to hold is due upon filing of the waiver statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In order to hold mining claims or sites for the assessment year beginning at 12 o'clock noon on September 1, 1994, each small miner shall file a waiver certification on or before August 31, 1994. Each small miner shall file a waiver certification on or before August 31 each year thereafter to hold the claims each assessment year beginning at 12 o'clock noon on September 1 of the calendar year the certification is due, through August 31, 1998. The small miner shall document, as provided in this paragraph (d), the claimed waiver for each assessment year a small miner's waiver is claimed, certified, and attested to under penalty of 18 U.S.C. 1001.

To be excused from paying the maintenance fee, the person cannot hold the subject claim or site with a related party, as defined in paragraph 3833.0&hyph;5(y), who does not also qualify under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The notice must be filed in the assessment year that the person entered active duty status, or if active duty began prior to August 30, 1994, the notice must be filed in the assessment year that he or she wishes the benefits provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to take effect. If the person previously filed a notice under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act to be excused from performing assessment work, and remains qualified under that Act, he or she will automatically be exempt from paying the maintenance fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

AD/M-19 congressmen, contrary to what  has been reported in some media, have confirmed their solidarity  with Antonio Navarro. The AD/M-19 congressmen will meet in Santa  Fe de Bogota at 0900 today to begin a new course, a new boost to  Antonio Navarro's candidacy.    Jose Cuesta is one of the AD/M-19 leaders proposing Navarro  give up his candidacy and that Ramon Jimeno should be the  presidential candidate and Gustavo Petro should be the vice  presidential candidate for the AD/M-19, but Gustavo Petro has  said he does not accept Jose Cuesta's proposal and supports  Antonio Navarro.</p>

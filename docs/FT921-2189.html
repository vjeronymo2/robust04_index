			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Sotheby's drops 86% to Dollars 22m despite strong final quarter SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS, the auction house, made up for losses earlier in the year in its fourth quarter to report pre-tax profits of Dollars 21.5m (Pounds 12.4m) for 1991. However, this was 86 per cent lower than the 1990 figure of Dollars 154.6m. The fourth quarter pre-tax profit was Dollars 30.4m (Dollars 42.9m). Even so, Sotheby's held its total dividend at 60 cents, although earnings per share were down to 25 cents, (about 14p) compared with Dollars 1.66. Earlier this week Christies International, Sotheby's rival, also reported a sharp fall in earnings but cut its dividend. Sotheby's shares were unchanged at 825p. Mr Michael Ainslie, Sotheby's president and chief executive officer, said there were signs that the art market was picking up again. He said that the 1992 dividend would be reconsidered during the year if Sotheby's felt that earnings would not reach 60 cents. Mr Ainslie countered claims by Christies to have increased market share to 48 per cent by saying that Sotheby's market share had risen again in the early months of 1992 and that Sotheby's made proportionally larger profits from its share of the market. Like Christies, Sotheby's suffered from the souring of the market for impressionist and contemporary paintings after the inflated prices seen in the late 1980s. Mr Ainslie said that the market hit bottom in the first half of last year and improved in the second half. So far this year sales were 12 per cent ahead of the same period last year. In 1991 auction sales totalled Dollars 1.1bn (Dollars 2.4bn) with the number of lots sold down from 180,000 to 135,000. But the fall in total revenues was less severe to Dollars 222m (Dollars 378m). Revenues from auctions were Dollars 194m, 17.6 per cent of auction sales, down from Dollars 347m or 14.2 per cent of sales. The improved margin reflected higher vendor commissions on lower priced lots. Operating profits from auctions were Dollars 12.1m (Dollars 139m). Sotheby's finance operations - lending to sellers ahead of auctions - made an operating profit of Dollars 7.8m (Dollars 8.1m), while the international real estate business increased profits to Dollars 312,000 (Dollars 52,000). Costs had been cut by Dollars 42m to Dollars 198m, Mr Ainslie said, and this would mean that slight revenue gains this year would have a larger impact on profits. Interest income fell from Dollars 14.6m to Dollars 6.85m. COMMENT Unlike Christies, which jacked up its dividend to unsustainable levels in the late 1980s, Sotheby's feels justified in maintaining its pay-out in a difficult year. It appears to think it could earn enough to cover a repeat payment in 1992 which suggests a p/e of about 24 or less and a yield of 5.6 per cent. But that would translate to pre-tax profits of about Dollars 70m, a rather steep recovery even if costs come down another 5 per cent and confidence rebuilds in the art market. A more conservative estimate might be about Dollars 40m pre-tax, with a correspondingly higher p/e. Investment in the shares demands faith in the long-term growth of the art market. Sotheby's shares have outperformed Christies' of late, but on balance look the better bet.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Oscar Camilion yesterday confirmed  that there is a UN weapons embargo on Liberia. This has  frustrated the sale of Argentine weapons worth $34 million.    Camilion denied to Radio Mitre that the operation was vetoed  by the Foreign Ministry. He admitted that the sale "was  canceled when the Foreign Ministry informed us of a UN weapons  embargo on Liberia." All weapons sales abroad must be approved  by a committee made up of high-ranking officials from the  Defense, Foreign, and Economy Ministries.    The shipment to Liberia included 15 155-mm cannons, light  weapons -- such as FAL [Light Automatic Rifle] rifles --  ammunition, and explosives.    The operation had made so much progress that the Military  Industries had already dispatched the first consignment of  weapons from the factory in Rio Tercero, Cordoba, on 80 trucks  to the military factory in Pilar before its shipment.    The Defense minister said "two orders had been received: one  was ruled out because it was for Croatia, on which there is a  weapons embargo; and the other was for Liberia. We were  informed at the last minute that there is a UN weapons embargo  on Liberia."    The first time the deal came to light was when a group of  Radical Civic Union deputies, headed by Antonio Berhongaray,  asked last week if weapons would be sold to Croatia.    The great suspicion stemming from the frustrated operation  to  Liberia is that this poor country does not have $34 million in  cash, unless it is acting as a "front" for the purchase. The  shipment may be a triangular operation by Liberia, under which  the arms would end up in Croatia, which is at war with Serbia  within the former Yugoslavia.    Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella said that "at no  moment" would a triangular operation to send weapons to a  country in conflict, like Croatia, have been allowed.    It is not just that weapon sales to Croatia are prohibited  by  the United Nations, the operation would have caused problems for  the Argentine Army battalion that is among the UN peace forces  in the Balkans. In face of an operation of this kind, the Serbs  could have retaliated against the Argentine Blue Helmets.    Camilion's remarks do not answer all doubts that stem from  this controversial operation. The first is, if the Argentine  Foreign Ministry reported the existence of an embargo, how come  part of the order was shipped on 80 trucks and a draft decree  authorizing the sale signed?    Official sources told CLARIN that during an initial  consultation, a mid-ranking Foreign Ministry official informed  the Military Industries that there was no objection to the  operation. That is why so much progress was made.    However, given the importance of the subject, Camilion spoke  on 3 March with a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official who  confirmed that in principle there was no problem with the  operation. The following day, however, the diplomat reported  that there was a weapons embargo on Liberia which forced the  Military Industries to suspend the operation which would have  saved it for this year from the financial crisis in which it  finds itself.</p>

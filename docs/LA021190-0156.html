			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE SENATOR FOLDS EFFORT TO REVISE GAMING LAW;  </P> <P> GAMBLING: THE BILL WAS WITHDRAWN WHEN NO AGREEMENT COULD BE REACHED ON ALLOWING  JACKPOT POKER.  </P> <P> A bill introduced last year by state Sen. Robert G. Beverly to overhaul  California's 99-year-old gaming law appears to be dead in Sacramento. But the  issue could be revived if card club owners and law enforcement authorities can  reach an agreement on whether to allow jackpot poker.  </P> <P> The bill, drafted last year by city managers in Bell, Bell Gardens, Huntington  Park, Gardena and Commerce, would repeal the present gaming law and clarify  what games would be allowed in the state's casinos.  </P> <P> Beverly, a Manhattan Beach Republican, withdrew his bill from consideration by  the Senate Governmental Organization Committee when an agreement could not be  reached on whether jackpot poker should be allowed.  </P> <P> The bill would outlaw jackpot poker, a provision endorsed by the California  Peace Officers Assn. and opposed by the California Card Room Owners Assn.  </P> <P> Under present jackpot poker rules, players compete for two pots -- a regular  pot that is won on each deal and a bonus pot that accumulates over days or  weeks. The jackpot grows -- often to as much as $70,000 at the larger clubs --  until it is won by a player with a specific hand that varies depending on the  game being played.  </P> <P> If an agreement can be reached, it is possible that the measure still could be  considered during this session, according to Joshua Pane, a spokesman for  Beverly.  </P> <P> "The bill did not get a hearing because there just wasn't agreement, so why  move forward?" Pane asked. Beverly agreed to sponsor the bill, Pane said,  because he had been assured that card club owners and law enforcement officials  could reach a compromise.  </P> <P> Bell Gardens City Manager Claude Booker still hopes that a consensus can be  reached. "We are not giving up on it," said Booker, who spearheaded efforts by  the city managers to revise the current law.  </P> <P> The law, which dates from 1891, includes regulations on such outdated games as  hokey pokey and fan-tan. The new legislation would deal with more current  games, such as pai gow, a popular form of Asian poker, and jackpot poker, both  of which would be outlawed.  </P> <P> Although both games are being played in Los Angeles area clubs, their legality  has been the subject of recent court battles. The new law would allow two other  forms of Asian poker, Super Pan 9 and double-handed poker, and would also allow  7-card stud and draw poker.  </P> <P> In the complex issue of jackpot poker, a Superior Court judge issued a  temporary injunction last year that allowed the game to be played in Los  Angeles County pending a trial. That suit was brought by the Eldorado Club and  the Normandie Casino in Gardena, the Bell Gardens Bicycle Club and the  California Commerce Casino. No date has been set for the trial.  </P> <P> But jackpot poker has been halted in more than 300 card rooms elsewhere in the  state, Department of Justice officials said.  </P> <P> Jerry Clemons, chairman of the Peace Officers Assn. gambling committee, said  the legality of jackpot poker is the last remaining "sticking point" in  discussions that have been going on for years between law enforcement officials  and card room owners about which games should be legal.  </P> <P> Last year, after the association's gambling committee asked for an opinion on  whether jackpot poker violated state gaming laws, the state attorney general's  office issued an opinion calling the game an illegal lottery.  </P> <P> Clemons, who also is director of the division of law enforcement with the state  attorney general's office, said club owners and police have worked "for months  on end to define clearly what games could be played and how they could be  played to get clarity in the law for the industry and for law enforcement."  </P> <P> But Clemons expressed doubt that an agreement can be reached about jackpot  poker. "I don't see any way it can be resolved." he said. "It appears whatever  clarity we're going to get (will be) from the courts and not the legislation."  </P> <P> Clemons said law enforcement officials remain opposed to jackpot poker because  some players have complained to police that when they win the jackpot, they do  not receive the entire amount in the pot.  </P> <P> "We know in some cases money is skimmed off and not given to the players,"  Clemons said. "The players say they don't get the whole jackpot."  </P> <P> Ron Sarakbi, president of the Card Room Owners Assn., said the group has  proposed that the licensing agencies that monitor club revenues also monitor  jackpots.  </P> <P> Sarakbi said his group will be meeting today to discuss a compromise proposal  that would revise the jackpot poker rules.  </P> <P> The game is often played as low-ball jackpot poker, in which the second-lowest  hand possible wins the jackpot if another player has the lowest hand possible,  which is ace, two, three, four and five. The second-lowest hand must be ace,  two, three, four and six. While the second-lowest hand would win the jackpot,  the lowest hand would take the pot for that particular game. The attorney  general's opinion said the game is illegal because the aspect of chance  dominates over skill.  </P> <P> Under revised rules being proposed by card club owners, the best hand would win  the jackpot, Sarakbi said, and therefore skill would be the decisive factor in  who wins.  </P> <P> "We would like to definitely reach an agreement and get this legislation," said  Sarakbi, who is also general manager of the California Commerce Club. "This  would clear up the whole industry and get a definite understanding between the  Police Officers Assn. and the club owners so each side would know exactly where  they stand."  </P></p>

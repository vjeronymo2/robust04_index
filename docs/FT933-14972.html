			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Spanish judge again rules against KIO SPAIN'S senior financial crimes judge has for the third time this year rejected efforts by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) to open criminal proceedings against the former chairman of the KIO, Sheikh Fahad Mohammed Al Sabah, and the former management of the KIO's troubled Spanish industrial investments. The KIO claims that it lost all Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) invested in Spain in the mid-1980s because of mismanagement and that up to Dollars 500m of this was stolen. The judge, rejecting a new KIO writ on Friday, said the Kuwaitis had produced no new evidence and there was no evidence in the writ of criminal conduct. The KIO will appeal, for the second time. The KIO's efforts coincide with indications that a civil writ issued against many of the same defendants in London is also likely to become bogged down in arguments over jurisdiction.</p>

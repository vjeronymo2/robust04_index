			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Fed boosts Dollars The varied fortunes of the US dollar caused hectic activity in foreign exchange markets yesterday as the US Federal Reserve announced the first tightening of monetary policy in nearly five years, writes Philip Gawith. After the Fed's late afternoon announcement of a 25 basis points increase in the Federal Funds rate, the dollar rose in heavy trading by over 3 pfennigs as the market took heart from the prospect of higher rates and confirmation of US economic recovery. Although profit-taking pushed the dollar lower as the London market closed, it later rose again in New York and was trading yesterday evening above the DM1.76 level, the strongest level since August 1991 and nearly three pfennigs above Thursday's close of DM1.7314. Yesterday evening sterling was trading at Dollars 1.4750, almost 2 1/2 cents down on Thursday's close. The US rate move put the D-Mark under pressure and it showed losses on most crosses within the ERM. Earlier in the afternoon the dollar fell below DM1.7350 when the release of lower than expected US employment figures dashed hopes of higher interest rates. Although yesterday's announcement by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, surprised the market, he had hinted at his intentions on Monday when he told a congressional committee that rates would have to be raised at some point. He said the central bank would 'increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions' in order to put upward pressure on rates. The Fed's decision was welcomed in the market as a vindication of the sustainability of economic recovery in the US. Mr Greenspan himself stressed this view saying 'The decision was taken to move towards a less accommodative stance in monetary policy in order to sustain and enhance the economic expansion.' This view was endorsed by Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS in London, who said the Fed's move was prompted not by concerns about existing levels of inflation, but 'as an insurance policy to ensure that in the longer term inflation remains under control.' Mr Chertkow said the Fed had moved too slowly and too late when cutting rates as the economy went into recession and Mr Greenspan was anxious to avoid repeating these errors in the opposite direction. Another view of the announcement is that it underlines the determination of Mr Greenspan to show the Fed's independence from the US administration. Observers said the timing of the announcement might indicate an anxiety on the part of the Fed to tighten policy before President Clinton had time to fill the two vacancies which currently exist on the Fed board. Mr Clinton said last week that he saw no need for interest rates to be raised. Analysts predict that the tightening will be the first in a string of monetary policy decisions, which could see the Federal Funds rate rising by a further 75 basis points this year. The US move spilled over into Canada when Mr Paul Martin, the finance minister, responded by saying Canada could have lower interest rates than the US. This caused the Canadian dollar to tumble within minutes to CDollars 1.3440 from CDollars 1.3360. Traders said the Bank of Canada was supporting the currency. The Bank of England yesterday provided the UK money market with Pounds 1.85bn of assistance after revising its forecast of the liquidity shortage to Pounds 1.85bn.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LOST GENERATION  </P> <P> It's ironic that in this era of women's liberation that actresses are  experiencing a low ebb, often playing second fiddle to their male counterparts.  Even when they do have starring roles, they are often reduced to playing  hookers, murderers and lunatics.  </P> <P> Part of the problem is that the movie studios are male dominated, and they view  the female artform as having little utility beyond physical beauty and sex.  </P> <P> But another part of the problem is with the actresses themselves, as they often  act like just a bunch of cowardly wimps, intimidated by these movie moguls,  afraid to stand up for their rights and demand better roles.  </P> <P> Ah, if only we could bring back Davis, Crawford and Stanwyck, who would scream,  fight, kick, cajole and threaten until they got the type of role they felt they  deserved and were entitled to. Some say they did their best acting off the  screen.  </P> <P> KENNETH L. ZIMMERMAN  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

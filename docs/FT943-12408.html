			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): GM and Ford on the road to a turnround - US carmakers Confirmation that the turnround of the big US carmakers is continuing is likely to come later this week, as General Motors and Ford report second-quarter figures. Chrysler unveiled strong results two weeks ago, adding to optimism about the outlook for its biggest rivals. Ford is expected to report a further big step in the return of its European operations to profit for 1994, after three years of losses. General Motors, meanwhile, continues to look to strong demand in the US and the restructuring of its North American operations to continue its turnround there.</p>

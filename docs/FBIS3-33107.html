			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On the night of 2 February, an incident occurred  between a military detachment and about 20 armed men, presumed  partisans of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in southern Haiti  near Les Cayes city, a Haitian military source told AFP on 16  February.    According to this source, there was gunfire during the  incident. The armed men, who are being sought, left weapons  including three M- 1 rifles and ammunition in the area. The  incident took place near the village of Chantal near Les Cayes,  some 200 km southwest of Port-au-Prince.    Three Haitians from the diaspora, who had clandestinely  reentered the country, were training young people of the region  in the rural section of Le Pretre when they were discovered by a  reconnaissance patrol acting on a tip, which then turned into a  combat patrol, according to the same source. No Army personnel  were wounded. There is no information about casualties among the  opposing group.    The plan to train for armed struggle is part of Operation  Iron Cuts Iron aimed at liberating the country, which was  announced by President Aristide from Washington in a New Year's  message to Haitians, this source explained. In order to thwart  this plan and maintain order, search operations were recently  launched by the Army in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area  where six weapons, including two with telescopic lenses, were  seized and arrests made, this military source pointed out. He  added that the situation in Les Cayes, where similar incidents  have taken place since Aristide went into exile in 1991, was  totally under the control of the local military command.    Furthermore, the same source said that the fire that  destroyed oil products clandestinely stored in a low-income  neighborhood of Port-au-Prince on the night of 12 February might  be the act of a criminal hand to raise fuel prices and  exacerbate the crisis.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Kone pre-tax result slips KONE, the Finnish elevator producer, yesterday reported a 20 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to FM464m (Dollars 108.6m) for 1991, while sales increased by nearly FM2bn to FM10bn. The dividend for 1991 will be the same as in 1990, at FM9 per A share and FM10 per B share. Income after taxes but before allocations decreased by 30 per cent to FM280.7m. Kone said its elevator business, which accounts for 71 per cent of the company's total sales, had a 14 per cent increase in orders last year. Demand declined in the main markets of Europe and North America but grew in Asia and Central America. The order book stood at FM6bn at the end of 1991, the same level as a year earlier. MacGergor-Navire, the marine technology division, was the fastest growing unit, with sales up by 40 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, chief of the Armed  Forces, admitted yesterday that U.S. Secretary of Defense  William Perry hinted at the deployment of U.S. troops from  Panama to support Honduras' drug interdiction efforts. The  officer then immediately pointed out that it would not be the  first time such deployments have been carried out. "I have  nothing against the democratic spirit, but at the meeting only  generalities concerning cooperation and support were discussed."    The U.S. Government plan envisions deploying U.S. Air Force  units stationed in Panama to Honduras to support the country's  efforts against drug trafficking. Honduran civilian authorities  were informed of this on 25 June at the Enrique Soto Cano Base  in Palmerola, Comayagua.    Discua Elvir avoided commenting on the conflict that took  place between Defense Secretary Perry and Honduran Foreign  Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar, arguing that "President Carlos  Roberto Reina is the one who establishes guidelines, courses of  action, and foreign policy for the Armed Forces." "They (the  Americans) are trying to implement preventive measures and  operate in areas where drug trafficking takes place, locating  sea, air, and land routes," Discua reiterated in reference to  the drug issue. He added that this would make it possible to  exchange community projects, resolve the housing problem, and  deal with individual security. Discua explained that the  expense of handling aerial equipment for this operation would be  paid by the United States.    Discua also spoke about the groups that are trying to divide  the civilian population from the military. He said they are  known because "we are a small country." He said, however, that  the Armed Forces are trying to rediscover the path to  convergence from which Honduras strayed because of imposed  missions or because of a poor concept of national security.    Gen. Discua Elvir yesterday spoke extensively about various  issues -- including changes within the military -- admitting  that the eighth graduating class is taking over the leadership  that the sixth class, of which he is a member, is about to leave.    Nevertheless, his demeanor and tone changed when he was  asked  about the alleged anonymous threats reported by the Committee of  Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras (COFADEH), which has  directly blamed him. "It bothers me. Yes, it bothers me to  discuss that because I do not know who is carrying out such  pranks or campaigns that prevent people from working," he said.  Discua Elvir said that a certain person who wants to create  confusion is behind this situation. "The Armed Forces are not  involved in that. Please, I believe that will be enough! he  concluded.

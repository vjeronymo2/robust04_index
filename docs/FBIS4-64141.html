			<p>BFN     [Text] The Interstate Space Committee uniting the former  Soviet republics, except the Baltic countries and Georgia, is to  adopt a program for cooperation in the exploration and  utilization of space in 1994.    A high-ranking representative of the Russian Space Agency,  involved in organizing the committee's session, to be held in  Moscow on June 2 and 3, told INTERFAX that the draft program  envisaged allocations of 1.25 trillion rubles (in January 1994  prices). However, this sum is likely to be increased to 2  trillion rubles, he said.    In accordance with the project, another six satellites will  be deployed within the framework of the program for creating the  Gonets low-orbit global communication system (two experimental  satellites of this series are on orbit already). In addition  there are plans to launch the first four satellites of the  Signal space communication system.    The program also provides for financing the development of  heavy- duty boosters, including Energiya M and Proton M ones,  and Start-1 and Start-1 super-light boosters.</p>

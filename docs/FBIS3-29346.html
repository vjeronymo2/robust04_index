			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yu Yong-ku: "Kim Chong-il Has Not Appeared on </F> His Birthday"]    [Text] Splendid celebrations marking Kim Chong-il's 52d  birthday took place throughout North Korea on 16 February. The  protagonist himself did not appear, thus arousing various  observations.    Rumors have been continually disseminated on Kim Il-song's  intensified personal involvement in administration and politics,  on barriers of receipt of foreign currency (Office No. 39 in the  party's financial and accounting department)--the source of  money for Kim Chong-il, and on Kim Chong-il's accident  groundlessly spread in Beijing -- thus indicating stumbling  blocks on the road of his succession to power.    The atmosphere in North Korea is quite the reverse. In an  editorial carried in NODONG SINMUN--the party's organ--on 16  February, the North Korean Workers' Party emphasized "the  single-hearted unity with Kim Chong-il as the center," thus  flatly rejecting such rumors.    In addition, various events celebrating his birthday were  held in North Korea and overseas. A banquet hosted by the party  Central Committee was held on the evening of 15 February, a  soiree by youth and students in Pyongyang and a soiree by the  Ministry of People's Armed Forces was held, and receptions were  also held. In addition, awards and citations were given to  economic and educational circles on the occasion of Kim  Chong-il's birthday.    Meetings to resolve loyalty to Kim Chong-il were held by  workers' organizations, including workers trade unions,  agricultural workers' trade unions, and womens' leagues, as well  as by youth and students. On 16 February, a national meeting of  the juvenile corps was held in Pyongyang Gymnasium. The meeting  urged the juvenile corps members to strengthen the "movement to  learn from the youth of Kim Chong-il." North Korea's overseas  missions also held events marking his birthday as usual.    However, Kim Chong-il himself did not attend any events  marking his birthday. Thus, the people have doubts as to his  personal condition. Experts in North Korean affairs, however,  do not attach importance to his failure to appear. Kim Chong-il  participated in his 50th birthday celebrations in 1992. He  attended, with President Kim Il-song, the celebrations held in  the Kumsusan Assembly Hall on the very date of his birthday. He  also saw a mass game, "With the party forever," held in  Pyongyang Gymnasium by youth and students in Pyongyang. All this  seemed to have been prompted by the custom of treasuring every  10-year mark.    Kim Chong-il did not personally attend any birthday  celebrations last year, either. His participation in a few  political events, including the 8th Congress of the Socialist  Working Youth of Korea held in February, encompassed all of his  movements. In addition, there was no report on his activities  during the month of February in 1991, not to mention his  attendance in birthday celebrations.    Proceeding from this, we will be able to confirm the changes  surrounding Kim Chong-il only after seeing if Kim Chong-il  attends the meeting to mark the 30th anniversary of publication  of the socialist rural thesis--a political event to be held  soon--and the Supreme People's Assembly meeting, which is  usually held in March or April.</p>

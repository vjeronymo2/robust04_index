			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Jose, 15 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican Foreign  Minister Bernd Niehaus is visiting St. Lucia, Guyana, and  Grenada in the Caribbean to confirm the support these nations  have given to his candidacy as the new OAS secretary general.    Official sources reported today on the "unexpected" visit  and  noted Niehaus was already on the island of St. Lucia and is  currently in Guyana from where he will fly to Grenada.  According to some news reports, Niehaus' visit is related to  the pressure the United States is exerting on some Caribbean  countries to withdraw their pledge to support the Costa Rican  foreign minister.    Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon said today "it  would be regrettable" if the United States were trying to  pressure the countries of Central America and the Caribbean to  withdraw their support for Niehaus. The head of state added  that Niehaus is most likely going to have to vie for this post  with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, "who has the backing of  the United States." Calderon reiterated his government's  endorsement of Niehaus, who is ready to go "to the end" on this  matter, he stressed.    Bernd Niehaus has been saying for some weeks he has the  majority of votes needed to win the post of secretary general on  28 March and replace Brazilian Joao Baena Soares, since he has  the backing of all the countries of the Caribbean and Central  America, and some South American countries.    Cesar Gaviria's candidacy, which the Colombian president has  not officially announced, has the backing of the United States,  Mexico, and Brazil, among other big countries, according to news  reports.    Before returning to Costa Rica, Foreign Minister Niehaus  will  go to Mexico to participate in a seminar on poverty in Latin  America sponsored by the OAS.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Arts: Today's Television More than a quarter of all British seven year olds fail to reach minimum standards in reading tests. BBC2's Education Special (7.50) investigates a new teaching method called Reading Recovery, already tried in New Zealand, the US, Australia and Canada which, it is claimed, takes at most 20 weeks to bring the worst pupils up to the average. In Floyd On Spain (8.30 BBC2) Keith Floyd conducts his happy gastronauts through the culinary delights of the Costa Blanca. They include paella and roast suckling pig. If you want to see yet another programme about Saint Roddick, fragrant boss of The Body Shop, she is featured in the last of BBC2's series The John Bull Business (9.30) which warns against adopting new technology without accepting the need for change in work methods. C4 gives the first television screening to Mike Leigh's highly praised 1990 drama, Life Is Sweet, in which Jim Broadbent and Alison Steadman play a suburban couple with two grown-up daughters: Natalie, a plumber, and Nicola, a bulimic and would-be feminist.</p>

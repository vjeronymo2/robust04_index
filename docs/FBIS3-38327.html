			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Alessandro Longo report: "`Scalfaro Must Leave'"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- President Scalfaro is "the last president of  the First Republic" and therefore cannot be "the first of the  Second" if "the renewal is to proceed." [Italian Social  Movement (MSI) Secretary] Gianfranco Fini carried the MSI public  with him. He received loud applause for his opposition to  Scalfaro at the last day of the congress that ratified the  "swing" toward the "grand right" of the National Alliance.    Fini asked the audience: "Do you know what the left will do  if it accedes to government? It will allow Scalfaro to retain  his post after 27 March. And this is unacceptable...." More  applause. After leaving the platform, he added: "I have said  it, and I repeat it. I do not consider it appropriate for  Scalfaro, who was involved in that mysterious business  concerning the intelligence services, to continue in his  post...." Nor would just any change of president be acceptable.  "What if they bring in Jotti? Can you imagine that? Keep in  mind that she does have a chance. She is a woman, she had a  role in the Resistance...."    They devoured him with their eyes, both friends sand  enemies,  as they experienced differing emotions. The die is cast. Now  there will be no compromise. Did anyone think that the Alliance  was merely "a tactical move designed to gain a few more members  of parliament?" They will have to think again, Fini warned.  The National Alliance, of which the MSI is the linchpin, "is a  great blueprint for the future." Fini was not intimidated by  the presence in the front row of Assunta Almirante [widow of  former MSI Secretary Giorgio Almirante]; her daughter, Giuliana  Almirante (who drew more attention thanks to memories of her  father); or Alessandra Mussolini, the duce's granddaughter. Nor  was he influenced by the awkward condemnation -- though it did  not lead to a separation -- issued by [MSI ideologue Pino] Rauti  ("Did we establish the Republic of Salo just to achieve economic  liberalism, just to introduce Coca-Cola?")    Fini dealt with the internal dissidents. Even the Nazi  skinheads appeared, brandishing a banner, then disappeared,  removed by the security guards. The time has come to look after  the allies. "There is an understanding" with [Forza Italia  leader] Berlusconi and the Christian Social group. The same  values apply -- God, the family, the homeland -- as can be seen  from the television propaganda. Negotiations with the League  are more difficult. Fini did not rule out the possibility of a  "technical agreement." "Some headway" could be made together,  but only on the following conditions: The League must resolve  the uncertainty over national unity, must say whether there is  one republic or three; then it will be possible to start  negotiating. How? By secretly sharing out constituencies, one  in exchange for another? No, that would be too "petty," too  restricted. Any agreement, the MSI secretary said, must  "materialize out in the open." No secret trysts, no secret love  affairs. Only agreements on policy and on the constituencies,  with equal "status."    Carlo Tassi did not give a damn for all this; he defied this  congress for renewal by giving a fascist salute from the stage  and by bringing with him [French National Front leader] Le Pen's  second-in-command as an unofficial guest. Although he lives in  Piacenza, he has always bought cars with Como license plates, to  avoid the letters "PC" [for Piacenza and communist party]. He  was heard to say: "The agreement with the League is fait  accompli.... We will give him a real shafting."    These may be mere quips. But one thing is certain: The  dance of rapprochement will not be easy. Fini refuses to take  "the first steps, either direct or indirect"; he wants no  "ambassadors." If [Northern League Secretary] Bossi so desires,  he is willing to negotiate; otherwise, never mind. He will  shoulder the "responsibility" for a possible victory by the  left-wing forces. But Bossi "cannot lose if he wants to retain  his leadership." Leadership is indeed one of the problems for  the right-wing alignment (Fini does not like the adjective,  "moderate" -- "it smacks of compromise.")    The chances of an accord depend also on who is put forward  as  the next prime minister. Berlusconi or Bossi? As, Fini has  already said: "The indication of a prime minister may be  important to the public, but it is not obligatory. I would have  no hesitation in choosing between Bossi and Berlusconi. I would  opt for Berlusconi because he has potential in both the North  and the South, whereas Bossi can only be a leader in the North."</p>

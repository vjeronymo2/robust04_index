			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 23 Jan (MENA)--Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif  Sidqi asserted that the government has not and will not keep  silent about any incident of corruption, no matter who the  perpetrator.    Addressing a People's Assembly session held today to debate  the report of the committee tasked with replying to the  government policy statement, Sidqi said every report on  corruption or deviations from any source, even anonymous ones,  is passed on for investigation with the knowledge of the  authorities concerned.    He added that people must not be accused without evidence or  according to mere reports because this is regarded as  intellectual terrorism. Referring to newspaper reports on  corruption cases, he said if such corruption happened in any  society, such a society would be barbaric.    Speaking about corruption, Khalid Muhyi-al-Din, opposition  leader in the People's Assembly, said he did not mean by his  speech to accuse anyone and that he knows that Prime Minister  Dr. 'Atif Sidqi is the one who ordered an investigation on  Madinat al-Nasr's multimillionaire. He added that he knows the  government, including not only the council of ministers but also  the administration agency, is opposed to such acts. I do not  mean to stand up against anyone or accuse anyone without  evidence, he remarked.    Kamal al-Shadhili, minister of state for the People's  Assembly and consultative council affairs, said corruption is  not common practice, and that the prime minister has affirmed  that neither corruption nor deviations will be protected and all  such cases will be invesitgated.

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Bossi plays rough game of political poker: Fiery leader of Northern League campaigns for concessions Mr Umberto Bossi, the fiery leader of the populist Northern League, has begun a high stakes game of bluff and threat to wring out the maximum amount of concessions for joining the next Italian government, writes Robert Graham in Rome. This means that over the next few days there will be some confusing and belligerent noises coming from the Bossi camp as media magnate Silvio Berlusconi tries to hammer out a consensus on a government programme. However, Mr Bossi appears to have accepted the principle that the League be part of the government in the wake of the overwhelming election victory by the right-wing Freedom Alliance. He also appears to have dropped his resistance - again in principle - to the presence in government of members of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini, the third main component of the Freedom Alliance. Thus the discussions now taking place are over the nature of the government programme and the role the League should play in government. Yesterday Mr Berlusconi met for the second time in three days with League representatives. Whereas Mr Bossi was present at the first encounter, yesterday he deliberately delegated his most trusted aide, Mr Roberto Marone, to meet Mr Berlusconi, and so distanced himself from the negotiations. 'We will put together a government and it will be a strong one,' Mr Marone said afterwards. But neither he nor a statement from Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement gave any idea whether their differences were being narrowed. Mr Berlusconi refused to be tied to a timetable for forming the government. 'Parliament reassembles on April 15. But this is not necessarily the date for the formation of the government,' he said. In the past Mr Bossi and Mr Marone have proved a highly effective duet. Mr Bossi makes the tough uncompromising public statements: in private Mr Marone softens them and acts as the go-between. They are likely to repeat this tactic now with Mr Bossi threatening not to join the government and Mr Marone then making light of such threats. It is also a way of Mr Bossi trying to impose his demand that Mr Marone be the next prime minister, instead of Mr Berlusconi. Mr Bossi argues that with 118 seats in the Chamber of Deputies compared with the MSI's 105 and Forza Italia's 101, the premier should come from the largest represented party. Having bad-mouthed his allies and associates in the Freedom Alliance throughout the election, it was too much to expect the voluble League leader to soften his language immediately. He also has to placate unease among his rank and file over doing a deal with the MSI. Nevertheless, Mr Bossi's tone and emphasis has changed. Instead of attacking the MSI as being 'reactionary fascists,' he is insisting the next government be built around acceptance of a new federalist approach to Italy's constitution. This has long been a League platform and a major point of difference with the MSI which believes in the opposite - a strong centralised state. Mr Berlusconi stands somewhere near the middle in this argument. As a northerner, he understands the frustrations of the League at seeing the hard-working north underwriting the inefficiency and waste of Rome and the south. His free-market instincts also attract him to the idea of greater administrative and fiscal devolution in Italy, the most centralised state in the EU. One way round the impasse between the federalist League and the centralist MSI is an agreement to introduce direct elections for the president of the republic, giving the presidency almost French-style powers. Only when these issues are resolved will the parties move on to finding common ground on measures to deal with the economy, another key area of potential disagreement. The economic programmes of the three parties, hurriedly put together prior to the elections, have few points in common. Although the Italian media have been full of lists of potential ministers during the past few days, Mr Berlusconi yesterday insisted no appointments had been decided. He is determined to cut the number of ministries by up to one third and is considering carrying out the much-studied amalgamation of the Treasury with the budget and finance ministries. He would also prefer to have the cabinet predominantly composed of politicians, and not technocrats.</p>

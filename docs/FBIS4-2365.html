			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, March 9 (XINHUA) -- East China's Shanghai  has achieved steady economic growth in the first quarter this  year, providing great momentum for its future development.    This was recently stated by Cheng Bulin, director of the  Statistics Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government.    Statistics show that the value of goods and service produced  in Shanghai during the first quarter totalled 42 billion yuan  (about five billion U.S. dollars according to current exchange  rates) with a growth of 13.1 percent over the same period last  year calculated in terms of comparable prices.    The Pudong New Area has continued its high development speed  with all of its economic quotas clearly higher than the city's  average.    As the pillar of the local economy, Shanghai's industry has  seen overall sales topping 81 billion yuan and the rate of sales  against production reaching 94 percent during the period.    Cheng Bulin also said that local exports, once the burden of  Shanghai's economic development, have made a fresh start this  year with the export trade volume soaring to 1.7 billion U.S.  dollars worth, a rise of 22.3 percent over the same period last  year.    The scale of foreign investment and the fields involved in  it  in Shanghai have both been expanded. Meanwhile, more overseas  capital has poured into industrial and high-tech projects.    State investment in fixed assets all over the city during  the  last three months was 7 billion yuan, a growth of 60 percent  over the same period in 1993. Major infrastructural projects  are going smoothly.    Price-control measures implemented by the municipal  government has effectively checked inflation and made shanghai's  margin of increase of prices one of the lowest in the country's  35 large and medium-sized cities.    Sound development of the local economy at the beginning of  this year can be largely attributed to the firm foundation laid  during economic flourishing in recent years and high demand for  local investment.    According to Cheng Bulin, deepening of reform in fields  including finance, banking, housing and social insurance is  expected to further invigorate the local economy.    But Shanghai is also facing problems such as scarcity of  floating funds, high prices of some key raw materials,  increasing of loss- making enterprises and marketing snags with  certain consumer products, the director said.</p>

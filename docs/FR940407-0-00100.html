This program element shall also include a State enforcement program which defines violations, and specifies auditing and inspections plans and provisions for enforcement actions. The program shall contain effective penalties for noncompliance which preserve the level of deterrence in traditional programs. For all such programs, the manner of collection of penalties must be specified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Emission limit violations. (i) Programs imposing limits on mass emissions or emission rates that provide for extended averaging times and/or compliance on a multisource basis shall include procedures for determining the number of violations, the number of days of violation, and sources in violation, for statutory maximum penalty purposes, when the limits are exceeded. The State shall demonstrate that such procedures shall not lessen the incentive for source compliance as compared to a program applied on a source-by-source, daily basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Programs shall require plans for remedying noncompliance at any facility that exceeds a multisource emissions limit for a given averaging period. These plans shall be enforceable both federally and by the State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Violations of MRR requirements. The MRR requirements shall apply on a daily basis, as appropriate, and violations thereof shall be subject to State enforcement sanctions and to the Federal penalty of up to $25,000 for each day a violation occurs or continues. In addition, where the requisite scienter conditions are met, violations of such requirements shall be subject to the Act's criminal penalty sanctions of section 113(c)(2), which provides for fines and imprisonment of up to 2 years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;51.494  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Use of program revenues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any revenues generated from statutory EIP's shall be used by the State for any of the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Providing incentives for achieving emissions reductions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Providing assistance for the development of innovative technologies for the control of O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  air pollution and for the development of lower-polluting solvents and surface coatings. Such assistance shall not provide for the payment of more than 75 percent of either the costs of any project to develop such a technology or the costs of development of a lower-polluting solvent or surface coating. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Funding the administrative costs of State programs under this Act. Not more than 50 percent of such revenues may be used for this purpose. The use of any revenues generated from discretionary EIP's shall not be constrained by the provisions of this part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

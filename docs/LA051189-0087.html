			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOULD AFFECT MOST PUBLIC AREAS;  </P> <P> DOWNEY VOTES INITIAL OK ON ANTI-SMOKING LAW  </P> <P> The City Council Tuesday voted preliminary approval for an ordinance  prohibiting smoking in most public places and requiring no-smoking sections in  restaurants with seating for 20 or more patrons.  </P> <P> If the proposed ordinance is given final approval on May 23, smoking would be  prohibited at retail stores, medical facilities and child-care operations 30  days after passage.  </P> <P> Smoking would not be allowed in enclosed areas such as elevators, hallways and  restrooms. It would be restricted to designated areas in the workplace,  restaurants and hotels.  </P> <P> Smoking would be allowed in bars, malls, retail tobacco stores, private  assembly rooms and in designated areas in places of work where smokers are in  the majority. Certain sections of lobbies in theaters and auditoriums also  would be designated for smokers.  </P> <P> According to the measure, employers would be urged to make "reasonable efforts"  to provide a smoke-free area, but they would not be required to erect barriers  for nonsmokers. The rights of nonsmokers would be given precedence in disputes  between nonsmokers and smokers. Signs indicating smoking and nonsmoking areas  would be required in business establishments.  </P> <P> Revisions and amendments are expected to be offered at a public hearing before  the ordinance is given its final reading on May 23.  </P> <P> The council gave tentative approval to the measure by a vote of 4 to 1 with  Barbara Hayden voting no. She said the proposed law was "too wordy."  </P> <P> The council considered the proposal after receiving phone calls, letters and  other responses that favored a smoking ordinance by a margin of 2 to 1,  according to a report presented to the council by June Yotsuya, assistant to  the city manager.  </P> <P> Councilman Roy Paul said he was concerned about the effect the ordinance would  have on small businesses. He said it showed signs of a "big brother" mentality.  "I see this as just another infringement," he said, calling the ordinance  confusing.  </P> <P> Mayor Robert G. Cormack said that the smoking regulation is necessary because  76% of the people are nonsmokers. "The only laws we should have are those that  protect the health and welfare of the people," Cormack said.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Diane Boggs called the proposal fair. She said it would be  irresponsible to ignore the statistical data on smoking.  </P> <P> Dr. Kenneth Wayne, a pulmonologist at Gallatin Medical Clinic in Downey, was  instrumental in bringing the proposal for a smoking law to the council more  than a year ago. Wayne said the ordinance should have been stronger.  </P> <P> "It isn't as tough as I would like, but it is certainly a first step," Wayne  said.  </P> <P> "I am convinced of the hazards of active and passive smoke. . . . Nonsmokers  shouldn't be forced to breath second-hand smoke," he said. He favors barriers  to restrict smoke moving from room to room.  </P> <P> The effects of second-hand smoke became a national concerned when U.S. Surgeon  General C. Everett Koop issued a formal warning in 1986 on its danger to  nonsmokers. The report stated that healthy nonsmokers have an increased risk of  getting lung cancer and other respiratory diseases by breathing smoke-filled  air.  </P> <P> There are nearly 400 communities nationwide that have placed restrictions on  smoking, according to Mark Pertschuk, director of Americans for Nonsmokers'  Rights, headquartered in Berkeley. Pertschuk said he was aware of the Downey  ordinance and said it was mild.  </P> <P> If the proposal becomes law, Downey will join 169 other California communities  with smoking ordinances.  </P></p>

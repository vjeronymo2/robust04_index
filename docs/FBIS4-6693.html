			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 19 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- Completing  his official visit to Mongolia the Governor General of Australia  Bill Hayden has spoken at the session of the Mongolian  parliament.    My current visit to Mongolia which is the first one is a  manifestation of developing recently close contacts between the  two countries. In this respect I would like to say addressing  the members of the Mongolian parliament that Australia has been  and is supporting the democratic renovations in Mongolia. We  are appreciating the fact that Mongolia is striving to expand  her relations with the countries of the Asian and Pacific  region. We Australians are greeting the peaceful transition of  the country to democracy, said in his speech Bill Hayden.    Touching upon the bilateral cooperation the governor general  notes that the representatives of the two parliaments have  mutually paid visits and it is a hope that a number of spheres  of cooperation might become a real support for the Mongolian  people such as training of Mongolian specialists, cooperation in  the agricultural sphere especially in keeping animal husbandry  in semideserted natural conditions, mining cultural and  humanitarian spheres, etc. The governor general has expressed  his gratitude for a warm welcome and hospitality during the days  of a visit of his.</p>

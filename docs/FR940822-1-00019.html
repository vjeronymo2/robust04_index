The Commission expects to apply these criteria in determining the adequacy of remediation of residual radioactivity resulting from the possession or use of source, byproduct, and special nuclear material. For high-level and low-level waste disposal facilities, the criteria would apply only to ancillary surface facilities that support radioactive waste disposal activities because criteria for closure of the remainder of the facility and termination of the license are currently specified. For uranium mills, the criteria apply to decommissioning of the facility but not to soil cleanup and the disposal of uranium mill tailings. The criteria would apply to decommissioning of nuclear facilities that operate through their normal lifetime, as well as to those that may be shut down prematurely. However, they would not apply to sites already covered by a decommissioning plan approved by the Commission before the effective date of this rule, if it is adopted in final form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of this rulemaking is to provide a clear and consistent regulatory basis for determining the extent to which lands and structures must be remediated before a site can be considered decommissioned. The Commission believes that inclusion of criteria in the regulations would result in more efficient and consistent licensing actions related to the numerous and frequently complex site remediation and decommissioning activities anticipated in the future. The Commission has reassessed the basis for the residual contamination levels contained in existing guidance in light of changes in basic radiation protection standards, improvements in remediation and radiation detection technologies, decommissioning experience obtained during the past 15 years, and comments received from workshops held as part of this rulemaking effort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC presently allows decommissioning on a site-specific basis using existing guidance. However, the Commission believes that codifying radiological criteria for decommissioning in the regulations would allow the NRC to more effectively carry out its function of protecting public health and the environment at decommissioned sites by providing for more efficient use of NRC and licensee resources, consistent application across all types of licenses, and a predictable basis for decommissioning planning. In addition it would eliminate protracted delays in decommissioning which result as licensees wait for NRC to promulgate regulatory criteria before proceeding with decommissioning of their facilities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments December 20, 1994.

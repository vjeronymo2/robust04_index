			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading LONDON derivatives continued to trade under the shadow of Wall Street, opening weaker following the decline in the US in the previous session and then slipping still lower as New York extended its slide in London hours yesterday. The UK equity futures market began weakly and helped to pull the stock market down. The premium of the June FT-SE 100 index over the spot index narrowed from 20 points to around 10 on selling by independent traders. At one stage, the futures market attempted to rally and succeeded in widening the gap over the share market to 20 points. But with Wall Street on the defensive, prices were again marked lower and by the close June was back to less than a 10-point premium to the spot market. The June FT-SE closed at 2,494, down 42 points on the day. Its premium finished at 6 points, against fair value of 15. In traded options, the stock market's inability to break out of the range of the past fortnight prompted investors to sell calls against stock holdings. Elsewhere, there was a buyer of 1,000 Asda July 130 calls; a buyer of 500 GrandMet October 650 puts; and a buyer of 250 Barclays June 460 calls. The Euro FT-SE was boosted by a seller of 1,000 July 2,625 calls and a buyer of 1,000 July 2,525 puts.</p>

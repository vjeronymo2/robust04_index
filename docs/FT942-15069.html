			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Lancer Boss hit by EU discord The receivers to Lancer Boss, the UK lift-truck producer, yesterday attacked the differences in UK and German insolvency procedures which have prevented a sale of the combined UK and German businesses together. Mr Allan Griffiths, a partner at Grant Thornton, said 'lack of harmony' in European Union insolvency legislation was 'a matter of concern to me and the insolvency profession'. He said he would have preferred to have been in control of all the group's subsidiaries, including Steinbock Boss, which went into German receivership a week ago and was purchased on Thursday by Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck producer. The purchase puts Jungheinrich in a strong position to buy Lancer Boss in the UK but Mr Griffiths said there was still active UK and foreign interest in acquiring the company. Jungheinrich has yet to launch a bid and Mr Griffiths will meet Jungheinrich executives early next week to discuss a trading relationship between Steinbock Boss and Lancer Boss in the UK. Mr Griffiths' comments come at a time when EU officials are in talks over the possibility of increased co-operation on insolvency matters, including a draft bankruptcy law across the EU. The Department of Trade and Industry is also understood to be taking a close interest in the difficulties of the UK receivers at Lancer Boss that have been caused by the different approach of the German receiver. The DTI said that it was too early to say whether the Lancer Boss collapse would give fresh impetus to discussions between EU members on the administration of cross-border receiverships. 'We recognise that there appear to have been some difficulties here, and we are looking to see what lessons there may be for the future.' Mr Griffiths' criticism of lack of harmony in EC insolvency legislation was echoed by Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, chairman of Lancer Boss before its receivership. He said: 'I am sure that this case will prompt a review of insolvency procedures in Europe.' Mr Griffiths said he still believed that the value of Lancer Boss would have been maximised by the sale of the combined UK and German businesses. But, following the sale of Steinbock Boss, he would seek to sell the UK business as a going concern and was encouraged by the interest received, including some new approaches. He stressed that Lancer Boss continued to trade and was operating normally. He added: 'I believe the right organisation can make it pay.' But he said he would not be able to sell the company until he had tied up a trading relationship with Jungheinrich. There is considerable trading of products and components between Steinbock Boss and Lancer Boss. Meanwhile Mr Ludwig Schneider, a German-based management consultant and restructuring specialist who was appointed late last year as the first group chief executive of Lancer Boss, refused to comment on his time at the UK company. It is believed that Mr Schneider was introduced to Sir Neville by Bayerische Hypo-Bank, lead bank for Steinbock Boss. Sir Neville said Mr Schneider was the 'exclusive interface' with Jungheinrich in protracted discussions about a possible takeover. He would not say why Mr Schneider, a Brazilian who works for CMI, a Munich consultancy, left the company in February, although it is known that Mr Charles Whyte was appointed by Lancer Boss's UK banking group to replace him.</p>

			<p>After   Exposure to High Altitude (3700 m) in Men   <F P=102> 40091007A Beijing HANGTIAN YIXUE YU YIXUE GONGCHENG [SPACE  MEDICINE &amp; MEDICAL ENGINEERING] in Chinese Vol 6 No 4, Dec </F>   93 pp  269-273  <F P=103> 40091007A </F> <F P=104>  Beijing HANGTIAN YIXUE YU YIXUE GONGCHENG [SPACE  MEDICINE &amp; MEDICAL ENGINEERING] </F>  <F P=105>  Chinese </F> CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Zan Junping [2501 0193 </F> 1627], Yin Zhaoyun [1438 2507 0061], et al. of the Institute of  Hygiene and Environmental Medicine, Academy of Military Medical  Sciences, Tianjin]    [Text] By means of incremental exercise test on bicycle  ergometer and determination of pulmonary gas exchange, anaerobic  threshold (AT) was investigated in 26 young men exposed to an  altitude of 3700 m for 6 months (group 1). The results indicated  that there was a positive correlation between AT and body weight  (BW) (P &lt; 0.01) and a negative correlation between AT and  heart  rate (HR) during stepping exercise on a 40 cm stool at a  frequency of 25 step/min for 5 min (P &lt; 0.01). Further, it was  found that AT was correlated with BW and HR (r = 0.799). The  multiple regression equation was Y = 126.8278 + 1.4625 BW -  0.8213 HR, where Y is estimated value of AT (w); BW is body  weight (kg); HR is heart rate during stepping exercise  (beats/min). In order to test their reliability, AT was  determined in another 24 males exposed to an altitude of 3700 m  with the same method (group 2). The analysis showed that  measured value of AT was highly correlated with that estimated  by the regression equation. Coefficient of correlation, slope  and standard error of estimate were 0.820 (p &lt; 0.01), 1.292  and  6.7 w (8.6 percent), respectively. This slope was statistically  not different from that for group 1 (1.001). It is suggested  that the regression equation can be used in evaluation and  investigation of aerobic capacity and physical work capacity in  men exposed to high altitude of 3700 m for longer time.</p>

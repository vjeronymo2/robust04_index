			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy The devaluation effect on UK manufacturers' costs abated in March. Not only did input prices rise only 0.1 per cent on February's level; the main influences were a sharp rise in home-grown food manufacturing materials offset by a drop in the price of electricity to large industrial users. With the prices of imported materials falling and sterling on a recovery track, it looks as though a line can be drawn under the debate on the price effect of devaluation. That still leaves the questions of how far the 10 per cent rise in input prices since September will be passed on, and of how quickly recovery will reignite inflation. One risk is that domestic manufacturers will use recovery to catch up on the prices charged by foreign competitors. Another is that recovery will bring an end to discounting, pushing up retail prices as stores - rather than manufacturers - seek to claw back margins. The chances are, though, that such pressures will remain muted for the time being. Recovery initially brings productivity gains as idle capacity is brought back on stream. At this stage the impact of higher demand is thus normally to dampen rather than kindle inflation. That should continue to offset the higher input prices for some time, especially since the UK is also enjoying a sharp fall in unit labour costs. The more dangerous moment will come when pay settlements start to rise again. Despite the apparent increase in union militancy, there is little sign of that yet. Wage levels should be watched, just the same.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lower metal prices hit Alcoa Australia Alcoa of Australia, the integrated aluminium group, has suffered a 35 per cent slide in net earnings for the nine months to September, reflecting the combined effect of lower metal prices and a strengthening Australian dollar. The company yesterday reported trading profit down to ADollars 196.4m (USDollars 145m) from ADollars 300.4m on revenues down 8 per cent to ADollars 1.53bn from ADollars 1.67bn. An abnormal tax gain of ADollars 59.7m in the previous period meant that earnings available to shareholders declined by more than 45 per cent. Directors said that lower product prices were partially offset by higher sales volumes of alumina and chemicals, and lower unit production costs for most output. An exception was gold, where lower ore grades cut production and increased costs per ounce. The company has reacted to tighter conditions by cutting capital spending to ADollars 82.7m from ADollars 138m and dividend payouts to ADollars 180m from ADollars 280m in the nine months. Alcoa's future earnings may be threatened further by a dispute with the Victoria state government over the pricing of electric power to its Portland smelter. The government has withdrawn some of the smelter's power supply, but directors said yesterday that it was still operating at about 90 per cent of capacity. The lastest result followed a reduced tax provision of ADollars 84.3m (ADollars 152.5m previously) and depreciation of ADollars 114.2m, compared with ADollars 111.2m. Interest expense eased to ADollars 12.8m from ADollars 20.6m in the period.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P>  Brunswick Corp. said Wednesday it plans to sell its San Diego-based Advanced  Materials Technology Center, a unit of its defense division that is involved in  the development of so-called Stealth aviation technology.  </P> <P> Brunswick's AMTC facility employs 40 people in a 30,000-square-foot plant in  the Miramar Road area, general manager Ray Buttram said. The unit is being sold  because the development of its technology requires an investment that is not  "compatible" with the company's other businesses, Buttram said.  </P> <P> Based in Skokie, Ill., Brunswick is best-known as a manufacturer of pleasure  boats and marine engines. The company's other San Diego operation, called  BioTechnetics, is researching therapeutic and commercial applications of  monoclonal antibodies.  </P></p>

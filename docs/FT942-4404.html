			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Turkish TV companies put future in the frame: A new licensing system is set to shape the industry for the next decade Turkey's television industry is on best behaviour, with companies today making initial applications to the newly formed High Broadcasting Council for licences the allocations of which will shape the industry for the coming decade. Invitations to tender will be announced in August and will be awaited with interest by both domestic and foreign investors in what has been one of the country's most dynamic sectors. The current economic troubles, with the lira having lost 50 per cent of its value against the dollar, have dampened investor enthusiasm throughout the economy. But in the new broadcasting regime - legislation for which was passed in April - under which the council is likely to limit the number of licences, there are expected to be fewer companies competing for the same amount of advertising revenues. This will strengthen the finances of companies operating in the sector. What is more, with the launch of Turkey's own satellite later this year and the planned privatisation of the state telecom company - which will open the way for innovations such as video on demand - the opportunities are huge. Some in the industry wonder whether the new legislation will keep pace with the changes in technology. Mr Nuri Colakoglu, head of Show, the largest private station, says the law set out to 'create a still picture, when in fact what they were seeing was the frame of a moving film'. The legislation provides a timely measure of official thinking on a range of vexed issues, from the Kurdish rebellion, the role of religious broadcasting in a Moslem country with a devoutly secular constitution, and the challenge to the state posed by the accumulation of media power, as well as the technological challenge. 'It's as good as the French or German legislation,' says Sedat Orsel, formerly deputy director of state television, now head of Eko television, a pay channel in which Koc Holding, Turkey's largest manufacturing company is in collaboration with Canal-Plus and Time Warner. However the issue of Kurdish-language broadcasts, once mooted by the prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, as a way to win over moderate Kurds, has been left for another day. After criticism from right-wingers such as her own True Path party deputy Mr Coskun Kirca, the final draft stipulated only the use of foreign languages 'which have contributed to the universal cultural and scientific works' - a phrase which Kurdish nationalists will take as doubly wounding. Politicians such as Mr Ulus Gurkan, a member of the parliamentary drafting commission, complain that the law is too restrictive, particularly the powers it gives the prime minister to stop broadcasts deemed against the 'public interest'. But many officials concede the companies brought it on themselves. In a conservative society, much of the programming has often stretched the bounds of public tolerance. A lot is at stake for the television companies, not least an advertising market worth Dollars 300m in 1993 and the chance to beam to a growing and young population where consumer choice is just taking off. The new law is broadly in line with other European practice in areas such as cross shareholding, advertising restrictions and broader public morality issues such as violence and pornography. Foreign equity will be limited to 20 per cent. The legislation will rationalise the number of terrestrial channels. The council will be entrusted to draft rules for cable and satellite transmission. The re-transmission of foreign programmes will no longer be allowed, with a waiver for one-off events such as foreign football matches. Turkish companies advertising on foreign satellite channels will not be able to set off their advertising costs against tax. Cost - in this case, of the satellite dish - is seen as the best constraint on the growth of foreign broadcasts. The big companies have complained that the rules on ownership are too onerous. But Mr Gurkan says 'the restrictions are essential if Turkey is to have a free press'.</p>

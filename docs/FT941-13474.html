			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Arabs' Israeli boycott to be reconsidered Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, yesterday said he had received assurances that, at its next ministerial meeting in March, the Arab League would consider revoking its boycott against foreign companies which do business with Israel. The league will also reconsider its tertiary embargo - against companies which do substantial business with companies trading with Israel. Mr Brown, who had just returned from an eight-day tour of the Middle East, said he had carried one consistent message to Arab leaders: that the boycott  -against Israel and companies which deal with Israel - was 'an anachronism' and counterproductive. 'It deprives the region of human and economic resources needed to boost economic growth,' he said. 'It probably hurts most the people it is designed to help - the Palestinians.' Mr Brown said his argument had wrung from Mr Esmat Abdel Meguid, the Arab League secretary general, a promise that the league would take up the question of the boycott against companies which trade with Israel. It was hurting American companies, he said. He expected the primary boycott, against Israel, to be discussed in the context of the peace negotiations. Mr Brown also urged Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, and Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, to lift the Israeli boycott against Arabs. In a press briefing on returning, Mr Brown also had hard words for Japan, which he said must agree to 'a targeted results-oriented approach' in its negotiating framework with the US. Japan's trade surplus with the US is heading towards Dollars 60bn (Pounds 40.5bn) in 1994. If Japan does not agree to specific targets, than the US may set them unilaterally, he said. 'We're ready and willing to explore any vehicle that we think can have an impact on our unacceptable trade imbalance,' he said. 'We have an Dollars 80bn trade deficit. . . Dollars 50bn with one country. We think we have to take tough and aggressive action to overcome this.' The Clinton administration would not wait for Japan to resolve its political crisis. 'We have to deal with the people who are in charge,' Mr Brown said. On his mission, Mr Brown visited Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Egypt and the occupied territories both to promote US products and to prepare for peace. The US is mobilising resources to quickly spur economic development in the region. He is working with an organisation called Building for Peace, a group of Jewish and Arab-American businessmen, who want to develop the West Bank and Gaza.</p>

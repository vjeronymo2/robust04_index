			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Arts: Wigglesworth's Shostakovich - Promenade concert Tuesday's richly rewarding Prom of Mahler's Ruckert Lieder and Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony reminded one of Mark Wigglesworth's position as one of Britain's most gifted young conductors. On a purely technical level, he drew disciplined, polished playing from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales - and, in in terms of decibels, some of the stillest orchestral pianissimos and most shattering fortissimos the Albert Hall has heard in a long time - but his interpretations gave notice of a mature, musicianly mind. The 'Leningrad' Symphony is by no means a work that plays itself and Wigglesworth, unencumbered by score, welded a coherent account of the 80-minute epic. The opening bristled with excitement, the great sonorous octaves given out with unerring precision: the orchestra marched through the first-movement ostinato, building it up inexorably to a point where it indeed seemed like an advancing army, capable of obliterating anything. But, as we now know, the symphony is about more than only - only] - the German siege of Leningrad; and Wigglesworth sought, and found, the deep seriousness of emotion and suffering in its middle movements. Listeners have long felt that it deals with more than one kind of institutionalised violence and further confirmation of this comes in Elizabeth Wilson's new Shostakovich: A Life Remembered: the composer's friend Flora Litvinova recalls him saying, 'this music is about all forms of terror, slavery, the bondage of the spirit . . . not just about Fascism, but about our system, or any form of totalitarianism'. Wigglesworth had also been at one with the composer's intentions in the Ruckert Lieder, proving himself a sensitive accompanist. Thomas Allen, on best of form, was the consummate soloist, bringing the elegance and restraint these songs require. The baritone caught the contrasts between each one of the five - in particular, the stillness of 'Ich atmet' einen linden Duft', the drama of 'Um Mitternacht'; and the resignation of 'lch bin der Welt abhanden gekommen'. All were hauntingly memorable.</p>

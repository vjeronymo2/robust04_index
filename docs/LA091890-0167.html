			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PATTI PUTS RISE IN HOMELESS AT DAD'S DOOR  </P> <P> Patti Davis blames her father, Ronald Reagan, for the increase in the nation's  homeless population.  </P> <P> Davis, who frequently has been critical of her father's environmental record,  wrote an article for Parade magazine in which she says the homeless problem  mushroomed when the Reagan Administration decided to trim "excess" from the  budget.  </P> <P> "It took us a while to realize that some of that 'excess' translated into human  lives, discarded onto the streets," she wrote.  </P> <P> Davis says she had to change her regular jogging route in Southern California  because it went past a settlement of homeless people and she was afraid they  would confront her about her father.  </P> <P> "What would I say if I were asked why I didn't talk to my father . . . about  this national tragedy?" she says. "I would have to try to explain that I didn't  know how -- how do you argue with someone who states that the people who are  sleeping on the grates of the streets of America 'are homeless by choice?' "  </P></p>

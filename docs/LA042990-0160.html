			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LETTERS ON LETTERS  </P> <P> Regarding Carol Chastang's Mar. 3 letter concerning Barbara Harrison's "Pure  Gore" (Jan. 28), I wish to say that Miss Chastang's choice of the adjective  pretentious for someone with a good vocabulary is unfortunate.  </P> <P> Although this advertises her own intellectual inadequacy, the perception is not  uncommon. There actually exists in our country a great number of individuals  who communicate daily in the English language, in their private lines, in  business, etc., and who resist -- moreover resent -- learning new words,  calling them "obscure." A pity! As Alexander Pope put it, "The fool is happy  that he knows no more."  </P> <P> LUCILLE BARNETT  </P> <P> Oceanside  </P></p>

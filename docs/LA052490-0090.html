			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: PICO RIVERA;  </P> <P> REMOVAL OF INOPERATIVE VEHICLES GEARS UP  </P> <P> If you live in Pico Rivera and your car doesn't move, the city will move it for  you -- to the junkyard.  </P> <P> The City Council, weary of seeing dead clunkers on streets and in yards, has  directed city workers to step up enforcement of a law banning visible  inoperative vehicles.  </P> <P> So far the effort has covered about one-fourth of the city. Even so, the  Planning Department has cited 200 vehicles per month since January. Through  mid-April, more than 250 vehicles have been garaged or removed by owners, or  towed by the city. The vehicle and property owners are liable for the towing  cost.  </P> <P> There were 10 inoperative vehicles at one residence alone, said Dave Caretto,  assistant city manager. The city has received voluntary compliance with the law  with 90% of the cited vehicles. Caretto said the goal is to make neighborhoods  more attractive and to maintain property values. "The difference is already  starting to show in the community," he said.  </P></p>

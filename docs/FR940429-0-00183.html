			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters argued that programs with a small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of graduates would not provide a statistically valid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure for completion or placement rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary believes these rates are statistically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valid unless fewer than thirty students complete a program in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> award year. The percentage of educational programs this size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating in the Title IV, HEA programs is so small, that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue of statistical validity does not need to be addressed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Award Year. Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters suggested that the period of time for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculating the placement rate should be based on the most recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar year or on the award year ending twelve months earlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., for 1995&hyph;96, the placement rate would apply to students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who graduated in 1993&hyph;94) instead of the immediately preceding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> award year, to account fully for the 180-day period permitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that a graduate has been placed and the 13-week  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period required to count an employed student as placed. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to count individuals as placements under these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances becomes increasingly difficult as graduation dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach the end of an award year. Some of these commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that this approach would be consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting procedures of many States and accrediting agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters suggested that the burden on institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be reduced significantly if the formula for calculating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placement and completion rates were the same as the Department's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Student-Right-to-Know provisions, and if the same formulas were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used by accrediting agencies and State licensing agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As noted in the earlier discussion, one reason that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary has adopted the requirement for a short-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program to be in existence for at least one year is to allow for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a track record of completion and placement rates. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation of these rates were to be based on an earlier award  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or calendar year than the one specified in these regulations, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary would need to require that newly established short-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs remain ineligible for an even longer period so that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> track record could be established. The Secretary does not wish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to discourage the creation of legitimate, high quality short-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs by requiring too great a period of ineligibility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those programs. The Secretary notes, of course, that once these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations have been in effect for at least a year, data for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently eligible programs, based on earlier years, will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary agrees that a standard rate is desirable, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the extent that a standard rate will provide the information the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department and other entities seek to obtain. Some rates may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to differ in order to achieve the purpose for which they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandated. For example, a rate that is designed purely for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer information purposes may require different data or time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods, than a rate that must coincide with student aid program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendars or a rate that is used for long-term academic studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary cannot control the design of placement rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by State agencies or accrediting agencies, but a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard rate or rates that can be calculated from the same data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources would help to reduce the burden on institutions. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary encourages States and accrediting agencies to foster  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the development of uniform standards the Secretary could adopt,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or adopt the standards in these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Student-Right-to-Know regulations are currently being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drafted with the intention of developing a completion rate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be useful for all Title IV, HEA programs when the statute so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits; but the Student-Right-to-Know regulations will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require a placement rate calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Calculation of Completion Rate. Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters suggested that the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``enrolled'' for purposes of calculating completion rates should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended to reflect only students who begin attending classes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter noted that some institutions do not charge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new students for any institutional costs during the first month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the students attended classes, because administrators at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these institutions believe that if these students withdrew before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tuition and fees were assessed, the students could be excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the calculation of a completion rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculating the completion rate, an institution would subtract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the number of regular students who were enrolled in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program those students who withdrew, dropped out of, or were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expelled from the program and were entitled to and actually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received in a timely manner in accordance with the refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of these regulations, a refund of 100 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their tuition and fees (less any permitted administrative fee)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the institution's refund policy. The Secretary believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this provision addresses the commenters concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters suggested that students who transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to another program or who withdraw because they have found a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> job, should be excluded from the completion-rate formula.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary believes that transfer students and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students who withdraw for the purpose of starting new jobs or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdraw for other reasons are accounted for by allowing up to 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the enrolled students to withdraw from the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Calculation of Placement Rate. Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters objected to the requirement that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student must be employed for at least 13 weeks following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> graduation from an institution to be included in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's placement-rate calculation. These commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that this requirement is overly burdensome because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would have to track those students for long periods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They believed that an institution should not be held accountable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for factors that are beyond the institution's control, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> layoffs, plant closings, illnesses, forced relocations, or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motivation of students. Some commenters suggested that instead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of tracking students (who tend to be very mobile) for 13 weeks,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence of the initial hiring by an employer should suffice. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested that the period of employment should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced to 30 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that an employment requirement of 13 weeks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will help stem abuses by institutions that may arrange to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students hired for short-term jobs in order to boost placement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates. In addition, a period of time beyond the initial hiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by an employer should be used to determine that the student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received adequate training from the institution. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that extraneous factors affecting a student's employment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are accounted for by using a placement rate that excludes up to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 percent of the institution's graduates. The 13-week period is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the period of time a student must be employed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be counted in the institution's placement rate under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures delineated in &sect;668.17(d) for the appeal of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's loss of participation due to an unacceptable cohort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> default rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A commenter suggested that students who are placed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jobs that are not related to their training should be counted, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least excluded from the placement-rate formula. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested that placements should be limited to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> graduates who obtained a job in the recognized occupation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which they were trained in order to prevent program abuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Students who are placed in jobs not related to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training should be treated in the formula in the same manner as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students who are not employed. The placement rate is designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure the effectiveness of the training provided by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution, and employment in an unrelated job does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that the training was effective. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that graduates who are employed in occupations that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparable and related to the occupation for which they have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trained should be included in the numerator of the placement rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formula. In these circumstances, the training provided by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school is likely to have been a contributing factor in obtaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment. However, the Department may revise this provision in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the future if there are numerous incidents of abuse in this area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

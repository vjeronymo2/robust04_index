			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Iran removes limit on foreign investment THE IRANIAN government is removing the limit on foreign investment in business and companies, according to Abrar, a Tehran daily newspaper. It reported yesterday that the Supreme Council for Investment had decided on Tuesday to drop the limit which restricts foreigners to a 49 per cent stake in Iranian ventures. It commented said decision was designed to attract funds from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for industrial projects and that these institutions had advised Iran to abolish limits on foreign ownership. Mr Mohsen Nurbakhsh, minister of economy and finance, and Mr Mohammed Adeli, governor of the central bank, returned this week from Washington, where they attended the spring session of the World Bank and IMF. Iran is seeking foreign investment in the fields of gas, energy, agriculture, transport and communications. The government of President Hashemi Rafsanjani has signalled that it is serious about trying to rebuild the country after its eight-year war against Iraq. The country, with a population of over 58m, remains an attractive market for trade but foreign companies have been less enthusiastic about investing in the country. Iranian delegations have been sent around the world, making presentations aimed at projecting an image of Iran as a friendly and stable country with which to do business.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPAGANDA BLITZ UNLEASHED;  </P> <P> IN CHINA'S MEDIA, OFFICIAL VIEW IS THE ONLY MESSAGE  </P> <P> Day after day, hour after hour, Chinese government television shows waves of  mostly youthful protesters attacking army trucks, tanks or armored cars.  </P> <P> The only dead seen in the broadcast videotapes have been three charred corpses  identified as soldiers. Every one of the injured shown so far has been a  military man recovering in the hospital.  </P> <P> In all the broadcasts, no shot fired by troops has been heard on the sound  tracks, although witnesses heard and saw plenty of shooting June 4, when  soldiers moved in force into the center of Beijing.  </P> <P> China's media are in the midst of a propaganda campaign of a kind not  experienced here for more than a decade -- and perhaps not matched since the  1950s campaign against what the government called rightist critics.  </P> <P> Television especially is saturated with stories supporting the government  version of events two weekends ago, when the army stormed into downtown Beijing  and used live ammunition to roust pro-democracy demonstrators from Tian An Men  Square. It has also emphasized the protesters' "criminal" nature with long  reports on arrests of "thugs" throughout the country.  </P> <P> The campaign is a textbook example of the official view here of mass  communication more as a tool of unification and pacification than as an  approach to the truth.  </P> <P> In this time of crisis, persuasion appears to be secondary to another goal:  letting everyone know what it is permissible to think. As a farmer in Tailing,  a village outside Beijing, told a reporter: "Television says that the attacks  were made by thugs. That is all I want to know."  </P> <P> That is not a general attitude, at least here in the capital. Interviews with  Beijing residents over the past nine days indicate that the effects of the  propaganda deluge are more unpredictable than the government might like.  </P> <P> One wild card is the role of the Voice of America and the British Broadcasting  Corp., both of which beam news in the Mandarin dialect to China. Foreign radio  has proven a formidable competitor to the official broadcasts. In random  conversations, many citizens of the capital say they listen to one or both of  the foreign outlets.  </P> <P> In the case of the Voice of America, China has launched a large-scale effort to  discredit its broadcasts by accusing it of deliberate misreporting.  </P> <P> The People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, said Monday  that the VOA could "hardly hide its excitement" over news of the protests at  Tian An Men. It accused the radio of "spreading rumors," including exaggerated  casualty tolls and stories about splits in the military.  </P> <P> "VOA spread too many rumors," the People's Daily said. "They played their part  in helping counterrevolutionary revolt in Beijing. . . . It is time for the VOA  to take a rest."  </P> <P> The government is also trying to head off the foreigners' practice of sending  in news clippings and leaflets by telephone fax machine. In radio broadcasts,  the authorities said that they have stationed police by fax machines in China  to intercept the messages and that any printed material "containing distorted  propaganda" must be turned over to Beijing's Public Security Bureau.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Intercepted Material  </P> <P> In another example of state control of all communication, Chinese authorities  have intercepted unedited ABC News material that was being transmitted to the  United States by satellite and used it to arrest a man who spoke to an American  news crew shortly after the martial-law crackdown.  </P> <P> The intercepted videotape was broadcast on state-run television Saturday  evening, showing a middle-aged man speaking vehemently about the killings of  protesters. The man admitted under questioning by a foreign journalist that he  had not seen the killings himself. He then attributed his information to the  Voice of America and added inaccurately that the American broadcast had  reported 20,000 deaths. The Saturday night broadcast concluded with a plea for  citizens to turn in the "rumormonger" to authorities.  </P> <P> The man appeared again on the Sunday night news, this time in police custody.  </P> <P> Identified as Xiao Bin, 42, the man declared before police officials and a  television camera: "I confess that I was guilty of making up rumors. If you  call me a counterrevolutionary, I admit it."  </P> <P> A spokesman for ABC News in New York objected strenuously to the interception  of its material and the use of it "for political purposes."  </P> <P> In response, U.S. television networks say they have begun to obscure the faces  of dissidents interviewed here to prevent identification and retribution by  authorities.  </P> <P> "We began to electronically disguise all people interviewed in Beijing on our  Sunday evening news programs," an ABC spokesman said from New York. CBS started  to "blank out" faces in interviews, and NBC said it is showing only silhouettes  of those who feared reprisal.  </P> <P> Chinese have reacted to the propaganda onslaught in a variety of ways. Some  simply dismiss the information -- at least in the privacy of their homes.  </P> <P> During one news broadcast, residents of a small courtyard home in the capital's  Qian Men district yelled "False! False!" in response to every official account  of the events at Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> Even Communist Party members, in private, may be heard to reject the official  line. "The party should not lie to the people," said a four-year member who  told a reporter that he was sickened by the army violence.  </P> <P> Other Beijing residents have been merely skeptical, especially if they have  heard foreign reports. Sometimes, when interviewed by a foreigner, Chinese are  much more interested in finding out what a reporter knows than telling him what  they think.  </P> <P> There are those who are wary of expressing themselves, such as the farmer in  Tailing, who viewed the state account as a guideline for staying out of  trouble.  </P> <P> Some would prefer not to hear any version. "I don't go outside to see or ask,  and I don't watch television," said a proprietor of a small, private dumpling  restaurant just a block off Tian An Men Square. "The way I look at it, the less  you know, the better."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Firsthand Accounts  </P> <P> It has not yet been possible to independently locate anyone in Beijing who is  convinced by the official reports. This is due in part to the number of  firsthand accounts of heavy shooting that have spread through the city.  </P> <P> On government news programs, however, there have been numerous interviews with  disgusted citizens who blame the students and other "counterrevolutionary  rebels" for unprovoked attacks on soldiers and the state.  </P> <P> One woman, interviewed in Shanghai, told state television that she watched news  broadcasts of the mayhem in Beijing "four or five times a day."  </P> <P> "It made me extremely angry, the burning of those buses and military vehicles,"  she said. "On top of that, people are spreading rumors, like it was the  People's Liberation Army that burned the vehicles. Our army would never do that  kind of thing!  </P> <P> "Watching television . . . isn't it clear that it's the thugs who did this kind  of destruction?" she asked. She began to cry as she added, "Yesterday, I saw  that soldier who was burned up that way, and I felt terrible inside."  </P> <P> Interspersed among such interviews were scenes of affection between common  citizens and the army. In one, soldiers paid visits to a school and helped  children wash windows.  </P> <P> "Thank you, uncle," the children said.  </P> <P> A peasant delivered three live pigs as a gift for one encampment of troops  deployed in the capital. The perhaps obligatory scene of soldiers helping an  old lady cross a street has been aired several times.  </P> <P> The testimonies and tributes followed days of repetitive broadcasts of selected  events from the June 4 weekend in and around Tian An Men Square that appear to  throw full guilt on protesters.  </P> <P> For instance, along a stretch of Changan Avenue in front of the Military  Museum, a remote-control, black-and-white video camera recorded what appeared  to be wave after wave of mob attacks on army tanks, armored cars and trucks.  </P> <P> The date and time of the action was shown at the bottom of the screen.  Sometimes, from segment to segment, the clock would jump forward two hours,  then backward five and then forward to the next day. No explanation was given  for the unsequential editing, and only mob violence was shown.  </P> <P> Youths identified as eyewitnesses in Tian An Men Square said all student  demonstrators escaped unharmed. No mention is made of the violence on Changan  or other thoroughfares or of the flatbed carts that were seen bearing bodies  away.  </P> <P> The one-sided slant is but an extreme example out of modern China's long  history of communication at the service of the state.  </P> <P> Officialdom's view of the media as mainly a propaganda tool predates Communist  rule. As early as the first decades of the century, pioneer journalist Liang  Qichao considered public opinion and its manipulation as a contributor to a  stable state, not as a means of expressing contending views.  </P> <P> The Nationalist government, which ruled China for a time after the fall of the  Qing Dynasty, routinely censored books and newspapers critical of the  government.  </P> <P> The late Communist leader Mao Tse-tung argued that the role of the press was  "to bring the party program, the party line, the party's general and specific  policies . . . before the masses in the quickest and most extensive way."  </P> <P> When in the late 1970s and early 1980s the Chinese press entered an uneven era  of revealing public wrongs, a Communist Party leader in Canton warned editors  and reporters: "Exposure of our dark side should not be too frequent nor too  highly colored. Otherwise, people might get the wrong impression, weakening the  party's prestige among the masses and affecting stability and unity in ways  that are not beneficial to socialist construction."  </P> <P> Since the Tian An Men incident, at least, the "dark side" of government has  received no exposure at all.  </P></p>

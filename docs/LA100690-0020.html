			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBUM REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'SHORT DOG'S' RAP: IT'S NOT MANTOVANI  </P> <P> Back when everybody hated rap, "Short Dog's in the House" (Jive/RCA) is the  stuff they thought they were hating, ultra-hardcore pimp rhymes from the  streets of Oakland, droned over monotonous, bare beats. Too Short's raps are  irresistible to old-school rap fans: nonstop litanies of his conquests and his  kingdom.  </P> <P> His rapping is formidable and unique, never straying from hip-hop's roots in  macho streetcorner jive.  </P> <P> Of course, the flagrant misogyny here makes the album all but unlistenable to  women -- especially the track where Ice Cube guests. This album sounds as if it  cost about $500 to make, but it will probably go platinum, just like his last  one did . . . even if the sharp rap remake of Donny Hathaway's  black-consciousness anthem "In the Ghetto" never gets a second of airplay.

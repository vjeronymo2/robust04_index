Not when there are so  many stylish models with price tags that won't empty your wallet.  </P> <P> The new Minnie Mouse watch by Lorus with a red-and-black polka dot rubber  wristband is a bit of whimsy for a reasonable $34.95 at Feldmar Watch and Clock  Center in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> More famous faces in timely places are found in the Memories Collection at the  Soap Plant in Los Angeles. Autographed photos of Marilyn Monroe and Jimmy Dean  are on the film-strip framed watch faces, priced at $45. Also from the Soap  Plant is the itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny silver bracelet watch from Capezio for  $100.  </P> <P> For timekeeping futurists the Match Watch collection has devices as intricate  as a space ship's flight panel. At K mart, $24.97 JOANNA DENDEL  </P></p>

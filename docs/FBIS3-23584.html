A  working meeting of delegations from the Ukrainian Ministry of  Defense and the Kazakh Republic Ministry of Defense was held in  Almaty on 16 February. The delegation to the negotiations was  headed by: On the Ukrainian side--deputy defense minister and  armed forces armament chief Colonel General Ivan Oleynik, and  from the Kazakh side--chief of Air Force Main Staff Major  General Alibek Kasymov. The problems of widening military  cooperation and implementing agreements signed at the level of  government delegations of the countries in early 1994 were  discussed during the negotiations.    A joint communique was signed on the basis of the results of  the meeting in Almaty. In it, the sides note their great  interest in widening contacts between the military departments  of the two countries on a broad range of issues. The principles  of mutual respect, mutual trust and mutual advantage were laid  at the basis of development of such relations.    The Ukrainian side expressed its readiness for military,  technical and scientific cooperation in developing new forms of  equipment and modernizing armament already in existence. Mutual  understanding of Ukraine and Kazakhstan in this area will make  it possible to carry out this work less expensively and more  effectively. Interaction in development of the missile and space  possibilities of the two countries is promising.    The Kazakh delegation displayed interest in more intensive  use of Ukraine's repair base on behalf of the armed forces of  Kazakhstan. The nature of mutual settlements will be refined and  determined more specifically in the immediate future, and the  possibility for quickly paying off existing debts is being  studied.    Both sides made note of the extensive possibilities for  mutually advantageous cooperation between the military  departments of Kazakhstan and Ukraine in the areas of troop rear  support, military education and other areas of military  development.    Such bilateral contacts are in keeping with international  obligations adopted through treaties, and they meet the  aspirations of Ukraine and the Kazakh Republic without  infringing upon the interests of any third countries. Hastening  the efforts by the Kazakh Republic and Ukraine to draft a treaty  on military cooperation was deemed suitable in the course of the  negotiations.    On the same day the Ukrainian military delegation left  Almaty  for Tashkent, where it is to meet with Uzbek colleagues.</p>

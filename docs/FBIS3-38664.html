Brigadier General A. Van Baal has  been appointed by Defense Minister Ter Beek to the position of  command chief of staff, succeeding Ramsey from the United  Kingdom.    Van Baal (47) will become second in command to British  General Rose, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] commander in  Bosnia. After six months, another Dutchman will take over the  position for another half year. Van Baal will be staying at the  UNPROFOR headquarters at Kiseljak next weekend, to get  acquainted with Rose, who recently succeeded General Briquemont  from Belgium.    Van Baal, an artillerist, is currently commander of the 43rd  mechanized brigade at Havelte. He has also been head of the  army staff's organizational department in the Hague. Van Baal  is regarded as a rising star within the army.    He will have the daily command of 460 troops of different  nationalities, including 60 Dutchmen. From the headquarters in  Kiseljak, the chief of staff will act as the deputy commander of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina command.    Together with the commander, he is in charge of the overall  coordination of all troops in Bosnia. They frequently consult  with political and military leaders from the contending parties,  such as the Bosnian Serb leaders Karadzic and Mladic.    The command is also responsible for the protection of food  convoys organized by the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner  for Refugees). The Dutch-Belgian transportation battalion in  Central Bosnia, the UNHCR's only military transportation unit,  also comes under the command. [passage omitted]</p>

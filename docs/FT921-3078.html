			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (27): If it's got to be Abuja . . . - Business Visitor's Guide LAST YEAR, shortly before Christmas, Nigeria fulfilled a 16-year-old dream that had been cherished successively by six governments and four presidents. On December 12 President Ibrahim Babangida cleared out of Dodan Barracks in Lagos and took up his residence in the Presidential Palace in Abuja. His move marked the official, and many say irrevocable, inauguration of Abuja as the new administrative federal capital of Nigeria. However, a shortage of housing and office space may hold back the pace at which Abuja transforms itself into a fully-fledged capital. Foreign embassies remain in Lagos for the time being, though many plan to staff offices in Abuja by the end of this year. The British High Commission has already established a rudimentary office in the Sheraton Hotel where British businessmen can get advice. While most banks and corporate head offices will stay in Lagos for the next 12 months, Abuja will increasingly become the place that foreign businessmen have to visit to see officials. Getting there Driving is still recommended by many old Nigeria hands as an alternative to erratic and often frustrating experiences when catching flights. The drive from Lagos takes eight hours on fairly good roads. ADC, Concord, Okada and Nigerian Airways all operate daily flights between Lagos and Abuja and the new capital is also served by airlines from most of Nigeria's other main urban centres. If you are flying from Lagos it is not advisable to try to reserve or buy your ticket beforehand. Go to the airport - beware of touts, if possible - and confirm that the aircraft is actually going to fly and that you have a definite confirmed seat before you buy your ticket. Friday can be a hectic day to fly out of Abuja as many officials head home to Lagos for the weekend.

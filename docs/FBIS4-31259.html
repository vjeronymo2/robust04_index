			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Tirana by Takis Dhiamandis] </F>   [Text] Nothing has been happening with the Greek minority  situation in the last few days, according to Americans who  visited Gjirokaster to check on the charges made against a large  number of witnesses last week. "The numbers mentioned are  totally unverified," a U.S. Embassy spokesman said, and added:    "There is talk about 40, 60, or 70 people, but I only know  about 25." The same spokesman said that what actually happened  was that the witnesses were summoned normally and according to  the law, except for a few cases where certain persons were  summoned by the police.    These remarks give rise to reasonable questions even among  the Albanian opposition, whose leading members claim openly that  the shadow of some U.S. secret agencies hovers behind the  Albanian Government's actions.    Commenting on [Albanian President] Sali Berisha's policy,  Servet Pellumbi, first vice chairman of the Socialist Party of  Albania, sarcastically said yesterday that "one can find many  good things about Berisha, but ideas are not among them." He  added:    "No matter how crazy Berisha might be, he cannot possibly  act  alone." As he explained, it is impossible for the policy of  Berisha and the Albanian Government not to be guided by other  foreign powers and primarily the United States. However, he  stressed: "We should know, however, that the U.S. policy toward  Albania is not unified. There is congressional policy, State  Department policy, and the secret agencies' policy."    Pellumbi added that things in the political field recently  seem to be changing as the U.S. Embassy is slowly approaching  the other political parties, even the Socialist Party.    Leading members of other Albanian parties agree with this  assessment by Servet Pellumbi and they also maintain that this  means a change in the stance of Americans toward Albania.  However, this view is not shared by a foreign diplomat in  Tirana, who said that the Americans' opening up to all the  Albanian parties shows precisely their determination to be  regulators of domestic affairs in Albania--and in a broader  sense of its foreign relations--for a long time.    According to a statement to a Greek correspondent by Servet  Pellumbi, the Socialist Party of Albania insists on the path of  dialogue with Greece and not the escalation of tension.  Pellumbi made it clear that this position forms the basis of  criticism that the Socialist Party of Albania makes against the  government and President Seli Berisha on the issue of  Greek-Albanian relations.    At the same time, Pellumbi expressed satisfaction at the  cool  and reasonable stance maintained by the Greek Government during  the recent crisis in the two countries' relations and stressed  in particular the fact that the Greek side did not play its card  of Albanian immigrants as the Konstandinos Mitsotakis government  had done in the past. He added that the latter fact had a  favorable effect on the Albanian people and it is something  which, as he noted, Berisha himself did not understand.    On the subject of the Albanian president, Pellumbi said that  he has no cohesion in his policy whatsoever and that he seems to  like Europe but his mind is really elsewhere.    However, referring to Greece, the socialist leader said that  there are some chauvinistic circles from which he believes the  Greek Government should be cut off and moreover that Greece  should respect the autocephalous status of the Albanian Orthodox  Church and not link it to the Albanian state from which it was  already separated as of 1928.    Pellumbi also condemned the ugly incidents during Easter and  stressed that "unfortunately, the two countries' governments  became involved in them afterward."    In conclusion, Pellumbi stressed that until now the U.S.  Embassy in Tirana has supported the Albanian Government's  policy. Concerning Europe, he said that "for Berisha it  constitutes the font in which he will be pardoned for all the  violations of political and human rights in the name of the  internal and external `dangers' facing Albania and which  nevertheless are the result of the lack of capability of Berisha  himself and his government."</p>

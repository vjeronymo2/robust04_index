			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Antonia Marcia Vale from Belem, Para State] </F>   [Text] The OAS will hold its next general assembly in  Port-au-Prince, the capital city of Haiti. The decision was  made today at a plenary session of the OAS General Assembly in  Belem by all of the 34 OAS member countries.    Haiti has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1991,  when Army coupists ousted the first elected president since the  downfall of a previous dictatorship that had lasted  approximately 50 years.    OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares has described the  OAS  General Assembly's decision as unequivocal proof of a clear  political will to resolve the Haitian crisis. In his opinion,  the holding of the general assembly in Haiti will be  instrumental in confirming the restoration of democracy in that  country.</p>

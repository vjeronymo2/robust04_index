			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Lionel Barber report: "Brussels Points the Finger at </F> Fiscal Laggards"]    [Text] The European Commission yesterday pointed the  finger at EU [European Union] member states which it considers  are not doing enough to curb budget deficits and restrain  inflation.    Dropping its usual diplomatic language, the Commission  singled out France and Denmark for lax fiscal policy along with  more familiar laggards led by Spain, Greece, Italy, and Portugal.    The UK, which has introduced record tax increases to curb a  50 billion pound budget deficit, escapes criticism on the fiscal  side. But Mr John Major's government receives an unwelcome  warning from Brussels about the risks of inflation.    The criticism appears in an update of the Commission's  macroeconomic guidelines which are intended to serve as a  blueprint for the EU to the end of the century and a framework  for achieving a single currency.    Union heads of government approved the first version of the  guidelines at the Brussels summit last December. The latest  paper has been adjusted to take account of the economic recovery  now under way in Europe.    Mr Henning Christophersen, the economics commissioner,  stressed the importance of reducing budget deficits. He  expressed concern about the recent rise in long-term interest  rates in Europe and said measures should be taken to reduce them  so as not to harm the recovery. The Commission paper calls for  a "clear confirmation" in member states' 1995 budgets that  fiscal consolidation is under way. It urged Belgium to match its  budget targets, and called on Spain, Portugal and Greece to  embark on long-term budget pruning.    The Commission also noted that in Denmark and France "it is  important to ensure that the fiscal expansion is reversed as the  economy gains momentum."    On inflation rates, the Commission says Spain, Portugal,  Italy and Britain have yet to decline into the range set by the  macroeconomic guidelines. Its prediction that Italy and the UK  "are expected to approach it significantly next year" may  irritate Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, who  has already clashed with Brussels over its lower growth forecast  for the UK.</p>

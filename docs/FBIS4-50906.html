			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Chris Patten Is Playing the Human Rights Card"] </F>   [Text] On 20 May, Chris Patten returned to Britain to  "report on his work" for one week. It was said that he would  discuss with John Major and Douglas Hurd the issue of setting up  a "Human Rights Committee," as proposed by the report of the  Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the British Parliament.  This shows that Patten is going further and further along the  course of confrontation. He has not only ripped up the rails  for convergence with the Basic law and tried to unilaterally set  up a political structure and impose it on the government of the  Special Administrative Region [SAR] beyond 1997, but also plans  to set the time bomb of a "human rights committee," revise a  series of laws in Hong Kong, and broaden the room for maneuver  for international forces in an attempt to create discord,  turmoil, and confrontation after 1997.    Patten's "three violations" are aimed at establishing a  pro-British and anti-China political body in Hong Kong and then  imposing it on the SAR. The plan for establishing a human  rights committee is also aimed at resisting China's sovereign  power, expanding the room for political maneuver, introducing  international political forces into Hong Kong, and thus turning  Hong Kong into a "political city." In this way, Britain may  continue to control Hong Kong's politics in reality after it  returns Hong Kong to China nominally.    The report of the British Parliament "proposed" that the  Hong  Kong Government set up a "human rights committee" and a "human  rights supervision organ" before 1997 so that they might  continue to exert international pressure on China after 1997  through "joint supervision over the development of the human  rights situation in Hong Kong after 1997" by the British  Government and the UN Human Rights Committee.    China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong  as of 1 July 1997. Britain has no right to influence anything  on China's territory and within the scope of China's internal  affairs, still less can it exercise any "supervision" over Hong  Kong affairs through a so-called human rights committee. In  addition to the attempt to maintain its influence in Hong Kong,  the plan to establish a "human rights committee" also shows that  Britain has the ambition of changing China's current system and  territory. The report by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee  not only meddles in Hong Kong's post-1997 affairs, but also has  a hand in Taiwan and Tibetan affairs. Britain tries to harbor  such people as Han Dongfang and allow them to use Hong Kong as a  springboard to enter the mainland for setting up liberal trade  unions and overthrowing the socialist system. Britain also  repeatedly interferes in such cases as that of Xi Yang in order  to support and protect people who use Hong Kong as a base for  buying, prying into, and stealing China's political, military,  and economic secrets and thus endangering China's security.  Britain continues to support such organizations as the  "Alliance in Support of the Patriotic and Democratic Movement in  China," which is hostile to China and attempts to disrupt Hong  Kong's stability, and allows it to continue its "yellow bird  action" and stretch its sinister hand into the mainland.    There also exist human rights problems in Britain. People of  Asian and African origin cannot enjoy equal treatment there, and  the demand of the people in Northern Ireland for independence is  suppressed cruelly. International human rights organizations  and the United States have interfered in and criticized such  events. However, Britain has not enacted its own "human rights  law" or set up a "human rights committee" in order to meet the  needs of guaranteeing human rights in its own country. Why so?  Britain fails to give any explanation, but it has formulated a  human rights law and is planning to set up a human rights  committee in Hong Kong shortly before its withdrawal from Hong  Kong. Obviously, it harbors sinister intentions when doing this.    An ancient Chinese saying goes that "one should not impose  anything one does not like on other people." Britain does not  want to see other countries interfere in affairs within its own  sovereign power, does not want to see foreign forces interfere  in the Northern Ireland issue, and does not want to see any  international organizations supervise its human rights  situation. Why did it do all this against China?    Over more than 100 years of British rule in Hong Kong,  Britain declared that some provisions of the international human  rights convention which it had signed were not applicable in  Hong Kong, and Britain also opposed deleting Hong Kong from its  list of colonies. Historical facts show that Britain had no  sincerity on giving democracy and human rights to Hong Kong.  Obviously it was for sinister purposes that it began to  introduce such things only when it would soon withdraw from Hong  Kong.    Many countries in the world do not have a "human rights  committee." The United States, Britain, Japan, and many other  countries have not set up human rights committees. However,  such committees have been set up in Canada and Australia, two of  Britain's former colonies. The practical results there are not  commendable. Enterprise management is made a mess of; large  numbers of suits pile up year on year; large amounts of public  money are wasted; right and wrong are lumped together; even  gangsters and tax evaders can enjoy various strange "human  rights" and can even make a fortune by filing countercharges.  Now Britain is trying to impose on Hong Kong such a human  rights committee, which has proved unsuccessful and which may  produce many side effects. This is completely another political  trick before its withdrawal from a colony.    The Basic Law includes sufficient provisions guaranteeing  human rights. In all countries, the guarantees of human rights  of their own people can only be effected through their own  sovereign power and their own legal systems. The establishment  of a human rights committee in Hong Kong outside the framework  of the Basic Law before Britain's withdrawal will only disrupt  the administrative, judicial, and legislative operation of the  future SAR Government, and may even throw things into chaos.  Therefore, such an organization illegally set up by the  colonialists is out of line with the Basic Law and is bound to  be disbanded after 1997.    People have noted that when the British side was talking  about the improvement of relations with China, Patten again  began to play the "human rights card." What is his political  purpose? How far does he plan to go along the course of  worsening Sino-British relations?</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Describe facilities, equipment, and other resources that would be available to the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Describe the administrative and organizational structure and linkages established with other relevant organizations (e.g. subcontractors, other projects). Provide charts summarizing these structures and linkages and written agreements defining them (include in appendices).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Budget Appropriateness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Discuss and justify the cost of the proposed project in terms of types and quantities of services to be provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Describe the fiscal control and accounting procedures that will be used to ensure the prudent use, proper disbursement, and accurate accounting of funds received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Describe how additional resources necessary to carry out this project would be obtained and integrated into the work of the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Provide assurance that one key person from the project would attend an annual 2&hyph;3 day FYSB sponsored meeting in Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Duration of Project:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This announcement solicits applications for Training and Technical Assistance cooperative agreements of up to five years in duration (60-month project periods). Initial awards, made on a competitive basis, will be for one-year (12-month) budget periods. Applications for continuation cooperative agreements beyond the one-year budget period, but within the 60-month project period, will be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis, subject to the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee, and determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal Share of Project Costs:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The maximum Federal share is not to exceed $150,000 per Federal Region for the first 12-month budget period, or a maximum of $750,000 per Federal Region for the 5-year project period. (For example, a project covering two Regions may receive up to $300,000 for the first 12-month budget period. Conversely, a project serving less than a Federal Region (e.g., a Statewide system) would receive less than $150,000 for the first 12-month budget period.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Matching Requirement:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The minimum non-Federal matching requirement in proportion to the maximum Federal share of $750,000 is $75,000 for a 5-year project period. This constitutes 10 percent of the total Federal share.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Anticipated number of projects to be funded:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is anticipated that up to ten projects will be funded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part IV. Application Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Assistance to Prospective Grantees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Potential grantees can receive informational assistance in developing applications from the appropriate ACF Regional Youth Contacts listed in Part VI, Appendix F or from the Administration on Children, Youth and Families in Washington, DC (see address at the beginning of this announcement).

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has announced that the  IMF will contribute $713 million to Turkey within the framework  of the stand-by agreement. Ciller, who is currently in the  United States, declared that the report drafted by the IMF  delegation that visited Turkey at the beginning of the month was  approved by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus. According  to information supplied by the Prime Minister's Press Center,  Ciller issued the following statement on the subject:    IMF Director Michel Camdessus called me today and informed  me  that he has approved the report of the IMF delegation that  visited Turkey at the beginning of this month. Accordingly, the  IMF will extend $713 million to Turkey within the framework of  the stand-by agreement. Camdessus' decision on this matter will  be put into effect by the IMF board of governors, which will  convene at the beginning of July.    The statement made by the IMF today is pleasing. Firstly,  the negotiating process with the IMF was concluded at a fast  rate. Secondly, as will be noted in Mr. Camdessus' statement,  the IMF finds the economic program which was announced and  effected by the Turkish Government on 5 April very  comprehensive, realistic, and solid. The $713 million  contribution to be received from the IMF within the stand-by  agreement constitutes the maximum amount Turkey can receive from  this organization. This, in turn, is a significant indication  of the international support accorded to our program. The most  important aspect of the IMF statement, in my view, is the fact  that the program, which was prepared and effected by the Turkish  Government itself, was endorsed without any argument. In other  words, the IMF has fully approved our formula for the recovery  of the Turkish economy. With the implementation of this  program, Turkey will occupy the position it deserves among the  strongest economies of Europe.</p>

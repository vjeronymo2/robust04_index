			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman has  expressed regret over the nuclear experiments being conducted by  the PRC when work on a treaty banning nuclear experiments is  gaining momentum.    Speaking at a news conference today, Ataman expressed  Turkey's belief that it is necessary to sign a comprehensive  international treaty banning nuclear experiments, which have  many environmental, health, and security drawbacks from the  viewpoint of the future of humanity.    Ataman said:    We regret to learn that the PRC has, in the last few days,  conducted another nuclear experiment when work on a treaty  banning nuclear experiments is gaining momentum and when  countries with nuclear capabilities are taking steps to make  their unilateral decisions to halt these experiments permanent.    Turkey believes in the necessity of signing a comprehensive  international treaty -- which will be a significant  complementary factor in helping the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty attain its goals -- banning nuclear experiments, which  have many environmental, health, and security drawbacks from the  viewpoint of the future of humanity. Turkey further notes that  it is doing all it can on the issue and finds it beneficial to  stress that it is deeply concerned and displeased about any kind  of behavior that might endanger the promising work being  accomplished on this path.</p>

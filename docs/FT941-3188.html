			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / People: British Telecom Mike Bett, 58, one of British Telecoms's two non-executive deputy chairmen, is standing down at the end of this month. His departure is no surprise; he became a non-executive deputy chairman three years ago, having previously been managing director of BT UK. His departure leaves Paul Bosonnet as BT's sole deputy chairman. Bett will continue as chairman of Cellnet, BT's cellular mobile joint venture with Securicor, until next January. Michael Argent will step down as director and secretary at the end of July but will continue as a non-executive director until the end of 1995. Colin Green, chief legal adviser, also takes on the role of secretary.</p>

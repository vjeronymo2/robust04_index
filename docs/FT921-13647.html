			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (4): Lost: 20m condoms - US assistance is far from trouble-free FOR AMERICAN officials administering the Dollars 815m annual US aid programme for Egypt, the Case of the Missing Condoms is no laughing matter. Acutely sensitive to any allegations of misappropriation of US taxpayers' dollars, officers of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) were alarmed as well as embarrassed when it became clear recently that no fewer than 20m condoms allocated to a Washington-backed Egyptian birth control programme had been taken up by local private sector companies. Private sector involvement in the scheme was officially prescribed. But USAID officials did not believe such a 'surprisingly high' number of condoms could realistically be properly distributed by the private sector. Jokes quickly began circulating among Egyptians that the condoms had been sold as children's balloons. USAID suspects they have been sold for profit or are being hoarded. The agency is threatening to bill the Egyptian authorities unless the missing items are accounted for. The condom mystery is more than just an amusing tale to be told at the expense of American blushes. It also illustrates how the USAID programme extends to the most mundane levels of Egyptian life. In the years since Washington began pumping in economic aid, as a reward for Egypt's 1979 Camp David peace treaty with Israel, more than Dollars 15bn in grants have been forthcoming. The aid, which comes on top of the Dollars 1.2bn annual military assistance, is much less in both absolute and per capita terms than the yearly US economic aid to Israel. Unlike Israel, which gets the money 'up front' to disburse as it pleases, USAID runs a 500-person operation in Egypt to manage the project-by-project allocation of the assistance to the country. Nevertheless, USAID funds have become an extremely important and constant source of development funding in the economy. In particular, they play a vital role in supporting infrastructure development, which accounts for about one third of the annual USAID flow to Egypt. The funds are divided into three main categories: Dollars 115m a year goes in the form of a cash subvention to the Government, to date loosely tied to economic performance but not conditioned specifically to policy. Dollars 200m a year is allocated for commodity imports from the US, until recently chiefly for the public sector, but now weighted Dollars 175m to Dollars 25m in favour of the private sector. Dollars 500m goes for infrastructure and social sector development. Schemes supported under the last category cover crop research and development, reducing Government interference in agricultural prices, basic education projects, health programmes - USAID claims its child disease aid has helped reduce infant mortality from 100 deaths per 1,000 to fewer than 50 - population control and local development projects. By far the biggest sums, however, have been spent on infrastructure, chiefly in the areas of potable water and wastewater programmes, power generating plants and telecommunications. USAID has been the biggest outside backer by far for the huge Cairo sewage project, now more than 12 years old and within a few years of completion. A total of Dollars 816m has been committed to the scheme. Wastewater projects in Alexandria will account for Dollars 350m and smaller projects in three Nile cities and three Suez Canal cities will swallow a further Dollars 500m. There is a heavy flowback to the US as American contractors do 79 per cent of the work and US companies supply much of the inputs. But the payout to Egyptian contractors is considerable and the benefits to Cairo and the other cities as a whole are unarguable. The next biggest USAID infrastructure commitment is to the power sector where Dollars 1bn has been earmarked. US officials say more than one quarter of all Egypt's generating capacity has been US-built. One project just at the completion stage is a Dollars 150m job to replace the 24 'runners' which feed the turbines at the Aswan High Dam. Telephone users in Cairo and Alexandria will also testify to the effects of Dollars 300m put into the hopelessly outdated telecommunications systems in the two cities by USAID in the past few years. The decisions on how USAID money is spent are taken by USAID and officials from the Ministry of International Cooperation. Each side has a veto in the sense that a project cannot go ahead unless both sides agree to it. Under the new director of the Egypt USAID operation, Hank Bassford, a strategic reassessment is underway to review where the money goes. The trend is clearly to shift away from pure public sector works to a greater involvement in the private sector, in line with the course of economic reforms set for Egypt by its agreements with the IMF, World Bank and Paris Club creditors. 'For years we couldn't really do anything in the private sector for political reasons,' says a US diplomat. 'There are still a lot of old-line socialists going back to the Nasser period in the bureaucracy who really don't want to change. But we are beginning to overcome the Government's reluctance to commit our funds to the private sector.' With the Government, Mr Bassford is also aiming to design assistance schemes which help Egypt meet the reform targets it has been set. USAID money is, for example, supporting studies by Peat Marwick on how to administer a new general sales tax and, similarly, work by Coopers and Lybrand on privatisation. USAID funds will continue to be a big source of traditional development funding. But assistance will tend to be more closely policy-related. 'We will not attempt to move them in new directions, but we will help them to carry out the economic reform programme they are already committed to,' says Mr Bassford.</p>

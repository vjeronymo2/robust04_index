			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUARTER-CENT STATE SALES TAX HIKE WILL TAKE EFFECT TODAY  </P> <P> Just in time for holiday shopping, the state sales tax increases one-fourth  cent on each dollar of purchases today.  </P> <P> The estimated $800 million that the additional tax will raise over its 13-month  duration will aid victims of the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake and help pay for  quake-related repairs to freeways, schools and other structures.  </P> <P> Lawmakers who approved the tax in a special session last month scheduled it to  begin today so that it will be in effect during both this year's and next  year's Christmas shopping season.  </P> <P> For most counties in the state, the new sales tax rate will be 6.25%.  </P> <P> However, voters in 13 counties previously approved local-option sales tax  increases, mostly for transportation projects. The sales tax as of today will  be 6.75% in Fresno, Inyo, Los Angeles, Riverside, Sacramento, San Benito, San  Francisco and Santa Cruz counties. It will be 7.25% in Alameda, Contra Costa,  San Diego, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.  </P> <P> And voters in five counties on Nov. 7 approved additional half-cent increases  that will not take effect until April 1, 1990, at the earliest. They are  Imperial, Monterey, San Bernardino, San Francisco and Santa Barbara. When those  increases take effect, the tax will be 6.75% in all but San Francisco, which  will rise to 7.25%.  </P></p>

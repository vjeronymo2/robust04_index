			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> STUN GUN USED IN O.C. ROBBERY  </P> <P> Two men shocked a Huntington Beach woman with an electric stun gun before  robbing her of her purse, police said today.  </P> <P> Alicia K. Derieux, 23, told police that the robbers escaped with $1 in cash  along with her checks and credit cards.  </P> <P> "This is a rare one," Lt. John Foster said of the stun gun robbery.  </P> <P> Stun guns, which are legal, send out electronic charges from two metal prongs,  shocking the victim and in some cases rendering the person unconscious.  </P> <P> The robbery occurred late last night at Derieux's carport at an apartment  complex in the 6700 block of Warner Avenue.  </P> <P> Foster said two men approached Derieux and instructed her "not to turn around."  </P> <P> "One of the suspects shot the woman (with the stun gun) in her right arm,"  Foster said.  </P> <P> Derieux suffered a small bruise but she did not require hospitalization, Foster  said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nasir al-Rimawi] </F>   [Text] Ramallah -- The Democratic Front for the Liberation  of Palestine [DFLP] has called for the holding of free and  democratic municipal council elections. It also called for  rejecting the principle of appointments.    In a statement distributed yesterday in Ramallah, the DFLP  warned against the municipalities' assumption of political  tasks, as in Hebron. The statement emphasized the need for  municipalities to fulfill their role in serving the residents,  far from the Oslo accord. It said that no one has the right to  use the municipalities for political purposes.    The statement renewed the demand to hold comprehensive  elections for all municipalities. It considers the lack of  response to the demand for elections as an indication of the  dictatorship of the coming authority, which our people will not  allow.    The statement said that the Israeli consent to reinstate the  Hebron municipal council members, who were elected 18 years ago,  was a bribe. The Israeli authorities have refused and are  refusing to collectively reinstate the elected municipal  councils, which is a popular Palestinian demand.    The statement sharply criticized what it called "the new  concessions," namely; having the settlers remain in the heart of  Hebron and in all the occupied territories, giving up the demand  for international protection for our defenseless people, and  sufficing with a weak multinational observers' presence as a  substitute to the international protection stipulated by the  Security Council.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Wanxiu (0719 8001 4423)] </F>   [Text] Antananaivo, 19 Jan (XINHUA) -- Malagasy President  Albert Zafy received Qian Qichen, China's State Council vice  premier and foreign minister, here this afternoon.    President Zafy warmly welcomed Qian Qichen. He said: The  current visit will surely further enhance the development of  friendly and cooperative ties between the two countries.    Qian Qichen said: Sino-Malagasy relations have a sound  foundation. The Chinese and Malagasy Governments will make  joint efforts to continuously consolidate and develop the  friendship between the peoples of the two countries and push  forward the development of bilateral economic and technological  cooperation.    Qian Qichen conveyed President Jiang Zemin's cordial regards  and good wishes to President Zafy. He said: President Jiang  looks forward to President Zafy's visit to China this year.    President Zafy pointed out: Madagascar and China have many  points in common. The Malagasy Government highly treasures our  friendly ties with China.    Touching on the situation in Africa, Qian Qichen said: The  process of decolonization in Africa has taken nearly half a  century. Currently, the African nations are still in a stage of  exploring how to develop their own economies. He stressed: The  practice of China's construction has proven that one cannot gain  success by indiscriminately copying and imitating the  experiences of other countries. The important thing is to  proceed from the realities of your own country, combine them  with and draw from the experiences of other countries, while  seeking your own path of development.    President Zafy endorsed Qian Qichen's views. He said: The  African people are increasingly aware of the importance of  acting independently and having the initiative in their own  hands, and of relying on themselves to develop their countries.  Notwithstanding that presently Africa has encountered  difficulties, it has its own superiorities.    Earlier on, Malagasy speaker Andriamahazo met with Qian  Qichen, and both sides exchanged views on how to further  strengthen contacts between the national assemblies of the two  countries.    Qian Qichen and his party left Madagascar this afternoon for  a visit to Mauritius.</p>

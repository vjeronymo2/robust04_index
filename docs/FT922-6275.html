			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / EC set to decide on sanctions against Serbia THE European Community will today decide whether to impose a comprehensive package of economic sanctions against Serbia in an effort to stop the fighting in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. But western diplomats continue to caution against military intervention, and Russia still opposes mandatory sanctions by the United Nations. The mounting international pressure on Serbia coincides with negotiations in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, on withdrawing Yugoslav federal army units from city's barracks. Over the past three weeks the army and Serb irregulars have blocked food, water and medical supplies into the besieged city. Aid workers based in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, said inhabitants of Sarajevo were near starvation. Yesterday army units started withdrawing from one of the barracks, but Moslem forces prevented units from leaving two other barracks because the Serb-dominated army had apparently refused to surrender their weapons. In Mostar, south-eastern Bosnia, Croat and Serb forces continued to fight for control of the city. The Moslem community, which makes up the majority of the population, has fled to neighbouring Croatia and other parts of Bosnia. Today's EC meeting follows a move by the US and Canada to block landing rights for JAT, the Yugoslav airline, which is based in Belgrade, the Serbian capital. Both countries have recalled their ambassadors. EC countries recalled their ambassadors from Serbia last week. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, is calling for tough sanctions against Serbia. Speaking in Lisbon at the end of an EC-sponsored conference on aid to former Soviet republics, Mr Baker told other countries to 'stop looking for reasons not to take action. 'There are 35,000 diabetics now who have no insulin. There are 6,000 women and babies who have no medicine, baby formula or milk (in Sarajevo),' he told jounalists. 'Anyone who is looking for a reason not to act, or arguing somehow that action in the face of this kind of nightmare is not warranted at this time. . . is on the wrong wavelength.' Mr John Major, British prime minister, last night gave full backing to Mr Baker's call, Philip Stephens writes. Speaking as he arrived in Warsaw for a four-day visit to central Europe, Mr Major made it plain he wants today's meeting of EC governments in Brussels to agree measures well beyond the token protest advocated by some EC governments.</p>

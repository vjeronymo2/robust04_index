			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UTILITY BLOCKING UNION EFFORT TO GAIN MEMBERSHIP ON BOARD  </P> <P> Regarding the letter from Pacific Enterprises Chief Executive Paul A. Miller  ("Southern California Gas Co. Is Proud of Stock Ownership Plan for Workers,"  April 23):  </P> <P> Miller's response to Harry Bernstein's April 18 column ("Utility Resists Adding  Union Official to Firm's Directors") is a masterpiece of misleading  information. He claims that I have been offered the shareholders list in the  drive to get representation for the thousands of shareholders (many of them  unions workers at Southern California Gas) who are unhappy with both the  performance of Pacific Enterprises stock and the state of labor relations at  its gas company subsidiary.  </P> <P> Pacific offered us the list excluding all participants in the employee stock  ownership plans -- more than 20% of the list.  </P> <P> Pacific's refusal was absolute until a Superior Court judge ordered the company  to provide us with a list of participants who don't object. And access to the  list has been made prohibitively expensive. To get the full list, our  shareholders action committee must pay more than $15,000 over and above what  Pacific has cost us in legal fees to get a judge to make a ruling.  </P> <P> Miller's concern about privacy might be more understandable if he were  concerned about everyone's privacy. But he seems only concerned about the  privacy of the 20% of shareholders who are most likely to give us their vote.  </P> <P> Unions at Southern California Gas Co. have united to support a union member for  the board of directors, and we have a chance of winning. Miller has stated that  he only wants people of the "highest caliber," clearly implying that union  members are not. That suggests what he really thinks of the shareholders who  are the gas company's employees.  </P> <P> As Bernstein pointed out, it is commonplace for European companies to have  worker representatives on their boards, and employee stock ownership plans are  growing rapidly. While it appears that Miller intends to retire in the near  future, he and his successors are likely to face the apparently unnerving  prospect of having to share power and the board room with people who have  actually worked for the gas company.  </P> <P> SAM WEINSTEIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> The writer, a candidate for Pacific Enterprises' board of directors, is  director of Region 5 of the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO.  </P> <P> </P></p>

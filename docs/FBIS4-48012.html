			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] With it being over eight months since the Central  African Republic [CAR]'s general elections, you might have  assumed that any argument about outcome would be over by now,  but far from it. The Supreme Court has just decided that there  were irregularities and much to opposition dismay. President  Patasse's government stands to gain more seats in parliament.  From Bangui, Joseph Benamsse telexed this report.    According to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme  Court,  three opposition deputies are suspended from Parliament because  of irregularities that took place in the parliamentary elections  of August 1993. Following submission of this verdict to the  Ministry of the Interior, a new round of legislative elections  in three districts will be held within 45 days. The areas  affected are all districts where President Patasse's MLPC  [Central African People's Liberation Movement] Party did not win  sits. They include a suburb of Bangui and two districts, west  and northwest of the capital. Speculation is rife in Bangui that  the MLPC are trying to gain these three seats for themselves as  they do not currently hold the majority in Parliament. With 33  out of a total 85 parliamentary seats, they technically need 10  more to hold the majority, but in practice they have been able  to count on a number of allies to vote for them thus far.  Cracks, however, are now appearing in the informal coalitions  in Parliament and the MLPC looks set to lose a couple of their  former supporters. And so, if they won these three seats, they  would be able to maintain their position.</p>

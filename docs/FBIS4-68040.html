			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Violence is back on the agenda in Lome, Togo.  Five Frenchmen and a Beninese were injured in the Togolese  capital last night when a grenade thrown into a restaurant in  the Be district exploded. The six victims are not in danger of  death and the Togolese police have declined at this stage of  their inquiry to speculate on the reasons behind the attack.  The targeted restaurant belongs to a Frenchman and is known to  be mostly patronized by Europeans. [passage omitted]</p>

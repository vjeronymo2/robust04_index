			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: BSN profits rise to FFr1.95bn in first six months BSN, France's largest foods group, yesterday reported an underlying 12.9 per cent rise in first-half profits, although earnings fell steeply in spite of exceptional gains from last year's sale of its champagne brands. The group published net profits of FFr1.95bn (Dollars 408m) for the first six months of this year, up from FFr1.72bn in the same period of 1991, excluding the profits from the champagne sale. Including exceptional gains, BSN made a FFr3.4bn profit in the first half of 1991, on which yesterday's results showed a 43 per cent decline. Sales rose by 14 per cent to FFr36.3bn from FFr31.9bn over the same period, or 4.2 per cent after stripping out acquisitions and exchange rate fluctuations. These include the first-time contributions from Danone Espage, France Plats Cuisine, Pycasa, a Spanish pasta and groceries producer, and W and R Jacobs, an Irish biscuits supplier. Operating profits rose to FFr3.76bn from FFr3.49bn. Within this, the dairy products division was the star performer, with a rise in profits to FFr1.28bn in the first six months of this year from FFr1.01bn in the first half of 1991. The mineral waters division reported a rise in operating earnings to FFr577m from FFr457m, an 'excellent performance,' said BSN. Operating earnings in the packaging division rose slightly to FFr436m against FFr426m in the first half of last year, while profits on beer rose to FFr511m from FFr425m. Among BSN's other activities, the biscuit division saw operating earnings fall to FFr485m from FFr536m, due to a fall in demand. Pasta and groceries fell back to FFr511m, from FFr664m; this reflected a drop in exceptional gains and a one-off lift to sales during the Gulf war last year.</p>

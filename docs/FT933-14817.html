			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Italy seeks to calm row with US on Somalia ITALY yesterday sought to calm a growing row with the US over the handling of military operations in Somalia. Mr Fabio Fabbri, the defence minister, said it would be a mistake to allow mutual recriminations between the Italian contingent in Mogadishu and the US-controlled United Nations forces in Somalia (Unisom) to get out of hand. Italian forces in Mogadishu, who 10 days ago suffered three killed and 21 wounded, has blamed the US for failing to consult and co-ordinate. This led at the Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations to an agreement between US and Italian officials that the their local diplomats in Mogadishu should form a political co-ordinating committee. However, Italian politicians and the press have complained that Italian troops have been placed in a highly volatile area of the Somali capital and possess equipment geared to a a humanitarian peace keeping mission - not a peace enforcement mission which it has now become. Yesterday Mr Fabbri said Italy had requested 'a reassessment of the aims of the mission which covers the relationship between the end - pacification, conciliation and humanitarian aid - and the means.' The minister went on to warn that there was a real danger that the turn of events was leading the mission towards 'a long period of combat operations.' Mr Fabbri's observations coincided with the approval of the budget for Italy's 2,500 troops in Somalia. The first six months have cost L553bn (Pounds 237m) and a further L800bn for the final half of 1993.</p>

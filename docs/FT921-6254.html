			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Amcor soars 138% in face of recession AMCOR, the Australian paper and packaging group, yesterday reported a 138 per cent rise in net profits to ADollars 190.7m (Dollars 142.8m) for the first half to December from ADollars 80m a year earlier, Reuter reports from Melbourne. Amcor said the result was highly satisfactory given that Australia was in serious recession. Sales rose to ADollars 2.3bn in the half from ADollars 2.26bn. Earnings per share rose to 22.5 cents from 16.7 cents,and the dividend is being raised to 14 cents a sharefrom 13 cents. The profit rise was due to substantial capital spending in recent years, strict cost control, plant rationalisation and expansion into profitable overseas operations. An abnormal gain of ADollars 78.6m was mainly due to the sale of 22.5m Mayne Nickless shares for ADollars 8.05 a share, which realised a profit for the group of ADollars 77m. Amcor said cash-flow for the period was well ahead of last year and it had about ADollars 200m cash on deposit. Amcor said it was reaping the benefits of a conservative approach to offshore expansion and was confident of continued improvement in results from its overseas subsidiaries. Although demand was firm in some segments of Amcor's business, particularly aluminium beverage cans and business papers, sales volumes in most other product categories showed little change. Sales for container packaging in Australia, New Zealand and Canada rose 8.1 per cent to ADollars 679m in the half, while sales for fibre packaging rose 14.2 per cent to ADollars 600m. The company said it expected further good results in the second six months. 'Directors hope to continue the progress made to date and, given no further deterioration in Australian economic conditions, we expect to achieve further good results in the January-June period,' it said. 'Should economic activity expand, Amcor is poised for a period of strong growth worldwide.'</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> RANCHO ALAMITOS ROLLS PAST SAN DIMAS  </P> <P> The Rancho Alamitos girls' basketball team advanced further than any other in  the high school's history, reaching the 3-A final with a 76-50 semifinal  victory over San Dimas Saturday night at Bolsa Grande High School.  </P> <P> Although the Vaqueros took a 17-0 lead to start the game, San Dimas fought back  behind forward Natalie Kramer (17 points) to pull within 39-38 at the half.  </P> <P> But San Dimas went cold in the second half, managing only 12 points and  six-for-35 (17%) shooting. And a minute into the fourth quarter, Kramer fouled  out.  </P> <P> The Vaqueros were hot outside, making 12 three-point baskets, with Shellie  Tsuji (18 points) and Melinda Lira (15 points) hitting five each.  </P> <P> "My two guards had their best games of the season tonight, but it was also a  total team effort tonight," Rancho Alamitos Coach Bob Becker said.  </P> <P> Forward Jenny Newsome had 11 points and 11 rebounds in the third period to  spark Rancho Alamitos to a 58-46 lead at quarter's end. She finished with a  team-high 19 points and 14 rebounds. MICHAEL ITAGAKI  </P></p>

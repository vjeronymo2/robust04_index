			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Observer: Lovely Rio de Toryio With impeccable timing - just as the country's latest economic stabilisation plan seems ready to expire - a flood of British bigwigs are zapping into Brazil to size up investment prospects. Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, has come trailing banking and industry worthies. When Portillo goes, air chief marshal Sir Michael Graydon arrives for talks with his opposite number. Baroness Thatcher is also on her way, funded by private Brazilian businessmen. She will quickly be superseded by foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, arriving at the beginning of April. Trips are also scheduled for Richard Needham - trade minister - and agriculture secretary Gillian Shephard. What's brought all this on? Sure, British exports to Brazil increased 52 per cent last year; but that's still small beer, at Pounds 660m. And Brazil has all the hydro-electric dams it can manage, thank you.</p>

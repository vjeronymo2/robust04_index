			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The international  association against torture strongly demanded the repatriation  of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan to the Northern half of Korea, two  old men who had been forced to a prison life for over thirty  years in South Korea after they were taken prisoners in 1951 and  1953 during the Korean war, and are now kept in South Korea.    In a letter to the South Korean authority demanding their  repatriation, the association recalled that they had been  subjected to brutal and inhuman tortures and maltreatment in  prison and noted that their health has run down further  under the present living condition and discrimination.    The letter said that though Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan sent a  petition requesting their repatriation to the North for their  reunion with their families to the South Korean Red Cross and  the International Committee of the Red Cross, the South Korean  Red Cross has not accepted it.    The letter urged the South Korean authorities to immediately  take a measure for their reunion with their families in the  North.</p>

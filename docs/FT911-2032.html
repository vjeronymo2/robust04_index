			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Book Review: A modern American morality tale THE DAISY CHAIN: HOW BORROWED BILLIONS SANK A TEXAS S&amp;L By James O'Shea Pocket Books, Dollars 19.95, 351 pages THE GREATEST-EVER BANK ROBBERY: THE COLLAPSE OF THE SAVINGS AND LOAN INDUSTRY By Martin Mayer Scribners, Dollars 24.95, 354 pages Imagine more than a dozen financial scandals with the notoriety of the Guinness affair, and involving the write-off of a third of the assets of the building societies: you then have an inkling of the scale of the US savings and loan disaster. It is the largest financial collapse - and taxpayer rescue - in modern times. The story remains little known across the Atlantic. Perhaps it is because savings and loans, also known as thrifts, are an unfamiliar, peculiarly American institution. The very size of the losses may also be a turn-off. Some numbers are just too big to grasp. The US taxpayer will have to provide at least Dollars 150bn (Pounds 88bn) and probably more (at current prices and ignoring cumulative interest costs), even though the direct economic impact will be smaller since most of the money is a transfer from the taxpayer to protect existing depositors. The disaster is one of the most fascinating business stories of the past generation. It touches much of American society. There are plenty of villains: crooks using every known device in the history of fraud to plunder savings and loans; lax members of top accounting and law firms willing to bend rules in search of fat fees; greedy Wall Street securities houses putting money wherever the return is highest; weak politicians looking for campaign contributions; blinkered ideologues in the Reagan administration; and ineffective regulators. Thrifts, with their inherent mismatch between borrowing short and then lending long at fixed rates, were at first protected by caps on interest rates for deposits and mortgages. But they faced growing pressure in the 1970s as rates rose and money market funds were devised to compete with them. The much-criticised deregulation of a decade ago was a response to that initial squeeze. First, interest rates were uncapped, then thrifts were freed to raise and invest money where they wanted. The real problem was the Federal government guarantee of deposits up to Dollars 100,000. As thrifts shifted from mutual to joint-stock operation, for a new generation of owners this was an irresistible invitation to gamble with little risk as the taxpayer stood ready to pick up losses. The early Reaganites never accepted that, with such a one-sided guarantee, prudent supervision was necessary to accompany deregulation. These two books are among the liveliest of more than a dozen recounting the saga. At one level it is a morality tale of the pitfalls of deposit insurance. Despite a condescending, know-it-all style, Martin Mayer revealingly explains how a problem of unprofitability in the early 1980s turned into one of insolvency by the end of the decade. The saga is also an absorbing yarn in the manner of the tabloids. James O'Shea exploits this to the full by concentrating on the rise and fall of Vernon Savings of Dallas, Texas, which, under the guidance of Don Dixon, boosted its deposits almost 20-fold in five years and collapsed with 96 per cent of its loans being delinquent. Vernon fully lived up to the Texan self-image of the American Dream taken to often grotesque excess. Dixon believed in living well - witness his 'gastronomique fantastique' tour of France to do research for a 'world-class' restaurant in Dallas (part of what was dubbed the rent-a-Frenchman programme). There were jets, luxury houses, collections of luxury cars and guns, and the hiring of prostitutes. Vernon was not alone. Stanley Adams, regarded as eccentric even by Texas standards, once applied to the state regulator to open a branch on the moon, saying 'what the hell, they laughed at Da Vinci too'. Vernon was rated one of the most profitable US thrifts. Something was obviously wrong. Vernon was exploiting to the full, and beyond, lax accounting rules about what it could declare as profits. Developers were given loans well over the appraised value of a project to permit payment of fees and interest. Losses were never written off and fictitious profits were booked as a result of friendly 'dead horse for a dead cow' deals as dubious projects were exchanged with fellow thrift owners in similar trouble. When the oil price fell in the mid-1980s and the Texas property market went sour, Vernon and other thrifts became engaged in desperate manoeuvring with increasingly worried regulators in the hope of deferring the end. Friendly politicians, to whom contributions had been made, were called in to help persuade regulators to be sympathetic. In the similar case of Lincoln Savings, Charles Keating donated more than Dollars 2m to five US senators in the specific expectation that they would help him. The resulting delays and some inept decisions by regulators raised the losses, which for Vernon are likely to cost US taxpayers Dollars 1.3bn. Last month Dixon received the lenient sentence of five years in prison for 23 counts of fraud and racketeering. Amid all the retrospective hand-wringing, Congress is determined to avoid making the same mistakes in the case of the banks. But there are big differences in reform proposals. The US Treasury's plan for the banks tightens, rather than relaxes, supervision and specifies that insured deposits cannot be used in risky ventures. Yet many in Congress are reluctant to contemplate sensible changes in banking structure, allowing a wider range of activities which would attract more capital and avoid a repetition of the savings and loan collapse. There is a risk that in fighting the last war Congress may lose the current one.</p>

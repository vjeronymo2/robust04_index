			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: SB challenge to Wellcome as Famvir gets US approval SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, yesterday announced the US Food and Drug Administration had approved its anti-viral drug Famvir for the treatment of shingles. The approval ends effective monopoly of Wellcome, the UK drugs group, over the US shingles market. Zovirax, its anti-shingles compound, was its largest selling product last year, generating sales of Pounds 760m, equivalent to 37 per cent of group sales of Pounds 2.04bn. The drug, whose US sales last year were Pounds 286m, was also the world's fourth biggest selling medicine. Wellcome's shares fell 27p to 590p, while SmithKline Beecham's dropped 3p to 406p. Wellcome reacted to Famvir's approval by announcing it had signed an agreement to co-promote Zovirax in the US with Upjohn, the Kalamazoo-based drugs group. The company said Upjohn's salesforce of 1,400 would work with Wellcome's 800 representatives. The Anglo-American group said it planned to launch Famvir in the coming weeks. The company refused to reveal at what price it would launch Famvir in the US. In the UK earlier this year, SmithKline Beecham set Famvir's price at Pounds 107.35 for a week's course for shingles, a 5 per cent discount to Zovirax. Wellcome matched SmithKline Beecham's price within hours. Wellcome insisted the launch of an additional shingles treatment in the UK had increased the overall size of the market by 25 per cent, and that Zovirax sales had not fallen as a result. In the same market, the company has recently launched an over-the-counter, non-prescription version of the drug for cold sores, in anticipation of the expiry of Zovirax's patents next year. Its application to market the drug over-the-counter for genital herpes in the US is still pending.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Auctions are in recess in Australia until the end of this month and raw wool costs in the meantime are measured by what merchants assess in relation to business and the market prospect. No weakness is apparent at present. On the contrary, with stockpile sales again at encouraging levels last week, and the Garnaut disposal quotas effectively taken up for July and August already, the outlook appears at least firm. There was also good demand in Europe not only for stockpile wool, but for stockpiled tops which were combed some time ago on behalf of the Australian Wool Corporation then in charge. This adds to the impression that combs at present are busy on present orders and there is little or no slack to be taken up to meet short-term buying interest. Prices are without wool auction guidance but must be described as firm.</p>

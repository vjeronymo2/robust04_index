			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / International Company News: Charge for job cuts brings loss at Aetna A SHARPER-than-expected deterioration in property-related investments contributed to a second-quarter loss of Dollars 20.1m after tax at Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, one of the largest US composite insurers. The result compares with a Dollars 159.5m profit in the same period of 1991, and leaves Aetna with a net profit of Dollars 187.1m for the first six months of 1992, against Dollars 296.9m in the previous year. Its shares closed Dollars 1 3/8 lower at Dollars 43 1/4 yesterday. The loss is struck after a Dollars 145m charge to cover job cuts and restructuring moves, which Aetna announced last month. The insurer is aiming to cut staff by 4,800  - about 10 per cent of its workforce. It claims this should lead to annual after-tax savings of around Dollars 132m by 1994. Net realised capital losses in the second quarter totalled Dollars 41m, against a loss of Dollars 12m a year earlier. However, within this overall figure, additions to reserves for troubled mortgage loans and property write-downs were Dollars 105m (Dollars 78m), Partly offsetting this damage were gains of Dollars 76m (Dollars 71m), largely from sales of bonds and shares. 'We saw more deterioration than we expected in our mortgage loan portfolio during our normal review process,' admitted Mr Ronald Compton, chairman. 'Most of the deterioration was in the commercial office sector in New England, California and New York City. 'We adjusted our reserves accordingly and we cannot currently estimate the full-year impact real estate will have on our earnings.' The second-quarter figures were also struck after a Dollars 30m charge related to an Olympia &amp; York financial guarantee  - of which Aetna had also previously warned. In terms of operating divisions, the biggest loss (after reorganisation charges and investment losses) was seen in the commercial property-casualty business  - a Dollars 37.4m deficit compared with a Dollars 43.1m profit a year earlier. The personal property-casualty division turned in Dollars 21.2m deficit (against a loss of Dollars 2.1m), while financial services made a loss of Dollars 25.2m (Dollars 35.2m loss). The life and health business made a profit of Dollars 31m (Dollars 87.5m), and discontinued operations  - the American Re-Insurance subsidiary which Aetna is selling to a Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts-backed buyout  - made Dollars 30.9m (Dollars 33.8m).</p>

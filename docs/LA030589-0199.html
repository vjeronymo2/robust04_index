			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 18-INCH SNOW SNARLS TRAVEL IN MIDWEST  </P> <P> New snowfall up to 18 inches deep left travelers stranded Saturday in much of  the upper Midwest, and nurses had to summon four-wheel-drive taxis to get to  work.  </P> <P> Snowplows were taken off some roads where blowing snow reduced visibility to  zero. On other highways, the snow drifted back as soon as the plows passed.  </P> <P> Along the edge of the snowstorm, thick fog made travel risky in southeastern  Wisconsin and delayed some morning flights in and out of Chicago.  </P> <P> Southwestern Minnesota was hit hardest by the snow, with 18 inches at  Worthington.  </P> <P> Northern and central Wisconsin also got heavy snow.  </P> <P> In eastern Louisiana, a tornado damaged several buildings and uprooted trees  that blocked roads in Tensas Parish, but no injuries were reported, authorities  said.  </P></p>

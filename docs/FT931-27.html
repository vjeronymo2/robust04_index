			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (20): Norman French titles and roles - Richard Evans takes a look at a system that has survived the centuries remarkably intact / Profile: The bailiff IN the UK, the title bailiff has been debased to mean the repossessor of a debtor's goods, but in Guernsey it has retained its original meaning of the sovereign's representative in a district. The bailiff is the equivalent of the lord chancellor, presiding over the royal court and the legislature and heading the island's administration. Given that Guernsey, like Jersey and the Isle of Man, is a virtually independent democracy in domestic affairs, it is a post of the greatest local importance. Lists on the walls of the spacious, panelled offices of the current bailiff, Mr Graham Dorey, show an unbroken line of bailiffs going back to William de Saint Remy in 1278 - and the office existed before then. The island, with neighbouring Jersey, was integrated into the Duchy of Normandy in the 10th and 11th centuries and became a dependent territory of the English crown when the duke, William, became king of England in 1066. When continental Normandy was overrun by the king of France in 1204, the islands remained under the English king, who continued to govern them in his capacity as duke of Normandy. The rule continued after the title was dropped. Their separate laws, customs and liberties were later confirmed by the charters of successive sovereigns, which secured the islands their own judiciaries, freedom from the processes of the English courts, and certain other privileges. The office of bailiff is at the apex of a system that has survived the centuries remarkably intact and has retained many of the original Norman French titles and roles. Ironically, these were largely abolished in Normandy itself at the time of the French revolution. In some respects, such as inheritance, bankruptcy and family legislation, local law still differs considerably from that in the UK. Most criminal and commercial law has come increasingly into line, though. Mr Dorey, like all recent incumbents, is a Guernseyman and a lawyer. He has been in office for just over a year, having climbed the ranks of the law officers appointed by the British crown of comptroller (or solicitor-general), procureur (attorney-general) and deputy bailiff, an office created in 1969 because of the increasing work load. Before that, Mr Dorey was in private practice as a Guernsey advocate, having gone through the obligatory process of a six-month course at Caen university to study Norman law as well as qualifying at the English Bar. He does not believe there is any conflict of interest between the judicial and administrative functions of the office. 'There could be in theory, but if we see one in prospect we head it off. I would avoid it by not sitting in court, for example. My place could be taken by my deputy or by a judge from the English court of appeal.' One of the bailiff's tasks is to head deputations from the States - the local parliament - to the Home Office, which is responsible for relations between the UK and the Channel Islands, on any conflict or concern. The only significant delegation recently was over French fishing rights at the Schole Bank off the island. This had been a matter of dispute for 20 years but after visits to London and Paris the matter was resolved. A much less easily resolved matter has been the sensitive issue of Guernsey and the German occupation from 1940 to 1945. Mr Dorey has played a prominent part in refuting allegations of wholesale collaboration and black marketeering by islanders that appeared when records were opened for inspection early this year. 'A lot of extremely offensive and false material was circulated and there has been a great deal of misunderstanding. . . our files show that at the express instruction of the British government the island authorities remained in being and acted as a buffer against the Germans on behalf of the small remaining population. 'Refusal (to obey German orders) was not possible as to do so would only have brought reprisals on a defenceless population,' Mr Dorey said. The Dorey family has lived on Guernsey for about 400 years, but although forebears have been deputies and jurats - the 12 elected people who in effect constitute a permanent jury - none has been bailiff before. Mr Dorey acknowledges there is a belief that Guernsey is dominated by seven extended families, but he is adamant that this does not affect the choice of bailiff. 'It is a delicate subject, but it is quite false to say the role only goes to old families. The position is open to all.' He estimates that out of the past nine bailiffs, only two came from families which had previously filled the post, although the position was very different in the last century and before.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Mexico approves two new banks The Mexican finance ministry has has given the go-ahead to two new banks, bringing to 11 the total number of authorisations granted this year. The government hopes the moves will put more competitive pressure on those former state-owned banks that were privatised last year and the year before. Next year, US and Canadian banks will be permitted to set up their own subsidiaries in Mexico, under the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). This will open up the market still further. The finance ministry has complained about the high spreads between interest rates on savings and loans earned by Mexican banks, and has partly blamed the credit crunch and economic slowdown this year on uncompetitive practices in the financial sector. The finance ministry also approved four mortgage associations, and three savings and loans groups, in an effort to stimulate housing market. Mortgages are difficult to obtain in Mexico, and rates are well above those earned on deposits. The two new banks are: Banco Regional de Monterrey, of Jaime and Manuel Rivero Santos, and Banco Invex, of the brokerage of the same name.</p>

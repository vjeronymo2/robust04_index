			<p>BFN     [Text] Republican economic entities have run into debt  amounting to millions of soms in customs dues for barter deals  to the state. Staff at the Kyrgyz Customs Directorate are  facing now the task of recovering this money from commercial  structures and enterprises. This has been said by Anatoliy  Linishenko, head of the Republican Customs Directorate, during a  briefing at government house. Over the last year 32 million  soms in customs duty were paid to the state budget, which  comprises around 20-30 percent of the possible volume of customs  dues. The reasons for this are inefficiency of the Customs  Directorate, the open border with Tajikistan, gross violations  of customs rules by a great number of commercial organizations,  and other reasons.</p>

The Supplemental EIS will supplement the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that DOE issued in 1982 (DOE/EIS&hyph;0082), and will evaluate whether and how to proceed with the Defense Waste Processing Facility in light of the changes in processes and facilities that have occurred since the 1982 EIS was issued. That EIS, its Record of Decision, and a subsequent Environmental Assessment,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Waste Form Selection for Savannah River Plant High-Level Waste  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (DOE/EA&hyph;0179), supported the preferred alternative for the construction and operation of the Defense Waste Processing Facility. The specific process and facility modifications that have been introduced or are being implemented in the Defense Waste Processing Facility system since the Record of Decision are discussed in the Supplementary Information section of this Notice of Intent. Background information on the Savannah River Site and issues proposed to be considered in this Supplemental EIS are presented in the Supplementary Information below as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOE also is announcing today its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Waste Management at the Savannah River Site.

Written and oral comments will be given equal weight. Written comments should be directed to Stephen R. Wright at the address below. Oral comments may be presented by voice mail at the telephone number below. Interested parties are invited to present comments at three public scoping meetings to be held at the dates and places indicated below. Additional notice will be given in appropriate media. At the scoping meetings and at informal information sessions held one month earlier, DOE also will provide the public with an opportunity to engage in informal discussions with DOE representatives regarding the Defense Waste Processing Facility. The scoping process and procedures are described in the Supplementary Information below. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The public scoping period for the Supplemental EIS begins with the publication of this notice and continues until May 31, 1994.

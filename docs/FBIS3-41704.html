This ailment has already taken the lives of  104 persons (131 last year). The most unfavorable situation has  evolved in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Krasnodar, Moscow and  Leningrad oblasts, Maritime Kray and Saratov Oblast. This was  communicated to this ITAR-TASS correspondent by Anatoliy  Monisov, deputy chairman of the State Committee for  Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight.    Specialists believe the main cause of such swift growth of  diphtheria morbidity to be insufficient vaccination of the  population. Many parents protest against immunizing their  children, while the adults themselves rarely get reimmunized.  Nonetheless, vaccine remains the most dependable defense against  diphtheria.    Anatoliy Monisov is also troubled by the fact that Russia's  supply of the needed preparations is short. You see, the  enterprises weren't ready to produce such a large quantity of  vaccine, and the production process takes 4-8 months. Such that  we can't expect the situation to normalize until next year, the  specialist feels. Anatoliy Monisov noted that the government has  developed a special ``antidiphtheria'' program, which has now  been forwarded to the Supreme Soviet. In order to hasten the  process of implementing this document the State Committee for  Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight asked the government to begin  its financing sooner. The cost of the program is 6 billion  rubles over 3 years (disregarding inflation), and a significant  share of this money will go to reinforcing the production  capacities of enterprises making the vaccine.    In addition the State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological  Oversight has sent a plan of diphtheria control measures to  local agencies, which should help medical workers in remote  regions in their fight against the disease.</p>

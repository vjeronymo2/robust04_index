			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Tate &amp; Lyle raises stake in Alcantara Tate &amp; Lyle, the worlds's largest sweeteners group, is paying Pounds 24m for a further 23 per cent stake in a leading Portuguese sugar refiner. The deal will bring Tate &amp; Lyle's holding in Alcantara Sociedade de Empreendimentos Acucareiros to 97 per cent. Mr Neil Shaw, chairman, said he intended eventually to buy the outstanding 3 per cent. Alcantara claims more than 40 per cent of the Portuguese market for refined cane sugar. Tate took its first stake in Alcantara in 1984. The Portuguese refiner reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 10m for the year ended September 1991, on sales of Pounds 85m. On the question of European Community quotas for the import of raw cane, Mr Nicholas Nightingale, company secretary, said Tate &amp; Lyle expected a decision 'in due course'. The temporary arrangement agreed when Portugal joined the EC is due to end this year. 'We are sure we will end up with a satisfactory basis,' he said. Alcantara employs 570 people and has two refineries. Mr Nightingale said there would be no management changes.</p>

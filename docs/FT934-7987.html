			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers ground as region takes profits THE Nikkei average recovered some ground after Monday's 2.3 per cent fall on buying by pension funds and institutions, agencies report from Tokyo. The 225-issue index finished 171.51 firmer at 18,246.12, after a day's low of 17,877.69 and high of 18,467.25. Volume was estimated at 260m shares. Rises outscored falls by 535 to 452, with 174 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks improved 9.69 to 1,549.34, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 0.73 at 1,250.65. Arbitrage-linked selling depressed the market in early trading but short-covering in futures caused a technical rebound later. Comments from government officials that the country may consider taking additional measures to boost the economy helped sentiment. In spite of the day's gains, many investors remain cautious ahead of the visit of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to the US at the end of the week. Banks and other financial stocks gained strength on bargain hunting: Nomura Securities added Y10 at Y1,920, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y30 at Y2,280 and Sumitomo Bank Y50 at Y2,360. Daikyo, the building group, lost Y124 to Y946 after revising down its forecast for earnings in the year to March 1994. Roundup THE region's markets were generally easier yesterday. HONG KONG ended moderately lower as bargain hunting helped to trim early losses. The Hang Seng index shed 49.69 to 9,683.65, having been 128 points off at one stage. Hong Kong Telecom lost 40 cents at HKDollars 16.10 as Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating. HSBC fell HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 88.50 but Hutchison Whampoa rose 50 cents to HKDollars 31.75. Lai Sun Garment, benefiting from institutional switching, jumped HKDollars 2.40 to HKDollars 22.90. SEOUL gave way to profit-taking in reaction to Monday's fourth consecutive year's high and the composite stock index receded 8.07 to 802.65. Among recent strong gainers, Samsung Electronics retreated Won500 to Won47,500 and Hyundai Motor Won400 to Won32,300. SINGAPORE was lower as brokerages imposed restrictions on intraday buying and selling by retail investors in line with the securities authorities' guidelines to check excessive speculation. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 17.54 off at 2,078.01, after an intraday low of 2,071.87. Shipyards bucked the trend, Keppel rising 55 cents to SDollars 10.40 and Jorong Shipyard 60 cents to SDollars 13.50. KUALA LUMPUR finished generally easier as volume shrank on lack of demand, and buying restrictions imposed by broking firms. The composite index fell 10.07, or 1.1 per cent, to 951.30. Some institutional interest, however, helped to push Malayan Banking 70 cents higher to MDollars 19.10. AUSTRALIA ended slightly firmer, with the All Ordinaries index 0.9 up at 2,083.8 in turnover of ADollars 309.2m. Activity was seen in the banks, where ANZ results disappointed many investors and the shares lost a cent to ADollars 4.44.

BANGKOK eased a shade, although some investors entered the market on late bargain hunting. The SET index slipped 0.54 to 1,366.77 in turnover of Bt15.5bn. SHANGHAI and SHENZHEN saw brisk volume on buying by overseas institutional funds, and their B share indices rose 5.1, or 7.3 per cent, to 75.28 and 1.36, or 1.8 per cent, to 78.15 respectively. Over the past two weeks, Shanghai Bs have climbed 26 per cent and Shenzhen's 15 per cent. TAIWAN fell back on profit-taking, the weighted index relinquishing 27.80 to 4,301.25.

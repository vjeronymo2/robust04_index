			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Stockpile sales quotas for July and August under Garnaut disposal scheme have now been met, and September and October are coming under pressure. This is seen as a bullish sign ahead of resumption of Australian wool sales ten days from now. Semi-official and trade forecasts agree on the probability that next season will be a good one, with price averages usefully above this season and no chance of a return to the low points of 1993. Holidays in wool using countries mean that trading conditions at present are dull and there is also caution among manufacturers and retailers in assuming that prices will rise to new peaks from the start. Dollar weakness tends to cause some softness in the pricing of semi-manufactures and merchanted wool just at present</p>

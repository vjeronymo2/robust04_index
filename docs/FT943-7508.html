			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Looking after number three - How protection could be extended to outsiders in European mergers A company does not have to be a party to a merger to be affected by a European Commission merger decision. The Commission may find that a merger would be acceptable from a competition point of view if none of the parties had links with other competitors in the market. The sacrifice of a business arrangement with a 'third party' company may seem a small price to pay for approval of the merger. If accepted, the Commission makes this a condition of the merger's clearance. A condition of this sort is not a finding for or against the third party. It passes no judgment on the business arrangements in question or on the third party's conduct or competitive position. It simply says that the companies seeking approval for their merger plan cannot have it unless one of them terminates its relationship with the third party. This might seriously damage the third party's interests through no fault of its own. It would be wrong in principle for the law simply to ignore it. How the third party can be protected is not without difficulty. A merger clearance is a legally binding decision taken with a view to securing a competitive market in the public interest. It is nevertheless given for the benefit of the merging companies, not as general legislation affecting everyone equally. Private interests should be treated even-handedly. Favouring one set of interests over another lacks the necessary balance. It could be argued that a merger decision that lacks this balance should be struck down by the European Court. A third party may undoubtedly seek annulment of a Commission decision if denied procedural rights, such as the right to make its views known during the merger inquiry. Yet private parties have no right to make the Commission take any notice of their views. Their legal rights can only be fully protected if the Commission has to consider them when deciding whether to approve a merger. The Court of First Instance has a case pending in which a ruling to this effect may be made. Indeed, the issue has already been identified as a serious one. On June 15, Mr Cruz Vilaca, the court's president, suspended the relevant part of a merger decision until the court deals with the third party's claims in depth*. The case was brought by SCPA, the French potash company. In December 1993, the Commission cleared the acquisition of control of MdK, the former East German potash producer, by Kali+Salz (K+S), a subsidiary of chemicals group BASF. As one of the conditions of clearance, the Commission told K+S that it must sell its own and MdK's shares in Kali-Export, a Vienna-based export agency handling sales by four European potash producers on the world market. SCPA was a partner in Kali-Export. Mr Cruz Vilaca found that K+S's departure from Kali-Export would inevitably lead to its closure. As a result, SCPA would have to set up its own international marketing arm, at considerable cost. He ordered that the condition in the Commission's merger decision should not be enforced until the court had considered whether - and, if so, how - SCPA's rights in Kali-Export should be protected. European law might be expected to follow the fairly universal rule that the law should not allow a person to be deprived of legal rights without providing a remedy. The court could strike out the condition under articles 173 and 174 of the EC treaty, on the ground that it infringed the treaty or 'any rule of law relating to its application'. This would leave the troublesome question of whether the merger could be allowed to go ahead, since removal of the condition might undermine the reasoning that enabled the Commission to clear the merger. More generally, a high level of protection for the third party would limit the Commission's room for manoeuvre under the Merger Regulation. If the third party could stop it imposing a particular condition, the merger might have to be prohibited. The court might decide that the harm to the third party should be remedied after the event by private law means, such as damages. Compensation may be available anyway. For example, the company that is told to cancel its agreement with a third party may be liable for breach of contract. But private litigation is expensive and risky. The company that causes the loss to the third party might escape liability for some reason. There might be no relevant right of action, or compensation might not be an adequate remedy. The conditions imposed by the Commission tend to affect long-term proprietorial interests rather than day-to-day business dealings. This reflects the Merger Regulation's concern with the structure of industry rather than its business conduct. It also makes it more probable that a third party's losses cannot be fully compensated by money alone. Examples of conditions imposed by the Commission include sale of a shareholding by one of the merging companies, disposal of its entire business in a particular market, termination of overlapping memberships of company boards and non-renewal of a patent licensing agreement. Potential harm to third parties may be mitigated in the decision. For example, it may allow time for the sale of a large shareholding to safeguard the share price. Private remedies might yield a satisfactory solution in the individual case. This would not be without its burdens for the Commission, however. It would be reasonable to expect it to make sure that the third party had an effective right of action and remedy. The Commission might itself deal with the issue of liability to third parties and make payment of compensation a condition of clearance. Within the tight Merger Regulation timetable, this might prove impractical. The question might be referred to arbitration. Overall it seems unlikely that the court will ride roughshod over the rights of third parties. It has repeatedly recognised their right to challenge competition rulings and approvals of state aid. It seems that the court has not yet overturned a Commission decision specifically because of the harm done to a third party's subsisting legal rights. It now has the opportunity to do so, or at least to say when it should be done. *Case T-88/94, Societe commerciale des potasses et de l'azote v European Commission; Commission Decision M308, Kali+Salz/MdK/Treuhand, December 14 1994.

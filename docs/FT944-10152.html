			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Academic approach to UBS Investors have tracked the proxy battle over the future of Union Bank of Switzerland mainly through the premium on the registered shares relative to the bearers. UBS directors are seeking shareholder approval to convert the registered into bearers at an EGM on November 22. Therefore, the premium should disappear if the directors carry the day. Since September 29, when the plan was announced, the premium has dropped from 34 per cent to around 13 per cent. But this week, it has moved back up above 16 per cent. On Tuesday, two Zurich academics, Mr Matthias Denzler and Mr Martin Janssen, suggested looking at a more sophisticated measure. In an article in the Neue Zurcher Zeitung, they pointed out that an investor can buy an EGM vote, so to speak, by purchasing a share and at the same time entering a December contract for its resale. They traced the net cost of such a vote for a registered share over the past month, finding that it has declined from a peak of SFr9 to around SFr3 per share. Their conclusion: investors now recognise that UBS has enough proxies to win. They suggested, too, that the 6 per cent slide in the UBS market capitalisation since September 29 reflected the fear that legal rows after the EGM would hurt the bank's profits performance.</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Observer: On the record As the Whitehall equivalent of the Squidgy tapes, bootleg recordings of a boisterous Waltzing Matilda, doctored to include statistical references, are becoming a collector's item in officialdom. When the song was rendered at a staff party organised by Bill McLennan, the Australian head of the Central Statistical Office who took over a year ago, he was so impressed that he insisted the choir put the number on record. As the official song includes references to Her Majesty's Treasury, Budget purdah forbids full disclosure. But the chorus will give a flavour: Testing the market, testing the market, Who'll come a -testing the market with me? And he sang as we sighed and we waited to be Ozzified, Who'll come a-testing the market with me?</p>

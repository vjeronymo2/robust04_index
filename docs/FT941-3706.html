			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Basic gallantry Standards in British public life have declined in the last century or two. Or have they? The armed forces at least seem to have improved, either in military prowess or in private morality, or both. Or maybe it is just that Britain is now safer than it was during the Napoleonic wars, and so can be choosier about its military leaders. In those days the nation was reduced to entrusting its fortunes to notorious adulterers. The Duke of Wellington, it will be remembered, was unworried by Miss Harriette Wilson's threat to publish her autobiography, and with good reason. He knew that Lord Nelson had been allowed to retain his command, in spite of his public and prolonged dalliance with the wife of a senior diplomat. Both noblemen got away with what the admirable Lady Buck - whose public spirit last week triumphed over mere sentimental loyalty - would no doubt have called 'the most immense security risk'. Thank goodness times have changed. There are now whole platoons of generals, admirals and air marshals qualified by moral character, as well as military genius, to fill the post of chief of defence staff. So no sooner had Lady Buck revealed Sir Peter Harding's (and her own) shortcomings on the former point than he resigned from that post. His 'professionalism, energy and skill', though acknowledged by the defence secretary, were found expendable. How Sir Peter must have wished that the Duke of Wellington's riposte to Miss Wilson - 'publish and be damned' - were available to him. But then the Duke of Wellington had not recently launched a code of conduct requiring 'better standards of personal behaviour' from officers and men. Perhaps marriage today is taken more seriously than in Wellington's time, although (or even because) it is more easily dissolved. And no doubt integrity is a virtue to be prized in the armed forces even more than elsewhere. But are we really so virtuous that adultery has become a disqualification for military command?</p>

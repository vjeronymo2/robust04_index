			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Maho in collaboration talks with rival Deckel THE DISCLOSURE yesterday that Maho, the stricken German machine tool group, is in collaboration talks with rival Deckel has highlighted the urgency of the industry's search for cost-savings. Mr Bodo Viets, Maho chairman since the end of June, said he could give no further details for fear of derailing the negotiations. He was speaking after winning shareholder approval for a capital restructuring which forms the launch-pad for his recovery plans. He told the annual meeting in Munich that group losses in the current financial year would fall to less than DM100m (Dollars 66.6m), against the DM157m reported in the 12 months to end-June, 1992. The deficit at Maho AG, the German parent, reached DM22m at the half-way mark, he said. Sales, which slumped 31 per cent last year to DM442m, will fall a further 10 per cent in the current year, he added. The company, which aims to return to profit in 1993/94, is expected to fall under the effective control of a group of eight banks, including Deutsche Bank, Bayerische Vereinsbank and Commmerzbank, after the annual meeting approved a complex package which should reduce the holding of the Babel family from around 54 per cent to 25 per cent. Last week Maho and Traub, a machine tools group which lost DM30m in 1991 and had a first-half DM16m deficit this year, announced the merger of their distribution networks. The companies estimated the deal would save each group DM8.5m in 1993 and twice that in the following year. Talks are to continue on co-operation in purchasing, manufacture and research and development, but full merger or share swaps are not on the agenda. The alliance followed the establishment of a similar collaboration, effective from January, between Gildemeister, which lost DM29m in 1991 and Deckel which expects a DM70m deficit in the current year. The machine tool industry has been especially hard hit by the investment cuts which have characterised international industry's reaction to recession. With the domestic downturn accelerating - new orders at Deckel were down 6 per cent at the end of September - the need to rationalise is growing more urgent. After two years of retrenchment, the scope for job cuts is limited and savings have to be found elsewhere. Maho, which in the past year reduced its workforce by a third to 2,320, has introduced widespread short-time and plans a further reduction of 400 places during the current year. So far, alliances have been forged between companies which do not compete directly with one another. While Maho is a milling specialist, Traub's main strength is in computer-steered turning centres. Gildemeister makes turning machines, while Deckel concentrates on milling. Mr Viets, who said talks were under way with other companies, noted a merger with Deckel would have grave consequences because plants would have to be shut.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> The records continue to be broken as "Batman" wings its way overseas. The  blockbuster hit has now become the first movie in British history to gross more  than 2 million (about $3.4 million) on its opening weekend. That's nearly 20%  more than the gross of any previous picture, Warner Bros. said. "Batman,"  produced by Jon Peters and Peter Guber, directed by Tim Burton and starring  Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, crushed all previous box-office records with  a gross of 2.9 million pounds at 400 theaters. The film also broke all standing  single-day records. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA summarizes the requirements of the federal I/M regulations as found in 40 CFR part 51.350&hyph;51.373 and its analysis of the Commonwealth's submittal below. A more detailed analysis of the Commonwealth's submittal is contained in a Technical Support Document (TSD) dated May 18, 1994, which is available from the Region III office, listed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section. Parties desiring additional details on the federal I/M regulation are referred to the November 5, 1992  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice (57 FR 52950) or 40 CFR part 51.350&hyph;51.373.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. EPA's Analysis of Pennsylvania Enhanced I/M Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, sections 182(c)(3), 184(b)(1)(A), 187(a)(6) and 187(b)(1) of the Act require that states adopt and implement regulations for an enhanced I/M program in certain areas. The following sections of this notice address some specific elements of the Commonwealth's submittal. Parties desiring more specific information should consult the TSD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Applicability_40 CFR Part 51.350  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 182(c)(3) and 184(b)(1)(A) of the Act and 40 CFR part 51.350(a) require all states in the OTR which contain MSAs or parts thereof with a population of 100,000 or more to implement an enhanced I/M program. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is part of the OTR and contains the following MSAs or parts thereof with a population of 100,000 or more: Allentown-Bethlehem, Altoona, Beaver, Erie, Harrisburg-Lebanon-Carlisle, Johnstown, Lancaster, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley, Reading, Scranton-Wilkes-Barre, Sharon, State College, Williamsport, and York. The Philadelphia area is classified as a severe ozone nonattainment area and also required to implement an enhanced I/M program as per section 182(c)(3) of the Act and 40 CFR part 51.350(2). In addition, the Philadelphia area of Pennsylvania is designated as moderate nonattainment for CO with a design value of less than 12.7 ppm. As per 40 CFR part 51.350(3), any area classified as moderate CO nonattainment with a design value of 12.7 ppm or less shall continue operating I/M programs that were part of an approved SIP as of November 15, 1990 and shall update those programs as necessary to meet the basic I/M program requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the requirements of the Clean Air Act, the following 33 counties in Pennsylvania (which are located in the above listed MSAs) would be subject to the enhanced I/M program requirements: Adams, Allegheny, Beaver, Berks, Blair, Bucks, Cambria, Carbon, Centre, Chester, Columbia, Cumberland, Dauphin, Delaware, Erie, Fayette, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Luzerne, Lycoming, Mercer, Monroe, Montgomery, Northampton, Perry, Philadelphia, Somerset, Washington, Westmoreland, Wyoming and York. However, under the federal I/M regulations, specifically 40 CFR part 51.350(b), some rural counties having a population density of less than 200 persons per square mile based on the 1990 census can be excluded from program coverage provided that at least 50% of the MSA population is included in the program. The following eight counties in the Commonwealth qualify for the exemption discussed in 40 CFR part 51.350(b) and are exempt from participation in the program: Adams, Carbon, Columbia, Fayette, Monroe, Perry, Somerset and Wyoming. Consequently, the Pennsylvania I/M regulation requires that the enhanced I/M program be implemented in 25 counties in the Commonwealth. The 25 counties are as follows: Allegheny, Beaver, Berks, Blair, Bucks, Cambria, Centre, Chester, Cumberland, Dauphin, Delaware, Erie, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Luzerne, Lycoming, Mercer, Montgomery, Northampton, Philadelphia, Washington, Westmoreland and York.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pennsylvania I/M legislative authority (referred to as Act 166 throughout the remainder of this notice) provides the legal authority to establish the geographic boundaries. The program boundaries listed in an appendix to the SIP include the 25 counties listed above and meet the federal I/M requirements under section 51.350. However, part of this provision states ``this program shall be established in all areas of this Commonwealth where the secretary certifies by publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pennsylvania Bulletin  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that a system is required in order to comply with Federal law. Any area, counties, county or portion thereof certified to be in the program by the secretary must be mandated to be in the program by Federal law.'' Act 166 requires ``at least 60 days prior to the implementation of any enhanced emission inspection program developed under this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation shall certify by notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pennsylvania Bulletin  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that an enhanced emission inspection program will commence''. The Pennsylvania I/M regulation states that the program begins 60 days after publication of the notice. It is stated in the Pennsylvania I/M SIP that ``it is not possible at this time to furnish a copy of that notice since it will be published in calendar year 1994.'' The SIP goes on to state that ``when that notice has appeared in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bulletin,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the Department shall furnish a copy to the EPA as an amendment to this SIP''. EPA interprets this language as a commitment on the part of the Commonwealth to publish the bulletin notice and submit it as an amendment to the SIP by December 31, 1994. EPA is proposing to find that the geographic applicability requirements are satisfied based on the condition that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will submit to EPA by December 31, 1994 the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pennsylvania Bulletin  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice certifying the geographic coverage. EPA, therefore, proposes to conditionally approve the Pennsylvania SIP based on the Commonwealth's commitment to publish the notice certifying the need for the I/M program and the geographic scope of the program by December 31, 1994. The geographic coverage certified in the notice must include the 25 counties listed above or EPA will consider the commitment not met and will promptly issue a letter to the Commonwealth indicating that the conditional approval has been converted to a disapproval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The federal I/M regulation requires that the state program shall not sunset until it is no longer necesary. EPA interprets the federal regulation as stating that a SIP which does not sunset prior to the attainment deadline for each applicable area satisfies this requirement. The Pennsylvania I/M regulation provides for the program to continue past the attainment dates for all applicable nonattainment areas in the Commonwealth and is therefore approvable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

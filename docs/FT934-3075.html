			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Core IT elements kept in-house Companies are increasingly happy to outsource their information technology requirements. However, contrary to popular perception, they did not outsource core facilities but peripheral ones, according to the latest report, 'UK IT Outsourcing Survey: 1993', from the PA Consulting Group. The report surveyed 230 UK organisations, 74 per cent of which had outsourced some of their IT provision. On average only 10 per cent of their IT budget was spent on outsourced services. Although 55 per cent of the companies cited cost savings as a main reason for outsourcing, 30 per cent said there had been none. In some cases costs had even risen. PA: UK, 071 730 9000.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / De Savary says reports of his collapse exaggerated Mr Peter de Savary, the flamboyant entrepreneur whose interests range from property to the oil business, yesterday angrily denied reports that his business empire was at risk of collapse. It emerged over the weekend that some 10 days ago Standard Chartered Bank, which has been associated with Mr de Savary for a number of years, has appointed accountancy firm Robson Rhodes as administrative receiver to Placeton, a property development company that three years ago represented 60 per cent of Mr de Savary's net assets. Mr de Savary played enthusiastic host to thousands of visitors yesterday at Littlecote Leisure theme park, set in the grounds of his historic Berkshire home, while rejecting suggestions that the collapse of Placeton was the end of the road. 'I greatly resent suggestions that de Savary is either wiped out, bankrupt, personally in trouble or no longer able to take a positive role in business.' he said. 'That would be very misguided.' He said he had personally lost Pounds 50m in the collapse, adding that this probably represented about 60 per cent of his net worth. He refused to put a figure on his fortune, however. 'An amount that others dream of,' was all he would say. Mr de Savary, who prides himself on being a self-made man who left school at 16, is well-known for his ebullience and willingness to take risks. At one time in the 1980s he was involved in attempts, ultimately unsuccessful, to win the Americas Cup yacht race. 'The whole thing has been greatly exaggerated,' he said of the Placeton receivership. 'The Placeton group was only established in 1989. My businesses are all horizontally structured, not vertically, so it is only one of the tentacles of my business operations.' He made it clear he believed that his continuing operations were insulated from the demise of the Placeton operations. 'Three years ago it became obvious if the recession did not lift it was going to be a difficult situation. I have disposed of many of the assets and restructured others. What we are left with is the fag-end of a property portfolio. 'Putting in a receiver was the bank's decision. It is fair to say that its idea of how to manage a portfolio is different from mine.' Mr de Savary added that he believed Standard Chartered had lost rather more than Pounds 50m. Yesterday the bank disputed his claim, pointing out that it had seen the crash coming for some time and had made the necessary provisions. As a result it did not believe there would be any material effects on its results this year. Mr de Savary said there had been no damage to creditors, all of whom had been paid off long ago, and no jobs had been lost. The only shareholders were himself and Standard Chartered. 'From my point of view, it is a painful experience, but I have written it off. I would have been happy to continue to manage the assets for the bank, but in a way I am relieved they have taken this burden from me.' Mr de Savary said he was still active in a broad range of business ventures. He mentioned oil, property and financial investment. He was bitter that institutions including banks were able to finance problems of the kind undergone by Placeton through rights issues that were not open to private individuals. He was also unhappy that the bank had been unwilling to consider a debt-for-equity swap.</p>

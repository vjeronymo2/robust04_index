			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> OLD SOLDIERS: After running for district attorney against his boss, Michael R.  Capizzi, and then losing, Chief Deputy D.A. James G. Enright, 64, started his  vacation Monday and will not return. . . . When his vacation ends, Enright will  retire after 30 years in the D.A.'s office. . . . Any parting words? No, says  Enright.  </P> <P> "That's probably the best way -- to just fade away." And which of his big cases  -- most of them splashy murders -- will he cherish most? A simple drug  possession conviction in 1970 -- but against drug cultist Timothy Leary. "He  was the drug guru, and we sent him to prison. That had an impact." Jim Newton  and Jerry Hicks  </P></p>

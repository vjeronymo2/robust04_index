			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 18, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister  Mart Laar in an interview with BNS today declined to comment on  the reasons why the Pro Patria party faction in the parliament  today had decided to seek the discharging of Indrek Kannik from  the post of the Defense Minister.    "I'd rather talk about it tomorrow, after we have discussed  the issue also in the government," Laar said.    Tonight's Cabinet meeting is not connected with the  dismissal  of Indrek Kannik from the office of the defense minister, the  premier said. "This meeting was called already before the Pro  Patria started to adopt its decisions," Laar said. But he also  mentioned that the situation had become "intolerable." "Now the  Pro Patria faction has made its decisions," Laar said.    Answering a question if it was possible that Pro Patria  might  split if Kannik and some of his allies were defeated in the  current power struggle, Laar said he considers such development  of the affairs a very regrettable prospect.    "One of the main objectives of my activity in the last half  year has been to avoid such conflicts," the prime minister said.  He added that although he had tried avoid a conflict, "each  thing has its limits and now these limits have been reached."    The prime minister declined to say whether he had plans to  make other changes in the Cabinet apart from Kannik's dismissal.    Laar said he had not delivered to the president a formal  proposal to dismiss Kannik. He said he is going to formally  seek the president's approval for the replacement after the  Cabinet has approved the decision made by the Pro Patria faction.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Slow creation of jobs in US THE slow US recovery last month generated about 162,000 civilian jobs, lowering the unemployment rate from 7 per cent in June to 6.8 per cent, according to the US Labour Department. The figures were consistent with other economic news of the week which shows the economy recovering slowly. Republicans seized on the news to claim that President Bill Clinton's budget plan, if passed by the Senate, would push the economy back into recession. Most economists say the economic plan will have virtually no effect on either employment or the economy. The Global Securities Research and Economics Group of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co yesterday issued an analysis suggesting Mr Clinton may actually meet his campaign promise of creating 8m jobs during his administration. Most of the jobs created in July were in low-paying sectors, say Merrill Lynch. 'During the past year, temporary help, health services, other services and restaurants each accounted for nearly 25 per cent of private payroll gains, with other sectors contributing almost nothing.' Mr William Barron, deputy commissioner of labour statistics, says the better-paid manufacturing sector continued to lose jobs last month, but the loss of 13,000 was much smaller than in the previous three months and the declines were concentrated in fewer industries than previously. Many economists believe the worst is over for the US economy on the unemployment front. Although there will still be heavy lay-offs, the savings and loan bail-out is nearing an end and many companies have completed painful restructuring. Last month the finance sector added 14,000 jobs. Analysts say the floods in the Midwest will affect workers in devastated communities and temporarily displace many from their jobs.</p>

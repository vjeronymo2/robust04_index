			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CADETS MISSED THE BOAT ON GOAT  </P> <P> Army cadets failed to get their goat from the Naval Academy.  </P> <P> Early Sunday morning, cadets from the U.S. Military Academy captured a goat  they thought was Bill XXVI, the mascot of the U.S. Naval Academy.  </P> <P> But midshipmen can be great kidders, especially when it comes to anticipating a  prank by rival Army cadets. The real Bill had been hidden by midshipmen just in  case of a prank.  </P> <P> The Naval Academy said the kidnaped goat was one of several that had auditioned  to succeed Bill XXV, who was retired in 1988.  </P></p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Steady as she grows PRESIDENT CLINTON'S new communications director, David Gergen, had a rule for the Reagan White House: keep it simple, even when it is not. The American economy has been hard to decipher in recent months, but the simple message is one of steady growth. If Mr Clinton has difficulties getting that across, few of his OECD colleagues will sympathise. The prospects for the US economy are still sturdy. Consumer price inflation has now averaged 3.5 per cent for the first five months of 1993, with worrying early figures appearing to be more blip than trend. The numbers for domestic output have also wandered, but the basic improvement is worthy, if dull. The economy looks likely to achieve 2.5 to 3 per cent growth this year. The pace is certainly slower than in previous postwar recoveries and job growth, too, has been lower. But it is a better performance than in any other major industrial country. Can Mr Clinton realistically hope for more? There are three factors which are keeping US growth forecasts sober: shaky consumer confidence at home, the dismal state of major economies abroad, and realism about what the economy can sustain without inflation. In the short term, at least, none of these is likely to go away. When news of the recovery seemed finally to be confirmed at the start of the year, observers expected fewer mood swings from US consumers and companies. Buying and hiring has stayed cautious, however, largely through uncertainty about federal tax increases and healthcare reform. Things will become a little clearer if a deficit package is finally passed in the coming weeks. But to the extent that the implications hurt America's biggest spenders, few would expect the added clarity to boost sales. New pessimism If he cannot expect much consuming zeal at home, prospects are bleaker in Europe. Indeed, the contrast in fortunes now seems even starker than first thought. The dollar's recent rise against the D-Mark is a sign of the new pessimism. It is difficult to believe that a differential of 4.5 percentage points between US and German short-term rates can be sustained much longer. The Japanese picture is only a little better, with or without current political uncertainties. The Japanese fiscal stimulus and the somewhat managed climb of the yen will eventually improve conditions for US exports. But the continued sluggishness of the Japanese economy and the effects of appreciation are likely to make the trade picture worse before it gets better. None of Mr Kantor's protests in Tokyo can change the fact the US and Japan are at different points in the economic cycle, and will be for a while yet. Less hesitant The president may be disappointed that he cannot offer Americans a recovery like the heady upturn of the mid-1980s. He should not be. Inflationary fears have been easy to ignite in recent months, partly because there may be limited room for manoeuvre in the US economy. Alan Greenspan understands this well. The Federal Reserve recently reduced its own estimate of US capital stock growth over the 1980s, from 2.4 per cent per annum on average to 1.7 per cent. This means that there is less spare capacity in the economy than previously thought. As important, it means that Mr Greenspan will be less hesitant to raise interest rates if inflationary pressures look worrying. He must move in that direction sooner rather than later if long-term rates are to stay down. So what can Mr Clinton hope for? The answer is an investment-led recovery, like that of the past few quarters. It will not be fuelled by government cash, since Congress has axed most of his public investment plans. And capital may not flow from Japan as easily as it once did, though Mr Clinton can hardly lament that if he is consistent in his war on the trade imbalance. Further cutting the federal deficit - which frees up domestic funds for private investment - would do most to give the recovery stamina. But little can be done to make it dramatic, or produce speedier job growth. It should, however, be a more sustainable recovery than any in recent memory. Even the most embattled president ought to find that a source of relief.</p>

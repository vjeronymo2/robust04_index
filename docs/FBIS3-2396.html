			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Wuhan, March 4 (XINHUA) -- The Foreign Investment  Office and the Administration for Industry and Commerce of Wuhan  city, capital of Hubei Province, recently revoked licences of 26  unqualified Sino-foreign joint ventures.    This is the first time that Wuhan city has withdrawn the  business permits from joint ventures.    The 26 companies were engaged -- or supposed to be -- in  operations in food-stuffs, catering services, fashion, video  tapes, medical instruments, car repairs and leather processing.    Sources said that some of the shut-down joint ventures had  not started operating even three or four years after they  registered with the local administration for industry and  commerce. Others had suspended trading for several years after  some conflicts within the enterprises.    A few of the enterprises even had no permanent location and  had disappeared from the city.    Sun Shiyu, director of Wuhan Foreign Investment Office, said  that a few of the joint ventures failed to meet the demands of  the market and their products could not be sold at home or  abroad.    He said that there were also some overseas businessmen who  had no capital at all and ran their operations entirely by  borrowing money from banks in the city. When the local banks  refused to lend them loans, they failed in their attempts.    Now Wuhan Foreign Investment Office and Wuhan Municipal  Administration for Industry and Commerce are jointly tightening  up supervision of the operations of registered joint ventures so  as to help overseas-funded enterprises to function normally.</p>

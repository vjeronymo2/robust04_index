"If changes are to be made, this is  definitely a responsibility of the commander in chief which is  clearly established in the Law Governing the Armed Forces,"  Discua stated.    Discua Elvir asserted he will meet this week with commanders  individually "to define forces' organization," work plans, and  the changes that will be made. The military chief described as  errors and speculation the reports on the ratification of all  military chiefs in the northern part of the country. According  to the general, there will be few changes and no "shakeups," as  happened last year.    Additionally, the Armed Forces chief said the new national  defense and public security minister will be named by  President-elect Carlos Roberto Reina, not by the military  leadership, as has always occurred in the past.    Discua Elvir ruled out a rebellion by officers against him  in  view of the announced changes or the situation prevailing within  the institution. Although he said he does not exercise control  over everybody, he has his "working team," because a man is  unable to have more than 10 people under his command. These 10  men, he stated, "are responsible for disseminating all the  information an executive can give."    Meanwhile, Discua Elvir explained that the election of the  new congressional president is an internal affair of the Liberal  Party of Honduras [PLH], but he said he hopes "everything is  done to benefit" the people and that political party. Discua  Elvir concluded that the PLH will initiate a strong government,  "with clear ideas and objectives."</p>

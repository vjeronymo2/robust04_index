			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: DATRON SYSTEMS ADOPTS ANTI-TAKEOVER RIGHTS PLAN  </P> <P> Datron Systems Inc., a Simi Valley producer of satellite-receiving dishes and  other communications products, adopted a common anti-takeover tactic known as a  shareholders' rights plan.  </P> <P> The plan's key feature says that if an unwelcome party acquires at least 20% of  Datron's stock, the remaining shareholders have rights to buy additional Datron  shares for half price. The idea is to increase the number of shares outstanding  and make a hostile takeover of the company prohibitively expensive.  </P> <P> Datron said the rights would cover its shares outstanding on Sept. 5. The  rights also can be redeemed by management in the event Datron's directors  accept a merger offer.  </P></p>

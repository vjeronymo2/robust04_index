			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tirana, February 26 (ATA) -- The Albanian Academy  of Sciences condemned today, through a statement, the illegal  and anti-scientific act of the Serbian invading authorities in  Kosova who confiscated on February 23 the building of the Kosova  Academy of Sciences and Arts in Prishtina. The Academy of  Sciences of Albania regards the Serbian act as part of a  short-sighted policy inspired by a medieval mentality.    The Albania's Science Academy appeals to all the world  academies and the progressive international community to protest  against those illegal acts in order that the Albanian scientists  in the Republic of Kosova may freely exercise their peaceful  activity serving the science and prosperity.</p>

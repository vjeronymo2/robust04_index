			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: TDG's Pounds 27m disappoints City - Shares fall 25p on downbeat statement about recovery prospects Shares in Transport Development Group fell 25p to 284p yesterday after the distribution, storage, transport and hire company issued a downbeat statement about recovery prospects. Mr Martin Llowarch, chairman, said: 'TDG's perceived status as a 'bellwether' of the UK economy has led some commentators to have rather bullish expectations about the immediate outlook for profits, although both here and on the continent, it is no easier to make money than it was a year ago. 'The group is in good shape, but profit recovery will only be steady rather than dramatic.' For the year to end-December pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 33.5m to Pounds 26.9m, which were depressed by exceptional net losses and closure costs of Pounds 7.5m. Operating profit after interest dipped from Pounds 36.2m to Pounds 34.4m and sales from continuing operations fell from Pounds 565m to Pounds 550m. UK operating profit increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 35.1m, but the group said the slow recovery was being accompanied by continuing downward pressure on margins. Continental European profits fell by 60 per cent to Pounds 3.2m, reflecting the economies in Germany and the Netherlands, and continuing difficulties in France. TDG withdrew from America in 1992 and has agreed to sell its Australian operation. The group said this pruning would give it an exclusively European focus and, on the completion of the Australian deal, leave it almost unborrowed. The group sold several businesses last year, including Translittoral, a lossmaking French haulage company, and the Canvey Island storage business of London &amp; Coastal Oil Wharves. Talks are in progress to sell Beck &amp; Pollitzer Engineering to a management consortium and sale discussions are being held concerning two other unidentified businesses. Earnings per share were 9.63p (12.05p), but before exceptionals rose to 14.89p (13.94p). A final dividend of 6.5p gives an unchanged total of 9.5p. COMMENT The drop in the share price reflected TDG's caution about the pace of recovery, but analysts were if anything more concerned about the extent of margin pressure across the group. Having trimmed the sprawl of companies from 120 to 34 in the last few years, TDG's management is still struggling with tough trading conditions - which is reflected in the unexciting prospective multiple of 17. Acquisitions could spark more interest, but European distribution is very fashionable and companies are being sold for fancy prices. TDG's cautious managers are unlikely to do anything rash, but a re-rating is unlikely until the group shows its hand.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUMOR OF ATHEIST AIRWAVE ATTACK PERSISTS;  </P> <P> BROADCASTING: A FALSE RUMOR THAT MADALYN MURRAY O'HAIR IS PETITIONING THE FCC  BAN ALL RELIGIOUS PROGRAMMING IS 15 YEARS OLD.  </P> <P> "Rumor travels faster, but it don't stay put as long as truth," humorist Will  Rogers once said. But don't try telling that to the Federal Communications  Commission.  </P> <P> A false rumor that atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair is petitioning the FCC to ban  all religious broadcasting is now 15 years old -- and it still brings in as  many as 83,000 letters a month to the federal agency.  </P> <P> Since the FCC started counting in 1976, more than 23.5 million petitions and  letters of protest or inquiry about O'Hair have flooded the agency's Washington  office.  </P> <P> Last year alone, 1.14 million pieces of mail were sent to Washington and  monthly totals early this year are running even higher. The still-traveling  rumor also prompted 3,959 phone calls to the federal agency last year.  </P> <P> Although no current cost estimate is available, FCC officials calculated that  the commission spent $1.5 million in the first 11 years alone responding to the  rumor. Its consumer assistance division sends denials to all inquirers, except  those who mail in form letters. The FCC repeatedly has said it has no legal  authority to prohibit religious broadcasts.  </P> <P> "It's a fire that is difficult for the FCC to put out," said Audrey Spivack,  acting chief of the agency's news media division. She would not speculate on  why the rumor persists.  </P> <P> Most religious observers, and O'Hair herself, say the rumor seems plausible  because of the atheist's fame as an opponent of religion. A lawsuit by O'Hair  contributed to the 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that banned devotional Bible  reading in public schools. Her name also is frequently, though wrongly, linked  to a 1962 Supreme Court ruling that forbade government-mandated prayers in  public schools.  </P> <P> "To evangelical Christians she is considered perhaps the archenemy of  religion," said Randall Balmer, a historian of American religion at Columbia  University. Balmer also noted that the supposed threat from O'Hair would strike  a blow in one area where conservative Christians have been dominant --  religious radio and television.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are fearful that the traditional values they hold are  threatened, and that they must act to defend God," said Thomas McAnally of  Nashville, national president of the Religious Public Relations Council.  </P> <P> McAnally said the United Methodist news and information office he directs has  sent out "a half-dozen" releases over 15 years trying to quell the rumor. "The  alarm that it triggers in them overshadows the need to find out where the  information comes from," he said.  </P> <P> At her American Atheist headquarters in Austin, Tex., O'Hair said she thinks  "religion has to have an enemy (to succeed). I've been on radio talk programs  where people say, 'Even if you didn't do it, it sounds like something you would  do.' They think it's a legitimate way to protest against me."  </P> <P> When Juanita Rayle of Altadena, for example, received a women's club newsletter  last month with an attached flyer alerting Christians to the alleged threat,  she said, "I was hopping mad when I saw it."  </P> <P> Rayle went to her church, Pasadena First United Methodist, to run off 100  copies to distribute to fellow church members and the Altadena Republican  Women's Club. "Boy, they wanted to do something about that old girl," Rayle  said.  </P> <P> Rumors having to do with anti-Christian threats don't stop with O'Hair and the  FCC.  </P> <P> Procter &amp; Gamble has been plagued since 1981 with virulent rumors about its  supposed satanist influences. Rumors of unknown origin have claimed falsely  that the company's half-moon and stars trademark is a satanic symbol. Other  rumors contended, wrongly, that a company executive on a television talk show  credited his success to "satanic influence."  </P> <P> Procter &amp; Gamble dropped the symbol from its packaging in 1985, got several  religious leaders to issue disclaimers, and the company filed lawsuits in 1982  and 1985 against individuals for spreading malicious falsehoods. A new wave of  rumors coming this year from the South led the Cincinnati-based company to  reissue an old letter from evangelist Billy Graham reminding Christians that  "it is a sin to 'bear false witness' " and release a letter written last month  by Jerry Falwell urging that the rumors be "squelched."  </P> <P> The FCC has not taken such active steps to cut off the O'Hair canard. "We  respond to requests for interviews by the news media, but we have a small staff  and no means to do an outreach," said Spivack, the FCC spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Religious publications -- by Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Mormons, Catholics  and others -- periodically carry articles criticizing the spurious "campaign"  to the FCC. "Experience has shown that church people contribute many" of the  protests, said an editorial in the nationally circulated United Methodist  Reporter. "Let's waste no more effort or postage on it. Instead, let's use our  energy to identify and confront real evils, to share the Good News of God's  love with others," the newspaper said.  </P> <P> The photocopied O'Hair rumor that appears to be the most commonly circulated  has some clues to indicate it is unreliable.  </P> <P> Among other things, the notice is unsigned, misspells O'Hair's name and refers  to her eliminating Bible reading and prayer in schools 15 years ago, which  suggests the circular was written at least 12 years ago. The notice also  declares that if O'Hair is successful, then "all Sunday worship services being  broadcast, either by radio or television, will be stopped" even though  religious freedom provisions of the First Amendment prohibit such  discrimination.  </P> <P> But the urgent tone of the notice still spurs many to action. The notice claims  that O'Hair has been granted a federal hearing on her petition, which was  accompanied by 27,000 signatures.  </P> <P> "We need ONE MILLION (1,000,000) signed petitions," the circular exclaims.  "This should defeat Mrs. O'Hare by showing that there are still many Christians  alive, and well, and CONCERNED, in our Country."  </P> <P> Only the petition number cited in the circular -- 2493 -- relates to a real  case. According to the FCC, a petition by Jeremy D. Lansman and Lorenzo W.  Milam in December, 1974, was routinely assigned the number RM-2493. That  petition asked that no licenses be granted for any new, non-commercial  educational stations, including those of religious educational organizations,  until their operating practices were examined. That petition was denied by the  FCC on Aug. 1, 1975.  </P> <P> But by then, the rumors had started, saying that RM-2493 called for all  religious broadcasting to be banned and that O'Hair was behind it.  </P> <P> In the first year it counted them, the FCC received nearly 4.7 million pieces  of mail on the issue. Subsequently, the volume has fluctuated, falling to a low  of 546,000 in 1981, but remaining above 1 million letters every year since.  </P> <P> Of 10 letters sent to the FCC early this year and chosen randomly for The Times  as examples, one was a protest petition from Canada signed by 10 people. The  other correspondents inquired whether the report was true or not.  </P> <P> One letter writer, the Rev. Jeffrey A. Lambert, pastor of two churches in South  Shore, Ky., said in an interview, "If it was true, I wanted to get on the  bandwagon and do everything in my power to fight it." Told by the FCC that the  rumor was false, Lambert said he distributed copies of the denial to church  leaders and told members about it from his pulpits. John van Genderen, a member  of Arcadia First Presbyterian Church, said his wife picked up a circular where  she works at Caltech. It was one of the copies made by Juanita Rayle.  </P> <P> "I remembered seeing something like that several years ago at church, and we  all signed a petition against it," Van Genderen said. "I thought we were not  successful, that they required more signatures," he said. He was about to  present the notice to a social group at his church until someone told him it  was bogus.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE RUMOR THAT WON'T DIE  </P> <P> More than 23.5 million letters have flooded the FCC offices in Washington since  the mid-1970s because a totally false rumor that atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair  has petitioned to shut down all religious broadcasting. Despite denials by the  federal agency and disclaimers in the religious press, as many as 83,000  protests and inquiries arrive monthly at the FCC.

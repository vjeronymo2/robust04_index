			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Nissan closure shocks workforce: Car company attempts one of Japan's most radical restructurings ON THE surface everything seemed calm yesterday at Nissan's Zama plant near Tokyo. On the production line workers diligently assembled car parts to the rhythm of nearby robots and the strains of Beethoven's Fur Elise ringing from loudspeakers. But one phrase kept tripping off the tongues of Nissan workers; bikkuri shimashita, we are shocked. A day after Nissan announced its plans to close Zama in 1995, workers were still trying to come to terms with being caught up in the most radical restructuring undertaken in the Japanese car industry. To older Nissan workers the Zama closure represents the end of an era. Japan's industrial success was built on plants such as Zama. It was one of the company's main plants in the 1970s when Japanese cars were flooding out into export markets around the world. At its peak in 1976 it produced 956,000 cars and pick-up trucks. In two years' time most of Zama's production will be transferred to an ultra-modern plant on the southern island of Kyushu, which Nissan hopes will be the centrepiece of its future. Workers will be transferred from the grey, rusting Zama plant to Kyushu and Murayama in Tokyo Nissan plans to transfer 2,500 of its workforce of 4,000 to the two plants in summer of next year in a desperate move to stem losses. 'It's really sad,' said Ms Saiko Tsushima, a 24-year-old guide who has shown visitors around the Zama plant for six years. Japanese companies take pride in giving employees security. But now Ms Tsushima admits: 'I don't know what's going to happen.' When the plant was built Zama was largely surrounded by fields. Now the factory lies in the middle of a dormitory town, with thousands of white-collar commuters travelling daily to Tokyo an hour away. The growing popularity of Zama as a residential area seems to have given Nissan all the more reason to let go of the site. Although some of the company's research and development laboratories and a small-scale factory will remain in Zama, most of the 853,000-sq metre site is scheduled to be sold. Nissan has promised job security to all plant workers. But most are facing a transfer similar to a move from Essex to the highlands of Scotland. The shock is being felt in the local community. 'Nissan's plant has been the symbol of Zama since it was built,' said Mr Kunihiko Kawasaki, a local businessman. Indeed, the Zama plant has been the pride of the community. Mrs Thatcher, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and Mr Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, have all been shown the plant as a model of efficiency. Zama city officials are worried about the expected decline in corporate tax revenues. For the year which ended March last year, Nissan paid Y350m (Pounds 2m) corporate taxes, some 20 per cent of Zama's corporate tax income. Local businesses are also deeply concerned, especially small, local parts makers who are at the furthest reaches of Nissan's vast supply chain. Nissan said it would start transferring its Zama workers in summer next year. Mr Sotarou Mori, the general manager, sighs over the prospect of talks with plant workers who face uprooting their families to keep their jobs. But it is not the first time Mr Mori has done this kind of thing. It was depressing, he reflected, that some of the management methods he last used while on overseas postings for Nissan were finally coming to Japan.</p>

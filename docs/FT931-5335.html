			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / The Conservative Central Council at Harrogate: Grassroots rebels defeat party reforms A RARE grassroots rebellion among Tory activists succeeded yesterday in defeating plans to revamp the party organisation, after bitter wrangling in a discussion behind closed doors. Party managers had hoped to keep the row private and under control by excluding the press from the debate on the rule changes, which critics said would make the organisation too centralised. In four secret ballots enough representatives rejected the advice of Sir Basil Feldman, chairman of the voluntary wing of the party, to throw out the planned changes, which needed a majority of two thirds. After the debate, Sir Basil played down the defeats. He said he was sure many constituencies would still want to abide by the proposed code of practice and would submit annual financial returns to party headquarters, even though the rule change forcing local associations to do so had not gone through. Representatives made it clear they wanted an annual statement of the party's accounts. But activists stopped short of approving a motion censuring the party organisation for failing to respond to demands for greater accountability, and calling for direct elections to the new board of management set in place by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman. Party managers were so worried about how that debate might go that they made a last-minute decision to hold it in private too. The defeat for the party management does not affect the reforms at Tory central office proposed by Sir Norman. He said yesterday the new board of management would act like a company's board of directors, and take the most significant financial decisions. The board will comprise representatives of different parts of the party, such as MPs and councillors. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, will serve as a non-executive director. Sir Norman, responding to grassroots concern about the state of the party's finances, said spending had been cut from Pounds 12m a year to Pounds 7m a year, and promised the board of management would prevent severe over-spending in future. 'Pro-democracy' campaigners in the Tory party had warned that the party's need to raise more money might lead the central organisation to try to gain control of constituency party assets. Sir Norman denied the suggestion.</p>

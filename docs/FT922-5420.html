			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Industrialists quit business school in row A DISPUTE at one of Britain's top business schools has led 14 captains of industry and commerce to resign from its council and call on Mr John Patten, education secretary, to set up an inquiry into the school's affairs. The 14 have resigned as private-sector, lay representatives on the council of Manchester Business School, claiming that the school is poorly run and fails to maintain a partnership with the business community. They are led by Sir Dennis Landau, chief executive of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, and include Mr David Sieff, a director of Marks and Spencer; Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd and former permanent secretary to the Treasury; and Mr Andrew Noble, chairman of Specialeyes and former managing director of Debenhams. In a letter to Mr Patten, the 14 highlight 'a mutual lack of confidence and trust' between them and the school's parent institution, Manchester University, and 'a complete breakdown of the concept of partnership on which MBS was founded and which has helped it to develop to the very successful institution it is today'. The Department for Education said yesterday that Mr Patten was 'highly unlikely' to intervene in Manchester University's 'internal affairs'. The status of MBS as an integral part of the university is the main source of the dispute. Unlike the London Business School, the other 1960s creation of the Franks report into British management education, MBS has not gained autonomy from its parent. The MBS board has been seeking to achieve that autonomy but the university authorities, initially sympathetic, have come down firmly against. They want instead to promote greater co-operation between MBS and the larger management school at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. Accordingly, the Court of Manchester University voted a fortnight ago to assume direct responsibility for the school's management and to abolish its separate council in due course. The lay representatives decided to resign the next day. The dispute has forced Professor Tom Cannon, the school's director, to take 'diplomatic' study leave. It is understood that he intends to resign on Monday. The University of London is a federation, while Manchester has the faculty and departmental shape of most of the redbrick universities of its era. Recognising that, Sir Dennis and his colleagues say in their letter to Mr Patten: 'It is apparent that the constitution of our universities, granted by charter many years ago, may be due for revision. The powers granted for the dispensation of public funds are hardly suited for present-day conditions.'</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Trial of Communist party set to end in compromise HOW much and yet how little life has changed in Russia is illustrated by the fact that tomorrow the Communist party which ruled the country for 74 years will go on trial, while former party chief Mikhail Gorbachev is accusing President Boris Yeltsin of heading towards dictatorship. Although the party's fate shows just how much has changed, Mr Gorbachev must remember the winter of 1990, when he embarked on the conservative U-turn which ultimately cost him his job and broke up the Soviet Union. In recent weeks Mr Yeltsin has made similar alliances with conservatives in industry and the military. The sense of deja vu was reinforced, when Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, warned on Tuesday of the danger of an 'anti-democratic coup', as Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, his Soviet predecessor, had done before him. Mr Kozyrev even went so far as to warn that Mr Gorbachev's fate could befall Mr Yeltsin if 'we begin to make concessions to these forces'. But other Yeltsin supporters say the parallels are superficial. The main issue now is not whether to proceed with political and economic reforms, as was the case two years ago, but how to strengthen the government's hand so it can continue the reforms. Further, they argue, Mr Yeltsin's direct popular mandate and the fact that market reforms are already under way put him in a much stronger position than Mr Gorbachev, an unelected leader who fell back on the traditional pillars of the party and KGB to stay in power. Then, Mr Gorbachev gave in to the blackmail of military and industrial hardliners rather than risk launching fast-track market reforms. Now, Mr Yeltsin has to deal with industrial managers who have so far refused to respond to the government's financial austerity measures: instead of sacking workers, they have continued to trade with each other without demanding payment. They and the new industrial managers who have joined the government argue that the country is not ready to absorb large-scale unemployment, that production cannot be allowed to fall any further, and that popular discontent could explode overnight if further hardships are heaped on to the back of price rises. On Wednesday, Mr Yeltsin, who says a coup is impossible but he needs the support of industrial managers to achieve reforms, will put the case to G7 leaders in Munich that he also needs western cash to succeed. Finally, Mr Yeltsin has been seeking the support of military conservatives. In particular, he needs to keep under control Russian forces in now independent republics where they risk being sucked into local conflicts and siding with Russian minorities whom, in the case of Moldova, Mr Kozyrev described as 'extremists'. This, at least, is the explanation given by Yeltsin supporters, and some western diplomats, for his decision to appoint as deputy defence minister a man like General Boris Gromov. An Afghan war hero, Gen Gromov was deputy to Mr Boris Pugo, the hardline Soviet interior minister who shot himself after the failure of the August coup. The verdict of the Constitutional Court, which tomorrow is to decide on the legitimacy of Mr Yeltsin's ban of the Communist party, is itself likely to be a compromise in the name of political stability. Although the constitutional grounds for it are shaky, it is unlikely that the court will overturn the ban. This is because neo-communist groups have been active in fanning nationalist and anti-reform passions and because the Communist party was indeed a dangerous machine that needed to be abolished - and not least of course because a verdict against Mr Yeltsin would cause immense damage to his authority. In the absence of a better bet than Mr Yeltsin to continue the reforms, the world can only take his word for it that he needs all the help he can get.</p>

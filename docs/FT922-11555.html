			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Mexican blast probe begins MEXICAN President Carlos Salinas de Gortari yesterday ordered a probe into possible criminal negligence by public officials in the gas explosions that killed about 200 people and injured some 1,500 others in Guadalajara, Mexico's second city, on Wednesday. Mr Salinas did not elaborate, but a spokesman for the Jalisco state government said that the state oil company, Pemex, was among the targets of the investigation. Earlier, Pemex had denied allegations that the explosions were caused by petrol that somehow leaked into the sewer system. Hundreds of workers yesterday were clawing through tons of debris, searching for survivors of the series of explosions which had wrecked a 20-block section of Guadalajara. Locals demanded to know why volatile gas had been allowed to build up in the sewer system, and why the government had failed to react quickly to reports of a petrol-like smell permeating the area before the explosions on Wednesday. The precise cause of the nine blasts, which gouged deep trenches in the streets of the poor La Reforma district, was still unclear yesterday. A cooking oil factory, La Central, said it had nothing to do with the blasts. It denied dumping hexane in the sewerage system. This is a highly volatile liquid paraffin hydrocarbon which can be used to extract edible oil from seeds. Some technical observers said the characteristics of the explosions point to hexane rather than petrol as the cause. The local authorities' failure to prevent the disaster and their handling of its aftermath have met heavy criticism, while national industrial safety standards have been called into question. A gas or fuel leak in the area was detected the day before the catastrophe. Staff from the local water and sewage department, and from Pemex, are reported to have investigated complaints but been unable to find the leak's source. On Wednesday, 10 minutes before the first explosion, the Guadalajara chief fireman told a local newspaper reporter that there was no problem. The authorisation of the use of heavy earth-moving machinery, while people were still being found under the debris, has also been sharply attacked. Mexican law requires industrial safety standards matching international norms, but enforcement is a problem. Mr Homero Aridjis, head of the Group of 100 environmental monitoring group, is reported to have said that the Mexican government had been very lax about industrial safety. The government requires new companies to undertake an environmental risk evaluation, but some older ones have not complied. Many of the companies created during the early years of Mexican industrialisation now have old facilities. President Salinas toured the scene late on Wednesday and pledged his government would do all it could to help the victims. After the poor official response to the 1985 earthquake in Mexico City, the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party suffered severe political repercussions. On the international level, the disaster may reinforce the negative image of Mexico among opponents of the North American free trade agreement being negotiated by Mexico, the US and Canada. US trade unions, concerned about the possible loss of jobs to enterprises south of the border, have painted Mexico as a backward, corrupt country where repeated statements of environmental concern are mere words.</p>

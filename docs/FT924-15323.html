			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (11): Fiercely competitive market - Photocopiers PHOTOCOPYING may be one of the oldest office technologies, but it continues to be one of the most fiercely competitive markets - and one of the most contentious. The past year has witnessed the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) investigation into toner supply; the Office of Fair Trading inquiry into dodgy dealer copier contracts; and the European Commission debating, yet again, the question of levies on imported Japanese copiers. All the while sales were being squeezed. Market research company Dataquest has yet to finalise its market figures for 1991 but, according to Jacqueline Hendriks, copiers research analyst, 1991 UK copier placements decreased by 11 per cent compared with 1990 to 144,500 units. The three main reasons for the decline were the impact of the recession, which has restricted user spending; the shift in copier placements from low to mid- and high-range machines; and the increased demand for less expensive reconditioned/refurbished machines. In terms of market share by unit placements, the top three suppliers last year were Canon with 30 per cent, Rank Xerox with 18 per cent and Sharp with 9 per cent. Toshiba stands in fourth position followed by Mita in fifth. Canon did well because of its strength in the colour market, while Rank Xerox did well because of a significant increase in 91+cpm (copies per minute) placements and because it receives revenues from its service operation as well (a fact which the MMC found upset some of their dealers), the report states. Although Sharp has pulled back from its involvement in the colour copier market until 1993, the company looks set to do better in future following its entry into the higher volume market. According to Dataquest, Konica and Minolta are showing good form in Segment 3 (31-44 cpm). But, as the MMC concluded during its investigation, the most appropriate market share measure of a copier company's current performance is placements weighted by recommended monthly copy volume. That meant, in 1989, that the Rank Xerox share was 31 per cent (down from 90 per cent in the heady pre-Japanese days of the mid-1970s), Canon had 7 per cent, Kodak 7 per cent, Toshiba 6 per cent and Sharp 5 per cent. The MMC put the total UK market value at Pounds 1bn. Indal Business Research, which carried out the industry survey for the MMC, puts the UK installed base at 717,000 copiers, with 179,000 machines placements in 1989, nearly two thirds of which were replacement machines, of which some 80 per cent were imported. There were 22 main suppliers selling 300 models between them and some 2,000 dealers; all combining to ensure that no monopoly position in respect of machines, consumables, parts and service operated against the public interest. For Europe as a whole, BIS Strategic Decisions estimates that the monochrome plain paper copier base will grow to 6.73m in 1995 units from the 5.65m recorded for 1990. The company forecasts a significant increase in the installed base of colour copiers in Europe from 34,260 units in 1990 to 117,600 in 1995, with electrophotographic technologies taking the lion's share of 28,580 and 99,300 units respectively. Dataquest claims that almost 15,000 units were placed in Europe during 1991, of which one fifth were in the UK. But of all the new full-colour copiers launched over the past year, it says the Canon CLC10 bubblejet, a copier, printer and scanner, is seen as the key to market take-off. It would appear that whatever guise the copier is under, its usefulness will not diminish for some years yet. Rank Xerox points out that Europe creates 4.7bn documents every day and the number of colour reprographic impressions created in Europe each year is expected to rise by 35 per cent from 1.2bn now to 4bn by 1996. Investment, continues, too. Mr Paul Allaire, chairman and chief executive of Xerox Corporation, claims that despite trading under some of the weakest economic conditions for a decade, Rank Xerox is growing in its target markets and continuing to gain market share lost to the Japanese in the early 1980s. To keep the momentum going, a Ecu235m investment programme is under way, Ecu64m of which is being spent redeveloping the Systems Centre at Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire. Over the past few years, Rank Xerox has reduced its number of suppliers from 4,500 to 350 and, says Mr Allaire, increased quality more than 100 times. The product development cycle has been shortened by as much as 50 per cent and product costs have been cut by 30 per cent, despite inflation. With the market moving upwards in the high volume sector, it is only to be expected that there would be competition from the Far East. However, according to Hendriks, the high volume market (ie Segment 5-6, 70cpm and over), will continue to be dominated by Kodak, Oce and Rank Xerox: 'The Japanese are developing higher-volume products, but they do not represent real competition because they cannot sustain the copy volumes'. It will not stop the Japanese making inroads, and Ricoh and Konica are just two gunning for the high-volume sector. Nevertheless, the advent of the small, integrated systems copier is an interesting development because it makes on-demand document reproduction a reality for every business, with completed multipage document sets produced and ready for despatch in a matter of minutes, without the need for lengthy user training. With prices typically around the Pounds 6,000-12,000 mark but starting at Pounds 1,650 for a low-volume machine, automatic on-line options include multiple copy paper formats with auto switching from one paper tray to another; cover and divider sheet insertion; and collating, folding, punching, stapling and heat binding. Because of the potential in the small- to medium-size business or department that has, until now, had to rely on external print shops, the competition is getting fierce, with main contenders in this sector of the market now including Agfa, Canon, Konica, Lanier, Minolta, Oce, Olympia, Panasonic, Ricoh, Sharp and Toshiba. Colour copiers tend to divide into two categories: 'business colour' units which normally means they are affordable and easy to use and so are suitable for general office uses, and 'professional quality colour' machines for applications where true colour rendering and perfect registration are more important than cost. Every manufacturer offers refinements which they hope will make their machines stand out from the crowd. Another main trend in the copier market is towards PC-Mac computer integration to provide a scanning and PostScript printing facility with options including slide projectors to make copies from 35 mm slides. An important development in this sector is the Electronics for Imaging (EFI) Fiery Controller with its PostScript capabilities that transforms a digital copier into a multifunction device capable of copying, scanning and printing full-colour images director from a PC or Macintosh computer. The very first UK installation linked to a ColorEdge 1550 has just been completed at law firm Denton Hall. Together with the continuous tone colour printer, it will enable the firm to create information brochures and customer newsletters on a computer and reproduce these on demand in-house. They will be able to produce an A4 colour proof in 30 seconds, or an A3 in one minute, at a cost of 35p against the Pounds 30 the printer used to charge for a chromalin. But no matter how sophisticated copier and photocopier technology becomes, it seems that corporate customers are more concerned with reliability, quality and value for money than how many bells and whistles it has got, according to a survey carried out by Kodak Office Imaging. Other priorities include fast response, availability of parts, ease of telephone contact, knowledge of the customer's business and good old fashioned courtesy and helpfulness.</p>

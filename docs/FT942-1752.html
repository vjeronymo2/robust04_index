			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Guinness cashes in on Irish glory Ireland's success in the World Cup is creating a windfall for Guinness, the brewer, which has seen stout sales surge on both sides of the Atlantic. Some pub landlords in Britain have ordered 'emergency supplies' of Guinness after the Irish footballers' triumph over Italy lifted sales to five times their normal level. In Britain, where Guinness generally sells about 1m pints a day, pubs and Irish clubs - particularly those in areas such as north-west London, Coventry and Merseyside which have large Irish populations - report strong sales. 'The Irish have a knack for turning a sports event into a party,' said Guinness. But English, Scottish and Welsh football fans, bereft of their own teams to support in the World Cup, are also jumping on the Irish bandwagon and ordering pints of Guinness - promoted on television by Jack Charlton, the Irish team manager. Guinness, which is sponsoring the Irish team, readily admits that much of the evidence for the sales surge in Britain is anecdotal, since it has yet to compile figures. Nevertheless, one pub landlord in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, said his customers downed more than 1,000 pints of Guinness as they watched Ireland's 1-0 victory over Italy - more than four times normal sales. In the Irish Republic, where 420m pints of stout are bought every year and Guinness is estimated to have 90 per cent of the market, the company said its sales have risen 15 per cent in the week since the World Cup started, compared with the same period last year. This was in spite of a strike by Dublin bar staff last Saturday, timed to coincide with Ireland's opening match against Italy, which closed half the pubs in the Irish capital. Happily, the dispute has been resolved. In the US, where Guinness sales were already growing strongly, Irish bars in New York and Orlando, Florida, where the Irish team is now staying, are doing brisk business quenching the thirst of the estimated 18,000 Irish supporters. Sales in Orlando are twice the 1993 level while in New York, where Ireland's first match was played, the Guinness sales representative believes 50,000 pints of Guinness will be sold this month - up between 70 per cent and 80 per cent on the same period last year: 'It's like a month-long St Patrick's day,' she said.

			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE GERMAN EXPRESSIONIST VIEW OF MAN IN NATURE  </P> <P> In the early 1800s, German Romantic artist Caspar David Friedrich expressed the  overpowering feeling of nature by painting a tiny figure gazing out to sea. A  century later, weary of the stultifying proprieties of bourgeois culture, the  German Expressionists took a bolder, often fiercer tack.  </P> <P> They exaggerated the contours and contrasts of the world around them to  synchronize with their own intense sensibilities, recreating nature as a  mysterious dream world or a monster organism driven by harsh rhythms.  </P> <P> At the County Museum of Art (to Sept. 3), "German Expressionism and Nature,"  drawn from the Robert Gore Rifkind Center for German Expressionist Studies,  offers a sampling of 80 prints and drawings by major and lesser-known artists,  grouped in categories such as "Nature as Paradise" and "Creation and  Destruction."  </P> <P> Although this arrangement makes the development of the movement as a whole  harder to grasp -- as well as downplaying the artists' affiliations with groups  like Die Brucke (The Bridge) and Der Blauer Reiter (The Blue Rider) -- it does  allow the art itself to take center stage.  </P> <P> The movement's formal qualities were influenced by such diverse sources as  medieval woodcuts, sculpture from the South Sea Islands, the graphic work of  Norwegian artist Edvard Munch and the decorative qualities of Jugendstil, the  German version of Art Nouveau. Its intellectual basis was rooted in such ideas  as poet Rainer Maria Rilke's comment that art should be "almost hostile . . .  to give our existence new meaning." And its emotional expression was as  individual as the personalities of the artists themselves.  </P> <P> If some of these images are charged with passion -- like Ernst Barlach's  lithograph, "Star Dance," in which a gaunt, ecstatic figure hugs himself  beneath a huge star-filled sky -- others simmer on a low flame. In Max  Beckmann's drypoint, "Main River Landscape," scroll-like clouds and an unusual  format emphasizing the white of the paper create a flat, diagrammatic effect  almost like a medieval map.  </P> <P> Some of the most striking images in the exhibit are the work of artists whose  names are no longer familiar. Alfred Hanf turned the natural world of "Country  Road" into a nervous jangle of swelling and tapering lines that almost swallow  up the moon and a baying dog. Gustav Wolf's lithograph, "The Fourth Day,"  conjures up the primal world of Creation, with multiple suns like cogs of  machinery and exploding galaxies.  </P> <P> Even the most fervent of these visions, however, is much smaller and paler than  the kind of massively scaled, boldly outspoken art we are used to looking at  today. A certain degree of patience helps smooth the transition between Now and  Then, and so does a degree of empathy with an era more interested in the psyche  than the body beautiful.  </P></p>

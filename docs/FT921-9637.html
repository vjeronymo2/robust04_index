			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Brighter views on BP THE RECENT weakness in BP shares, triggered mainly by worries about low crude oil prices, a board room split, uncovered dividend and fears that any prolonged period of weakness by oil prices could trigger a shrinking of the company, was reversed yesterday after reassuring comments in the weekend financial press. Stories, suggesting that BP would at least maintain its quarterly dividend and probably increase the payment to match inflation when the results are published on Thursday, helped BP recover 10 to 285p on turnover of 6.8m BP was also helped by firmer crude oil prices ahead of tomorrow's Opec meeting in Geneva. Brokers were divided as to the outcome of the Opec meeting and the outlook for the sector. Mr Chris Perry at Gilbert Eliott said he viewed the downside in oils as 'limited' with the sector relative close to a five-year low. He is looking for the sector to outperform the market 'by at least 10 per cent' this year. Smith New Court's Mr Steve Turner commented: 'A successful Opec meeting and action by Opec to cut output would send oil prices back above Dollars 20 in the second quarter; this can only be regarded as a positive for the oil sector.' County NatWest, on the other hand, remained pessimistic on oil and oil shares. Mr Fergus MacLeod said: 'We stand by a 1992 forecast of Dollars 18 a barrel, with further weakness possible in the short term; this will keep the oil sector dull.' Mountleigh deal A successful share placing in property group Mountleigh saw the stock rise 2 1/2 to 9 1/2 p, as the market speculated on the likely buyers. One dealer said there was intense US interest spilling over from late on Friday, when a block of 27m shares came on to the London market. Some believed the stake was placed following the bankruptcy last week of Danish investment group Accumulator, which helped to underwrite Mountleigh's unsuccessful Pounds 96m rights issue in July. Yesterday's deal appeared to be an agency cross at 7p. Mountleigh already has large US shareholders - financiers Peltz &amp; May and the Getty Trust together hold 29 per cent - and has attracted stakebuilding hints on previous occasions. Yesterday's move is the latest in a burst of activity in the group's shares. Last week, chairman Mr Ian MacGregor took his stake to 3.5m shares after purchasing 2m for around 7p, while fellow director Mr David Watkins bought 100,000 at the same price. Eurotunnel down It was a volatile session for Eurotunnel, which fell 27p initially after announcing that it would not meet its June 1993 target for the opening of the Channel tunnel. Analysts had, however, suspected that Eurotunnel would have to make such an announcement, and the stock quickly rallied to close 11 down on balance at 454p on moderate turnover of 778,000 shares. Mr Richard Hannah, at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, calculated that Eurotunnel would lose about Pounds 60m to Pounds 70m for each summer month it delays opening the tunnel. He added: 'I think there is a distinct possibility for further equity financing, given the over-runs to date.' Reuters was weak in early trading as investors took profits before the results due tomorrow. However, the stock bounced in the afternoon to close a net 5 up at 1095p. Glaxo rose 12 to 828p as one US house was said to be a strong buyer, arguing that it was heavily undervalued. Nervousness ahead of its first-quarter profits failed to hold Hanson down and the shares gained 4 at 203p with a hefty 7.1m traded. Analysts believe the profits, to be reported on Thursday, will be below those of the same period last year. Weekend press reports that Fisons' best-selling asthma drug Intal was under threat prompted the shares to fall 11 in early dealing. However, analysts felt that the threat was overstated and the shares recovered to close unchanged on the day at 377p. A Hoare Govett review of the implications for the utilities of various political scenarios resulted in the broker recommending a switch out of electricity distribution companies into the water sector. Overall, Hoare said water shares were undervalued and electricity stocks fully valued. It particularly recommended Severn Trent, which closed 8 higher at 339p, and Welsh, 11 ahead at 383p. Allied-Lyons was firm in a generally depressed brewing sector. The shares put on 3 to 622p, shrugging off confusion about a proposed pub leasing deal with Brent Walker, and gaining support from the sale of the food division's home baking mixes and chocolate business. Bass lost another 9 to 511p, weighed down by the implications of US litigation over the purchase of the Holiday Inn hotel chain by the UK brewer. Cider producer HP Bulmer recovered an early loss to finish unchanged at 254p, in spite of concern that a successful bid for Perrier by Nestle might mean Bulmer losing the Perrier distribution rights in the UK. Among food manufacturers, Unigate rose 5 to 280p following the sale of its loss-making JP Wood chicken business to Hillsdown Holdings for Pounds 36.7m. Hillsdown, which through its Buxted Poultry subsidiary will lift its share of the UK poultry market from 14 to 20 per cent, was unaltered at 162p. William Low weakened 13 to 261p, reacting to Friday's late news that Mr Colin Mitchell, managing director of supermarkets, is leaving at the end of the month. Stores group Burton lost 2 to 37 1/2 p on sell recommendations by Nomura and Credit Lyonnais Laing. Nomura warned that, on all but the most optimistic consumer spending forecasts, the shares are likely to drift lower and the need to conserve cash may result in another cut in the dividend. Holiday group Airtours surged on old talk of strong holiday bookings. There was also the likelihood of some lift from US investors, who were reported to be impressed by a Hoare Govett presentation in New York on the group. The shares climbed 14 to 250p. Royal Bank of Scotland was the most heavily traded bank stock as its shares gyrated between 170p and 164p before settling unchanged at 167p. The bank confirmed that it was considering the sale of part or all of Charterhouse, its merchant bank arm. Other banks recorded minor improvements ahead of the preliminary results season, which starts on February 21 with figures from Lloyds, 4 firmer at 397p. Discount houses strengthened on suggestions of an early cut in UK interest rates. Union Discount, badly mauled in recent weeks, improved 8 to 142p, while Cater Allen rose 10 to 324p. Royal Insurance declined 11 to 232p and Sun Alliance 6 more to 280p as analysts caught up with Goldman Sachs-inspired profits downgrades carried out last week and continued to fret about a dividend cut at the former. Sturge Holdings relinquished 6 to 209p before today's annual meeting. Industrial gases and healthcare company BOC finished 2 easier at 645p ahead of first-quarter profits - expected to be between Pounds 73m and Pounds 80m  -due on Thursday. Kleinwort Benson was said to have reduced its forecast by around Pounds 6m to Pounds 79m yesterday. British Vita was held down to 261p after Hoare Govett changed its recommendation from 'buy' to 'hold', arguing that the shares were over-valued. Buying in front of today's third-quarter figures lifted British Airways 4 to 225p as 5.5m shares changed hands. The range of analysts' forecasts is between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m. USM stock Ross Group was quoted at 46p, against 9 1/2 p at Friday's close, following a one-for-five share consolidation yesterday. Stock overhanging the market in USM-quoted Nu-Swift was said to be behind a drop of 26 to 418p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (83).

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valentin Zhdanko from Minsk under the "Belarus" </F> rubric: "Mr. Kebich Wants To Be President. He Thinks That the  End Justifies the Means"]    [Text] The number of potential candidates for the  Republic's presidency is growing by the day, but the most  probable rivals whose names are set to be included on the ballot  are three: Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, [former] speaker  Stanislav Shushkevich, and Aleksandr Lukashenko, director of a  state-owned farm in Mogilev Oblast, who heads the government  anticorruption commission.    The candidates have already engaged in a struggle that  sometimes takes on risky forms, with Mr. Kebich setting the  tone. On the evening of 5 April, Aleksandr Lukashenko's office  at Government House was sealed. This was done on the pretext  that the ad hoc anticorruption commission had completed its  mission and should be dissolved. At the same time, most  commission members have announced that they are quitting it.  However, there has been no Supreme Soviet decision on the  subject. Mr. Lukashenko himself has promised to fight to the  bitter end and is intent on staying on as commission chairman  regardless of who its members will be. The incident of sealing  the main corruption fighter's office was immediately described  by Aleksandr Lukashenko's supporters as schemes by "a corrupt  government."    Mr. Kebich also made a harsh attack against his other  dangerous rival, Stanislav Shushkevich. Colonel Zametalin, the  prime minister's press secretary, issued a statement calling the  former speaker's candidacy "the most controversial and  inconsistent one, prone to political flirtation." Mr.  Shushkevich was accused by the press secretary of "demoralizing  the Supreme Soviet by having turned it from a legislature into a  debating society." As an example, he cited the fact that the  parliament has been unable to pass the Constitution for two  years. Only upon the arrival of a new speaker was the  Fundamental Law adopted.    None of the candidates has a clear edge at this stage. The  current prime minister's chances may receive a strong boost,  however, if the money systems of Belarus and Russia are unified.  The government is doing its utmost these days to accelerate the  process.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                           Apparently seeking to avoid putting its human rights record in  the spotlight at a time when Washington is beginning its annual  review of most-favored-nation trading status for China, Beijing  has responded with its usual circumspection to recent critical  reports on the human rights situation in China from the U.S.  State Department, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch.                                     END SUMMARY      Reflecting this year's typically restrained approach, Beijing  adhered to the pattern of the past three years and responded in a  pro forma manner and at a low-level of authority to the 1  February release of the U.S. State Department's annual report on  human rights, using the usual statement by a PRC Foreign Ministry  spokesman to register its official opposition to the report  (Xinhua, 3 February).  The spokesman, at the regular weekly press  conference on 3 February, denounced the report in standard terms,  saying it is "utterly unreasonable and totally irresponsible" for  the United States to "distort, criticize, and attack" China's  "domestic situation."  He went on to reaffirm Beijing's  longstanding position that the issue of human rights is an  "internal affair" which falls within the "sovereignty" of each  country and to reiterate China's "resolute opposition" to any  interference in the PRC's internal affairs on the "excuse" of  human rights.     In another indication of Beijing's apparent intention to maintain  a low-profile on the human rights issue, media commentary on the  release of the State Department report was similarly low-level  and limited to an article in Renmin Ribao by Shi Quan on 14  February and a 4 February article in the PRC-owned Hong Daily Ta  Kung Pao by well-placed columnist Shih Chun-yu.  Issued eleven  days after the Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, the Renmin  Ribao article, while pegged to the release of the report, devoted  most of its space to a historical discussion of the difference  between China's view of human rights and the European "humanist  concept" of rights.  It concluded by stating Beijing's standard  position that the human rights issue should not be used to  "meddle" in a country's internal affairs or "exert political  pressure on them."  For his part, Shih Chun-yu used his Ta Kung  Pao column to highlight what he said was a "significant  improvement" in the human rights situation in China and to  routinely warn Washington that efforts to "interfere" in China's  internal affairs under the "pretext" of human rights will be  counterproductive.     Beijing's effort to deemphasize its human rights problems was  also evident in its low-key response to the critical reports  issued in mid-February by Amnesty International and the Human  Rights Watch on China's human rights record.  Offering Beijing's  only observed public comment on the reports to date, Xinhua on 22  February carried remarks made the previous day by a PRC  representative to the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.  According to Xinhua, the representative made no mention of the  charges in the Human Rights Watch report, focusing instead on the  Amnesty International report as evidence that the organization is  "highly prejudiced" against China and that its thinking remains  that of the "Cold War era."  By contrast, last year Beijing had  responded at a higher-level of authority with a Foreign Ministry  spokesman statement to an Amnesty International report  criticizing China's human rights record in Tibet (Xinhua, 23 May  1993).

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, May 20 (AFP) -- Hundreds of thousands of  people are fleeing central Rwanda as heavy fighting in the  capital Kigali and elsewhere in the central African nation  causes a new exodus of refugees, an International Committee of  the Red Cross [ICRC] spokesman said Friday.    The ICRC appealed for UN peacekeepers to be sent in as  quickly as possible and for the establishment of humanitarian  corridors through the country.    Up to half a million Rwandans are believed to have died in  ethnic and political killings between members of the Hutu and  Tutsi people that broke out in early April.</p>

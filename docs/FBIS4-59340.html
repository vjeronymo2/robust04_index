			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim al-Wazir, secretary general of the </F> Yemeni Islamic Unification and Action Movement, by Muna Yasin;  place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Yasin] The Yemeni crisis did  not start with the recent events. What are the real reasons for  the crisis?    [Al-Wazir] The main reason is the financial and  administrative chaos, which began before unity and has continued  to aggravate since. There is indiscipline in the expenditure of  public funds, and all departments are in disarray. The economic  situation is in extremely bad shape. In addition, there is no  interest in work, and all parties are pursuing unsound policies.  Moreover, the political leadership has failed to make officials  abide by the law and work rules and pay attention to public  interest, so it has reached the point that personal interests  guide the officials. Everyone takes care of his personal  interests and ignores the interests of the homeland.    [Yasin] There are people who speak of other reasons. They  say that the political leader give high military posts to their  relatives and fellow tribesmen.    [Al-Wazir] This is also part of the disorder that prevails  in  all civilian and military departments.    [Yasin] Is petroleum one of the reasons for the crisis,  because every party wants to get that revenue and because they  have failed to distribute it to the two parts of the country?    [Al-Wazir] This is totally untrue. The unhealthy  malpractices are the main reason. The state's funds are treated  as funds that belong to no one.    [Yasin] Certain individuals hint that regional and  international circles are playing a role in the incidents and in  influencing the fate of unity.    [Al-Wazir] I do not believe this is this case. In fact, if  there is any foreign plotting, the influential rival Yemeni  factions gave them the opportunity.    [Yasin] How then do you explain Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-  Bid's tour of the Gulf countries after the signing of the Pledge  and Accord Document, a tour which he made without consulting  with the Yemeni president?    [Al-Wazir] The situation was bad in Yemen, and the vice  president says his tour was designed to improve Yemen's ties  with neighboring countries. Prior consultation was not possible  at the time because differences had not yet been settled.    [Yasin] Do you believe that this tour was normal behavior  since it came directly after the signing of the Document?    [Al-Wazir] The vice president has given his justifications,  which show concern for Yemen's ties with its neighbors.    [Yasin] Mystery surrounds the U.S. role as a mediator in the  Yemeni crisis and also Washington's position on Yemeni unity.  How do you view this role?    [Al-Wazir] Many people say that the United States is not  opposed to Yemen's unity because it wants stability in Yemen.  They say it wants this to promote stability and quiet in the  region as a whole, to guarantee the continued flow of oil and  because Yemen can be used as an alternative oil shipping point  if problems recur in the Gulf.    [Yasin] Certain parties propose a confederation as an  alternative to a complete merger and as a way out of the crisis.  What do you think?    [Al-Wazir] This issue takes us back to the question of  Yemeni  society and whether unity is feasible for it. I maintain that  there is no society where unity is more feasible as for the  Yemenis. This society does not have the problem of any  minorities, whether religious, ethnic, or linguistic. However,  historical experience has shown that no one area can rule the  others and no one individual can dominate all others. In other  words, when there is a central government, fragmentation and  secession occur. Retaining local rule in certain aspects would  guarantee the continuation and success of unity. Therefore,  local elections, for example, are considered to be an excellent  thing by the Yemeni president, who approved them; all that  remains is to implement them. But in my view, local elections  would bolster unity; and this does not mean federalism.    [Yasin] This clause is outlined in the Pledge and Accord  Document, but it was not implemented.    [Al-Wazir] It is funny that every party claims it supports  the Document and accuses the other party of refusing to  implement it. Only one part of the Document has not been  implemented. I believe that the Yemeni president is capable,  understanding, and flexible. If he wants to end the crisis he  can do so, as he has the finesse and flexibility. By using his  strong position he can steer things toward implementation of the  Document.    [Yasin] But the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] is asking for  guarantees before implementing the Document. What are these  guarantees and what is the possibility of providing them?    [Al-Wazir] The YSP is demanding the implementation of  specific clauses in the Document, as this would insure the  return of Vice President al-Bid to Sanaa. The required  guarantees are the implementation of the initial clauses  relating to security in order to make Sanaa secure for residence.    [Yasin] The concern over security is linked to the  assassinations of dozens of YSP members. Why are those  responsible for the assassinations not punished?    [Al-Wazir] Ask those who refuse to investigate these crimes.    [Yasin] But you, as a Yemeni who follow events, may have an  idea of the reason for this refusal, especially since there have  been 156 assassinations.    [Al-Wazir] I believe that establishing security is very  important to promoting the democratic process, which can only  thrive in an atmosphere of security and stability. Dialogue,  unlike violence, provides a chance for understanding. If it is  difficult to implement the initial clause of the Document--that  is, handing over those accused of the assassinations--the  parties can start by implementing the other clauses of the  Document and leave the first clause for the future. I propose  that the parties start by implementing local rule and put off  the clause on assassinations, which is difficult.    [Yasin] Why is it difficult?    [Al-Wazir] Because they have not started to implement it,  which indicates that it is difficult.    [Yasin] I would like to ask about the other political forces  in Yemen, particularly the al-Islah Party, the third partner in  the government.    [Al-Wazir] The al-Islah Party is a prominent party and is  trying to contain the crisis. However, the efforts of all  parties should focus on implementing the Pledge and Accord  Document, because it is the key to solving problems and  achieving social justice, which is absent in Yemen. Yemen is  now divided into an abject poor class and an unfairly rich one.  Other problems are rife in Yemen, like the lack of security and  deterioration of education. Moreover, the media is  concentrating on useless aims. There are other problems that  the al-Islah Party, the General People's Congress, and the YSP  should resolve; and they should revive the principles and goals  for which blood was shed to establish the state of Yemen. If  they fail to do this, the long struggle would be in vain.    [Yasin] What about your party?    [Al-Wazir] The Islamic Unification and Action Party, as is  clear from the name, is an Islamic party based on monotheism and  it acts to establish a state on the basis of true Islam. The  ideology of the party is that there is no contradiction between  traditionalism and modernism. We call for coping with the age  while not disavowing tradition and heritage of our predecessors.  The party also calls for Arab and Islamic unity. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Supreme Court Will Review Texas Thrift Ruling: In a case affecting the  government's efforts to deal with the S&amp;L crisis, the court agreed to  decide whether federal regulators can be held liable for supervisory acts in  running a troubled thrift. The court said it would hear a Justice Department  appeal seeking to dismiss a lawsuit by Thomas Gaubert, former chairman of  Independent American Savings Assn., a Texas thrift that was closed in 1987. He  charged in the suit that the thrift's failure was caused by the negligence of  regulators.  </P></p>

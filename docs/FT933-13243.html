			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Techint instigates a 30-year-old plan - The Argentine group's expansion strategy Techint, the Argentine steel-to-oil group, is using the country's enthusiastic embrace of privatisation and free market economics to press ahead with plans first hatched in the 1950s. For three decades, interference by the government and the army frustrated its ambitions to grow into a big, integrated steel maker. But the new economic climate has enabled Techint to forge ahead with an expansionist strategy in a highly competitive steel market. Acting through Siderca, its seamless pipe unit, Techint last month took management control of Tubos de Acero de Mexico (Tamsa), a Mexican steel pipe maker it helped set up in 1954. It paid Dollars 67m cash to increase its stake to 24 per cent when the loss-making company made a rights issue. Latin America's small equity markets and family-owned private companies make takeovers such as this rare. Techint was able to take control of Tamsa because of its unusually dispersed shareholding and New York stock exchange listing. The trend to mergers and takeovers should increase as more Latin companies are forced to go public to raise capital. Techint has wasted no time laying its plans for Tamsa. A Techint executive said: 'We will work on the obvious synergies.' Each company makes different types of steel pipes, which are used in the oil drilling industry, so there is little danger of competing in overlapping markets. Siderca has a strong international sales network and will offer a wider range of products. It will be able to advance more easily into the Mexican and North American markets. The two companies have a combined share of about 20 per cent of the world market for seamless piping, although a group of four Japanese companies led by Sumitomo has a dominant 40 per cent share. Techint is setting up a joint venture with Confab, Brazil's biggest maker of welded pipes, to share the cost of overseas sales networks and broaden product ranges. However, Techint is preparing for a long hard slog. Tamsa and Siderca export more than 80 per cent of output, but the trading outlook is cloudy. Demand in the former Soviet Union, a big market for Siderca, has slumped, drilling in the rest of the world is down and competition is getting ever tougher. On one level, Argentina's privatisation programme could make life less comfortable for Siderca. YPF, the oil group which is Siderca's biggest local client, threatens to become more choosy in placing orders now that it has moved into the private sector. However, Techint hopes Tamsa and Siderca, supported by stronger balance sheets, will be able to hold their own in the international market. Within two or three years, says a Siderca executive, 'there will be fewer companies and we expect to be among the winners. The others do not have the excellence, the management or technology to continue in this very competitive market.' Brave words, but Siderca has been going through hard times. It lost Dollars 98.7m in its last financial year following a decline of a third in output. Like many other large Argentine companies, Siderca is part of a closely-held family-dominated holding company. This shields management from the short-term outlook of minority shareholders, but Techint's murky inner workings make it hard to monitor strategic progress. The takeover of Tamsa follows Techint's acquisition of Somisa, a steelmaker, when it was privatised last year. Techint led a consortium that paid Dollars 140m for 60 per cent of the company, renamed Aceros Parana. Techint then absorbed Aceros Parana into its Propulsora steel plant, allowing it to fulfil its long-held ambition of becoming a fully-integrated steel maker. In the 1970s, the army blocked Techint's plan to build a steel mill to compete with Somisa, the military-controlled steel company. However, Techint is still facing competition from recession-bound Brazilian companies and as a result, Propulsora lost Dollars 2.8m in the first half of this financial year. Fortunately for Techint, the government has imposed countervailing duties on Brazilian steel imports. As in pipes, Techint has forged international alliances to strengthen its steel business. Its allies in the Aceros Parana privatisation were CAP, the Chilean steelmaker; Usiminas, Brazil's privatised steel mill and CVRD, the Brazilian state-owned iron ore producer. Little more than a decade ago, the military would have vetoed alliances with Chile and Brazil, Argentina's bitter rivals, in a strategic industry such as steel, as a threat to national security. Today, both companies and governments see cross-border alliances and takeovers as a key to survival.</p>

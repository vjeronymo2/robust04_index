			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Heavy retail price-cutting pushes down inflation rate THE SHARP reduction in inflation yesterday was welcome news for the government following Thursday's steep rise in unemployment and the record number of house repossessions. The fall in the annual rate of increase of the retail prices index for January to 4.1 per cent puts the UK headline inflation rate below the EC average of 4.9 per cent and below the ERM average of 4.5 per cent. Overall the RPI fell by 0.1 per cent from 135.7 in December to 135.6 in January, based on a weighting of 100 in January 1987. But the good news on inflation also reflects bad news on the economy. A breakdown of the falls in prices of the components of the RPI reveals the desperate lengths adopted by some retailers in January to overcome the negative forces of the recession. The biggest of these falls was recorded in clothing and footwear, where prices fell 5.1 per cent on the month, the biggest fall recorded in this sector since February 1921. The Central Statistical Office said that the figure reflected the exceptionally sharp price reductions in the January sales which turned out to be even more extensive than the record cuts in the January sales last year. There were further steep price reductions in household goods, where prices fell 1.7 per cent on the month - the largest monthly fall since 1956 and a reflection of price discounting in furniture and electrical appliances. The link between the heavy discounting by retailers in January and the sharp fall in the annual rate of inflation leaves a question mark over the prospects of keeping inflation at its present rate if demand picks up. Seasonal factors and higher prices for fares and utilities were the main reason for the rises that occurred last month. Fare increases of 6.3 per cent in January pushed travel costs up 2 per cent on the month, while higher prices for house-contents insurance caused a 1.7 per cent monthly increase in the price of household services. A sharp rise in the price of home-killed lamb, and increases of fresh vegetables caused seasonal food prices to rise by 2 per cent. A smaller rise in non-seasonal food prices - 0.8 per cent - reflected more expensive bread, cheese, soft drinks, beef and bacon. A 1.1 per cent monthly increase in personal goods and services reflected higher charges for services including health insurance.</p>

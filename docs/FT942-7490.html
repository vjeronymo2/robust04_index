			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Automotive Precision valued at Pounds 40.8m Shares in Automotive Precision Holdings, the precision engineering company, were priced at 100p yesterday valuing the group, which exports 93 per cent of its production, at Pounds 40.8m. Automotive Precision, based in Tonbridge, Kent, is coming to market via a placing of 10.2m shares with institutional investors by Beeson Gregory. The shares are due to begin trading on May 31. The company, which manufactures high precision components for the international automotive industry, was the subject of a Pounds 6m management buy-out from Hunting, the defence, aviation and oil group, in December 1990. About 80 per cent of its exports go to customers in the US including Chrysler and Detroit Diesel. Some 80 per cent of turnover is covered by rolling contracts of between two and four years and the customer base has doubled since 1992. Last year the group reported profits before non-recurring items of Pounds 4.99m (Pounds 4.2m) on turnover of Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 17.1m). Pre-tax profits slipped to Pounds 1.91m (Pounds 2.59m) after remuneration payments of Pounds 3.03m (Pounds 1.24m). The bulk of the shares being placed, some 9.71m, are being sold by the five members of the buy-out team. The remaining 500,000 shares are being issued by the company to cover the costs of the placing. The management, led by Mr Stefan Petszaft, managing director, will retain roughly a 70 per cent stake in the group, but plan to reduce this. The managers had initially planned to retain a 50 to 55 per cent stake but scaled down the sale because of the condition of the market.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Works councils go-ahead likely THE stalled EC draft directive to set up mandatory works councils in large trans-European companies is likely to be the first measure approved separately by Britain's 11 partners under the Maastricht social chapter, assuming the treaty is fully ratified in early autumn. Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner, said yesterday that talks in London this week with Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, had failed to produce any change in the UK's attitude. The 11 who signed the Maastricht social protocol are broadly agreed on the works councils directive, which Britain has blocked for more than two years. Mr Flynn said the Belgian presidency intended to put the directive on the agenda of its first social affairs council (probably on October 13). 'Failing agreement, it is a candidate for the first measure to go through under the protocol.' He is understood to have been seeking some signs of flexibility from Britain on works councils in exchange for concessions in other areas of EC social policy. Under the directive, companies employing more than 1,000 workers in more than one member state, and with more than 100 employees in at least two of them, would have to set up elected works councils, and consult them on jobs changes, new technology, investment and relocation plans. Though there is provision for workers and employers to make their own arrangements, the UK opposes making consultation obligatory. But because British companies in continental Europe would be among those most affected, even if only 11 states adopted the directive, the UK had appeared until now to be keeping its options open, negotiating clause by sub-clause on the measure.</p>

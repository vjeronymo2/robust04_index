Suryanarayana: "Pakistan Still Cool to </F> India's Proposals"]    [Text] Islamabad, Jan. 26--Pakistan today expressed  "disappointment" that India's latest proposals, aimed at taking  the bilateral process of dialogue forward, "do not address what  we (Pakistanis) regard as the fundamental and core problems in  Kashmir."    Outlining their "immediate reaction" to, and "preliminary  views" on these proposals, the Pakistan Foreign Secretary, Mr.  Shahryar M. Khan, told reporters here that India's "non-papers"  on as many as six separate issues "miss the point" at stake,  "beg the question" in focus or merely "address the peripheral"  aspects of the primary issues.    Making it clear that Pakistan would express its "considered"  comments on the proposals, Mr. Shahryar Khan said "none of these  non-papers, in our preliminary view, really goes to the depth of  the two crucial issues" regarding which Islamabad had recently  made its own proposals. These related to the modalities of  holding a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir and "visible steps to  stop (India's alleged) repression and human rights violations"  there.    It was within these Pakistani norms of judgment that Mr.  Shahryar Khan saw India's proposal on converting the line of  control in Jammu and Kashmir into a line of peace and  tranquillity as suggestion for "a kind of mechanical agreement  which would seem to be missing the point" that India was, in  mooting this formula, "virtually asking us to accept the status  quo on the line of control." Pakistan had already "indicated  that this is not acceptable to it," he said.    Real reason for tension: "The real reason for  tension along the line of control," which India was now seeking  to address, was its "repression" in Jammu and Kashmir, he said.  India should take cognisance of this linkage, he argued, but  indicated that Pakistan would, nevertheless, undertake "a  careful consideration" of the proposal regarding the line of  control and "react some time later."    On the proposal regarding a bilateral ban on the first  resort  to a nuclear-weapons strike against each other, he said: "This  proposal, in our view, begs the question. We are not nuclear  powers. To have an agreement not to strike first is a basic  contradiction in terms."    Dismissing this proposal as an exercise at window-dressing  and an essentially "peripheral" aspect of the relations between  the two countries, he said India was silent on crucial issues  such as "the control of weapons of mass destruction, or the  control of ballistic missiles being manufactured indigenously in  India or the control of fissile materials being produced." The  proposal "does not come to grips with the real issue of regional  non-proliferation," he said.    No contradiction: Asked why Pakistan should shoot  down the proposal for a bilateral ban on a nuclear first-strike,  especially in the context of Islamabad's concern regarding the  need to control India's production of fissile materials and  indigenous ballistic missiles, Mr. Shahryar Khan said: "There is  no contradiction." While, according to him, the proposal was  based on the assumption that Pakistan was in possession of  nuclear weapons, Islamabad's concern regarding "other issues  such as fissile materials and ballistic missiles" should be seen  in the context of "preventing (India) getting there," meaning  the acquisition of a nuclear arms delivery system.    To a question whether Islamabad's views against an  Indo-Pakistan ban on a nuclear first-strike did not reflect his  own assumption that both countries were not nuclear powers, he  said: "India has exploded a nuclear device (in 1974). Its  capability is a matter of conjecture."    At this point, the official spokesman, who was also present,  intervened to say that Pakistan had not exploded any nuclear  device and that India's proposal was founded on "a presumption"  that Pakistan was a nuclear power. What would be, however,  acceptable to Pakistan, the spokesman indicated, was any  proposal implying a unilateral commitment by India to desist  from a nuclear first-strike against them in these circumstances.    "Only an Update": Mr. Shahryar Khan, referring to  what he described as India's proposals on "technical issues"  relating to the Siachen, Sir Creek and Wular barrage questions,  said India had merely presented "an update on the state of  negotiations." Even in this sense, the "non-papers" in this  regard were not reflective of the "consensus" already reached by  the two sides. The "points at which the bilateral negotiations  were left off (on these issues) have not been accurately  reflected," he said. He also said Pakistan would study these and  other proposals seriously, despite Islamabad's view that India  might have presently tried to draw a red herring of proposals  across the tracks of the international community to "deflect and  divert attention" away from the core issue of Kashmir's  political status.    While Pakistan's initial reaction might suggest that it  finds  itself in no position to reject the proposals outright,  diplomatic sources here said the reason could be traced to  India's exercise at presenting Islamabad with draft agreements  in certain respects.    The sources draw attention to the proposals regarding peace  and tranquillity on the line of control. It is said that India's  prescription of maintaining peace "without prejudice to the  known positions of the two countries" on the fundamental Kashmir  issue can be seen as a draft accord which would not transform  the existing line of control into a de jure boundary  between the two countries.    On the proposals regarding confidence-building measures,  including a bilateral ban on a nuclear first-strike, the sources  said Pakistan's willingness to consider them, despite its  reservation regarding the nuclear-security status of India,  could perhaps be seen in the context of India's parallel  suggestions forbidding each side from launching a conventional  attack on the other's economic targets and population centres.    As for "the technical issues," India had suggested  "immediate  talks" on the Siachen issue in the light of its "specific"  ground details regarding disengagement and redeployment of  troops on either side. On the Sir Creek issue, it had outlined  the "principles" of a possible agreement, while the technical  draft of an agreement on Tulbul had also been presented.</p>

Also the purchasing  power of payments declined, the GUS Deputy President Roman  Sawinski said on Friday.    In comparison with 1992 the sales of industry went up by 6.2  per cent but were still lower than in 1989 and 1990. The  highest sales were recorded in the printing, transport,  electro-technological, electronic and clothing industries while  coal-mining, energy and leather industries noted a decrease in  production. The GUS data also indicate that generally companies  became more profitable by decreasing their costs.    In 1993 the housing construction suffered a serious  breakdown, it build 35 per cent flats less than in 1992.    The agriculture produce increased by 2.2 per cent and the  total area of uncultivated arable land decreased from 12 to 7  per cent. In the eighties only 1 per cent of arable land was  left fallow.    In 1993 prices went up by 35.3 per cent. Such a high  inflation rate was influenced mainly by hikes in gas, energy,  transport, telecommunications and fuel prices. Although the  purchasing power of payments declined by 1.8 per cent and of  pensions by 2.6 per cent, private consumption rose, which means  that poles did bigger shopping taking loans or diminishing their  savings.    Unemployment figures were still high in 1993 and in December  the unemployment rate amounted to 15.7 per cent. There were  2,889,600 unemployed people registered in job centres. The  highest unemployment rate was recorded in the northern provinces  of Koszalin (28.7 per cent), Suwalki (28.6 per cent), Olsztyn  (27.8 per cent), Slupsk (27.3 per cent) and Elblag (26.8 per  cent).    The budget deficit was lower than it was envisaged in the  budget law and amounted to 44 trillion zlotys (over 2 billion  U.S. dollars). The budget revenue (459 trillion zlotys) was  higher by 6 per cent than envisaged as the state got more money  from income tax and customs duties and the budget expenditure  (503 trillion zlotys) was lower by 2.3 per cent.    Imports exceeded exports by 3.5 billion dollars, which,  according to Sawinski, was connected with the increase of  imports by 47 per cent in comparison with 1992 before the  introduction of VAT [Value Added Tax]. In the same time exports  went up only by 24.1 per cent.</p>

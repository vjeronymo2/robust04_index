			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRENCH ROLL TENSE GAME OF STEELY CONCENTRATION;  </P> <P> RECREATION: THE GALLIC PASSION FOR PETANQUE, A FORM OF BOWLING PLAYED OUTDOORS  WITH THREE METAL BALLS, HAS BEEN IMPORTED TO WEST LOS ANGELES.  </P> <P> It's arguably the national pastime of France. Wherever there's a patch of flat  dirt -- in town squares, boulevard meridians, public parks, campgrounds --  petanque players gather.  </P> <P> All they're really doing is trying to toss or roll three steel balls as close  to a marker as possible. But that process brings out at least as much passion,  strategy, animated gesturing, spirited banter and joie de vivre among the  French as do politics or haute cuisine.  </P> <P> So it's no surprise that French "petanquers" living in Los Angeles have staked  out a patch of Southern California dirt to carry on their passion. They gather  every Saturday and occasional Sundays in Rancho Park in West Los Angeles,  transforming a niche of the park -- tucked between the archery range and a  maintenance shed -- into a parcel of their homeland.  </P> <P> But the mostly French contingent that gathers in Rancho Park isn't there to  indulge in nostalgia for their country. They're there to play petanque.  </P> <P> Pronounced "pay-tonk" (and also known as boules -- pronounced "bools"), the  game is similar to shuffleboard or horseshoes, and related to, but not the same  as, English lawn bowling or Italian boccie ball.  </P> <P> A small round marker called a cochonnet, or jack, is tossed six to 10 meters  away. Players then take turns tossing three steel boules as close as possible  to the jack. The object is to finish a round with all three of one's balls  closer to the jack than any of the opponents' balls. The game can be played  tete-a-tete, or with teams of two or three.  </P> <P> That may sound rather tame, but when strategy kicks in, the game shifts into  high gear. For example, in three-on-three petanque, each player assumes a  specialist role. The first player, called the pointeur, uses a deft backhand  toss to place his or her ball close to the cochonnet. Backspin prevents the  ball from rolling too far.  </P> <P> The second player, the milieur, may attempt to better the opponents' position  relative to the jack, or may elect to bump a boule out of scoring contention.  The third player is the tireur, the marksman, who specializes in bumping  opponents' balls.  </P> <P> The tireur's ability usually makes the difference in a petanque match. Even a  casual onlooker can marvel at the skill of a good tireur as he concentrates on  a target -- an enemy boule lying close to the jack -- then launches a toss high  in the air. Steel on steel produces a loud clink as the target boule ricochets  away. The tireur's own boule may plop right down in place of the other. Even if  it doesn't, he has cleared the way for his team to score.  </P> <P> At the end of a round, only the team with the boule closest to the jack scores.  A measurement may be required. If the two closest boules belong to the same  team, two points are scored, and if the three closest are of the same team, the  maximum three points are scored. A full game may go to 15, or any predetermined  number.  </P> <P> The petanquers who gather in Rancho Park are passionate about their sport, but  they are just as enthusiastic about sharing it. One needn't be daunted by all  the French banter that accompanies petanque matches. The players all shift  quickly into English when visitors inquire about the game.  </P> <P> Robert Breidenstein, president of the Los Angeles Petanque Club, says the group  is trying to encourage Americans to play, so as to further the growth of the  sport here.  </P> <P> "Sometimes on a Sunday when we have a tournament, we get pretty serious, but  Saturdays are for training, for fun," he said. "We always have extra balls and  we always welcome visitors."  </P> <P> Petanque clubs have formed in San Francisco and San Diego also, as well as in  most major cities across the country. According to Breidenstein, about 500  players are registered with the Federation of Petanque, USA, and hundreds more  play the game casually. Most are French, but the Los Angeles club also has  members from Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, Canada and Poland.  </P> <P> The representation reflects the worldwide growth of the sport, which was played  almost exclusively in the South of France until after World War II.  </P> <P> About 30 countries were represented at last month's world championship in  Spain, and prospects are good for petanque becoming a demonstration sport in  the 1992 Olympics.  </P> <P> American petanque gained international prestige during the world tournament; a  U.S. team that included two Los Angeles players finished 27th among 54 teams.  </P> <P> "Anyone can play petanque," says petanquer Max Le Grand. "That's part of the  beauty of the sport. Women, children, older people -- it's not strenuous, and  it's easy to learn."  </P> <P> "But there's a lot more going on than meets the eye," adds Pierre Agnesse, a  deadly tireur and member of the U.S. national team.  </P> <P> What clearly meets the eye of the petanque spectator is the camaraderie among  the players. The game is clearly as much social as it is sport.  </P> <P> At a recent Sunday tournament that included San Francisco's top team (which,  incidentally, only narrowly defeated a team of Los Angeles women), picnic  tables next to the courts were laden with pastries, baguette sandwiches and  beverages. Nearly as much eating and socializing went on as petanque playing.  And visitors were given a hearty bienvenue.  </P> <P>  (Members of the Los Angeles Petanque Club gather in Rancho Park, near Motor  Avenue and Pico Boulevard in West Los Angeles, every Saturday from about 10  a.m. until dark. The next Sunday tournament will be December 3.)  </P></p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Mobil signs Indian joint venture Mobil Petroleum, the US oil company, yesterday signed a joint venture with Indian Oil Corporation, India's state oil company, a move which sees Mobil returning to India after an absence of nearly 20 years. Like other large multinationals, Mobil quit India in the mid-1970s in response to the autarchic economic policies of the government of Mrs Indira Gandhi, the former prime minister. The liberalisation of the economy by Mr PB Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, has encouraged some of these multinationals to return, notably IBM and Coca-Cola of the US. The venture with Indian Oil Corporation covers the blending and distribution of Mobil-brand lubricant oils through Indian Oil's nationwide chain of petrol stations and other outlets, which have a market share of 57 per cent. The partners will invest in a Rs470m (Dollars 14m) blending plant to be built in the state of Haryana, near Delhi. It will go on stream in late 1996, producing 100,000 tonnes of oils a year. Mr RC Parker, chairman of Mobil Asia Pacific, Mobil's regional company, said the group was delighted to be back in India. Both Mobil and Indian Oil had much to offer and much to gain at a time of growth in the region.</p>

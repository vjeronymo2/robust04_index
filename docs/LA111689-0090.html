			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> IRONY ON PHILANTHROPY DAY  </P> <P> Friday is National Philanthropy Day, which will be celebrated in Orange County  with a breakfast honoring individuals and organizations that have helped those  in need. Top honor at the fourth annual celebration will go to Athalie Clarke  of Newport Beach, whose philanthropic activities have included the Arthritis  Foundation of Orange County, Chapman College and UC Irvine. Clarke will receive  the Spirit of Philanthropy award.  </P> <P> But this year there is an ironic twist to the celebration. Earlier this week,  United Way of Orange County said that it looks as if the county -- one of the  wealthiest in the nation -- will once again fall short of its annual goal for  charitable giving. It is a puzzling phenomenon in a politically conservative  county where, presumably, there would be broad support for President Bush's  "thousand points of light" -- the private support of programs once financed by  government.  </P> <P> This is the fifth consecutive year that the county will have failed to meet the  United Way goal, which was set at $20.5 million, a 10% increase over the 1988  pledge total of $18.6 million. United Way officials attributed part of this to  cutbacks in computer, communications and aerospace firms that now have fewer  employees to solicit for payroll deductions -- the agency's primary means of  raising money.  </P> <P> But these same officials say that they continue to be concerned that county  residents contribute less per capita than other similar areas in the country.  According to the 1988 Orange County Survey, residents gave just $8.34 per  capita to charity, a 30% decline from 1987. The national average is $18.79. The  United Way itself says that Orange County ranks last in per capita giving  compared to six economically similar areas of the country including Boston, San  Diego and Atlanta.  </P> <P> While United Way has had its problems in the past, it now appears to be on a  strong course. It is the major charitable organization in the nation. In Orange  County alone, it aids 121 organizations that help the poor, sick and disabled  as well as youth and other groups.  </P> <P> Charity, as they say, begins at home. Orange County should take better care of  its own.  </P></p>

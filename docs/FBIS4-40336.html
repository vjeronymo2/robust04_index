			<p>BFN     [Summary] Half of Kazakhstan's population is working in the  agro-industrial complex. They produce 40 percent of the  national income, which goes into our country's budget. This was  said at the general meeting of the Kazakhstan Academy of  Agricultural Science on 14 June. At the meeting, it was said  that there are more than 60 soil zones in the Republic that  differ from each other in nature and climatic characteristics.  This means that each of the zones should be managed differently  and use different kinds of cattle breeds and seeds.    The meeting also said that the Republic has a developed  high-fleeced sheep breeding program and created a new fat-failed  breed of sheep that can do well in harsh climatic conditions.  It was noted that the Academy of Agricultural Science is  suffering from a lack of financing. The gross share of budget  allocations for scientific backing of the agro-industrial  complex has decreased and comprises 15.5 percent against 18.9  percent last year. Over a period of five months agricultural  science has been granted only 34.8 million tenge. The meeting  raised some other issues related to financing agricultural  science.    Attending the meeting were Deputy Prime Minister [Sergey]  Kulagin and Sagadiyev, the president of the National Academy of  Agricultural Science. Also attending was Marat Ospanov, the  deputy chairman of the Supreme Council.</p>

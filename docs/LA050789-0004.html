			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> With Witness (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) Australian director Peter Weir made an  exceptionally potent American debut in this intelligent 1985 romantic thriller,  which found Harrison Ford's Philadelphia cop taking refuge in an Amish  community, where he and a beautiful young Amish woman (Kelly McGillis) find  themselves mutually attracted.  </P> <P> The Trial of the Incredible Hulk (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) brings back Bill Bixby  and Lou Ferrigno in a new TV movie reprise of their series. This time out  Bixby's research scientist, Dr. David Banner, is thrown in jail for a crime he  didn't commit.  </P> <P> Top Gun (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) is that wildly popular 1986 picture, a male  bonding adventure that's both mind-boggling and vacuous. Allegedly based on the  Navy's crack fighter pilot program at San Diego's Miramar Naval Base, it sucks  us into a high-tech world of multimillion-dollar aircraft and hell-for-leather  fliers. Tom Cruise is Maverick, an egotistical hotshot pilot; others involved  are Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards.  </P> <P> In the dreadful 1981 comedy, Modern Problems (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.),  that air traffic controller Chevy Chase develops telekinetic powers through  contact with nuclear waste is so grim as to be awe-inspiring in its sheer  inappropriateness as a source of humor.  </P> <P> The 1982 Fast Times at Ridgemont High (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) seems an  ambitious movie struggling against the formula dictum that teen-agers must  never have anything on their minds but sex. Even so there are many believable  young people in the film, and they are played by then-such terrific newcomers  as Jennifer Jason Leigh, Sean Penn and Judge Reinhold.  </P> <P> The new TV movie Murder by Moonlight (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a futuristic  outer space thriller, stars Brigitte Nielsen, Julian Sands and Gerald McRaney.  </P> <P> In The Money Pit (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), New Yorkers Tom Hanks and  Shelley Long succumb to the temptation of grabbing a million-dollar Long Island  fixer-upper for a mere $200,000. The stars of this 1986 comedy shine, but it  might have been funnier had the catastrophes of remodeling not been laid on  quite so thickly.  </P> <P> Blame It on Rio (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a misfired 1984 remake of  the French film "One Wild Moment" in which Michael Caine, who for once cannot  transcend his material, plays a middle-aged vacationer who winds up in an  affair with the teen-age daughter (Michelle Johnson) of his best friend (Joseph  Bologna).  </P> <P> Three Amigos (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), a very broad spoof of silent  movie making, requires a total ignorance of the era for the humor of this 1986  film to have a hope of seeming funny. The trio of inept 1916 stars -- Steve  Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short -- not surprisingly turn real-life heroes.  </P> <P> That multi-Oscar winner One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest returns on Channel 5  Thursday at 8 p.m., and The Heavenly Kid (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a  highly derivative and unfunny 1985 teen fantasy comedy that is entirely  skippable.  </P> <P> Amityville: The Evil Escapes (NBC Friday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie starring  Patty Duke as a mother confronted with a mysterious evil force threatening to  destroy her family.  </P> <P> Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart (Channel 28 Friday at 11:30 p.m.) evokes with  tenderness and humor the plight of a young Chinese-American woman (Laureen  Chew) trying to leave her mother (Kim Chew) in order to make a life of her own.  An endearing gem of a film.  </P> <P> Saturday evening offers a lineup of familiar fare: 9 to 5 (Channel 5 at 6  p.m.), On Golden Pond (Channel 5 at 8 p.m.), A Fistful of Dollars (Channel 13  at 10 p.m.) and Hitchcock's Sabotage (Channel 28 at 10 p.m.).  </P> <P> The ratings checks on movies in the TV log are provided by the Tribune TV Log  listings service.  </P></p>

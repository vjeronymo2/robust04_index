			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Nakajima acts on WHO row DR Hiroshi Nakajima, director-general of the World Health Organisation, has transferred a fellow Japanese from a key management post after a special audit showed WHO funds had been misused. The move, which comes just two weeks before WHO's 183 members vote on whether to confirm Dr Nakajima's appointment for a second five-year term, is clearly designed to defuse the simmering row over the circumstances surrounding Dr Nakajima's renomination last January. The special audit, carried out by Sir John Bourn, Britain's auditor-general found financial irregularities in five contracts approved by Dr Yugi Kawaguchi, who was director of planning in the UN agency. WHO denied his transfer to the new post of head of inter-agency affairs, was a demotion or a punishment.</p>

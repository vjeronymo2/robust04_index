After the latest slaughter in Sarajevo, nothing would be worse  for Western credibility than a fleeting burst of anger. Indeed,  it will be easy to stress that previous UN or NATO admonitions  to the belligerents remained devoid of any consequences.    This powerlessness in implementing decisions actually made  stems from Western disagreements on ways to bring the conflict  to an end as well as on the political objectives to pursue.  Should the standing threat of selective air strikes be carried  out? Military officials do not relish this solution because,  beyond the risks it implies for their men, they fear military  activism may only be a smoke screen for the inertia of  politicians.    For such strikes to be meaningful, they must be part of an  overall strategy which provide very clearly for a "second  strike," the one that may become necessary if the first one --  regardless of its degree of success on a technical level -- does  not bring the expected political result. In other words, the  international community must ask itself how far it is ready to  go and for what ends.    Objectives can range from putting an end to the shelling of  Sarajevo and lifting the siege of the city to achieving a  general ceasefire leading to renewed and serious negotiations;  the targets will then vary accordingly, as will the extent of  the resources used and the duration of the operation.    Until now, Western nations have disagreed on just about  anything, be it the importance of the conflict in the definition  of the post-Cold War world, the allocation of mutual  responsibilities, the solutions to be implemented, or even the  necessity to act. They tried to alleviate the situation through  means often courageous, sometimes hazardous, and perchance  effective from a humanitarian viewpoint, but which only  contained the pain as they could not cure it.    Some may deem it positive that the conflict has not  extended,  that foreign powers have not contributed, as they did before, to  a new Balkan war, that the European Union has somehow preserved  its unity, albeit at the cost of its credibility.    Can one stick contentedly with such modest objectives and  not  attempt to impose rules of good neighborly conduct to peoples  bent on mayhem? Even retreating to our ivory tower -- however  inglorious a proposition -- would be less of a disgrace than  useless swagger. However, if we believe action is the right  choice, then we must stop talking about what we will not do, and  then suit our action to our word.</p>

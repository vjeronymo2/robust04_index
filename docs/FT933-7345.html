			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Books: Doomed, but driven to confess - Anthony Curtis takes a look at the characters in William Trevor's stories WILLIAM TREVOR: THE COLLECTED STORIES Penguin Books Pounds 9.99, 1,261 pages EXCURSIONS IN THE REAL WORLD by William Trevor Hutchinson Pounds 16.99, 201 pages THERE IS a deep unease that comes from reading William Trevor's fiction. It causes one to be as glad to put down one of his novels or stories as one was to pick it up. The reason for this is that people in whom he is interested are doomed. There is no way out for them. None at all. Being an Irish Protestant, his fiction is not priest-ridden like that of Brian Moore, but that only makes the guilt from which his people suffer the more immovable. His characters long to confess their guilt. They do so not in the darkness and secrecy of the confessional, but out loud at a social gathering or at a party. Often to a total stranger. Inevitably such confessions tend to fall on ears that if not deaf are bewildered. The recipient of the confession becomes defensive, or in some other way hopelessly inadequate in response to the enormity of what is being uttered to him or her. He can give momentary sympathy, or some kind of practical help - like, say, the offer of another drink - to the sufferer; what it is beyond his power to do is to grant him any lasting cure or absolution. The appearance of William Trevor: The Collected Stories on September 2 reveals the ubiquitous presence of these guilt-haunted individuals right from the beginning. It was in the 1960s that Trevor's stories started to appear in places like The London Magazine and The Listener. His first book of stories, with its title-story The Day They Got Drunk On Cake, appeared in 1967, and Trevor was at once hailed by reviewers as a wizard in his handling of this difficult form. He rapidly emerged as the successor to Maugham and in Ireland to Sean O'Faolain. Doom was everywhere in his early tales. There was the ex-RAF-man, now a driving instructor whose pupil has crashed the car, drowning his sorrows over several pints with a former colleague ('The Introspections of JP Powers'); the elderly baby-sitter who finally becomes the baby ('In At The Birth'); the schoolboy who in 'A School Story' announces his intention to murder his father and step-mother. Most haunting of all was 'The Sins of Edward Tripp'. In this key story Edward T. is racked by guilt at having mercilessly teased his sister when they were children. Now in middle age they live together. Neither has married. Emily has her revenge on Edward by engulfing him in a compulsive fantasy; she insists that each of their neighbours has, one after another, been murdered. After each outburst Edward is forced to ring the neighbour's bell and show her the person in the flesh to stop Emily's raving. When Emily declares that Mrs Mayben has been killed 'in cold blood', Edward decides to liberate himself from this intolerable situation by confessing its root-cause to this woman when he enters her house. It does not work out like that at all and the scene in which to her growing horror Edward forces his confession upon the lady is typical of the agonisingly hilarious tragi-comedy that is Trevor's trademark. All these stories were England-based, as was Trevor when he wrote them. In the later stories, masterpieces such as 'Attracta' and 'Beyond The Pale', he returned to Ireland where he used his skill to reveal guilt not simply as the product of individual fantasy but as the stuff of history. Although Trevor has only rarely applied his gift for dialogue and incisive character-sketching to the stage play, he has adapted several of these later stories as plays for radio and television where they have proved extremely effective in performance. When he first began to experiment with the story-form Trevor was working in London as an advertising copy-writer. Hitherto he has been reticent about his own life but in Excursions in the Real World he breaks his silence about himself. He is highly entertaining about his days in Hill Street, W1 and its surrounding hostelries. There are tiny glimpses of colleagues who later ceased to write copy and became poets or critics like Peter Porter, Edward Lucie Smith, but the major portrait here in 'A Public House Man' is of one Marchant Smith, a great copy-writer in his day and Trevor's immediate boss. Trevor grew up in the 1930s in the seaside town of Youghal where his father was a bank clerk. He describes his early education among nuns as almost the only Protestant boy in the convent school; then less happily at Sandford Park and St Columba's in Dublin. The author of The Old Boys is charitable but penetrating about his earliest teachers. He suggests that frequent visits to the cinema made a more lasting impact on his mind than the formal instruction. The sketches dealing with his youth in Ireland and period in the London of the 1960s are more memorable than the later pieces on Venice, Stockholm, the Ticino, New York, San Francisco and the brief appreciations of Yeats, O'Casey, Beckett, Somerville and Ross. The overall mood is nonchalant, wry, reflective: the style of a born raconteur whose timing is just a little too perfect for his anecdotes to be completely spontaneous - but make no mistake, they remain utterly riveting.</p>

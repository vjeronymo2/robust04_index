			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "bj": "Martinez Set Free; Cuban Charge d'Affairs </F> on Yesterday's Demonstration"]    [Text] Bratislava--"This is a needless politicization and  ideologization of the problem, which cannot have a positive  influence on bilateral relations between Slovakia and Cuba,"  Juan Sanchez Monroe, charge d'affairs at the Cuban Embassy in  the Slovak Republic, told a news conference about yesterday's  demonstration for the release from prison of dissident Joel  Duenas Martinez, which was organized by the Bratislava branch of  Amnesty International. Out of respect for the Slovak public and  following a personal conversation with Marta Simeckova, the  Bratislava representative of Amnesty International, J.S. Monroe,  pledged already last year that he would personally plead for the  revision of the verdict. This happened in March of this year  and in April Martinez was released from prison. "Cuba did this  as a friendly gesture toward the Slovak Republic," J.S. Monroe  said. That is why he considers yesterday's demonstration, as  well as the previous March demonstration, inappropriate  interference in the Slovak-Cuban dialogue.</p>

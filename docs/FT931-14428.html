			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Ministers see dentist pay review OPTIONS ON how dentists should be paid, ranging from tinkering with the much-criticised system to a radical restructuring of the dental health service, were presented to ministers yesterday. The review of dentists' remuneration, which was launched by the government last July to defuse a crisis that led to threats to leave the health service and a vote to stop taking new NHS patients, makes no recommendations but sets out possible improvements. Every dentist will receive a copy of the report and there will be a long consultation before ministers decide how to proceed. It appears that the setting up of the review, which was chaired by Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, former head of the Civil Service in Northern Ireland, has helped to defuse the dispute between dentists and the government. Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said after receiving the report yesterday that in the past six months there had been a net loss of only 15 dentists in the health service. 'There was considerable unhappiness (at the cut in fees), but those who suggested a lot of dentists would behave irresponsibly have been proved wrong,' he said. The review has also underlined the lack of consensus within the dental profession and outside on what should be done to upgrade the service and make it more cost effective. The only agreement seems to be that the status quo is unsatisfactory. The options presented by Sir Kenneth include relatively minor changes to the complex system, under which the country's 18,000 dentists are paid in the form of reimbursement for practice expenses, fees for specific treatment, and bulk payments for the number of patients signed up. Radical reforms might include limiting the treatment available under the health service, or further restricting those eligible for free or subsidised treatment. The report favours maintaining free treatment for children, but not necessarily for all pregnant women. The report says that 'a greater concentration of available resources on providing a smaller number of treatments could (subject to proper controls) lead to a desirable shift in emphasis from quantity to quality'.

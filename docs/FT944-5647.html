			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Quantum leaps The rebound in profits at Quantum Chemical Corporation has proved stronger than Hanson anticipated when it made the acquisition last year. After appearing to lose its touch with other recent transactions, Hanson has once again timed a deal to perfection. The purchase looks set to sustain annual earnings growth for the group at well over 20 per cent for the next two years. The problem is that the Quantum deal has brought not just short-term dynamism to Hanson's earnings. It has also turned Hanson into a more cyclical company than it was. Profits which are rising sharply will one day drop just as rapidly, if not more so. This fear has driven Hanson's shares down by 17 per cent against the market in the past year, forcing the yield to a significant premium. If earnings growth enabled Hanson to pay higher dividend increases than the market, the historic yield of more than 6 per cent would be a strong signal to buy the shares. But earnings growth is unlikely to prove sustainable beyond a peak in two to three years' time. Moreover, post-tax operating cash-flow was only Pounds 323m - less than the dividend payment of Pounds 568m. The second half showed an improvement over the first and that is set to continue. But it is unlikely to do so strongly enough to allow Hanson to increase its dividends aggressively at the same time as rebuilding cover. Hanson's shares have outperformed over the last month and were resilient yesterday as the market fell. This is appropriate, given the group's success with Quantum. But a more far-reaching re-rating will be hard to achieve.</p>

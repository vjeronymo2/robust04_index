			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov for TASS] </F>   [Text] Simferopol, 23 May (TASS) -- The Crimean militia has  been ordered to stay in the barracks in connection with the  latest developments on the peninsula, particularly the Ukrainian  national guard's preparations for action. The number of the  national guards in Simferopol has increased by more than five  times lately to reach 2,000 men.    According to the Crimean Minister of Internal Affairs  Valeriy  Kuznetsov, the situation in the Republic is under control and  the law enforcement agencies are taking tough measures to  maintain public order.    Kuznetsov rejected the statement of the press service of the  Ukrainian Interior Ministry, which alleged that the former  Interior Ministry Aleksandr Plyuta had been unlawfully dismissed  from his post and the criminal situation in the Crimea has  aggravated as a result.    Valeriy Kuznetsov stressed that Plyuta had tendered his  resignation himself, asking not to be considered for a post in  the new Crimean Government. The parliament met his request.</p>

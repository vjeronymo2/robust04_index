			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: Bridge Oil moves back into the black BRIDGE OIL, the Sydney-based resources group, returned to the black in 1991, shrugging off the previous year's big write-down of the troubled Aredor diamond venture in West Africa. The company turned a ADollars 81.3m net loss into a ADollars 28.7m (USDollars 21.50m) net profit in the year, and is resuming its dividend with a 2 cents a share payout. The result was achieved despite a 4 per cent fall in sales to ADollars 195.8m from ADollars 204.6m. The directors said 60 per cent of the company's revenue was now derived from the US and the decline reflected lower US gas prices. 'During the year, the company substantially replaced Australian production with new reserves,' they said. '(The company) anticipates achieving the same result in the current financial year notwithstanding the continued high production. 'There remains a degree of uncertainty as regards product prices. The present level of product prices in real terms is approximately equal to those ruling in 1974. 'Average product prices are presently below what was achieved in the previous year, and therefore unless there is an improvement, the result achieved in the 1991 year will be difficult to maintain.' Directors said the Aredor diamond project has achieved a positive cash flow, but incurred losses of ADollars 1.5m. Bridge paid back borrowings of ADollars 52m in the year, cutting net interest-bearing debt to ADollars 218m. This helped to reduce interest expenses to ADollars 23.5m from ADollars 29.3m.</p>

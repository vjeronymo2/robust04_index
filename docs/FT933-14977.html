			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Sun's 5p price cut launches tabloid war MR RUPERT MURDOCH last night launched a bitter tabloid circulation war as his main popular newspaper, The Sun, announced it was cutting its price by 5p to 20p. The move, to last through the summer, is designed to boost flagging popular newspaper sales in the difficult summer market and put pressure on The Sun's main rivals, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Star. Mr David Banks, editor of the Daily Mirror last night unveiled his response as soon as he was sure the Sun presses had begun to roll for the first edition. For today only the Daily Mirror is cutting its price to 10p to allow potential readers to sample the paper. 'I hope this highlights the lunacy and stupidity of The Sun's cut-price tactics,' Mr Banks said. The paper will return to its normal cover price of 27p tomorrow. Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of Mirror Group Newspapers, described The Sun's price cut as 'the act of a desperate man with no other cards to play but cost-cutting'. He said the Daily Mirror would be promoted as a quality popular daily that was worth paying for. Mr Banks added that The Sun had still 'a long way to fall in price before it found its true level'. The Sun's price experiment, which the editor, Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, described yesterday as 'a recession beater', followed market research carried out at Martin's newsagents in areas such as Southampton and Milton Keynes. A local 5p price cut advertised by posters in the newsagents resulted in an 8 per cent increase in sales. Mr Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, who personally authorised the price cut on Friday, is taking a gamble that a dramatic price cut and the accompanying publicity will lure back some of the lost regular readers. Sales of the mass circulation dailies have been in decline for some time. Between January and June, for example, The Sun suffered a 2.6 per cent drop. The Daily Mirror fared better but sales still fell 1.76 per cent. The results of The Sun's price promotion will be assessed in mid-September when a decision will be taken on whether or not to return to 25p. Mr MacKenzie, who is appearing in a television campaign to promote the price cut, said the paper would cut its price to 15p if anyone tried to match the first reduction.</p>

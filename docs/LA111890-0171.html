			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OREGON WINS BATTLE OF FIELD GOALS  </P> <P> Gregg McCallum kicked two field goals and the Oregon defense made repeated big  plays in the final quarter as the heavily favored Ducks struggled to a 6-3  victory over Oregon State Saturday in the annual Civil War football game.  </P> <P> Oregon, whose offense sputtered in the absence of quarterback Bill Musgrave,  finished the regular season at 4-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference and 8-3  overall.  </P> <P> The Ducks' defense held Oregon State to 27 yards rushing.  </P> <P> The Ducks, who are headed for the Freedom Bowl, won eight games in the regular  season for the first time since 1959. But the last one was anything but easy.  </P> <P> The Beavers, whose 1-10 record was their worst since 1981, were 20 1/2-point  underdogs. But they were tied 3-3 at halftime and missed two serious scoring  threats in the second half. Oregon State was 1-6 in the Pac-10.  </P> <P> Junior Bob Brothers took over for Musgrave at quarterback for Oregon.  </P></p>

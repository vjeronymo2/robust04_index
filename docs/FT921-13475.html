			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Traditional Tory lives to fight another day - Searching for the true character of Northern Ireland secretary Peter Brooke MR PETER Brooke, who offered to resign yesterday as Northern Ireland secretary, is not a politician at ease with the late 20th century. He is a traditional Tory, fascinated with history, who bumbles poetry and witticisms to journalists and politicians. He is polite, honest - and sometimes recklessly honourable. For a time last year, as he announced the first 'round-table' talks in the province for 15 years, he won praise from all sides - including those Unionist MPs who this week triggered his offer. It was a rare high point in 13 years of drift in Northern Ireland under Tory rule. His patience and courtesy have earned him the respect necessary to bring Northern Ireland's recalcitrant political leaders back into the democratic fold. Such integrity lay behind yesterday's announcement. Mr Brooke felt the remaining allegiances he could command among the province's politicians had been undermined. But his offer also suggests a pent-up frustration - over his failure in the six months to restart his talks and, possibly, over his relationship with Mr Major. Officials and colleagues on all sides of the Chamber were taken aback by his announcement. Those Unionists who were there, and not at the funerals of construction workers killed by the IRA on Friday, appeared taken aback by the effect of their jibes. 'We could paper the offices with Unionist demands for the secretary of state to resign,' one official said at the weekend. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, is not backward in calling for ministerial scalps. Frustration among Northern Ireland secretaries is hardly surprising. The least-envied of all Cabinet posts brings oppressive round-the-clock security, universal cynicism, and the prospect only of being immersed in the province's agonisingly languid politics and endless security crises. In spite of his achievements, Mr Brooke has never been immune to the pressures. He finds it difficult to knock heads together. During last summer's 'round-table' talks he was unable to force the pace when deliberations were bogged down for seven weeks of procedural arrangements. Participants complained of waiting for long periods as Mr Brooke pondered where to go next. He is not, colleagues say, a great thinker. He can be moody. There is no 'Brooke vision' on Northern Ireland. He does not appear to get on automatically with Mr Major. Aristocratic mannerisms - his ancestral home was in County Cavan, now in the Irish Republic - jar with the prime minister's classless politics. Mr Brooke, who supported Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, during the 1990 Conservative party leadership election, might well have been happier as a Tory politician of the Victorian era. He enjoys the cultural distractions of his job - taking an academic interest in the events leading up the 1920s partition of Ireland - but not the unrelenting pressure. So far, Mr Major has had little input into Conservative policy on Northern Ireland, perhaps adding to Mr Brooke's sense of discontent. Mr Brooke has made serious mistakes before. Shortly after becoming secretary of state, he gave an interview in which he appeared to envisage eventual talks with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. Beforehand he had an unhappy period as Tory party chairman when he oversaw the Conservative party's defeat in the 1989 European elections. His posting to the Northern Ireland office by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, was seen as a sideways step. Mr Brooke has weathered past storms but last night his position appeared to have been weakened considerably. It is difficult to see how he can last much beyond the general election. But a ministerial resignation so close to a general election would have been highly damaging. It appears evident that Mr Major decided that, for now at least, he could not manage without him.</p>

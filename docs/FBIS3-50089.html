			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by </F> Stanislaw Cwik and Dariusz Szymczycha; place and date not given:  "Let Us Not Argue; Let Us Solve Problems"]    [Text] [TRYBUNA] You have come back from Prague. We did not  expect anything momentous from that meeting. The Partnership for  Peace [PFP] was supposed to be an anteroom to NATO, and it  remains that way. Your idea of a Partnership for Development was  received as a novelty. Do you see any obstacles to economic and  scientific cooperation with Western countries?    [Pawlak] Poland's external security consists of a number of  factors. One of the most important is economic and social  stability. During the recent rather frequent visits of U.S. and  EU [European Union] representatives in Poland, we said that,  although the PFP may lead us toward NATO, it does not guarantee  that we will join it. In a situation where there are so many  obstacles to NATO entry, economic efficiency is becoming a major  guarantee for our future.    That is why we are so worried about our unstable economic  cooperation with the West. Despite guarantees stemming from  accords and agreements, the West does not always treat us as an  equal partner. That is the reason behind the Partnership for  Development idea, especially economic development. This idea was  proposed during the consultations that preceded the NATO summit.  It found an echo in President Clinton's remark during the NATO  summit about the need to open the U.S. and EU markets more  widely to products from Central Europe.    [TRYBUNA] So the Partnership for Development could mean a  new  stage in economic development?    [Pawlak] Yes. The Uruguay round of talks ended in December.  It brought new solutions regarding customs tariffs, but it also  created confusion regarding nontariff issues. In fact, it  created new restrictions to Polish trade on the U.S. and Western  markets. How are we to overcome them? By standardizing our  products and raising their quality. We can also follow the  West's example and impose equalizing levies on the prices of  some Polish exports and harsh hygienic requirements regarding  certain Polish imports.    Such a solution may have a bearing on the development of  Poland and the entire region.    [TRYBUNA] But there is nothing momentous about this. It is  merely imitation.    [Pawlak] Yes, but it is imitation of momentous significance.  No Polish government used such methods before.    We want a multifaceted partnership. Therefore we are trying  to open up economic cooperation in all directions. Our  businessmen must perform reconnaissance immediately and not  leave it until our trade partners have failed us.    [TRYBUNA] So one can say that this is the beginning of the  end of the Visegrad Group?    [Pawlak] During the prime ministerial talks in Prague, we  considered a way of expanding the Visegrad formula and  converting it from a political body into an economic one.  Perhaps we need a G-4 group, concentrating on creating a free  trade zone and relaxing trade conditions. During the Prague  talks, we suggested a practical dimension to Visegrad  cooperation.    [TRYBUNA] Prime Minister, can Poland be a partner in the  Partnership for Development? Look at the state of Polish  agriculture. It is not impressive. How do you intend to change  Polish agriculture and drag it to its feet again?    [Pawlak] I do not share your harsh opinion on the subject of  Polish agriculture. Polish agriculture's capabilities are  underestimated.    If one looks at production organization and technology and  the variety of goods, one will see that our agriculture could  play a larger role in the economy that is the case at present.  It can also make a greater contribution to international trade.  These reserves have not been used until now because not all of  the economic mechanisms have been adapted to our agriculture. We  also discussed this in Prague.    Our agricultural production is often cheaper than in  developed countries so we can enter world markets without  additional costs--that is, without burdening the budget. An  increase in agricultural exports is hampered not so much by  market barriers as by administrative restrictions in the form of  special fees whose only purpose is to bar our products to  foreign markets.    Another problem of Polish agriculture is how to make use of  excess produce. We are seeking ways of increasing the production  of industrial raw materials, which might then be applied to  other sectors of the economy.    [TRYBUNA] But, during the election campaign and even before  it, the Polish Peasant Party accused the Solidarity governments  of lacking an agricultural policy. If things were considered bad  under Solidarity, why should they be considered good today?    [Pawlak] It is the possibilities that are good today, not  the  actual state of things. Apart from that, we spoke of the absence  of not only an agricultural policy, but also an industrial and  social one.    The Polish countryside has its specific nature. There are  people who see only faults in it. But we also see positive  features. After all, in some developed countries, there is now a  departure from excessive concentration in urban planning, from  shutting people up in concrete apartment blocks. The trend is  now in favor of distributing the population more loosely. Modern  science permits the location of very modern firms at a  considerable distance from the capital.    So when people complain that the Polish countryside is  overpopulated, we reply that rural inhabitants are  self-sufficient and do not burden the budget. Is it not better  to create employment for them where they live, rather than move  them to urban areas? Which solution is more profitable and less  costly in social terms?    We should not apply a doctrine that calls for a fixed rural  population level. We must avail ourselves of any solution that  opens up prospects. I think that is the way we should view the  Polish countryside.    [TRYBUNA] You already have several months' experience as  the prime minister of a coalition government. In the beginning,  you said the government would last four years. Are you still so  optimistic?    [Pawlak] Yes, I think we will survive.    [TRYBUNA] We are asking because there are already strikes,  and there has been an announcement about demonstrations and a  general strike.    [Pawlak] Indeed, we are not in for an easy time. We have  drafted a budget that is dictated by the reality that we have  inherited. We have also "ironed out" many matters. But the media  enjoy concentrating on difficulties, especially on announced  price hikes, quite forgetting that these difficulties and price  hikes are the consequences of the activity of previous  governments and that my government is trying to help those in  the worst material situation. Generally, we have altered the  philosophy behind wages policy in the public sector, and we are  raising minimum pensions and offering incentives in the  agricultural sector to those who are energetic and produce  high-quality goods. The media somehow do not want to notice any  of this.    I want to be properly understood. I do not complain if  people  indicate dangers, even if they exaggerate. But I would prefer it  if they suggested solutions and new possibilities.    Of course, there may be protests and demonstrations, but we  no longer have a situation where one single trade union  determines our future. The population now determines its own  future in elections. For example, if the present government and  coalition are incapable of solving basic problems, they will  lose the next elections. I am counting on an improvement to the  situation by the time the next elections take place. This is not  an easy task, but I am counting on a high level of commitment  not by just state institutions but also by individuals--for  example, those who lay down fiscal policy.    [TRYBUNA] Do you not regret the fact that you did not  commence your tenure by exposing the state of the Polish economy  you inherited and drawing up a report? Criticism of the  government is frequently based on the remarks of Mrs. Suchocka  and Messrs. Rokita and Syryjczyk.    [Pawlak] We did produce a report but only for our own  internal purposes, and there is no need to reveal all of the  features of the Polish economy to the public. But we did present  many of these features when we drew up our budget--I did so in  my 29 December speech and so did Deputy Prime Minister  Borowski--but we were more concerned with convincing everyone  that, despite all of these difficulties, it is possible to halt  the negative phenomena and move forwards.    Perhaps we are not making satisfactory progress in every  single sphere. There is no doubt that a social debate or  tripartite pact between the government, employers, and employees  would help explain the current situation and permit better  prospects. I fear that the government might not be sufficiently  energetic in this regard.    [TRYBUNA] The government's personnel policy is being  criticized. What principles of personnel policy do you profess?    [Pawlak] I have the dubious honor of being criticized from  various quarters. Some people criticize me for making any  personnel changes whatsoever, and others do so because I  tolerate the presence of officials whose views differ from the  government's.    I think it is important to use the knowledge and experience  of various people. That often provides good results. The  important thing is to concentrate on tasks. Poland has lost too  many people since the war. There are times when it is worth  viewing personnel matters from a wider angle and not just from a  political one.    As far as the administration is concerned, personnel changes  there should come as no surprise. It is difficult to expect  people to be loyal to a government they cannot stand. On the  other hand, one cannot tolerate a situation where everyone  pursues his own policy. That is why changes are necessary.    [TRYBUNA] How much independence do you have in the making of  personnel decisions?    [Pawlak] This is a coalition government, which means that we  try to seek a joint solution to issues regarding the functioning  of the coalition. But certain personnel issues are my sole  responsibility. That depends on the situation and the case at  hand.    I can say that, despite the variety of situations,  cooperation between the coalition partners has generally been  good. Even if there are disputes, they provide conclusions. It  does not matter if the media try to inflame moods and make it  look as if there is a coalition crisis. If I were not in the  government, I would enjoy reading such things myself. But the  result of the 19 September election was clear inasmuch as it  showed the coalition partners what the electorate wants.  Therefore, we should concentrate on solving problems and not  invent reasons to argue.    [TRYBUNA] So the coalition will last four years?    [Pawlak] That depends on the relationships between the  coalition groups and on the situation within each group. I count  on them to appreciate the opportunity that has arisen in Poland.  Inside Poland we can decide on most issues to the advantage of  everyone. Our predecessors tended to forget that the reforms are  meant to serve the people and not to further the interests of a  group of visionaries or idealists who want to reform the world  but have forgotten who they are working for.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Labour steps back to the good-old bad-old days: Ivo Dawnay says the party is suffering from a bout of recrimination and self-pity prematurely hailed as chief architect of an historic Labour victory - found himself labelled yesterday into a creature of the 'union barons', a beneficiary of a conspiracy and a stooge of the party establishment. In the meantime, the election was not lost by Labour, but, according to its outgoing leader, won by the Tory tabloid press. Only one thing, as they say in the lager ads, can do this: a Labour election disaster and the onset of a party leadership contest. Nobody can deny a party's right to a little recrimination and self-pity in defeat; but then nobody exhibits it so publicly and with such gothic hyperbole and suicidal skill as Labour. Yesterday it was like old times. The day began with the claims of Mr Colin Byrne - until last year Labour's chief press officer - in a letter to The Guardian. Mr Byrne charged that Mr Smith had 'cost the party dear' with his tax plans and sat on his hands through all the tough decision-making of the Kinnock years. Unnamed conspirators, he added, 'had been manouvering (sic) John Smith into position to walk into the leadership should Labour lose and orchestrated the ruthless undermining and behind-the-hand rubbishing of perceived rivals in a future contest'. In other words, over all these years, when people like Mr Byrne were insisting all was sweetness and light in the Labour team, it had in fact been business as usual. Much of this stems from Mr Neil Kinnock's now infamous dinner with journalists at Luigi's restaurant, Covent Garden, in January. Some in the Kinnock camp claim Mr Smith's office then briefed against the leader, contradicting his suggestion that higher tax and National Insurance contributions might be 'phased-in'. In this particular demonology, therefore, it is only a small (if simplistic) leap for the fanatically loyal to claim that it was Mr Smith's intransigence on tax that lost Labour the election. The truth is probably less conspiratorial. Mr Smith was indeed widely believed to have been irritated by his leader's dinnertime indiscretions, as he wished to keep back the option of phasing in tax rises should it be needed. But to suggest this was all part of an elaborate plot aimed at engineering Mr Smith a smooth passage to the Labour leadership is laughable. Hearing Mr Byrne inveigh against 'spin-doctors' in his lunchtime interviews yesterday caused a good deal of mirth in the Commons' press gallery. As Labour's chief press officer for three years under the communications directorship of Mr Peter Mandelson, Mr Byrne was himself - arguably quite properly - a professional interpreter of events to the media. The second charge against the Smith camp - that it is steamrollering the shadow chancellor into the leadership - is also only half the story. After all, it is Mr Kinnock's determination to go that is pressing a quick decision - although it must be admitted that this is not to Mr Smith's disadvantage. As for the role of the 'union barons' in the election, it will be the same in June or July as it will be in October. There is also an irony in the outrage among some of Labour's best known leftwingers - some of whom worked hard to get the unions the biggest possible say in leadership elections at the expense of MPs and constituency parties - that they intend to exercise that right. Is Labour back in the days of fierce ideological schism? It should not be, yet it is in danger of becoming so. The differences between Mr Bryan Gould and Mr Smith are complex, but they defy the simple categories of left versus right. There are distinct differences on attitudes to Europe and the economy. But the key to Mr Gould's campaign is going to be putting a case for a new appeal and a fresh style, aimed at attracting the southern middle-class that Labour so signally failed to win over last week. His implicit argument in a weekend interview was that the shadow chancellor had underestimated the poor reaction to his tax plans among the 'aspiring' classes and that he lacked the 'zeal and the passion' needed to woo the public away from 'pocket-book issues'. Some in the party, however, seem determined to try to transform Mr Gould into the left's candidate and to portray the more traditional Mr Smith as an advocate of a no longer valid 'steady-as-she-goes' policy. Mr Ken Livingstone, the MP for Brent East, was yesterday among several leftwingers who argued that the rightwing shadow chancellor had been too tough on middle-income taxpayers. What is clear is that before the election is held, Mr Smith will have to fill in the blank sections of his ideological curriculum vitae to counter the 'lack of vision' charges. So far Mr Smith is known, almost exclusively, for his cautious bank-manager style. In some respects it is his misfortune that what now looks more than likely to be a foreshortened leadership contest will leave him almost inevitably vulnerable to the accusation that he has been elected by a discredited system. His only plausible response to that is to follow Mr Gould's lead and promise to accelerate changes in the party constitution to ensure that future elections are conducted on the basis of one member, one vote. Meanwhile, attention in Westminster has turned to the race for the deputy leadership, which might be a dress rehearsal for the next leadership battle. The decision by Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, not to run has mystified some of her supporters. With the advantages of being a woman, English and leftwing, she is the ideal complement to Scottish Mr Smith and may be persuaded to change her mind. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, is thought certain to run, as may either or both Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair, respectively the trade and industry and employment spokesmen - and dubbed by the acerbic Mr Prescott as the 'beautiful people'. With official declarations expected to begin tomorrow, the triumphant Tories  -now basking in their election victory - are anticipating a highly enjoyable summer. Observer, Page 19</p>

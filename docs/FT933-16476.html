			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Greater advocacy rights rejected THE LORD Chancellor's advisory committee yesterday rejected the Law Society's latest application for extended advocacy rights for solicitors. It said additional safeguards were needed before solicitors employed in commerce and industry, government and the Crown Prosecution Service could be allowed in the higher courts. The committee, chaired by Lord Griffiths, a law lord, has advised Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, that there are no objections to solicitors in private practice being allowed to appear in the higher courts. But changes are needed to the 1990 Courts and Legal Services Act before lawyers working for the CPS and the Government Legal Service are given wider audience rights. The committee said there needed to be a limit on the amount of work CPS lawyers were allowed to do in the Crown Court. The Law Society's application would allow the CPS and the GLS to do all their higher court advocacy in-house. The committee said that was unacceptable.</p>

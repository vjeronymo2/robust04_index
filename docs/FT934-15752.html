			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Taking risks on futures - The Speculator WHEN actor Eddie Murphy stepped into a futures dealing pit to became a millionaire in the film Trading Places, he seemed to be at the sharp end of a modern and sophisticated financial instrument. In fact, the first futures contracts are said to have been sold by Japanese rice farmers in the 16th century. The first organised futures fund was established in the US, and it is there that the market is most developed. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a fixed quantity of a certain commodity, currency or security for delivery at a specified date at a fixed price. The system was devised to protect farmers against volatility in commodity prices. The farmer would agree to sell a proportion of his crop at a fixed price on a fixed date. The consumer also wanted to know the price he would have to pay once the crop was harvested so it was in his interests, too, to fix a price. The futures market could also be used to hedge risk. Everyone is familiar with the concept of hedging against inflation by investing in equities or bonds to protect capital against a rise in inflation. Liquidity in futures markets is provided by speculators who, in order to try to make a profit, are willing to take on the risk of those who are hedging. One reason speculators are attracted to futures is that they need to provide only a fraction of the money needed to buy the contract. Say a speculator pledges to buy coffee at Dollars 50 a ton in six months; he may only need to put up only Dollars 5 initially. If the price of coffee doubles during that period, he can sell the contract before delivery for Dollars 100 and get the full benefit of the rise. So, he will have made Dollars 50 for an outlay of only Dollars 5. Although the price of the contract has only doubled, he has profited from a tenfold increase. This process is known as margin trading and has earned futures its reputation for risk because, if the price had moved against him, he could have lost many times his original stake. Futures contracts today are often for hundreds of thousands of dollars or pounds but private investors can enter the market for considerably less through a futures fund. The minimum investment will usually be around Dollars 5,000-10,000. A fund invests in a range of futures - mostly financial which, in the UK, are traded on the London International Financial Futures Exchange. Given the risk, why should anyone want to invest in futures? Despite their volatile image, futures funds can be used to lessen risk because some futures do not necessarily move in line with other markets. 'Futures tend to show low correlation with equity and bond markets,' says Nicola Meaden, managing director of TASS, a London-based information and research house which has developed an index to monitor the performance of funds. 'They can, therefore, be used to reduce risk by increasing diversity in a portfolio.' Peter Swete, chairman of Sabre Fund managers - a UK-based futures manager which is 25 per cent owned by Henderson - adds: 'People buy us as they would an emerging markets fund or property. We can also provide high leverage and high risk if that is what the investor wants.' In order to meet investors' anxieties over risk, the market has tried to expand by constructing 'guaranteed' futures funds. These promise to return capital at the end of a specified period (usually five years) while holding out the prospect for profits during that period. Most non-US futures funds are based offshore. It was not until 1991 that the Securities and Investments Board, the chief regulator for the financial services industry in the UK, allowed unit trusts to invest in futures and options. The SIB authorised two types of fund: unleveraged futures and options funds (Fofs) and leveraged funds (Gfofs). Guaranteed funds are not yet permitted onshore. Next week: the different types of futures funds.</p>

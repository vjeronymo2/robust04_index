			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / National Savings receipts decrease National Savings' contribution to government coffers fell again last month, Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes. The contribution was a net Pounds 373m, with accrued interest accounting for another Pounds 181m. March's receipts were Pounds 481m plus accrued interest of Pounds 116m, which themselves were a fall on February's Pounds 617m plus Pounds 158m. Figures for April from building societies and unit trusts - National Savings' keenest competitors - have not yet been released but societies have been fighting a steady net outflow of funds since November. The new-found fondness by private investors for equity investment against a background of low interest rates helped sales of unit trusts to a record month in March. National Savings aimed to increase its intake and to assuage the fears of the elderly, who are dependent on their savings for income, by launching the Pensioners Bond, for those aged 65 and above, in January. The bond pays an annual fixed rate of 7 per cent gross for five years. It was the best-selling National Savings product in March and April. April's contribution was Pounds 236m. Premium Bonds were the next best-selling product last month at Pounds 176m. Since February, sales have been boosted by the first Pounds 1m prize draw. That took place last month. Total gross sales of all National Savings products in April amounted to Pounds 1.09bn with repayments of Pounds 721m.</p>

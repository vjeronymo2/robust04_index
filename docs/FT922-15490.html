			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Ratings lowered at four banks in Japan MOODY'S, the US credit rating agency, yesterday lowered ratings of four Japanese banks. The move comes at a time when the balance of bad loans is increasing sharply at Japanese financial institutions. Their problems are traced back to the late 1980s, when loose credit controls allowed banks to lend to land and stock speculators. Increasing concern over deteriorating asset quality at the banks has led to banking shares being sold off heavily in recent weeks. Long and short-term ratings of Mitsui Trust and Banking were lowered to A3 and P-2 respectively. Moody's said the downgrading reflected concerns over Mitsui Trust's long-term profitability. Mitsui Trust is currently involved in the restructuring of troubled real estate-related companies. Moody's also cited the bank's exposure to non-bank financial institutions as a significant concern. Moody's lowered Tokai Bank's long-term credit ratings from Aa3 to A1. It said Tokai's commitment to aid Central Finance, a leasing affiliate which was involved in a series of loan scandals, would squeeze the bank's profits. The Bank of Tokyo saw its long-term ratings lowered from Aa2 to Aa3 on concerns over deterioration of domestic and overseas assets, and expectations of a profits squeeze due to financial deregulation. Although the bank has little direct exposure to the domestic property sector, Moody's said loans made to real estate and non-bank financial institutions through affiliates were putting pressure on the bank's asset quality. The credit agency lowered the short-term credit rating for Hokuriku Bank, a regional bank, to P-2. Hokuriku is a leading creditor of Nanatomi, the property company which filed for bankruptcy last year with debts totalling Y300bn (Dollars 2.3bn).</p>

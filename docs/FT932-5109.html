			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Burford rights to fund purchase BURFORD Holdings yesterday joined the ranks of property companies raising money from their shareholders when it announced a Pounds 41.9m rights issue to help pay for a Pounds 68.2m property acquisition. Burford is buying a portfolio of 11 properties from Provident Mutual, which includes office buildings in Glasgow, Birmingham, Leeds, Leicester, Exeter and Mayfair and some industrial and retail warehousing property. Some 69.6m shares will be issued on a 3-for-5 basis at 62p a share. Burford's share price yesterday rose from 74p to 75 1/2 p. The issue has been underwritten by BZW. The remaining funds needed for the acquisition will be financed by a new Pounds 44m banking facility from Societe Generale. Burford, which is regarded by the City as one of the best managed small companies in the sector, yesterday described this latest deal as a 'quantum leap'. It will make it the 15th largest company in the sector with a market capitalisation of about Pounds 140m. Mr Nick Leslau, chief executive, said the property market was now off the bottom. 'The price of good quality property has gone up quite dramatically,' he said. The portfolio's initial yield is 9 per cent and its net annual rental income is Pounds 6.1m. Burford said it was confident that rental increases would result in the yield rising to more than 10 per cent within five years. The average rent on the offices is less than Pounds 11 per sq ft outside London and less than Pounds 29 per sq ft in Mayfair. Burford said that the properties were generally of a higher quality than its existing properties. They would help the group achieve its aim of having a balanced portfolio comprising quality properties as well as properties that required more intensive management. Mr Nigel Wray, chairman, said that their strong rental income would enhance the company's earnings. He believed that there would be many opportunities to enhance the value of the portfolio in the future. The company said its current year performance had been in line with expectations. 'There has been a perceptible hardening in yields although opportunities to purchase high quality assets on satisfactory terms still remain difficult to identify,' it said.</p>

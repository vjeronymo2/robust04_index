			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Venezuela looks to skilled of E Europe VENEZUELA is launching a selective immigration programme aimed at bringing in 50,000 east Europeans over the next five years, according to Mr Miguel Rodriguez, minister of planning. The South American republic, with about 19m inhabitants, has a shortage of experienced professionals and tradespeople in a number of sectors, including agriculture and general industry, and services such as health. Its economy grew by an estimated 9.2 per cent last year, the highest rate in Latin America. Further growth - although at a slower pace - is expected over the next two years, increasing demand for a wide variety of skills. The immigration programme, the first of its kind to be implemented in Venezuela since the 1950s, is being co-ordinated by the Ministry of Planning. The programme would be 'demand driven', Mr Rodriguez said, with private companies drawing up lists of specific skills required. These lists are to be used by a special government team which will visit east European countries to assess the availability of skilled individuals willing to emigrate. The Venezuelan government is receiving assistance from a UN agency that works with international migrants. Selected immigrants will receive free airline passage to Venezuela and a cash payment to help cover relocation costs.</p>

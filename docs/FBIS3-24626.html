Vladimirskii, Moscow]    [Abstract] Reproductive follow-up studies were conducted on  164 men that had been engaged in cleanup efforts at the  Chernobyl nuclear power plant. External exposure levels of these  22-50 year old men were reported not to have exceeded 25 cGy.  The protocols involved questionnaires and, in the case of 125 of  the men, laboratory examinations of semen samples. The findings  indicated that one third of the men suffered from various  degrees of impotence. In addition, 21% presented with  chronic  prostatovesiculitis, azoospermia, oligozoospermia, or  asthenospermia. Thus, impotence and infertility should also be  included on the list of medical complications that are being  monitored in the the Chernobyl cleanup personnel. Tables 1;  references: 2 (Russian).</p>

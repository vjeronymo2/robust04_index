			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Rally follows president's popular move  -A look at what has so far been a good year for Peru's stock exchange President Alberto Fujimori's surprise dissolution of Peru's Congress on Sunday night sent a slight tremor through the stock exchange in Lima. But by midweek, confidence was returning in line with public backing for Mr Fujimori's action. In spite of a 9 per cent fall in the general index since last Friday, trading was reaching normal levels again by Wednesday. One of the key market indicators, Banco Credito, which had lost some 19 per cent in value on Monday and Tuesday, staged a rally of 6.5 per cent on Wednesday. Sunday night's measures, supported by the army, were aimed at the opposition, which has been attacking the government's free market reforms and placing obstacles in the way of privatisation. 'Investors and brokers alike generally support the government's action,' says Mr Jose Almenara, general manager of the stock exchange. 'I believe economic reforms, including the privatisation process, will now advance much faster.' While the enthusiasm of overseas investors was more muted, Baring Securities in London said its clients - all experienced in the risks involved in emerging markets - were taking a long-term view. Baring noted that foreign investors had bought some Dollars 200,000 of stocks on Tuesday and that Mr Fujimori's announcement of a plebiscite in six weeks was encouraging. It has been a good year so far on the stock exchange: trading topped Dollars 200m in the first quarter and the daily average of nearly Dollars 3m contrasts sharply with the daily average of only Dollars 100,000 a year ago. The general index, after consistent monthly growth of 30 per cent throughout the final quarter of 1991, leapt from 108 in January to 170 in February, before falling back some 25 points in March. Last month's dip, in advance of Sunday's measures, was attributed primarily to companies cashing in on a rising market to pay large tax bills falling due. The market had also been disconcerted by a bungled domestic tax package announced in late February which unexpectedly imposed a 20 per cent tax on all dollar savings. While income from stocks and dividends was not included in the measure - issued by supreme decree and swiftly rescinded in the face of widespread protest - it probably proved an important signal from investors to the government that fledgling investor confidence is easily rocked by abrupt changes in the rules. Investors seeking the next Latin American success story have been flocking to Lima ever since Peru, long ostracised by the international financial community for reneging on its Dollars 22bn foreign debt, was welcomed back to the fold in September. 'Investors love a back-from-disaster story,' says Mr Federico Laffan of Latin American Securities. 'They are looking for a repeat of the kind of gain, about 300 per cent a year, made in Argentina.' So far the market's growth has focused on banking and industrial shares  - the best performers have been brewers, cement manufacturers and CPT, the Lima telephone company. CPT continues to rise in anticipation of the privatisation of the state-held stake. Another sector showing signs of activity is mining. The industry is Peru's biggest export earner but has been affected for years by a debilitating spiral of over-taxation, short-term indebtedness, and decapitalisation. But prospects for sectoral refinancing and a long-awaited improvement in the exchange rate are encouraging investors to look again. Later this month the stock exchange will handle its first important privatisation - that of Condestable, the state-owned copper mine. Banco de Comercio is likely to follow and Hierro Peru, the iron monopoly, could also be sold through the stock exchange. Mr Jose Luque Otero, president of the board, says: 'The government intends to privatise as much as possible via the stock exchange. It is the most transparent mechanism they can get.' Within two to three months, according to Mr Almenara, Lima will launch two new ventures - foreign exchange and index futures markets along the lines of those already well established in Chile. Under a recent agreement between the stocks and securities commissions of the two countries, Peru is benefiting from an interchange of information and training of personnel. By the end of the year the market will be accessible by computer from anywhere in the world. For the management of the exchange the biggest current challenge is to create a 'stock market mentality'. In spite of the tight liquidity, local companies are still reluctant to launch public offers for shares or bonds and relinquish their traditional control. But with demand for shares outstripping supply, analysts believe it will not be long before old prejudices are laid to rest.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Jan 12 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister  Radoje Kontic and the premiers of the Yugoslav Republics of  Serbia and Montenegro, Nikola Sainovic and Milo Djukanovic, on  Wednesday evening [12 January] backed up an economic recovery  programme drawn up by a team of Yugoslav experts and agreed to  start implement the measures contained in it as of next week.  Yugoslavia desperately needs such a programme to counter the  effects of an airtight international blockade and monster  inflation which in December alone reached one million percent.    The U.N. Security Council imposed tough sanctions on  Yugoslavia in late May of 1992 for its alleged involvement in  civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Kontic, Sainovic and Djukanovic were agreed that the  anti-inflation and stabilization programme, due to be launched  on January 17, would ensure an economic independence to the  country and open prospects for recovery on the basis of  market-economy principles, the Yugoslav Information Ministry  said in a statement. The Yugoslav Government on Wednesday  generally upheld the programme but insisted on some corrections  and amendments, the statement added. The programme focuses on  curbing hyperinflation and ensuring monetary stability as a  precondition for reviving production and improving the living  standards of the population, the Yugoslav Government said. It  also said that in the conditions of international sanctions,  financial backing for the programme should be primarily ensured  from domestic sources rather than from foreign ones. This  should not stop actions, however, for deblocking Yugoslav assets  frozen in foreign banks, settlement of claims that Yugoslavia  has towards other countries and conclusion of credit and other  financial arrangements to support the programme, the Federal  Government said.    The government of Serbia on Wednesday backed the programme,  while the government of Montenegro said on Tuesday that it  should be used as a basis for seeking how to surmount the  present economic difficulties and suggested a series of  alterations. In a letter to the Federal prime minister whose  content was published on Wednesday, Montenegrin Premier  Djukanovic said that the programme did not fully take into  account the effects of the blockade, that it was better suited  to an open economy and that it implied backing of foreign  capital.    Another shortcoming of the programme, the Montenegrin  Government said, is that it offers no complete answer as to how  to revive production and the commodities' market and how to  mitigate the acute social problems.</p>

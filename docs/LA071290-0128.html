			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLIES PRODDED TO FACE TOUGH ISSUES;  </P> <P> SUMMITRY: UNDER THE GLARE OF WORLD ATTENTION, THE SEVEN LEADERS FELT COMPELLED  TO ACT, ALTHOUGH GINGERLY.  </P> <P> Hours before the start of the 16th annual economic summit Monday, British  spokesman Bernard Ingham was asked how the heads of the world's major  industrial powers could possibly reach agreement on the intractable problem of  cutting back farm subsidies.  </P> <P> "Ah," Ingham replied, "therein lies the miracle of summits."  </P> <P> Wednesday's final results seemed to prove him correct.  </P> <P> Summits defy the wisdom of management theory, with its belief in clear-cut,  decisive action and its abhorrence of evasion and inefficient half-steps. And  critics were quick to point out that the Houston summit dealt with several  issues by reaching agreement on broad goals while leaving individual countries  free to do largely as they pleased.  </P> <P> Yet, in politics, half a loaf is often a lot of bread. And in international  negotiations, "progress is not a straight line, it's a sawtooth" moving in zigs  and zags, said one senior U.S. official.  </P> <P> Even in this era of almost nonstop consultation, therefore, the bringing  together of heads of state for large, set-piece meetings seems to play a vital  role in keeping their governments zigging and zagging ahead.  </P> <P> The reason, experts say, is simple. By assembling national leaders in the full  glare of world attention, summits force them and their aides to confront  difficult issues they might otherwise push aside.  </P> <P> While they still may disagree and refuse to take decisive action, leaders find  it difficult to ignore a pressing issue entirely and often cannot avoid taking  first one half-step, then another. Once all the national delegations have  arrived and negotiations are under way, no one leader wants to be tagged as the  person who blocked accord and caused the summit to "fail."  </P> <P> "It doesn't work . . . to march in lock-step on all these questions," President  Bush said during his post-summit news conference Wednesday. At the same time,  summit participants feel a strong pressure not to get too far out of step.  </P> <P> The prime example at the latest summit came in agriculture, in which the heads  of state agreed, some of them reluctantly, to break a logjam that had stalled  world trade negotiations.  </P> <P> Bush arrived in Houston determined to get a deal that would move the trade  talks forward. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl used the summit as an  occasion to break ranks with fellow European leaders and support Bush on the  key agricultural issue. In the end, that forced a deal.  </P> <P> On the environment, the summit played a similar role, although in the opposite  direction. For months, the major industrial nations have been locked in debate  on reducing carbon dioxide and other gases that are believed to cause global  warming. Some want aggressive action to reduce the gases; others favor  postponing action.  </P> <P> At the summit, the no-action side, led by the United States, won decisively --  for better or worse -- putting at least a temporary end to the debate.  </P> <P> Summit meetings do have their limits.  </P> <P> "Informality is not possible," noted W. Allen Wallis of the American Enterprise  Institute think tank, who was President Reagan's chief negotiator at several  economic summits. And the meetings typically cost taxpayers of the nations  involved millions of dollars, probably nearly $20 million this time around.  </P> <P> But the role of summits in grabbing the attention of world leaders may be even  more important now than in the past. In earlier years, noted Robert D. Hormats,  former assistant secretary of state, the pressures of the Cold War helped force  the major industrial democracies together. Now, by contrast, the chief job  facing leaders of the industrial nations is to prevent economic tensions from  pulling them apart, Hormats said.  </P> <P> And economic disputes are the sort of matters that most world leaders prefer to  avoid. They almost always involve complicated, technical matters in fields that  few politicians feel comfortable discussing in detail.  </P> <P> The annual economic summits force the leaders of the participating countries to  focus on those issues, at least for a few days each year. Moreover, for  lower-level officials, the summits pose a deadline, forcing action to avoid  confrontations when the heads of state meet.  </P> <P> The international agreement reached late last month on new protection for the  ozone layer illustrates that point. Officials from the United States and its  European allies, knowing that this week's summit might face a split over  another environmental issue, global warming, were eager to get the ozone issue  out of the way before the summit leaders arrived.  </P> <P> The pressure paid off with a quick agreement on ozone protections, and a summit  confrontation was avoided.  </P> <P> Finally, of course, regardless of what the experts and the scholars say, there  is one inescapable fact: So long as world leaders enjoy attention, they will  schedule summits. One line in Wednesday's final summit declaration took no  negotiation to work out.  </P> <P> "We have accepted the invitation of Prime Minister Thatcher to meet next July  in London," it declared.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Greenhouse Gases  </P> <P> CO2 Emissions  </P> <P> (as percentages of world total)  </P> <P> United States: 17.6%  </P> <P> Japan: 3.9%  </P> <P> Western Europe: 13.1%  </P> <P> Canada: 2.0%  </P> <P> Brazil: 10.5%  </P> <P> Soviet Union: 12.0%  </P> <P> Eastern Europe: 4.0%  </P> <P> Rest of World: 36.9%  </P> <P> Source: World Resources Institute  </P></p>

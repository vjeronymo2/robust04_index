			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Germany One might have expected lower German interest rates to be a tonic for the bond market. As rates have fallen elsewhere, money has moved out along the yield curve in search of capital appreciation and higher yields. That German bonds instead became unsettled this week is food for thought. The Bundesbank, which regards long-term yields as an indicator of inflationary expectations, is on difficult ground, especially when the weakening economy has driven it to accelerate rate cuts although inflation is still over 4 per cent. Part of the bond market's behaviour is the old story of selling on the good news. The Spanish peseta aside, calm has returned to the ERM. So there may be greater opportunities in other European markets where rates are also falling. The effect of such outflows on the D-Mark has so far been masked by poor US economic data which have weakened the dollar. Still, the anxiety of the Bundesbank's Mr Helmut Schlesinger is understandable. One of the bank's tasks is to create an environment in which the large budget deficits arising out of unification can be financed. It will not help if the monetary squeeze intensifies the recession, making the deficits even larger after the UK fashion. That is a powerful argument for lower rates. But if the bank remains serious about inflation, it cannot afford to see the exchange markets lose confidence in the D-Mark. The fall in German rates may not be quite so smooth after all.</p>

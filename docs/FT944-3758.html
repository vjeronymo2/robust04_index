			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / British Coal set to sell fund arm British Coal is expected to ask for offers next month for CIN Management, its fund management arm, after the trustees of both the industry's pension schemes agreed the framework for a fully commercial relationship with it. The sale is expected to attract significant interest among other fund managers. CIN Management is one of the country's biggest pension fund managers, with Pounds 16bn to Pounds 17bn under its control. Most of the managed funds are in equities, predominantly UK shares, but there are also property and venture capital investments. British Coal is likely to ask potential bidders in mid-January if they are interested in pre-qualifying to take part in the bid. Completion of the sale is expected in April or May. British Coal is also starting the sales process for its 15 per cent interest in German Creek, an Australian coking coal company in which Shell Coal also an interest. Coal users and producers in North Korea, Japan and Taiwan are likely to be interested. It expects it to take three to four months to get an offer. Existing partners in the joint venture will have pre-emptive rights to buy the shareholding at the final price. British Coal bought into German Creek in the late 1970s to test machinery for longwall mining.</p>

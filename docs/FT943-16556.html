			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Capital not the priority Sir, While agreeing with much of what Richard Lapper says in his article on reinsurance ('Third force emerges in high-risk world', June 30), I must question his assertion of the pre-eminence of capital among criteria for the well-appointed reinsurer. Without denying in any way the value and importance of an adequate capital base, proven underwriting and sound management, as exemplified in consistent results and an ability to survive, give better indications of health. The fragmentation of risk, which is both the method and purpose of reinsurance, allows the small, the medium and the large to co-exist. The slaughter of the innocents and the not so innocent owes more to the apparent inadequacies of management than of capital.

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Russian talks to avert crisis fail to reach compromise TALKS aimed at easing the political crisis in Russia broke up without agreement last night as the Congress of People's Deputies blocked President Boris Yeltsin's move for a referendum to dissolve the top legislature. Mr Yeltsin and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, were unable to find common ground during a meeting arranged late yesterday. The crisis erupted at the Congress on Thursday when Mr Yeltsin appealed for a referendum through which the people could put their trust in him to provide reform, rather than in the presently constituted parliament. Elections would be called for a new parliament if the president won that vote. Mr Yeltsin's proposal followed the refusal of Congress the previous day to confirm Mr Yegor Gaidar as prime minister. Deputies approved an amendment to the referendum law explicitly banning any plebiscite that would result in the dissolution of a high state body. The amendment was rejected on a first vote, but approved in a second poll following technical objections from deputies. It was pushed strongly by Mr Khasbulatov, who spoke scathingly of Mr Yeltsin's camp. Nothing in the comments made by spokesmen afterwards indicated that the two men had narrowed their differences. Mr Yeltsin established the limits of compromise by sticking to his choice of Mr Gaidar as prime minister. The two men met only after deputies had shuttled between them with various proposed compromises. The prime mediator, Mr Valkery Zorkin, head of the constitutional court, who also attended the meetings, finally brought the two men together. Mr Yeltsin is to meet Mr Khasbulatov and Mr Zorkin today, with deputies from a cross-section of parliamentary factions, in a further search for consensus.

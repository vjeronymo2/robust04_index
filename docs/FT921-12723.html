			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Recruiters target ex-Soviet missile scientists FOREIGN headhunters are recruiting specialists from Dnepropetrovsk, the missile-building capital of the former Soviet Union, to work in the Middle East and elsewhere. Local businessmen say rocket scientists are among those seeking to work abroad. The recruitment drive at the centre where all Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles, including the SS18 and SS24, are built and designed raises the spectre of Soviet arms technology proliferating to countries such as Iraq, Iran and Libya. Yesterday Mr Yuli Vorontsov, the Russian ambassador to the UN, denied reports in an Arabic magazine that Iran had already purchased three nuclear weapons, possibly from Kazakhstan, for between Dollars 130m (Pounds 71m) and Dollars 150m. The magazine, Al-Watan Al-Arabi, also claimed that Iran had hired more than 50 Soviet nuclear experts at salaries of Dollars 5,000 a month. Proliferation of Soviet arms is a danger to which western leaders are acutely sensitive. Yesterday on German radio Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's foreign minister, warned that unemployed Soviet military specialists are 'wandering technological mercenaries . . . easy prey for recruiters for irresponsible potentates' who have the dangerous ambition of building weapons of mass destruction'. Mr Genscher proposed western states create funds to help prevent such a brain drain. At the same time, officials accompanying Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, on a visit to the former Soviet Union, said Russian authorities might be willing to take legal action to prevent military specialists from peddling their skills abroad. But in Dnepropetrovsk fledgling entrepreneurs think military knowhow could be one of their depressed region's most promising exports. 'If the Libyan government asked me to find rocket scientists I would be happy help,' says Mr Viacheslav Kostiukovych, assistant director of Sistema Reserve, an American-Ukrainian joint venture in the city which is primarily involved in publishing. Mr Kostiukovych has no doubt that if the price was right, Dnepropetrovsk's military specialists would be willing and able to work abroad - he believes some are already employed in the Middle East. Sistema Reserve has an entree into the business: this spring it was asked by the International Employment Agency, based in Liechtenstein, to recruit specialists to work abroad, with special reference to the Middle East. IEA emphasised that 'there is no limit to the amount of candidates that you can recruit' and offered annual starting salaries of Dollars 30,000, (Pounds 16,600), a complete benefit package, pre-paid air fares and assistance in obtaining visas. Dnepropetrovsk is the home of Iuzhny Mashinostroitelny Zavod (Iuzhmash), the largest integrated missile production facility in the world. According to Mr Leonid Kuchma, the director of Iuzhmash, some 3,000 of the 50,000 people employed by the complex are specialists with knowledge of sensitive rocket technology. As the enterprise has shifted from 85 per cent military production five years ago to a current 30 per cent, those specialists are now making umbrellas, sausage-making machines and rose petal dryers instead of missiles. Mr Kuchma brushes aside fears of a brain drain to the Middle East butMr Iuri Alexeyev, chief engineer is not so sure. Ukrainian military, Page 2</p>

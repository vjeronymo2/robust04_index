			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Georgiy Shmelev: "Bosnian Conflict: Is There </F> Light at the End of the Tunnel?"]    [Text] It is very important now to focus attention on  bringing to an end the process of political settlement in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Without a political settlement the world  will continue to observe the tragedy, stated Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin in an exclusive interview with  an ITAR-TASS correspondent on his return from Geneva, where the  latest meeting of the sides in the Bosnian conflict had taken  place. He said that with each new unsuccessful round it is  increasingly difficult to count on the success of the talks on a  Bosnia settlement.    Describing the recent round as "unsuccessful," Vitaliy  Churkin noted that at the previous meeting in Brussels in  December last year in his opinion an opportunity of reaching  agreement was lost: The world community lacked the resolve to  see the matter through to a logical conclusion. "And that is  even more so now." The deputy foreign minister believes that  essentially the participants in the talks are now "going round  in circles." That is problems which at the previous round of  talks seemed to be the main, final problems were not mentioned  at all this time. Some completely different questions arose.  Thus while then the chief and paramount obstacle to reaching a  definitive agreement seemed to be questions of the Muslim  republic's access to the sea and the river Sava, that is  questions connected with its survival, now these questions have  not been mentioned at all. New questions have arisen and there  was the impression that the preceding five or six rounds of  talks had not happened t all. This situation, V. Churkin said,  confirms the Russian side's concern that unless it adopts a  clear position and leads the sides to signing an agreement then  disputes on various aspects of this agreement could continue "as  long as you like."    What worries me most, Churkin said, is the fact that the  world community, not to mention the participants in the talks,  seems to have "lost its bearings," and some kind of confusion  bordering on panic has arisen. Because nothing is being  achieved, important but secondary issues are being brought to  the fore. "I am deeply convinced," he stressed, "that without a  political settlement the humanitarian problem, however much is  done with it, will be on the tragic borderline since as long as  people continue to fight -- when each side will be thinking of  military victory -- it will not be possible to meet the  population's humanitarian needs." But what is happening now,  the deputy minister continued, is that the political aspect of  the matter is sometimes forgotten and important but nonetheless  secondary humanitarian problems and even "individual episodes"  of the overall humanitarian situation are being brought to the  fore.    As for the question of air strikes against Bosnia, V.  Churkin  pointed to the relevant UN Security Council resolutions which  speak of the possibility of such actions "from the viewpoint of  helping the UN protection forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  helping the world community's humanitarian measures."    Speaking of the Russian side's position on this issue it  cannot be said that Russia opposes any air strikes "a priori,"  he continued. "If a situation suddenly arises when UN troops  really become the target for a direct attack by any of the  conflicting side," V. Churkin explained his personal viewpoint,  "I will recommend (and I am sure a political decision will be  made) that the measure be supported." Or another case: Perhaps  a "malevolent action" will be undertaken and some side will not  allow humanitarian aid through to dying people and in these  cases, he stressed, the toughest measures could perfectly well  be taken.    But when people speak of air strikes virtually today or  tomorrow to assist the battalion replacement operation (and the  changeover is planned for the middle of February [as published]  and there is an agreement on assisting this changeover in  Srebrenica) then in V. Churkin's opinion such proposals are  aimed at diverting attention from the real problems in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is hard to imagine, he continued, how it  is possible to use air strikes to open the airport in Tuzla or  effect the replacement of the Canadian battalion with a Dutch  one. It is absolutely clear that if air strikes are be  delivered in the Srebrenica region there will be no changeover  -- fighting will begin and there will be no question at all of  any humanitarian aid.    As for the displeasure voiced recently by "some circles and  people" over Lord Owen's actions in a Bosnian settlement, then  in V. Churkin's opinion the latter's replacement or resignation  from the post of cochairman of the international London  conference on a settlement in the former Yugoslavia would be a  "serious mistake" right now. Lord Owen, the Russian Federation  deputy foreign minister said, is the only man who has been  concerned with settlement issues from the outset and "he has  concentrated all the threads of the negotiations in his hands"  and if he were to be replaced now "any of the three sides in  Bosnia which does not want a settlement could simply exploit  this fact to continue to fool everyone, to raise ever new  questions, or return to old ones and so on and so forth."    Vitaliy Churkin recalled that in the past Lord Owen adopted  a  very tough anti-Serbian stance and called for air strikes  against individual targets. "When this did not happen calls  began to be heard for Lord Owen's replacement." The Russian  Federation deputy foreign minister believes that it is very  difficult now to find a worthy replacement for Lord Owen and  that it is simply impossible without losing the pace of the  negotiations. That would essentially mean, he said, that the  world community would acknowledge its impotence and "talk would  then turn to a completely new and large range of political  efforts with vague chances of success."    The next round, Vitaliy Churkin said in conclusion, is  scheduled for 10 February [as published] in Geneva. This  meeting has been set more modest tasks. And it will take place  with a narrower range of participants and the representatives of  the Bosnian sides will meet to discuss confidence building  measures. That is it will be a meeting with limited aims.</p>

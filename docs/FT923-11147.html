			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Management: Sharper skills and bigger pay cheques - Are MBAs still useful to ambitious business people? Decrying the value of an MBA is all the rage, but some consumers still seem to think it is value for money. So say two very different surveys of graduates from British business schools - published, you should be warned, by the institutions themselves. The first, a survey of graduates from Cranfield School of Management's full-time MBA programme between 1970 and 19901, shows all but 3 per cent of alumni 'highly satisfied' and nearly 90 per cent avowing it as 'important' to their career progression. However, the main reason for taking the MBA had changed. In 1970 the top reason was 'to change career'; since 1975 the top slot has been 'to acquire new skills'. Despite that, the number of company-sponsored students has dropped from nearly a quarter in 1970 to 4 per cent in 1990. Cranfield's part-time MBA seems to have taken most company-sponsored students. On the pre-MBA background of students, in the first 10 years of the programme there was a shift away from large companies (turnover in excess of Pounds 100m a year) to small companies (turnover up to Pounds 10m a year). Since 1985 this shift has slowed, and the last year surveyed (1990) saw a move back to medium-sized and large companies, possibly as a result of the recession. Some things remain fairly constant. The salary differentials pre/post MBA stayed typically in the order of 30/40 per cent. Similarly, graduates from all four of the years surveyed regarded finance and accounting, followed by marketing, as the most valuable programmes. The second survey is of students on the part-time MBA at London's City University Business School 2, which runs one of the UK's largest evening MBA courses. The course, begun in 1983 for City workers, takes nearly 100 students a year. The average age of students surveyed was 30, 82 per cent of them men. Around half had their fees paid by their company, with another quarter part-sponsored. Graduates produce the usual list of benefits ('thinking strategically', 'wider understanding of business'), but a surprisingly high number volunteered 'credibility' as a benefit. And guess the average salary increase? Yes, another 30 per cent. 'It is not possible to say whether this was a result of the MBA,' says the report modestly. The effect of sponsorship is not straightforward. Whereas sponsored employees are more likely to stay with their employers, the unsponsored are less likely to change employer than the part-sponsored. 'Possibly this is because an employee who has undertaken such a commitment does so because it is the only way they can see to change function or achieve promotion.' 1 The MBA at Cranfield 1970-1990, Cranfield Institute of Technology, Cranfield, Beds MK43 OAL. 2 The Evening MBA Alumni Survey, City University Business School, Barbican Centre, London EC2Y 8HB.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Pepsi-Cola Co. will air what it calls the first Spanish-language commercial on  U.S. network television -- without subtitles or dubbing -- during Wednesday's  Grammy Awards broadcast on CBS, the company announced Monday. The spot will  feature Puerto Rican singer Chayanne, 20, who gained attention as a member of  the group Los Chicos and who topped the Latin chart in the United States in  1985 with his album "Sangre Latina." "Our international experience with  English-speaking superstars like Michael Jackson and Tina Turner has proven  that music has universal appeal and bridges language and cultural differences,"  Alan Pottasch, a Pepsi senior vice president, told United Press International.  The commercial, filmed in Chile, features Chayanne's single, "Este Ritmo Se  Baila Asi" ("You Dance That Rhythm Like This") from his current album,  "Chayanne." Pottasch said the commercial would air following a Grammy show  segment in which Linda Ronstadt sings in Spanish. Shauna Snow  </P></p>

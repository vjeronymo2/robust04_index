			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 Feb (MENA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH  has affirmed that President Husni Mubarak's visit to Turkey  falls within the framework of realizing the great pan-Arab and  Egyptian goals and also within the framework of Mubarak's  constant desire to establish deep and binding relations of  cooperation and friendship with all countries of the world.    The newspaper said in an editorial in today's issue that  Egypt has relations of friendship and cooperation with the  countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea and the Arab, Islamic,  and European countries equally.    The newspaper adds: If we are aspiring to modern, civilized  ties among the countries of the Mediterranean Sea basin that  will restore to this region its significance and historical  value to the whole world, it is only natural for Egypt to want  to form a new kind of relations of cooperation with  Turkey--relations that befit Egypt's position and history with  Turkey since the latter is undeniably an Islamic country linked  to Europe by special ties.    The newspaper stressed Egypt's efforts to establish peace in  the Middle East. It also stressed Egypt's efforts to forge  relations of cooperation and friendship with the countries  bordering the Mediterranean Sea and normal and strong relations  with the big powers in the northern half of the hemisphere.    The newspaper believes Egypt's present and future interests  are the ultimate objective of the national leadership's every  effort, regardless of the interconnected fronts and national  working policies. Mubarak's visit to Turkey is a short one, but  a visit that serves the long-term and grand objectives.</p>

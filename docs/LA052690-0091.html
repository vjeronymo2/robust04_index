			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> SUCCESS ENCOURAGES SPORT OF KINGS  </P> <P> Before May of 1989, Wayne Gretzky's interest in thoroughbred racing was  limited. He paid some attention to the career of fellow Canadian Sandy Hawley  and the Triple Crown, but that was about it.  </P> <P> Hockey's Great One had never seen a race in person until last year's Kentucky  Derby at Churchill Downs.  </P> <P> After watching Sunday Silence beat Easy Goer in the first of their four  meetings, Gretzky was hooked.  </P> <P> "It was very emotional and very exciting," he said. "When the gates opened, it  was one of the wildest things I'd ever seen. They've said it's the greatest two  minutes in sports, and I guess I'd pretty much have to agree with that."  </P> <P> Gretzky's Derby companion was Bruce McNall, owner of the Kings. By his own  count, McNall -- the man behind Summa Stable -- has had "thousands of horses."  </P> <P> Soon, Gretzky was to own his first horse, in partnership with McNall. The way  their first collaboration has turned out, it's easy to understand why Gretzky's  interest in the sport is increasing.  </P> <P> Purchased almost a year ago in Europe after his second start, Golden Pheasant  won once and placed in two other graded races before coming to the United  States.  </P> <P> Since his arrival, the roan son of Caro has been perfect in two tries and has  already stamped himself one of the nation's best turf performers.  </P> <P> Impressive beating allowance rivals at Santa Anita, Golden Pheasant was equally  dominant against Eclipse Award winner Steinlen and Classic Fame 13 days ago in  the John Henry Handicap.  </P> <P> Golden Pheasant will go for three consecutive victories Monday in the $500,000  Hollywood Turf Handicap. His main rival, now that Prized has been scratched,  figures to be Hawkster.  </P> <P> Having owned stars such as Trempolino, Dahar and Track Robbery, McNall  definitely likes what he has seen of Golden Pheasant, who is trained by Charlie  Whittingham.  </P> <P> "I think he has every opportunity to be the best horse I've ever had, certainly  in this country," McNall said. "It's very exciting for me. Charlie's very  confident.  </P> <P> "I don't know how good he is yet, but we'll find out a little more on Monday.  From what I've seen, he's got all the potential. I've had a lot of horses, and  I think he's right near the top."  </P> <P> McNall was initially hesitant to buy the colt, even though he had finished  second to Old Vic in the second race of his life.  </P> <P> "He wasn't a great-looking horse, and he wasn't a horse who necessarily was  proven at that level," McNall said.  </P> <P> Bloodstock agents and racing managers Emmanuel and Laura de Seroux were  convinced Golden Pheasant had the right stuff. "They've done great for us over  the years, so I tend to go with them," McNall said.  </P> <P> Credit Gretzky with an assist. Ever since the 1989 Derby, he had been eager to  get involved in the sport. He helped persuade McNall to buy the horse.  </P> <P> "Bruce had been telling me that one of the most important things about the  horse business is that you have to be patient," Gretzky said. "I was anything  but patient about Golden Pheasant. I kept pushing him on it. It's pretty  exciting when you first get involved with horse racing that you can be involved  with a horse like Golden Pheasant."  </P> <P> Golden Pheasant hasn't been the only successful horse for Gretzky and McNall.  Shining Steel won the Shoemaker Handicap earlier this month. Northern Glance, a  daughter of Nijinsky II, broke her maiden at first asking the same day Golden  Pheasant won the John Henry. Frankly Perfect won or placed in several stakes  before breaking down in the San Juan Capistrano April 22.  </P> <P> "I'm trying to figure out how to explain to Wayne that not every horse wins  graded races," McNall said. "So far, I've been unsuccessful. It's like starting  out your first game winning the Stanley Cup finals. Where do you go from  there?"  </P> <P> Gretzky experienced the other extreme when Frankly Perfect was injured a couple  of hours before the Kings' Game 3 loss to Edmonton. Still, Gretzky plans to  increase his involvement. He has shares in eight thoroughbreds and a harness  horse in Canada.  </P> <P> "When you see your horse win, there's an emotional high, just like there is  when you win anything else," he said. "When you lose, obviously, there's  disappointment.  </P> <P> "I like to think that when we lose a hockey game, I understand the reasons why  or some of the reasons why. I'm still learning this business, and after a race  is lost I'm still not sure of everything that happened or everything that went  on. It'll take time to learn. You're not going to grasp it all in one year. I  have a lot of years ahead of me to learn the whole business, and I'm enjoying  it more every day.  </P> <P> "Like I said two weeks ago, if you're going to get involved with something  where you don't know a whole lot about it, you have to be patient and get  involved with people who know what they're doing.  </P> <P> "Bruce and his horse empire and the people who run it have been very  successful, work very hard and know what they're doing."  </P> <P> Gretzky's wife, Janet, and 17-month-old daughter, Paulina, saw Golden  Pheasant's victory in the John Henry.  </P> <P> "She loves animals and horses," Gretzky said of Janet. "We watched the replay  of Golden Pheasant's last race about seven times, mostly because she kept  wanting to see the horses run."  </P> <P> Whittingham will also be represented in the two other stakes Hollywood Park is  offering this weekend.  </P> <P> Today, he will send out Warcraft against 10 other 3-year-olds in the $113,500  Will Rogers Handicap at 1 1/16 miles on the turf.  </P> <P> Beaten by a nose in the Spotlight Handicap in his first grass start three weeks  ago, Warcraft is the co-highweight with Somethingdifferent, who was fourth in  the Spotlight, at 120 pounds. Robbie Davis again will ride Warcraft.  </P> <P> Making his first turf start will be Tsu's Dawning, who was a disappointment  after looking as though he might be a Triple Crown prospect early in the year.  Trainer Ed Gregson's colt has trained well on the surface and is bred to do  well on it. He is a son of Tsunami Slew, who won this race in 1984 and the '85  American Handicap over this course, and a half-brother to Zoffany, a multiple  stakes winner on the turf. Gary Stevens has the mount.  </P> <P> Others in the field include Single Dawn, who beat Pleasant Tap by a nose in the  Hoist The Flag Stakes last fall in his only grass start; Itsallgreektome, who  staged the upset in the Spotlight in his first race as a gelding; Mehmetori;  Senegalaise; Robyn Dancer; Forth Niner Days, Green's Leader and Balla Cove.  </P> <P> Sunday, Whittingham's hopes in the $107,700 Gamely Handicap will rest with  Dearly Loved. The beaten favorite in the Santa Lucia at Santa Anita in her  first California outing, Dearly Loved was scratched from the Hawthorne Handicap  a week ago in favor of the Grade I Gamely. She was fourth in her only other  turf appearance.  </P> <P> Dearly Loved will have only five opponents in the 1 1/8-mile race -- Beautiful  Melody, runner-up to stablemate Reluctant Guest in the recent Wilshire  Handicap, Stylish Star, Double Wedge and the Fabio Nor-trained entry of  Estrella Fuega and Mamma Rosita.  </P></p>

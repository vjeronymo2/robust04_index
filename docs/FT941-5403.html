			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / People: Libyan Saudi resigns in Bahrain Arab Banking Corporation is sifting with some urgency through possible candidates to assume the presidency of the Bahrain-based bank after the resignation of Abdulla Saudi, writes Mark Nicholson. In a statement, ABC said Saudi was leaving 'owing to external circumstances' and that his departure was 'necessary to protect shareholders' interests and safeguard the bank's future'. All of which is apparently code for Saudi's chief problem: his Libyan nationality. Senior bankers in Kuwait say the primary reason for Saudi's departure is that his Libyan nationality had led to fears among ABC's chief shareholders  -notably the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait which, with Libya, hold about a quarter of the bank each - that the US might decide to freeze the bank's assets under sanctions against Libya for its alleged role in the Lockerbie bombing in 1988. In February, a two-month freeze of the assets in the US of Arab Financial Services, a Bahrain-based credit card and travellers cheque company which Saudi (right) also chairs, was lifted only after intensive lobbying by the Bahraini authorities. ABC apparently felt Saudi should step aside to avoid any further such problems. He will do so after May 1 and Gulf bankers say it could be as big a blow to ABC as to Saudi himself - though he could not be reached to comment on his future. Saudi was ABC's founding president in 1980 and has crafted it ever since - raising it from a straightforward Offshore Banking Unit in Bahrain to an international group embracing operations in Hong Kong, Spain, London and, increasingly, across the Arab World. His retail banking experience in Spain led him to acquire Banco Atlantico, the Spanish retailer. For now, Khalifa al-Muhairy, an ABC board member, will chair a committee to take over the running of the bank until a permanent replacement for Saudi is found. Well informed gossips in Kuwait say Abdulla al-Qbandi, former head of the Kuwait Investment Authority, is among the favourites.</p>

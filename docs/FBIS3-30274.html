			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Immediately before the evening news, we received an  exclusive report from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The murder of the British  humanitarian worker, Paul Goodall, and the wounding of two of  his colleagues, is a crime without precedent for which the West  quickly accused members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Here is  the result of a quick and successful investigation by the  Ministry of Interior of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Following the terrorist attack on the UNHCR [UN High  Commission for Refugees] workers in Perin Han near Zenica on 27  January this year, members of the Ministry of the Interior and  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, as well as the relevant judiciary  bodies from Zenica and Sarajevo, took urgent and energetic  operational and other steps to clarify this terrorist act and  find the culprits.    Three persons, under well-founded suspicion of taking part  in  the attack, were arrested in Zenica. Taking as the starting  point the established facts and the fact that the group that  carried out this crime consisted of several people, steps were  taken to find all the culprits. Reliable information was  obtained to the effect that three kidnappers had set off toward  Butmir in the stolen vehicle, in order to--as the Ministry of  Interior of Bosnia-Herzegovina assesses--reach the airport and  flee.    The plan was to intercept the group on Mount Igman in order  to arrest its members. However, the car failed to stop despite  repeated warnings by the Army. In a contrary action, automatic  weapons fire was immediately opened from the car in the  direction of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army members and had to be  returned. All three terrorists and one civilian, who was held  hostage, were killed in the ensuing shoot-out, while one  military policeman was seriously wounded.    A passport issued in Great Britain and a passport that was  an  obvious forgery from Pakistan with an entry and transit visa of  the Republic of Croatia was found on those killed. For the  aforementioned reasons, it cannot yet be said for certain what  kind of people this involved; nor can their exact identify be  verified.</p>

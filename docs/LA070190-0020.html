			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RATING THE SYSTEM'S DANGERS;  </P> <P> DROPPING THE X  </P> <P> Re Charles Champlin's commentary "Dropping the X," June 17:  </P> <P> Champlin is right about one thing: The X rating, like communism, is an idea  whose time has long since gone. But the blame for the de facto censorship it  has represented for the past decade does not rest entirely with its capricious  and inconsistent application by the Motion Picture Assn. of America but also  with the nervous-nellie theater chains who unilaterally bar all X-rated films  from their venues.  </P> <P> About the time that "9 1/2 Weeks" and "Angel Heart" were having their ratings  difficulties, instead of forcing the directors to monkey around with their  vision, the studios should have pressured the theater chains to drop that  guideline.  </P> <P> The purpose of that rule was to keep porno films out of the local multiplex,  but face facts: The producers of these films know the local mall is hardly the  place to find their target audience. The porno market has been swallowed up  almost completely by home video. Any film made by a respectable producer or  distributed by a major company is not likely to fit under the heading of  hard-core smut. For that matter, almost anything shot on film (rather than  videotape) is probably not porno.  </P> <P> Of course, we still should eliminate the X, with all its less than savory  associations (not the pornography, but the cloud of latent censorship it  generated). Whether you replace it with an A, a 17 or an NC makes no difference  -- just as long as the MPAA copyrights it and keeps it under association  control. If it had done that in the first place, perhaps the whole mess could  have been avoided.  </P> <P> PAUL McELLIGOTT  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

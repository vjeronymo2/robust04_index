			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 24--The Economic Survey for 1993-94,  presented to Parliament today, hints at further reforms in  taxation, subsidies, price control and expenditure, but concedes  that these basic reforms may not show "immediate dramatic  results in deficit reduction" from the current year's level  which is likely to exceed significantly the 1993-94 budget  estimates.    Nevertheless, the survey says, the measures can help ensure  that control over the fiscal deficit is re-established.  Referring to the high fiscal deficit during the current  financial year, the survey points out that "after initial  success, there is a tendency for fiscal discipline to weaken" as  happened in many countries which faced a fiscal-cum-balance of  payment crisis.    It notes the success achieved on the balance of payments and  inflation fronts as also rekindling of growth which is expected  to be 3.8 percent for 1993-94, nearly two percent less than the  target. But these encouraging trends, the survey warns, must not  lead to fiscal laxity. "The alternatives to fiscal  responsibility and sustained reform will bring higher inflation,  low growth, recurrent balance of payments problems and the  accentuation of poverty." The survey, therefore, calls for  resisting them firmly so as to attain the goals of fast labour  intensive growth, employment generation and poverty reduction.    The need for macro-economic stability by reducing the  government's revenue expenditure to sustain high rates of  savings and investment has been repeatedly stressed. A reduction  in fiscal deficit will also facilitate financial reform by  eliminating any residual risk of a high interest-fiscal deficit  spiral. In the medium-term, containment of fiscal deficit would  entail serious changes in both expenditure and revenue policies.  Control of major subsidies and effective prioritisation of  discretionary expenditures is a key issue.    While broadening of the tax-base is necessary to contain  fiscal deficits, moving towards the ideals of a national value  added tax and ad valorem import duty is also considered  essential for putting Indian producers on a par with foreign  competitors.    Among other important issues and priorities highlighted by  the survey are: changes in legislative and administrative  framework to facilitate restructuring of industry, elimination  of rigidities in labour laws, attracting foreign direct  investment, phasing out import licensing and high tariffs.  Shifting the composition of external finance from borrowing to  direct equity investment, and from short-term and government  guaranteed government debt to long-term debt with minimum  reliance on government guarantee, prudent management of external  debt and foreign exchange reserves, reforms in pricing, cost  recovery and institutional changes in the infrastructure  sector. The survey also emphasises the need for shifting  composition of public expenditure in agriculture from input  subsidies to creation and maintenance of infrastructure.    The survey notes several plus points during the current  financial year as fruits of the reform initiatives. The year is  likely to end with foreign exchange reserves of about $12  billion and a current account deficit of less than 0.5 percent  of GDP. An inflow of over $2.5 billion on account of foreign  direct and equity portfolio investments is expected by the end  of this financial year, with much higher inflows likely next  year.    The monetary effects of large capital inflows may pose a new  challenge for the country's monetary policy for the first time  in recent history. In 1991-92, foreign exchange inflows added  about Rs 11,000 crores to reserve money and in 1993-94, this  increase may be of the order of Rs 16,000 crores. "The  contribution is likely to increase next year and we must be  prepared to meet this challenge," the survey observes.    A conscious policy is being followed to reduce the quantum  of  short-term external debt as a result of the marked improvement  in foreign exchange reserves. The share of short-term debt in  the total debt stock fell from 10.2 percent in March 1991 to  seven percent in March 1993. The increase in external debt  averaged about $3 billion in both 1991-92 and 1992-93, but in  the first half of 1993-94, the increase was limited to less than  $300 million.    In the first nine months of 1993-94, export growth rose to  19.9 percent in dollar terms while imports declined by 1.3  percent. The deficit in the current account at 0.5 percent of  GDP is also sustainable. While all this provides a very sound  basis to put the balance payments position on a stable path in  the medium-term, concerted policy action is required to ensure  that exports maintain their growth rate in the medium-term and  the trade deficit is not allowed to widen despite the likely  recovery in imports during 1994-95.    The survey also notes that debt servicing is expected to  peak  in 1996-97. Because of the large interest and principal  repayments, a substantial financing gap may be expected to  remain in the coming three years. In this connection, the survey  refers to the issue of taking a medium-term loan from the IMF  under the extended fund facility (EFF) and says that while some  talks have been held, a decision will be taken keeping in view  the emerging balance of payments position.    The overall industrial growth during the first seven months  of 1993-94 has been only 1.6 percent. The growth rate, though  registering discernible improvement since July 1993, is below  the expectation, the survey concedes. But it finds indications  of an industrial revival due to several factors on both the  supply and demand side. These factors include successive good  agricultural performance, high growth of exports, a buoyant  infrastructural sector, enhancement in public spending on social  sectors and a substantial increase in foreign investment. Demand  conditions are also favourable, indicating an industrial growth  rate of around 4 percent for 1993-94. The survey, however,  admits that due to a number of factors, "the industrial sector  is yet to respond with full vigour to liberalisation measures."    Turning to agriculture, the survey says that despite a good  year, agricultural production will show slower growth in 1993-94  because of the peak levels attained in 1992-93. But the  production of wheat and rice is likely to grow this year.  Foodgrains stocks at 22.8 million tonnes at the end of December,  1993 were at their highest level in seven years.    The survey expresses concern at the price situation. Though  the annual inflation rate stood at 8.2 percent (provisional) on  January 29 this year, the fiscal and monetary situation was  fuelling inflation. Because of the increased administered prices  at the end of January and early February, "control of inflation  once again emerges as an area of priority concern."    It therefore, observes: "In the coming year, containment and  reduction in the rate of inflation will depend on measures for  containing the fiscal deficit and reducing the potential for  monetary expansion, recovery of industrial production and the  management of the supply of foodgrains and other key essential  commodities."</p>

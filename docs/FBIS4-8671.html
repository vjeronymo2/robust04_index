			<p>BFN     [Text] Democratic Union [UD] leader Tadeusz Mazowiecki,  commenting on President Walesa's statement regarding possible  early parliamentary elections should deputies want to restrict  the constitutional prerogatives of the head of state, said that  the Constitution could not be constantly amended with every  conflict.    He added that the parliament had, after all, the right to  change the Basic Law and that this was no reason to threaten it  with dismissal.    Tadeusz Mazowiecki also said he was not in favor of changes  to the Constitution because this situation concerned a dispute  between the ruling coalition and the president. A proper  constitution should be set up once and for all, declared the UD  leader.</p>

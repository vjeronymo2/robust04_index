			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Travel: The old world of modern Iran - The sights of Iran are impressive - but does anyone want to go there? IT IS spring in Iran, and you can imagine the poets hymning it. Roses and plum blossom burst out against the dusty hillsides and pale blue skies, while the snow melts into rivulets that combine into streams that water the land. As you head lower, farmers are ploughing rich brown furrows in the grey soil and scattering seed. Wheat and rice start appearing. Land that looks too poor to raise crops is grazed by sheep and goats, tended by boys with big sticks. Way down in south Iran, by the Gulf, the herds are heading higher as the weather warms, with Kashgai nomads in attendance. Real nomads do not lead the sheep but follow them, their possessions bundled on donkeys. We saw a rare sight, a brightly-clad group riding camels; but today's preferred beast of burden for the Kashgai is a Toyota pickup. People have been travelling these roads, between east and west, for ever. On the plain at Pasargadae, near modern Shiraz, Cyrus the Great overthrew his Medean grandfather in 550 BC, the first step on the way to building the first Persian empire. He beat Croesus of Lydia, who was promised by the oracle at Delphi that if he went to battle he would destroy a great empire (Croesus did, only to find it was his own empire). Cyrus also conquered Babylon and earned everyone's admiration for his generosity: he restored the old gods, encouraged religious and cultural tolerance, and won glowing mention in the Bible for sending the Jews home after their long exile. Here, at Pasargadae, he was buried in a small, stepped building which looks as if he was imitating the pyramids but had not realised the size of them. Alexander the Great, another admirer although he spent much of his career fighting the Persians, executed the underling who looted the tomb. Cyrus's successor-but-one, Darius, moved his palaces to Persepolis and Susa  -proper, walled, defensible cities, whereas Pasargadae was a nomad camp in stone. The walls at Persepolis are decorated with neat bas-reliefs, as clear and detailed as if they were carved yesterday, of long-gone subject peoples bringing him tribute: Arachosians with goblets, Gandarians with bison, Sagartians with a horse. They had to prostrate themselves before the King of Kings; if they so much as touched the royal carpet they were put to death. The Greeks were disgusted by this oriental pomp, and Alexander burnt the palace after capturing it. Along the same roads, though, is the evidence that the Persians rose again under the Sassanian dynasty. In 260 AD, King Shapur captured the Roman emperor Valerian, and wanted everyone to know it. By Darius's tomb near Persepolis, and at other prestige sites throughout Iran, are sturdy rock carvings showing him humbling the hapless Roman. When Valerian died, Shapur had him stuffed with straw and mounted in a temple, to keep alive the memory of his victory. Other Sassanians appear in similar self-advertisements, unhorsing opponents in battle or being crowned by their chief god, Ahura Mazda - impressive, inelegant stuff that has lasted through the ages, as it was meant to. The following millennium of rule by Arabs, Seljuks, Mongols and Timurids left monuments everywhere, pavilions and gardens and poets' tombs, but above all in Isfahan, capital of the 16th-century Safavid kings. There are bridges across the Zayandeh Rud river: one with 33 neat arches, another with steps on the downstream side, where people sit in the sun on their day off, supping a sort of ice cream made of rice powder and lemon sauce (unexpectedly refreshing), and women, swathed from head to toe in the standard black chadors, cruise round in pedalos. Above all, Isfahan has mosques, with the bluest domes this side of Samarkand. On the main Friday Mosque, the delicate 15th-century tilework hides an older maze of brick pillars, arches and cupolas, which seems to have just accumulated over the years. On what used to be the Royal Mosque, and is now the Imam's Mosque, the decoration is total. Four huge, arched rooms open on to a central courtyard, and every one of them is awash, inside and out, with tiles, swirling foliage patterns, geometric decorations and angular calligraphy. Scholars grumble that this is all over the top, decadent, a rush job begun in 1611 by the Great Sophy - Shah Abbas - to complete one end of the city's great rectangular open space, the Maidan (which has smaller buildings in the middle of the other sides, and two storeys of arches in between, and is anyway so big you hardly know it is there). Maybe. But I defy anyone to walk into this mosque and not be dazzled by the overwhelming luxuriance of it all. All this magnificence, though, raises the question of whether anyone is going to go to Iran to see it. Its sights, natural and man-made, are as exciting as those of, say, Mexico; but a decade of religious rule and Gulf war have left Iran looking like a bad risk. Foreigners are, at best, trickling back. Understandably so. Our hotel in Tehran bore the words DOWN WITH THE USA in letters a yard high over its front door; this was only partly offset by the amusement park over the road with Mickey Mouse painted on the walls. Like the French at Eurodisney, the Iranians are half-fascinated, half-repelled by the Great Satan and his mouse familiar. For all that, the people seem friendly. Children gawp and grin and say hello, but unlike their counterparts in much of the Third World they do not demand pens, sweets or money (yet). Some women were as eager to photograph us as we were to photograph them. Anyone who speaks English will probably try it on you. Modern Iran has not, to be honest, many monuments to recommend it. Villages are poor, mud-brick things. You can visit the ousted Shah's estate in Tehran, gracelessly decorated; there was once a statue of him there but only the boots, a yard high, are left. (The fabulous Peacock Throne, however, is to go on public show again). Khomeini's tomb, also in Tehran, is the main contemporary shrine: still unfinished, it looks like the Pompidou centre inside, all its service ducts exposed. There is no alcohol, and not much night life either, but you could try one of the Houses of Strength, gymnasiums in which brawny young men work out in unison while a leader plays a drum and chants the Shahnama, the Persian national epic poem. It makes for an odd mixture of aerobics, juggling, weight-lifting, dervish-whirling and recitation. At the end, the owner thanks all his visitors from Inglestan and wishes them a safe trip home. John Westbrooke travelled with Jasmin Tours. Tel: (0628)- 531121. There have been no guidebooks for 20 years, although Lonely Planet has one in the works. The old ones are wildly enthusiastic about how progressive and popular the Shah was; Nagel's is the best of them. Bureaux de change and film are often unavailable. Take a universal bathplug, a headscarf (if female), a taste for rice, and some patience: Iranians are re-adjusting only slowly to tourists.</p>

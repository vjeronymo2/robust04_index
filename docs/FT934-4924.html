			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Airline stocks hit by levy Airline stocks suffered a torrid five minutes at the market finale yesterday as the chancellor announced the imposition of an airport tax from next October. Dealers quickly marked down related shares as investors rushed to sell, with backwardations - a situation when offer prices on the screen are below bid prices from other marketmakers - in both British Airways and BAA. Transport analysts were unwilling to estimate the effect of the measure on BA, the UK's largest carrier, although some suggested that yesterday's electric response was overdone, adding that the shares had enjoyed a good run in recent weeks. BA shares, initially higher, finished a net 8 down at 420p. On Wall Street, BA continued to slide. Airport operator BAA's sharp rise during earlier trading in London was scythed by the 4.25 pm announcement, the stock closing just 2 up at 929p, after 939p. Elsewhere, tour operator Airtours weakened 6 to 435p, while rival Owners Abroad slipped 3 to 75p. Benefiting from the fallout was P&amp;O, the ferry company, which forged ahead 17 to 608p. The stock also gained from a survey indicating consumer concern over using the Channel tunnel.</p>

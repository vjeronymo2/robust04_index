Instead of appearing as scheduled at 1800 hours, which was put  off first until 2000 hours and then until 2100 hours, he arrived  at the meeting with journalists only at 2300 hours on Tuesday  [22 March]. Only the hardest of the diehards were still  waiting. We did not wait in vain.    Just 20 minutes before the IMF delegation appeared in the  hall of the Zubovskiy Boulevard Press Center, Mr. Camdessus  revealed, he and Viktor Chernomyrdin had signed a joint  statement.    The theme running through it was the idea that the Russian  Government has decided to take additional steps to mobilize  income for the 1994 budget. In the next few days work should be  completed on the compilation of a joint government and Central  Bank memorandum on the Russian leadership's economic policy for  all of 1994. Following this, the managing director  [Camdessus] will be prepared to recommend that the IMF Board of  Directors ratify the decision to release to Russia the second  tranche of the $1.5-billion Systemic Transformations  Facility. Thus, realistically, the loan will become  available during April, in M. Camdessus' opinion.    In other words, the mechanism for releasing the second  tranche of the loan remains in principle the same as the one  used to allocate the first tranche last June. The situation in  the Russian economy a year ago was hardly any better than it is  today. The composition of the government has changed. This may  have influenced the talks.    The size of the budget deficit and the inflation rate at  year's end were the stumbling blocks in the long discussions  between the IMF chief and the prime minister and other  government members. The lack of coordination between approaches  and assessments initially created a sense of deadlock --  something which was reported by most of the Russian and foreign  media. Yet a specific result was objectively needed by both  partners. V. Chernomyrdin's government needed it in order to  assert its reformist image in the eyes of the international  community following the departure of the reformers; the IMF  needed it so as not to face an onslaught for the umpteenth time  from the critics of its policy toward Russia both within the  country itself and in the West. It was this convergence of  interests that ultimately resulted in the positive outcome.    "We do not have a single major problem left," Michel  Camdessus stated following the signing of the joint statement.  So just why did the Russian budget start looking better to the  IMF chief at the last minute -- where did its extra revenue come  from?    Necessary amendments, he explained, will be forthcoming in  previously highlighted areas -- certain dates for the receipt of  specific revenues will be amended, and individual tariffs and  taxes will be reviewed. Mr. Camdessus admitted that it has  always been difficult to collect taxes in Russia and to obtain  other revenue for the budget. Russians will now be helped to  remedy this state of affairs by IMF experts -- fiscal texts will  be drawn up more exactly, and a number of additional measures to  enhance the effectiveness of the tax system will also be  outlined.    The draft Russian budget faces one further test in the next  few days -- ratification by the Duma. Budgets generally find it  hard going to pass through any parliament in the world, the IMF  managing director noted. In order to get a better idea of the  Russian budget's chances, he also met with Ivan Rybkin and  Sergey Glazyev. In M. Camdessus' opinion, the parliamentarians  are prepared to adopt the budget, although there will probably  be some problems.</p>

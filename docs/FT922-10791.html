			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / German employers hold firm as strike widens THE GERMAN public sector strike spread yesterday, halting public transport throughout the Ruhr industrial region and causing huge traffic jams on the motorways, as both sides dug in for an extended battle. The oTV public service union promised to call out refuse disposal workers across the country today in a deliberate escalation of the wage conflict with both central and local government employers. Up to 4m metal and engineering workers have threatened large-scale warning stoppages, also beginning today. More rail and post workers came out, causing further train delays and a mounting mail backlog. Most people got to work, however. There was no sign of any softening in the employers' position, although all three chief negotiators appealed for a return to the negotiating table. The employers refuse to improve on the volume of their pay offer above 4.8 per cent, although they are talking of more money for the low paid, and possible improvements in fringe benefits. The worst chaos yesterday was around the city of Dusseldorf, the capital of North Rhine-Westphalia, where traffic jams of up to 60km were reported from the surrounding motorways. Commuters had to walk, cycle or drive to work in private cars or taxis, causing a boom in both cycle-hire and taxi fares in the Ruhr region. The deliberate escalation of the conflict was announced in Stuttgart by Mr Wolfgang Warburg, deputy leader of the oTV. Some 170,000 workers were reported on strike yesterday, compared with 75,000 on Monday. He said that refuse workers would come out across the country today, as well as hospital administration workers in six cities  - Heidelberg, Ludwigsburg, Ulm, Duisburg, Cologne and Munich. 'We must step up the pressure,' Mr Warburg told an open-air press conference outside the union headquarters, after the building was evacuated for a bomb threat. Rubbish strikes began yesterday in three states, but the main focus was on disruption of public transport. Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, the militant oTV leader, told a Duisburg strike meeting: 'We will strike until the employers make a new and better offer.' Chancellor Helmut Kohl, although officially aloof from the conflict, is insisting that the pay deal must remain below 5 per cent, against a union pay claim of 9.5 per cent, and an arbitration tribunal award (rejected by the employers) of 5.4 per cent. Mrs Wulf-Mathies says the union would have accepted 5.4 per cent, but now wants more. Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, is urging the employers to pay the 5.4 per cent. The strike takes place against a background of confused economic signals. Latest figures for industrial production in eastern Germany  - where workers are not on strike  - showed a new slump of 4.5 per cent in January, with a fall of 8.5 per cent in manufacturing industry. On the other hand, the engineering industry reported a real increase in orders of 7 per cent in March.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) Section 1201.4(d) is amended to clarify the definition of ``appropriate'' office for purposes of filings with the Board. On March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14739), the Board published a revision to its rules in appendix II and appendix III of this part to reflect the realignment of its regional office structure into six regional and five field offices. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  explaining that revision, the Board stated in part: ``Appeals and related matters will continue to be filed with either the regional or field office having geographic jurisdiction.'' The Board is now amending &sect;1201.4(d) to specifically include field offices, as well as regional offices, in the definition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Section 1201.22(a) is amended to clarify that appeals and responses to appeals are to be filed with the appropriate Board regional or field office. See explanation in paragraph (e) above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Section 1201.37(a) is amended by deleting the reference to ``&sect;1201.116'' and replacing it with ``&sect;1201.117.'' On June 16, 1994 (59 FR 30863), the Board published an amendment to its rules in this part that revised &sect;1201.115, redesignated &sect;&sect;1201.116 through 1201.119 as &sect;&sect;1201.117 through 1201.120, respectively, and added a new &sect;1201.116. Because the former &sect;1201.116 was redesignated as &sect;1201.117, the Board is now making a conforming amendment to the cross-reference to that section in &sect;1201.37(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Section 1201.122(c) is amended by adding ``commercial overnight delivery'' as a method of filing and service. On July 7, 1993 (58 FR 36345), the Board amended its rules in subparts B and C of this part to permit filing and service of appeals and petitions for review by commercial overnight delivery. The Board is now amending &sect;1201.122(c) to conform the method of filing and service requirements for Special Counsel complaints and proposed agency actions against administrative law judges in subpart D of this part to those for appeals and petitions for review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Section 1201.163(c)(1) is amended to clarify that mixed case appeals governed by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978 are to be filed with the appropriate Board regional or field office. See explanation in paragraph (e) above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Section 1201.182(a) and &sect;1201.182(c) are amended to clarify that petitions for enforcement of orders issued under the Board's appellate jurisdiction are to be filed with the appropriate Board regional or field office. See explanation in paragraph (e) above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Appendix I is amended by substituting the revised October 1994 edition of the MSPB Appeal Form, Optional Form 283 (Rev. 10/94), for the July 1991 edition. The form has been revised as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

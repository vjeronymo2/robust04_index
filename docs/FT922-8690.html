			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Hughes to pay Dollars 450m for General Dynamics business HUGHES Aircraft is paying Dollars 450m in stock to buy the missiles business of General Dynamics in an important re-alignment of the US missiles manufacturing sector. General Dynamics, the second largest US defence contractor, announced last week it intended to sell its missiles operations as part of a programme to divest non-core assets. Hughes, a subsidiary of automotive manufacturer, General Motors, confirmed then it was negotiating to buy the business. The deal will make Hughes one of the largest missiles manufacturers in the US, roughly the same size as Raytheon, which also tried to buy General Dynamics' business. Hughes already employs 7,300 people making the AMRAAM advanced medium range air-to-air missile, the Phoenix air-to-air missile, the Maverick air-to-ground missile and the TOW anti-tank missile. The General Dynamics businesses employs 9,000 on programmes which include the Standard shipboard surface-to-air missile, the Stinger anti-aircraft missile and the Tomahawk sea-launched cruise missile. The deal, which is likely to lead to job losses as the two businesses are consolidated, is one of the largest examples of the rationalisation in the US defence industry as it grapples with sharply reduced Pentagon spending on weapons systems. Mr Michael Armstrong, chairman of Hughes, said the deal should have a favourable impact on earnings and would enhance the company's ability to be competitive in a wide range of missile systems. The takeover, still subject to approval by the Defense Department and anti-trust regulators, involves Hughes issuing General Dynamics with some 21.5m of its GM Class H common stock, which General Dynamics would quickly sell off in a secondary offering. Hughes said the purchase was not expected to dilute Class H earnings per share. Mr William Anders, chairman of General Dynamics, said the deal would allow his company to 'build further financial strength as we focus on strengthening our four core defence businesses'.</p>

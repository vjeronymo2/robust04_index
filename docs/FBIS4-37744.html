			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus (SANA) -- The working class has renewed its  pledge of loyalty, commitment, and allegiance to President Hafiz  al- Asad on the occasion of holding the fourth session of the  General Council of the General Federation of Workers Union. The  cable says:    The General Council of the General Federation of Workers  Union meeting in its fourth session renews to you the pledge of  loyalty, affection, and commitment which our working class has  believed in and considered a firm course for its struggle, which  depends on your generous offers and directives and adheres to  the national and pan-Arab constants which you have affirmed and  which have been entrenched in our national march and productive  process so that Syria under your leadership will be the pioneer  of struggle for liberating the occupied Arab territory,  restoring usurped rights, and preserving Arab solidarity as the  course for mobilizing Arab potentials in face of the challenges  threatening the present and future of the Arab nation.    Our General Council held deep discussions on the recent Arab  and international developments and their repercussions on our  people and working class and was in close touch with the  successive events. It affirmed its adherence to rights under  all circumstances and its readiness for all the proposed  possibilities for achieving a just and comprehensive solution  without abandoning or conceding any inch of the occupied  territory. We recall your words that there is not a single  house in Syria which has not lost a martyr in defense of the  homeland, the nation, and Arab rights. For the sake of these  martyrs and their sons and families we want the peace of the  brave; a real, viable peace which will last and guarantee  everyone's interests and give everyone his rights.    We pledge to interpret your words into action and creative  initiative in the field production and services and to improve  the standard of our trade union performance in the work sites  and in all fields in order to overcome existing hardships. Our  working class and its trade unionist organizations are loyal and  committed to the course which has been chosen by our party and  National Progressive Front under your wise leadership in order  to protect national gains and achievements, develop national  production in all fields, and safeguard the great generous offer  [wage increase] which you granted the sons and daughters of the  working class on their world labor day.    Our workers will remain loyal soldiers committed to the  national and pan-Arab march under your wise and courageous  leadership until the achievement of our nation's objectives of  unity, freedom, and socialism.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Arts: Dance Umbrella - Ballet The evenings grow chill, and post-modern dancers huddle together for shelter under the Dance Umbrella as autumn takes hold. This year's jamboree began on Wednesday night at Riverside Studios with two recent works from Siobhan Davies performed by her troupe. They are planned, I suppose, as contrasting aspects of her creativity. Make-Make is dark, constrained, and something of a bore. But White Bird Featherless is light-filled, as teasing as one might expect from a piece whose title is owed to an 18th century riddle, and wonderfully bold and inventive in movement. Make-Make (and what does that mean?) begins glumly with the sound of a storm, rain pouring down a huge plastic sheet at the back of the dance area, a layered babble of ethnic keening as sound-track, and figures looming in the gloaming. We could be in any English holiday resort out of season. Where we are, in fact, is an 'island' conceived by Miss Davies as a pen in which to confine her six dancers. They make dull gestures and awkward mime. Small cells of movement are generated, and build to a crescendo before the dance returns to its original anxious signallings. There is one intriguing duet, but the choreography does not flatter the dancers - they look costive, and less than interesting. It was Sean Feldman who made the piece bearable for me. His style is mercurial, quick-muscled, admirably varied and vivid in dynamics. This bright gleam apart, the rain fell incessantly: il pleure dans mon coeur comme il pleut sur la ville is the message. Happily, White Bird Featherless showed us Siobhan Davies at her very best. The piece is visually ravishing. A black setting has three looking glasses on either side of the dance area. Peter Mumford casts a chequer-board of light on to the floor. Antony Macdonald dresses the six members of the cast in handsome white unisex outfits (trousers; flimsy shirts; armoured-looking jerkins). The properties are cheerfully coloured wooden apples, pears, pineapples, which feature in incidents that tease, intrigue, but never obtrude into the clear fabric of the dance. Movement is inspired and enriched - Siobhan Davies needs good music for her dances - by Gerald Barry's strong score for two pianos and countertenor. The white costuming, the shifting squares of light, encourage a first impression of luminous, radiant action. But it is the dance itself, at times buoyant and resourceful in mingling solos and ensembles, then contemplative and questioning, which has the brightest glow. In its dynamic variety, in its freshness of impetus, it shows Davies working at the very top of her considerable form: caught up with ideas of movement itself, and eschewing any introversion, it thrills the viewer. The cast looked fine, with Gill Clark and Deborah Saxon having inspired some rewarding incidents. But it was Mr Feldman, a newcomer to the troupe, who again held the eye, notably in a solo that celebrated his light, sweeping jump and the speed and richness of his response to a pose or a quick change of direction in step. It is dancing of great distinction in a work no less excellent. Let it please be filmed. The Siobhan Davies Dance Company continues at Riverside Studios until Oct. 17; thereafter the company visits Sheffield, Cambridge, Newcastle upon Tyne.</p>

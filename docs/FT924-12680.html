			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Brazil becomes computer compatible - A notorious ban on informatics trade is to give way to tariffs BRAZIL's notorious informatics laws, which prevented imports of foreign computers and ensured the country missed out on much of the 1980s technological revolution, are to be abolished next week. In spite of the fact that a combination of tariffs and high taxes will continue to keep computer prices high, big-name companies such as Digital Equipment Corporation, NEC, IBM, Acer, Bull and Hewlett-Packard are among at least 13 foreign corporations which have already announced partnerships with local companies to manufacture or distribute their products. A further 20 or more deals with foreign companies were signed at a Sao Paulo computer trade fair last month, according to Mr Carlos Rocha, president of the Brazilian Computer Industry Association. Jockeying for position - by both foreigners anxious to get at a Dollars 7bn market and locals intent on survival under new rules - has been fierce since Congress passed the law late last year. Under that law, which comes into effect on October 28, import restrictions will be lifted, though some relaxation of import rules has already taken place. Gradually declining tariffs - which from the start of this month range from 40 per cent for finished products to zero for vital components not produced locally - will now present the main impediment to imports of digital technology for both computers and telecommunications equipment. Barriers to local manufacturing by foreign companies will be dismantled. The only previous exceptions were for mainframe manufacturing by IBM and Unisys, whose product lines had no local competition. The old Brazilian legislation, established by the military government in the 1970s, has long been cited by free traders as a perverse example of the protectionist policies common in Latin America at the time. Not only did the Brazilian computer industry get stuffed into a technological time capsule, missing out on many advancements of the 1980s, but the entire economy suffered as all sectors were denied access to efficiency-boosting technology. The new law encourages joint ventures: foreign partners may own 49 per cent of voting shares, and 100 per cent of non-voting shares, and the resulting company can still qualify for preferential treatment as 'Brazilian' when bidding for government contracts and credit. Traditional arguments for partnerships are evident as well. 'We've got the technology, and they've got good manufacturing capabilities,' explained Mr Thomas Offutt, vice-president for international sales of Link Technologies, a California-based maker of video terminals, about his agreement with Sao Paulo-based TDA. The new regulations have also been predated by liberal import approval policies by once-pernickety Brazilian authorities. 'The opening began over a year ago,' said Mr Zeke Wimert, president of Oracle do Brasil, subsidiary of the US software company. 'You could bring in any hardware you wanted if you could justify it.' At the trade fair last month, Oracle software was running on 28 different types of hardware, including Compaq and Digital systems. 'At last year's fair, they were all national makes,' said Mr Wimert, who is also president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Sao Paulo. Despite this influx, the Brazilian computer industry has yet to fade away, as some pundits expected, although production of micro-electronic products and computer accessories are down sharply. Mr Rocha admitted to a 'partial de-industrialisation'. Some of the more than 300 Brazilian hardware companies have indeed gone out of business or merged with competitors, but about 90 per cent of sales were already concentrated in about 70 companies, Mr Rocha said. 'We used to talk about 300 companies, but some of those were small businesses that just assembled kits.' Despite the dismantling of protectionist barriers, high tariffs and high taxes - with resulting high prices - will encourage the widespread contraband market, especially in components and personal computers. Mr Rocha estimated that of the 250,000 units of microcomputers and accessories sold each year in Brazil, about 150,000 were smuggled into the country.  -------------------------------------------------------------------              BRAZIL: Informatics import duties (Percent)  -------------------------------------------------------------------                         July 92   July/Oct 92   Oct 92   July 93  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Microprocessors and liquid crystal displays                 30-50          0          0        0  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Unassembled printed circuits          30           20         20       15  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Semiconductors            40           20         20       15  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Subassemblies and modules              35-50       30-40      25-35    20-30  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Finished products         50           45         40       35  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Brazilian Department of Foreign Trade  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

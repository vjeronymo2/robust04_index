			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Dutch rail dispute deadlock A train strike in the Netherlands threatens to go into a second day today after management and unions failed to resolve their conflict about the proposed loss of 470 jobs. The management of state-owned Dutch Rail, which wants to eliminate jobs among drivers and conductors as part of a wider reorganisation plan, has refused to meet the unions again while the stoppages continue. The Dutch rail system ground to a virtual halt yesterday with the exception of a few local train services in the east and south of the country. International train services into Belgium and Germany were also cancelled. Yesterday's 24-hour strike followed stoppages during the morning rush hour last Wednesday.</p>

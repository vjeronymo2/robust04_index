			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Foreign and US influences depress Dow Wall Street HEAVY losses on foreign equity markets and disappointment with recent second quarter corporate earnings left US share prices lower across the board yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 28.64 down at 3,303.00, but well above the low for the session when almost a 50-point fall was recorded. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.87 at 413.75, while the American SE composite closed 2.03 lower at 384.52 and the Nasdaq composite 6.24 weaker at 564.28. Turnover on the New York SE was light at 165.7m shares. Analysts had expected equities to open weaker after last Friday's disappointing earnings from IBM and the overnight losses in Japanese, UK and continental European exchanges, and the New York markets duly obliged. The early selling was heavy, reflecting concern about the global economy, the weak nature of the US recovery and, to a lesser extent, the vulnerable state of the dollar which prompted co-ordinated intervention by the world's central banks yesterday. Second quarter corporate results, many of which have come in below expectations, also continued to depress market sentiment. Dealing in IBM was delayed at the opening because of an order imbalance on the sell side. When trading finally commenced, IBM fell Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 92 7/8 in turnover of 2.9m shares. This followed a series of downgradings by analysts, who quickly lowered their forecasts for full-year earnings in the wake of Friday's second quarter figures. Many stocks registered losses in spite of satisfactory quarterly profits. Merck was one such case, dipping Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 49 3/8 after the drug company, the biggest single component in the Dow average, announced a second quarter profit of 57 cents a share, up from 48 cents a year ago and in line with market estimates. Among the stocks to buck the trend, BankAmerica advanced Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 as Wall Street analysts applauded the banking group's second quarter net income of Dollars 240m, achieved in spite of considerable costs related to the recently completed merger with Security Pacific. Transamerica was another to post a rare gain, adding Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 45 3/8 after the financial services group revealed plans to divest its property and casualty operations. The company also made positive noises about second quarter income. Upjohn firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 32 1/4 on stating that a government-appointed scientific advisory committee in the UK had recommended that Upjohn's sleeping drug Halcion be allowed back into the UK market. On the Nasdaq, First Federal Savings &amp; Loan jumped Dollars 8 3/4 to Dollars 42 3/4 on news that the company would be bought by Society Corp for Dollars 45 a share in a deal worth Dollars 141m. Canada TORONTO stocks tended to follow other world markets lower, but the TSE 300 index closed only 10.4 off on balance at 3,452.6. Declines led advances by 297 to 212 after a moderate volume of 24.8m shares valued at CDollars 264.2m. Toronto Sun Publishing, up CDollars  3/8 at CDollars 16 1/2, reported a second quarter profit of 14 cents a share, compared with year earlier earnings of 5 cents.</p>

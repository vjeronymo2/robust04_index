			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists on  May 17 sent the overseas-based AWACs to the sky above South  Korea to stage a joint air war exercise against the North with  the puppets in the skies above Muju, Nonsan, Yoju and Yongwol,  according to military sources.    The war gamble was aimed at testing the feasibility of the  AWACs "E-3" command over combined flying corps and the accuracy  of joint surprise strike at targets.    On the same day, the South Korean puppets deployed 10  large-calibre guns, commandos, more than 100 military vehicles  and thousands of puppet armed bandits in Paju County.    Meanwhile, the puppet tank groups deployed in Paju County  fired scores of shells near the demilitarized zone of the  military demarcation line and puppet armed helicopters launched  support exercises for missile attack operation and ground attack  in the sky above Yonchon County and Chorwon County, South Korean  Kangwon Province.</p>

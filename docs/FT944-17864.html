			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Broadcasters may develop digital decoder The BBC, Channel 4 and the ITV companies have started discussions on the possibility of developing their own encryption system to decode digital television transmissions. The talks, disclosed in Electronics Times, the trade magazine, are still at a preliminary stage. Mr Ken Sheppard, chief engineer of LWT, one of the biggest ITV companies, said: 'It's still very early days,' but confirmed that the broadcasters were considering developing their own system. Digital television, which should be able to offer a wider range of services to viewers than the existing analogue format, could start as early as the end of next year. Satellite channels are expected to be the first to go digital, followed by the terrestrial channels from late 1997. The BBC, Channel 4 and the ITV companies are planning how to market and deliver their digital services. One option would be for them to buy the encryption system developed by British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television network in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. BSkyB hopes to take the lead in digital satellite television and has invested heavily to create sophisticated descrambling and subscription management facilities. The terrestrial broadcasters have, however, expressed fears about the risk of BSkyB exploiting its dominant market position. These concerns were heightened in the row over the code of conduct unveiled last week by the European Digital Video Broadcasting project, which in theory will allow one company to dominate access to digital television. As a result the UK broadcasters are exploring other options, including the possibility of joining forces with a set-top box manufacturer. At the European Digital Video Broadcasting project meeting in Geneva last week 12 broadcasters voted against the new code of conduct and 17 voted in favour.</p>

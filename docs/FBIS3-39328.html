			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Muslim Premier Haris Silajdzic by </F> Bob Kroon in Geneva; date not given: "Silajdzic Counts on  American-Russian Cooperation"; first two paragraphs are GAZET  VAN ANTWERPEN introduction]    [Text] Although the talks in Geneva have stalled, the  diplomatic activity is more hectic than ever just one week  before possible actions by NATO. The United States is counting  on "Russia playing a constructive role," and expects Moscow to  exert pressure on Serbian President Milosevic. Meanwhile,  together with Germany and Turkey, the United States will place  Croatian President Tudjman and Bosnian Leader Izetbegovic under  pressure.    Bosnian Muslim Premier Haris Silajdzic says that he is very  pleased with Clinton's radical change of tack. "The Serbs could  always count on the support of the Russians, whereas Washington  kept out of harm's way," he said, before returning to Sarajevo.  "Now the balance has finally been restored. Bosnia is not an  isolated problem. It concerns Europe and the whole world. The  ultimatum should have been announced last year, then a great  deal of suffering would have been spared."    [Kroon] Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic has said that he will  only withdraw his heavy weapons if the numerically stronger  Muslim troops return to their barracks. Was that the agreement?    [Silajdzic] Absolutely not. There are more than eight  million Serbs, several times the number of Bosnian Muslims.  However, we are much more motivated, because we are fighting  for our homeland. Karadzic is bluffing. I do not think that he  wants NATO on his back.    [Kroon] Karadzic says that air strikes would mean the end of  NATO, and he cannot guarantee the protection of international  aid workers in the chaos that might result from them.    [Silajdzic] That is laughable. And as for the aid convoys,  the Serbs are protecting them so well that most of them never  even reach their destination.    [Kroon] You feel strengthened by U.S. support. Does that  mean that you will no longer be satisfied with a tripartite  division, according to which the Muslims are allocated 33  percent of Bosnia?    [Silajdzic] We are still proceeding on the basis of a  three-way split. However, the issue is not whether we get 33 or  33.3 percent. We want habitable areas in both eastern and  western Bosnia, areas to which the refugees can return.    [Kroon] Do you see any possibilities of forming a coalition  with the Croats, now that Nationalist Leader Boban has been  shunted onto the sidelines?    [Silajdzic] That would be an extremely logical development.  The new delegation leader Akmadzic seems willing to cooperate.  A coalition between the Muslims and Croats would solve a number  of problems, both for us and for them. However, Akmadzic is  still demanding Mostar as the capital of Croatian territory in  Bosnia, and we cannot accept this. The majority of the  population of Mostar is Muslim, it is not a Croatian city.  Furthermore, it was they who barbarously reduced Mostar -- one  of the most beautiful cities in Europe -- to rubble. Mostar  belongs to all sectors of the population.    [Kroon] What is your view of the new developments?    [Silajdzic] I hope that the Russians actually cooperate with  the United States. If they do, then the problem can be resolved  within several months. However, President Yeltsin is facing  difficulties. Many Russian generals regard people like Karadzic  and General Mladic as some kind of brothers-in-arms. Moreover,  we should not underestimate the problem posed by someone like  Zhirinovskiy, as happened way back in the case of derided artist  Adolf Hitler. However, it is not Zhirinovskiy himself, but  rather what he embodies that is the issue -- the frustrations  and apparent hopelessness of the situation in Russia. That  neofascist Milosevic in Belgrade remains one of the main guilty  parties. If the Russians can bring him into line, then we will  have come a whole step further.</p>

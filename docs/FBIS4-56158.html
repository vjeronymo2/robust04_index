			<p>BFN     [Editorial Report] Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in  Portuguese 26 Apr 94 p 1 reports that Central Bank Norms  Director Claudio Mauch has announced that as of 25 April the  banks are authorized to issue Bank Deposit Certificates, CDB's,  and Bank Deposit Receipts, RDB's, in Real Value Units, URV's.  These certificates will thus earn a lower annual interest rate  plus monetary correction which will be determined at the  maturity date. This means investors will know their profits on  the maturity date of the document. Savings accounts will  continue to earn the Referential Interest Rate, TR, plus a  6-percent annual interest. If the banks en mass adopt the URV,  the Central Bank will have to modify the TR calculation formula.  The TR is currently calculated on the interests paid by the  prefixed CDB which is a preestablished interest-earning paper  that does not receive monetary correction.</p>

Nadein-Rayevskiy: "Russia and the Central </F> Asian States: Chances of Integration"]    [Text] Tendencies toward integration and separation can be  seen in Russia's relations with the new states of Central Asia.  The former tendencies were submerged in the atmosphere of  euphoria in the sovereign entities after the collapse of the  USSR, but common interests have been having an increasingly  strong impact since that time. Mutual interests in the spheres  of economics, defense, security, and the protection of the  external borders of the CIS have the greatest integrating  potential. The factors contributing to separation include the  view of national statehood as the extreme form of isolation, the  search for new partners and "patrons" supposedly capable of  solving internal problems in the new independent republics, and  detachment from former "union relatives" in an attempt to  maintain the authority of the old elite.    Enough has already been said about the economy as one of the  major spheres of integration, and for this reason I will be  discussing other uniting factors.    The first of these is the defense sphere. Russia certainly  does not want its "soft underbelly" to turn into a zone of  confrontations and local wars. The Russians are still not  accustomed to seeing the strictly Russian borders as their own  boundaries. They are still thinking in terms of the union.  Furthermore, they are not the only ones: This is also true of  much of the population of Central Asia and Kazakhstan. The  presence of external dangers, particularly from Afghanistan and  Iran, probably will be acknowledged in the near future.    Security issues have also required a reassessment. Russia  does not have to guard against attacks by the traditional  enemies of the Russian empire and the USSR. Its "central"  location in Eurasia separates it from Europe by two buffer  zones: the territory of the former republics of the USSR and the  territory of the former socialist countries. These zones are a  more than adequate guarantee against any potential Western  threat to Russia. This double safety zone is also completely  adequate for Russia in the event of conventional warfare. The  USSR's longtime adversary--the United States--is dangerous only  in the event of a global conflict, which seems virtually  impossible at this time, particularly in view of the signed  nuclear arms reduction treaties.    Russia's longest border is with China, and China can  certainly be seen as a potential threat in some respects. The  Chinese leadership once tried to lay claim to 1.54 million  square kilometers of Soviet territory that is now part of Russia  and Kazakhstan, but no demands of this kind have been made in  recent years. China was given several hundred islands on the  Amur River after successful negotiations to settle these  disputes. There are no problems on the Russian-Korean and  Russian-Mongolian borders, and Norway and Finland have not made  any official territorial claims either.    The potential threat could come from our former associates  in  the empire, particularly if extremist, nationalist, or  religious-nationalist groups should rise to a position of power  there, especially now that some representatives of social  movements in the Central Asian states have already made  territorial claims on Russia. This is why Russia has an interest  in preserving the stability of moderate political regimes that  can maintain smooth interstate relations and encourage  integration processes within the CIS framework.    In view of current objective circumstances, Russia should  not  be the only one concerned about the security of external  borders. The Central Asian states have an equal interest in this  matter. Completely obvious sources of potential danger exist on  their southern borders. Above all, they include Iran, which has  exported revolution in the past, although the people of Iran are  no longer inclined to give all of the expansionist ambitions of  their leadership unconditional support. They also include  Afghanistan, which is in the midst of a civil war that is  gradually acquiring the features of an inter-ethnic and  inter-religious conflict. Tajiks and Uzbeks live on both sides  of the border of the former USSR, and there are several million  of them in Afghanistan. Ahmad-shah Masoud, the acknowledged  leader of the Afghan Dari (Tajiks), has effectively set up his  own state in the north of Afghanistan, while the unified state  in Tajikistan is still only in the formative stage. The  possibility of expansionist ambitions on the part of some  leaders of ethnic communities in Afghanistan cannot be excluded.  Although Tajikistan is far away from Russia and does not have  any common borders with it, Russian military units were  nevertheless drawn into the internal conflict there during the  civil war in that republic. Furthermore, the destabilization of  Tajikistan could disrupt the balance of power in the whole  region and jeopardize Russia's economic and political interests.    The situation in Turkmenistan, with its clearly defined  populist policy line, is more stable. The republic leadership,  headed by "Turkmen-bashi" ("Turkmen leader") Saparmurad Niyazov,  has a good chance of maintaining economic and, consequently,  social stability because of the republic's large supplies of  natural gas. In turn, social stability probably will allow the  authoritarian regime to retain strict control over all other  spheres of life in the state for a fairly long time.    The regime in Uzbekistan is more or less stable. President  Islam Karimov has provided hundreds of thousands of families  with land and low-income strata with stronger social guarantees,  which has allowed him to take a hard line in relations with the  opposition without any fear of mass demonstrations in support of  the opposition. When I. Karimov says: "Our people are not ready  for democracy," he is probably right in many respects, although  this position cannot appeal to the Russian leadership.    There is a regrettable tendency toward the ideologization of  interstate relations in Russian foreign policy. Their  development occasionally depends on feelings of sympathy or  antipathy for a particular regime, political order, or political  figure. I feel that this tendency could endanger Russia's  national interests, which consist primarily in the maintenance  of stability on its borders and in the region as a whole.    Complex problems in Russia's relations with the Central  Asian  states are connected with the Russian and Russian-speaking  population in the region. Kazakhstan has the largest Russian  community--6.2 million people. There were 1.6 million Russians  living in Uzbekistan in 1989 (now the number is lower), and  there were more than 900,000 in Kirghizia, over 300,000 in  Turkmenia, and approximately the same number in Tajikistan. This  factor could contribute to integration and separation in  Russia's relations with the countries of the region.    Before the revolution the Russian population lived mainly in  the cities serving as administrative centers of the empire and  reached a high level of assimilation there. The level of  integration was much lower for the new settlers of the Soviet  period. In addition to the construction workers and skilled  laborers who moved there during the period of industrialization,  there were also former convicts, who were forbidden to live in  Russia's big cities, and people with no definite social status.  The behavior and lifestyle of these last two groups did not  contribute to friendly relations between the Russians and the  native population and strengthened tendencies toward separation.    On the other hand, Russians play the key role in industrial  production in the region, and their departure will lead  unavoidably to a recession in industry and even to the closure  of enterprises. The leaders of the Central Asian republics are  trying to stop, or at least stem, the process of emigration,  while nationalist movements are doing the opposite--encouraging  it in every way possible. Unfortunately, the activities of the  latter have been much more effective, because governments  operate on the macrolevel while nationalists can influence  individuals. Threatening letters and telephone calls, physical  assaults, property damage, and other such actions have a greater  impact than official assurances of commitment to human rights  and liberties.    The emigrants from the Central Asian region in Russia are  more likely to play a separating role. Millions of refugees  could change public opinion in Russia dramatically, directing it  into the channels of negative feelings about the CIS.  Developments of this type, which are already apparent in several  regions, include the anti-Armenian demonstrations in Stavropol  and the anti-Caucasus feelings in large Russian cities (although  they are of a different nature). More and more people are  beginning to feel that Russia should "withdraw" from Central  Asia and the Caucasus.    Under certain circumstances the "Turkish factor" could  become  one of the external obstacles to Russia's integration with the  Central Asian states. When the new states of Central Asia were  choosing a development option, they turned to the Turkish model  first. This model, however, has certain distinctive features  preventing its use in its entirety and with the same degree of  effectiveness as in Turkey. First of all, the Turkish economy  was not as centralized and monopolized as the economies of the  Central Asian states when the changes started there in the early  1980s. In the second place, the Turks did not go through an era  of socialism and were not infected by its mentality. After all,  the Soviet people are convinced that someone is obligated to  help them: the state, "foreign countries," or their "big Russian  brother," and they are less likely to rely on themselves. Of  course, new attitudes have emerged in the region recently. The  Turkophile euphoria of late 1991 and the first half of 1992,  which was based on the anticipation of immediate miracles, is  beginning to give way to a more realistic approach, with  consideration for historical traditions, established ties, and  so forth. The lack of offers of generous financial aid, and the  fact that the "language common to all Turks" turned out to be a  myth, apparently played a role in this process. The languages of  the Turkic peoples are quite different from Turkish.  Furthermore, the prospect of integration with Russia and other  republics of the former USSR turned out to be much stronger than  Turkey expected. Finally, the possibilities of trade between  Central Asian republics and Turkey are limited. Turkey does not  need agricultural products, and Central Asian energy resources  are still inaccessible to Turkey because of the great distances,  the absence of a transport infrastructure, and the high cost of  establishing one. The high level of Europeanization in the  Central Asian republics could also play a role in the future. In  comparison with Turkey as a whole, rather than with Ankara,  Izmir, or Istanbul, the level of Europeanization is higher in  the former Soviet republics. This is likely to discourage the  "Turkish" view of the world, based on the supposed superiority  of the Turks to other people. The efforts to strengthen the  Turkish influence in the Central Asian republics have distinct  pan-Turkic features. The mass media were open to propaganda of  the pan-Turkic ideas of "Turkic unity" and the creation of  "Great Turan" ("Great Turkey," "Great Turkestan," etc.). The  traditional anti-Russian aims of the pan-Turkic movement will  work against the process of Russia's integration with Central  Asia.    Some of the internal Russian factors complicating Russia's  integration with the Central Asian states within the CIS  framework are purely psychological, but they can take the form  of actual policy. Above all, these include the nationalist  attitudes in Russia itself, which are frequently directed  against "foreigners." The collapse of the USSR contributed to  the growth of these attitudes. There is also the fear,  engendered by these attitudes, that Muslim Turks will eventually  constitute the majority in the "integrated" Commonwealth. These  fears were present even in the Brezhnev years and are nothing  new, but they have not promoted isolationist attitudes until  now. Overcoming them in a short time would be difficult,  especially when everyday life is more likely to strengthen them.    Therefore, we still are not completely cognizant of the  importance of the Central Asian region in Russian foreign  policy. We still have not completely recognized the economic  interests dictating the need for closer cooperation with the  countries of Central Asia. The actual intensification of  integration processes within the CIS will depend largely on the  development of Russia itself, on the success or failure of its  reforms.

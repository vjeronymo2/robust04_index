			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / UK Company News: B&amp;J meeting likely to be adjourned Today's extraordinary meeting at troubled retailer Brown &amp; Jackson to consider a capital injection by Mr Gerald and Mrs Vera Weisfeld, will no longer mark the Glaswegian couple's triumphant return to discount retailing. A motion to adjourn the meeting will probably be approved by shareholders, paving the way for their later consideration of a newer bid by Pepkor, the South African retailer. Pepkor's offer of a capital injection of up to Pounds 56.2m is double the maximum investment by the Weisfelds. The Weisfelds, who founded the Whatever Everyone Wants clothing chain, have remained silent since their offer was gazumped, leaving no indication of whether they are prepared to enter a bidding war. The B&amp;J board is unanimously supporting the Pepkor offer, but the Weisfelds have more than three weeks to counter bid, before the South African proposals go before shareholders. Pepkor would provide a Pounds 12m secured five-year trade finance agreement. In addition, it proposes to pay Pounds 500,000 for 12.5m new shares and buy Pounds 7.5m of secured convertible loan stock, convertible into 187.5m shares. It would pay Pounds 77,200 for unsecured loan stock, carrying the rights to subscribe for 772m new shares at 5p, raising Pounds 38.6m. Finally, it would take options to buy 128m shares at a price of either 2.5p, 5p, or 7.5p, depending on the timing of exercise. This would raise between Pounds 3.2m and Pounds 9.6m. The Weisfelds were proposing an initial Pounds 6m capital injection, and an investment package worth a maximum of Pounds 28m.</p>

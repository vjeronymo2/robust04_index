			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> ZINMAN LEADS RUSSIAN PROGRAM AT HOLLYWOOD BOWL  </P> <P> In the same way the Los Angeles Philharmonic had renewed its credentials as a  Ravel orchestra earlier in the week, so did it prove again Thursday night in  Hollywood Bowl what an expert band it remains in music of Russian composers.  </P> <P> David Zinman, the largely unsung American conductor of wide and deep  accomplishment, was the instigator of this exemplary demonstration, in a  program listing Mussorgsky's Prelude to "Khovanshchina," the Second Piano  Concerto by Rachmaninoff, and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 2.  </P> <P> To all three works Zinman brought a clear sense of structure and line, plus  intense but never finicky detailing. Our Philharmonic responded with admirable  soloism, exact balances and a handsome palette of sounds.  </P> <P> The Tchaikovsky work became at once compelling in its rhetoric and natural in  its tone of conversation. A strong arch of thought seemed to connect the  movements, and there was at the end a real sense of resolution. Among many  others, hornist Jerry Folsom distinguished himself. The Mussorgsky piece, too,  found the orchestra in fine voice and high mettle.  </P> <P> At midprogram, however, a weak link emerged in this event (heard, it is  reported, by an audience of 10,761). It was a half-realized, competent and  unremarkable run-through of Rachmaninoff's familiar C-minor Concerto by Yefim  Bronfman.  </P> <P> A familiar figure on local stages since his Philharmonic debut in 1977,  Bronfman this time around did not justify his engagement; he showed no  compelling personal identification with the composer or the piece, raised no  musical temperatures and failed to remind us why we love this music.

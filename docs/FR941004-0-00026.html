			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that these rules contain deadlines for action on transit projects and HOV lanes. It is true that the Transit System Improvement rule 310 CMR 7.36(3) provides for delays in the deadlines listed in section 7.36(2) for up to three years, but it is also clear that at the end of those three years, either the project must be completed or there must be a proposed substitute. While it might be more desirable to have a fixed completion deadline without the ``escape valve'' for project delays in section 7.36(3), EPA cannot conclude that the possible three year delay authorized by this section causes these rules to violate any obligation to implement TCMs as expeditiously as practicable. Massachusetts has assembled an impressive roster of transportation measures, many of which must be implemented by the attainment year of 1999, even allowing for the possible three year delay. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, section 7.36(2)(c)1. requires the Old Colony Commuter Rail Line Extension, one of the most significant transportation measures in 7.36, to be ``complete and open to full public use'' by December 31, 1996. Even the worst case scenario of a full three year delay would have the Old Colony in full use only 46 days after the attainment deadline for the Commonwealth, November 15, 1999.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Massachusetts DEP's comment advised EPA that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts may be developing changes to the transit improvement and HOV rules that could be submitted to EPA in calendar 1994. DEP suggested that it might be prudent for EPA to delay final action on these rules until EPA receives MA DEP's revisions. MA DEP did not, however, ask to withdraw the rules from EPA's consideration as a SIP revision. While EPA appreciates DEP's desire to avoid iterative SIP actions on these rules, EPA has an obligation to process SIP revisions consistent with section 110(k) of the Act to the extent practicable, including the requirement to act on the SIP submission within a year of deeming it complete. Furthermore, MA DEP has not clearly withdrawn this SIP action. At most their comment appears to be a suggestion to EPA about how to avoid repetitive rulemakings. EPA cannot suspend its statutory obligation to act on SIP submittals without a clear expression from a state that it is withdrawing the package. Suspending final action on these rules in anticipation of rule changes that EPA has not yet seen in draft would only aggravate any delays in processing these rules as a SIP revision to accommodate what is now a speculative rule change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is approving the Transit Systems Improvements and High Occupancy Vehicle Facilities in the Metropolitan Boston Air Pollution Control District as a revision to the Massachusetts SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et. seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The U.S. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

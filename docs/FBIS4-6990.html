			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Apr 25 (ANTARA) -- China will not interfere  with the Indonesian Government's way of handling the recent  riots in Medan, North Sumatera, which resulted in attacks  against ethnic Chinese in the city.    After a meeting with President Suharto here on Monday,  China's Vice Speaker Wang Guang Ying told the press that Beijing  does not want to interfere with the internal affairs of any  country.    "China does not want to intervene," said Ying who met the  head of the state in his capacity as the chairman of the  Indonesia-China Association for Social and Cultural affairs.    Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin last week made  a statement urging the Indonesian Government to defuse the  tension in North Sumatera which was rocked by violent  anti-ethnic Chinese rioting.</p>

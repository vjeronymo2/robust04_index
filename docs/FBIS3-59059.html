			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wolfgang Piller, president of the Federal </F> Association of German Aerospace and Defense Industries, by  unattributed FOCUS reporter; place and date not given: "Bonn  Should Not Vacillate"]    [Text] [FOCUS] The defense industry has empty order books  and an uncertain future. How do you feel as a German defense  industry manager?    [Piller] I feel better than a year ago, when I was elected  president of the Federal Association of German Aerospace and  Defense Industries. I feel better, because public opinion has  increasingly come to believe that the serious problems that  people face, such as security, information, communications,  mobility, and, last, but not least, environmental protection  cannot be solved without the skills of the aerospace and defense  industries. I would feel even better if Bonn believed that an  economy that has maintained one of the highest standards of  living in the world does not want want to disregard an area of  such valuable net output.    [FOCUS] So, what are the greatest problems that the defense  industry faces?    [Piller] We see ourselves increasingly confronted with  reductions in the Bundeswehr procurement budget for which  provision cannot be made. The quota for investment has fallen  from 30 percent to 20 percent. Now we have got 15 percent, if I  leave aside socks, underwear, and boots, which have nothing to  do with high-tech products. There is no industry in the world  that can survive that without being damaged.    [FOCUS] You have called for a relaxation of the rules  governing German weapons exports. Do you consider that to be a  general panacea that will save the German aerospace and defense  industries?    [Piller] No, not at all. We do not advocate the  unrestricted export of defense goods to all corners of the  world. We are not concerned about a relaxation, but more about  cross-border opportunities for cooperation on the part of the  aerospace industry through the introduction of uniform  regulations for all the countries in Europe. The aerospace  industry is dependent on international cooperation for its  survival. That is why there must now be some uniformity in the  rules governing exports of weapons.    [FOCUS] Would you place the entire blame for the collapse of  the German defense industry on Bonn?    [Piller] No. At the moment, our markets have declined for  various reasons. The end of the East-West confrontation has had  a significant impact on defense technology. However, a  significant part of the negative consequences of this  development in the industry are attributable to the fact that  the necessary political decisions -- for example, those  regarding the way in which the Bundeswehr has been equipped --  were made too slowly or not at all.    [FOCUS] Do you lack certainty with regard to planning?    [Piller] Absolutely. Aerospace projects must involve  long-term planning. For that, one needs guidelines for the  future stemming from a security policy that has been clearly  defined. Germany has still not sufficiently defined its role in  Europe and the rest of the world clearly enough.</p>

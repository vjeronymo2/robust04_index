			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ITALIAN DC-9 JETLINER CRASHES AND BURNS IN SWITZERLAND; 46 ABOARD DIE  </P> <P> An Alitalia DC-9 jetliner approaching Zurich airport crashed into a hillside  and burned Wednesday night, killing all 40 passengers and six crew members  aboard, police said.  </P> <P> Flight AZ404 of the Italian airline, coming from Milan, crashed about 8:20 p.m.  five miles north of Kloten International Airport outside Zurich, near the  village of Weiach, airport spokesman Peter Gutknecht said.  </P> <P> Witnesses reported what appeared to be fire and explosions before the plane  crashed into a wooded hill, Zurich police told a press conference.  </P> <P> Only a few on board were Italians, an Alitalia spokeswoman said. Italian  reports said most of the other passengers were apparently Swiss and Japanese.  Alitalia said it did not expect to publish a full passenger list before today.  </P> <P> The Swiss Federal Meteorological Office said that visibility at the time of the  crash was good -- up to 10 miles, with light rain and light winds. Early  reports had cited heavy rain.  </P> <P> Fire raged in the wreckage and woodside for at least 1 1/2 hours, police said.  </P> <P> Hanni Steffen, a nearby resident and a medic, said she rushed to the site but  all help appeared too late.  </P> <P> "The plane was burning like a volcano," she said.  </P> <P> Italy's state-run RAI television said first reports appear to discount the  possibility of a terrorist act but that the crash did not seem linked to the  weather.  </P> <P> The plane broke apart on impact. Smoking wreckage, covered with firefighting  foam, was scattered about the muddy hillside. The tail section had broken off.  One landing gear and a section of wing were also discernible.  </P> <P> The plane was on time after a 50-minute flight from Milan when it disappeared  from radar screens, Gutknecht said.  </P> <P> Swiss aviation authorities said they have begun an investigation, and Italian  authorities said they will dispatch a team of investigators.  </P></p>

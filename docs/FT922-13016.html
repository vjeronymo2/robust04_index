			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson Hanson's Pounds 132m sale of Ever Ready UK is bound to provoke a further rash of theories on what the company is up to. Perhaps the deal is evidence that Hanson is clearing the decks for the next megabid, now that the UK is re-confirmed as a free market paradise. Perhaps it is an admission of defeat, in that the Hanson method has been able to squeeze only so much out of Ever Ready before discarding it. Perhaps it is neither. In the context of Hanson's past deal-making, Pounds 132m is neither here nor there. As for the new Tory government holding the door open to takeovers, Hanson has not mounted a hostile bid since 1986. It may be that Hanson can do nothing more with Ever Ready. It is probably more relevant that the group is increasingly concentrating on a small number of large businesses. It would not do to exaggerate this; Hanson is still, for instance, one of the UK's biggest suppliers of elastic bands. But it seems at least plausible that the future of the company after Lords Hanson and White is that of a safe, dull dispenser of basic commodities such as coal, tobacco and gravel. Granted, this may not be a matter of choice. In retrospect, it is possible to see the 1980s as a period of unique opportunity for the classic acquisitive conglomerate. The world was awash with money, mistakes were covered up by asset inflation and equity investors were prepared to part with a Thomas Tilling or an SCM at silly prices. In today's world of dear money and low inflation, the risk of overpaying in a contested bid does not stack up any more. Far better to do as Hanson did with Beazer: pick a company crippled by debt and make the sums work by refinancing the debt at lower rates. The acquisitive conglomerates will still do the odd deal. But they may be buying from the banks rather than the equity market.</p>

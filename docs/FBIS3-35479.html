			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The follow-up committee of the mass gathering of the  sons of Shabwah Governorate has issued the following statement:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.    At a time when our Yemeni people received with great  satisfaction the signing of the accord document in the Jordanian  capital, Amman, and after it was hoped that a final countdown  would begin to resolve the political crisis, the Yemeni people  were surprised by a deterioration in the security and military  situation in Abyan Governorate. As a result, many people fell  as victims, even in this blessed month. These regrettable  incidents are sought by forces hostile to unity and democracy to  prevent the implementation of the accord document, which is a  safety mechanism for unity and democracy.    While receiving this regrettable news, we denounce these  incidents and consider them the beginning of a new political  crisis that could jeopardize our unity and life. We ask for a  prompt investigation and trial of the elements that sparked  these incidents so that the tragedy will not be repeated. We  also call for the removal of the causes of these incidents and  the prevention of further such irresponsible actions so they  will not expand beyond control.    We in the follow-up committee of the mass gathering for the  sons of Shabwah ask the political leadership to face up to its  responsibilities and begin the implementation of the accord  document, since they have signed and pledged to implement this  document. The document is a national program that has won the  consensus of the Yemeni people.    We also ask our brothers and sons in the Armed Forces, the  bulwark of Yemeni unity, not to disappoint this patient, loyal  people and to help implement this document. They should also  not be carried away by selfish whims and narrow interests. All  military units should remain in their positions since their  movement under these circumstances would delay the start of the  implementation of this document and threaten the homeland's  unity, security, and stability.    The sons of the Shabwah Governorate also assert that they  will be faithful to the implementation of the document to which  they have agreed upon in their gathering. They will  particularly spare their governorate all conflicts, military  skirmishes, and political confrontation. All military units  will remain in their original places to avoid any clashes, which  could claim many lives in the governorate. This governorate  will also refrain from causing any tension to spread to other  governorates so that the accord document can be implemented in  accordance with the agreed upon mechanism.    The follow-up committee also asks the political leadership  and the commanders of military units to honor the documents of  the mass gathering of the Shabwah Governorate and not to turn  the governorate into a battlefield or a source of tension for  other governorates.    May God grant us all success for the good, security, and  stability of this homeland.    Our Lord. Decide thou between us and our people in truth,  for thou art the best to decide. [Koranic verse]    Issued by the follow-up committee of the mass gathering of  the sons of Shabwah Governorate.</p>

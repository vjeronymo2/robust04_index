			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: FREQUENT FLIERS  </P> <P> Studios and producers often arrange special screenings for special-interest  groups. In the case of "Communion," based on writer Whitley Strieber's  best-selling account of his real-life abduction by aliens, that group was  extra-special: These were folks who also claim to have had Close Encounters.  </P> <P> Abductees and contactees -- that is, persons who claim to have been abducted or  contacted by extraterrestrials -- attended the screenings recently in N.Y.C.,  San Diego, San Antonio and St. Louis.  </P> <P> According to Lorie Barnes -- a chronic abductee who's also Strieber's secretary  -- the folks were rounded up via "Communion" network groups composed of  "hard-core" abductees/contactees in 15 states.  </P> <P> Barnes, 59, had her first contact with a UFO in 1954, she told us, when she saw  a blue flying saucer with flashing white lights that hovered about 50 feet  overhead. Four years later, she added, she was physically abducted -- like  Strieber, taken aboard a spaceship for examination. She said she's since been  abducted three other times physically, and numerous times "astrally."  </P> <P> An admittedly biased viewer -- Strieber wrote and co-produced the film --  Barnes liked it "tremendously," though she found some of the depicted aliens a  bit "plastic" looking.  </P> <P> As for the screening she attended in N.Y.C.: "Oh, there was lots of applause.  But not from everyone. Some people were also silent and thoughtful. You know,  the film had brought back scary memories."  </P> <P> Starring Christopher Walken as Strieber, the film -- from New Line Cinema --  opened last weekend to a down-to-earth $1 million in ticket sales.

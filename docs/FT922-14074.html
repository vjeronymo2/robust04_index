			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / O&amp;Y keen to meet Tube line payments OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the property developer, is seeking a new timescale on payments to secure an extension to the Jubilee underground line. O&amp;Y is apparently committed to paying its full contribution to the project and its legal representatives have been meeting London Transport in the hope of reaching an agreement. O&amp;Y was expected to pay the first instalment of Pounds 40m on March 31 but was unable to do so. However, the Department of Transport has said that if the agreement with O&amp;Y is not concluded before tomorrow's election, the first payment will fall due on the day the agreement is signed. Both O&amp;Y and London Transport are understood to have reluctantly concluded that the future of the extension will have to await the outcome of the election. Much will depend on O&amp;Y's debt talks with banks, due on Monday. London Transport would like O&amp;Y to stick as closely as possible to its original timescale but it is thought that the developer favours a more flexible approach. London Transport said last night: 'We are anxious to start this project as soon as possible but we cannot get the Secretary of State for Transport's approval until we have sorted out the funding.' Under proposals put to the department in 1989, O&amp;Y agreed to contribute Pounds 400m towards the Pounds 1.3bn project. A second instalment of O&amp;Y's contribution was scheduled for the end of March 1993, with the balance of Pounds 300m expected after completion of the extension in 1996. It is unclear whether a new timescale would delay the start of the project or would put pressure on the incoming government to increase its contribution at an earlier stage. The developer believes Labour has given conflicting signals. Ms Joan Ruddock has stated her support for the proposals but Mr John Prescott, the party's transport spokesman, has warned that the project was 'going to be thrown into the hands of the public sector'.

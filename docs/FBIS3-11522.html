			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Fernando Canzian and Fernanda Godoy] </F>   [Text] The Creditor Bank Advisory Committee at 1709  yesterday (1909 Brasilia time) released a communique informing  the international financial community that Brazil is willing to  conclude on 15 April an agreement to renegotiate its foreign  debt. The advisory committee's "waiver" will permit the  conclusion of an agreement on the $35 billion debt owed to  private creditor banks without the guarantee ("standby") of the  International Monetary Fund.    With a speech delivered in New York, and with the tone of a  candidate for president, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso took advantage of the proximity of the conclusion of the  agreement.    At least two-thirds of private creditor banks (out of a  total  of 440) need to give a positive answer to the Advisory  Committee's waiver before 24 March. If this does not happen  Brazil will need the IMF guarantee to sign the agreement. The  Committee's communique recommends that banks endorse the  agreement.    During an interview at the Intercontinental Hotel yesterday,  where he is staying, Cardoso said he is sure that creditor banks  would agree to the Advisory Committee's suggestion.    On 16 March the IMF refused to guarantee the agreement,  compelling Brazil to provide by itself -- without money from  international financial organizations -- the guarantees demanded  by creditor banks. On 15 April, Brazil will have to prove to  creditor banks that it has $2.8 billion in zero-coupons (U.S.  Treasury bonds with a 30-year maturity period and zero interest)  to guarantee the agreement.    "Brazil is a prudent country, and will know how to present  that guarantee," Cardoso said, without specifying whether the  country has already purchased the coupons from the secondary  market. Brazil could have purchased the bonds from the U.S.  Treasury at a lower price if it had had the IMF "standby."  According to the minister, the bonds will be deposited at the  BIS (Bank of International Settlements) in Basil, Switzerland,  on the date the agreement is signed. Financial market sources  have said that Brazil has already purchased those coupons.    The minister said the final negotiation of the debt  agreement  was "a nice, well-designed operation." But he refused to say  when or how Brazil purchased the zero-coupons that will be used  as a guarantee for the exchange of Brazilian debt certificates.    Cardoso said the agreement proves that Brazil is a "solvent"  country and "promotes economic growth, reduces the Brazilian  risk, and reduces international interest rates for the country."  Cardoso added that "the end" of the debt problem will make  growth more feasible, and will "strengthen any candidacy  supporting an economic program like the one we proposed."    He said Brazil has turned over a new leaf. "I am  particularly satisfied, because I have accompanied this process  for 11 years, since the time I was a senator," the minister  said. The signing of the agreement, he said, will facilitate  the entry of foreign financial resources into the Brazilian  economy. "The Brazilian risk will have to drop, the `spread'  [preceding word in English] (interest surcharge) will have to  drop," he said.</p>

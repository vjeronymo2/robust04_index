			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Zimbabwean Government, which last Friday [18  February] ordered the dismissal of all striking postal and  telecommunications workers, yesterday authorized the parastatal  body to reinstate them and award them a 12.5 percent salary  increase. The unprecedented move ended a week-long strike that  paralyzed the country's postal and telecommunication services.  Ten-thousand-five-hundred workers of the state-owned Post and  Telecommunications Corporation [PTC] downed their tools last  Wednesday after management failed to pay them a 12.5 percent  salary increase backdated to July 1992 and awarded to them by a  labor tribunal. The PTC refused to pay the increases and  appealed to the Supreme Court against the labor court ruling.  Meantime the workers' union leaders instructed all workers not  to go back to work since theoretically they had been fired.</p>

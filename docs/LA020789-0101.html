			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRIPES ABOUT AIRLINES RISE 50% IN JANUARY  </P> <P> Consumer complaints against major airlines rose 50% in January and airlines  reported increases in late flights and mishandled baggage at the end of last  year, but on-time performance was still well ahead of a year earlier, a  government report said Monday.  </P> <P> The Transportation Department, in its monthly consumer report on air travel,  said consumer complaints against the industry reported to the department went  from 724 in December -- the lowest level in four years -- to 1,086 in January.  But the new total was still a 70% improvement over the 3,674 complaints  received in January, 1988.  </P> <P> Complaints covered a wide variety of problems, including flight cancellations,  ticketing mistakes, difficulty in getting refunds, lost baggage, rude  employees, problems with smoking restrictions and claims of misleading  advertising.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Mishandled Baggage  </P> <P> The nation's 13 largest domestic carriers reported that 76.1% of their flights  were on time in December, compared to 77.7% a month earlier. The rate was still  nearly 10 points better than December, 1987, when one-third of all flights were  late.  </P> <P> A department news release blamed the busy Christmas-New Year holiday season for  an increase in mishandled baggage reports filed against the carriers in  December. The reports averaged 8.58 for each 1,000 passengers, compared to 6.17  in November.  </P> <P> The airlines covered in the monthly consumer report account for about 90% of  domestic flight revenue. Carriers are required to report on operations in and  out of the nation's 27 largest airports.  </P> <P> For the third month in a row, Eastern Airlines reported the best on-time  record, with 88.1% of its flights arriving within 15 minutes of posted time.  Earlier this year, Eastern was consistently among airlines with the most  delayed flights. The figures do not count fights delayed because of mechanical  problems.  </P> <P> Eastern was followed by Southwest, with 79.6% on time, and Delta, with 79.3%.  </P> <P> Piedmont had the worst record for mishandled baggage, 12.27 for each 1,000  passengers, and Southwest had the best, 4.59 for each 1,000.  </P> <P> Pan American had the most ticketed passengers denied seats on overbooked  flights, with 10.54 for each 10,000 boardings for the first nine months of  1988.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ON-TIME PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> Percentage of flights in December arriving on time. That is defined as arriving  within 15 minutes of the scheduled time.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.44IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> AIRLINE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> PERCENT  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Eastern  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 88.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Southwest  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 79.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Delta  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 79.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Northwest  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 77.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> USAir  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 76.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> America West  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 76.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Continental  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 75.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> American  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 75.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pan American  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 75.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Trans World  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 73.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Piedmont  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 71.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> United  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 69.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Alaska  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 76.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Department of Transportation  </P></p>

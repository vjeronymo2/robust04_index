			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Bundesbank cuts rate THE BUNDESBANK made a token gesture towards interest rate reductions when it shaved 0.01 per cent off its minimum security repurchase agreements, taking it down from 7.59 to 7.58 per cent, writes Gillian Tett. But the small scale of the reduction left the markets deeply uncertain about the likelihood of further interest rate cuts at today's meeting of the central bank's policy-making council. The deep recession in Germany, coupled with recent government spending cuts, left some traders hoping that the Bundesbank might be prodded into further action today, particularly in light of President Clinton's call for a cut in German rates yesterday. However, concern about German inflation left the majority sceptical that the Bundesbank would relax its policy. 'Everybody knows that interest rates have got to come down within the next month. But we would be surprised to see any real cut in the Lombard or discount rate this week,' commented one dealer. On the back of this speculation, the trading in D-Mark futures remained stuck within a very narrow band. After a day of heavy dealing, the September contract closed at 93.24, up 2 basis points on the day. At this level dealers are pricing three month money at 6.76 per cent. Trading in sterling futures in London markets was also lively. Speculation that sterling's growing strength against the D-Mark might increase the pressure for an interest rate cut later this year helped to push sterling futures slightly higher across the board. The September contract closed at 94.23, eight basis points up on the day. The December contract rose five basis points, closing at 94.38. Conditions in the London money markets were 'typical of the end of the month', according to one dealer, with most movements dominated by technical factors. Temporarily tight money conditions pushed the overnight rate towards 8 per cent during the morning. However, by the end of the day overnight rates had fallen back to 6 1/4 per cent, with little change on three month rates. After forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1.75bn, the Bank of England successfully removed most of this in a round of late assistance.</p>

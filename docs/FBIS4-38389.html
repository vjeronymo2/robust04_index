			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Simferopol, 30 May -- Deputies of the Crimean  Parliament have decided at the sittings of their commissions  that there are no grounds for rescinding their decision on  restoring the main points of the 1992 Constitution, which  provides for setting up a Crimean statehood and building  Crimea's relations with Ukraine on the basis of treaties. An  ITAR-TASS correspondent learned this from Viktor Mezhak, deputy  chairman of the Crimean Parliament.    Today is the deadline of the 10-day period during which, at  the demand of the Ukrainian Parliament, the Crimean Supreme  Council was to have brought the Crimean Constitution into  agreement with the Ukrainian Constitution currently in force and  with the law on the division of powers between the state power  bodies of the two republics.    Mezhak said that common sense should prevail at the session  of the Ukrainian Supreme Council, which is opening tomorrow [31  May], and that the Ukrainian Parliament should not empower the  president of Ukraine to "act stupidly" with regard to Crimea, as  he called it. All the more so, he said, that not a single  statement in the restored Constitution violates territorial  integrity or leads to existing borders being redrawn because,  under the Constitution, Crimea remains part of Ukraine.  However, it would henceforth develop its relations with Ukraine  on the basis of treaties and agreements through delegating power.    According to the deputy chairman of the Crimean Parliament,  a  working group is to be formed from deputies of the Ukrainian  Supreme Council and it is to come to Sevastopol no later than  Friday [3 June] in order to continue the talks previously held  in Kiev.    Mezhak said the situation in Crimea is reasonably quiet and  there are no grounds for concern. However, in his opinion,  attempts to destabilize it from the outside depress people and  introduce a note of anxiety into their everyday life and work.</p>

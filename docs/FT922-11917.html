			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Letter: View of Baltic Exchange bombing aftermath 'callous' Sir, Your Observer column story ('Home thoughts', April 16) dealing with the Baltic Exchange bomb outrage is noteworthy only for its callousness and ignorance. First, there has been far more 'fuss' about an employee of the exchange who was murdered while serving what you refer to as a hangover establishment, and another member of the exchange who is lying in hospital with horrific injuries, than about the building itself. If Observer had any knowledge at all about the Baltic he would be aware that the industry based around it is primarily concerned with invisible exports and nothing at all to do with Britain ruling anything. The personal contacts and disciplinary codes of a trading floor are what makes the exchange unique and help it maintain its position as the most important shipping centre in the world. A telephone and computer alone contribute nothing to the confidence and trust among individuals that enable the Baltic to keep international business in London that would otherwise go elsewhere.

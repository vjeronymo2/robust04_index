			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-BENTSEN AIDE WINS WRIGHT'S SEAT  </P> <P> Democrat Pete Geren, a former Senate aide, narrowly won a special election  Tuesday for the seat given up by ex-House Speaker Jim Wright, toppled by an  ethics investigation after 34 years in office.  </P> <P> With all precincts reporting, Geren had 40,210 votes, or 51%, to 38,590, or  49%, for Republican Dr. Bob Lanier, a television medical commentator.  </P> <P> Geren, a 37-year-old former aide to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, will serve the  remainder of Wright's term, which expires next year.  </P> <P> Republicans had seen the election as a chance to capture the 12th District, a  longtime Democratic stronghold covering most of Ft. Worth and Tarrant County.  </P> <P> But Lanier, in his first campaign for public office, had acknowledged that his  race was an "upstream swim" because the district is heavily Democratic and  because Geren raised nearly twice as much money.  </P> <P> Lanier, 44, a pediatric allergist and immunologist, is featured on a television  segment syndicated to local news broadcasts in more than 40 television markets.  </P></p>

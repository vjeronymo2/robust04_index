This is a sign that the overall strength of China's  rural economy has grown further.    At present, there are 4,989 townships and towns each of  which  has more than 100 million yuan of rural output value. Of them,  72 exceed 1 billion yuan each and 434 exceed 500 million yuan  each. The order of the first 10 townships and towns whose output  value exceeds 100 million yuan each is: Caigongzhuang township  of Jinghai county in Tianjin, Qianzhou town of Wuxi county and  Shengze town of Wujiang city in Jiangsu, Beijiao town and  Guizhou town of Shunde City in Guangdong, Ninghai town of  Mouping county in Shandong, Xinzhaizi town in the Ganjingzi  district of Dalian in Liaoning, Maqiao township of in the  Minhang district of Shanghai, and Zhouzhuang town of Jiangyang  city and the Luoshe town of Wuxi county in Jiangsu.    The assessment was made by the China Rural Society Economic  Assessment Center under the State Statistical Bureau in the  light of the 1992 figures. Judging from the statistics of these  nearly 5,000 townships and towns, we find the following  characteristics:    First, they have powerful economic strengths. Although the  100- million-yuan townships and towns only account for 10  percent of China's total townships and towns and only 20 percent  of the rural population, yet they produce half of China's rural  output value and 2/3 of the rural industrial output value.  Second, they have a high degree of rural industrialization.  The non-farming proportion of these townships and towns reaches  as high as 88.2 percent, 24 percentage points higher than the  national percentage. Third, their enterprises have an economy  of scale. The output value of the enterprises of these  townships and towns already accounts for 52.8 percent of the  total output value of township and town enterprises in China,  their enterprise scale is 73.8 percent higher than the national  scale, their average labor [lao jun 0525 0971] output value is  62.6 percent, and they produce four times as much profits and  taxes as the national average. Fourth, 100-million-yuan  townships and towns are found everywhere in economically  developed coastal areas. Jiangsu has 944 such townships and  towns, which is the highest number and which accounts for nearly  half of the province's total townships and towns, whereas  Shandong has 892, Zhejiang 538, and Guangdong 425.</p>

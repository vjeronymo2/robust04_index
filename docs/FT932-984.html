			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: SelecTV growth held back by wrangling SELECTV, producer of programmes such as Birds of a Feather and Lovejoy, yesterday announced pre-tax profits nearly doubled to Pounds 809,000 in the year to March, writes Raymond Snoddy. Mr Allan McKeown, chief executive, expressed disappointment, however, that the company had not broken the Pounds 1m barrier mainly because of the cost of inter-company wrangling and legal fees. A dispute between Mr Michael Buckley, the former chairman, and other directors cost the company Pounds 295,000 in legal fees. Mr Tony Brooke, the new chairman, said that following an investigation by Richards Butler, the company solicitor, the board had concluded, 'that there had not been any conduct amounting to a breach of fiduciary duty or other impropriety on the part of Mr McKeown, who was completely exonerated by the board'. Mr Buckley is no longer a director of the company. Mr McKeown also yesterday discounted reports that Associated Newspapers, which has increased its stake in SelecTV to 12 per cent, might be planning a bid. 'I think it is very unlikely', said Mr Keown, who added that such a move would breach rules on broadcasters not owning independent production companies. Associated has a 20 per cent stake in Westcountry. The pre-tax profit, achieved on turnover of Pounds 19.9m, compared with Pounds 423,000 last time. Earnings per share rose from 0.38p to 0.42p.</p>

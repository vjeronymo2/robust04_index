This massacre is to be added to the crimes that the  Palestinian people have been subjected to since the Dayr Yasin  massacre, which was perpetrated by criminal thugs whose  objective was to uproot the Palestinian people from their lands  and possessions and to give these lands and possessions to  tyrants and despots. And these despots went ahead with the  judaization of the Palestinian land in accordance with a vile  scheme that resulted in covering the Palestinian territories  with settlements and colonies that are like a spearhead in the  Arab nation's body.    The al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre constitutes a crime against  all humanity. It is the black fruit of the tendencies of hatred  and bigotry that Zionism is planting in the hearts of its  followers, thus prompting them to kill and practice violence and  urging them to annihilate the Arabs so that the land will be  theirs alone and Israel's area can expand to include the entire  Middle East, with sovereignty over and control of all the  peoples of the region.    The treacherous bullets that assassinated the worshippers in  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque wounded the hearts of the Arabs, Muslims  and supporters of right and justice everywhere. These bullets  have undermined the peace hopes of everyone. Israel's rulers are  secretly hatching plots while talking publicly about peace. They  are the ones who gave the terrorrist an opportunity to attack  the worshippers and it is they who cover up for the criminals  after each massacre.    The Wafd Party, which firmly believes that justice must win  and injustice is bound to be vanquished sooner or later,  believes that this ugly crime must open the eyes of the Arab  rulers to the extent of the Israeli danger. The Arab rulers  must rise above differences, conflicts, and hatreds and stand  united against the schemes being hatched against us so as to  turn us into lackies of the Israeli state under the slogan of  the Middle East policy. The Arab peoples should be aware of the  danger coming from Israel and those who stand behind Israel.  The Wafd Party, while feeling the enormity of the catastrophe  inflicted on the Palestinian people in the occupied territories,  is confident that this catastrophe will make this heroic people  more determined, stronger, and more steadfast. The martyrs who  were slain by the bullets of treachery are in an Assembly of  Truth, in the Presence of a Sovereign Omnipotent, in the company  of prophets (who teach), the sincere (lovers of truth), the  witnesses (who testify), and the righteous (who do good): Ah!  what a beautiful fellowship. [Koranic verse]    [Signed] Muhammad Fu'ad Siraj-al-Din    Wafd Party leader.</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A return is good form AFTER THE first year of independent taxation for married couples, my wife made a claim to the Inland Revenue in respect of tax overpaid on her income from investments, then largely in equities. The claim was met, and she was sent another tax repayment claim form for the subsequent year. She has not used the form because she has since arranged matters so that the nil-rate tax band is covered by income from investments not taxed at source. She plans to continue this process, as nearly as possible and in balance over the years. The Revenue has taken no further interest in her affairs, and meanwhile the tax vouchers, contract notes, and other records are piling up. How long should they be kept in case of future approaches from the Revenue? Even if your wife has been skilful (or lucky) enough to arrange that her untaxed income of 1991-92 amounted precisely to Pounds 3,005, we recommend that she submit a tax return / claim. Even if you are both a long way from your 65th birthdays, and your wife does not wish to claim any part of the married couple's allowance, it will be simpler in the long run if she continues to submit tax returns. You may like to ask your tax office for the free pamphlets IR80(1992) (Income tax and married couples) and IR84(1992) (Have you anything to declare?). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

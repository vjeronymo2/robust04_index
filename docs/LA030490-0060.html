			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DUAL PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> James Brosnahan, representing Richard T. Silberman, enjoys a fine reputation as  a defense attorney from San Francisco.  </P> <P> Mr. Silberman's guilt or innocence will be determined in court. I look forward  to Brosnahan's performance there as an attorney, once he finishes playing as a  public relations agent.  </P> <P> PHIL HART  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

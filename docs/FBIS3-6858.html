The spokesman said that Army Commander General Wimon  Wongwanit has stated a clear policy that the Army does not  interfere in politics and everyone is trying his best to perform  his own duty. The Army wants to see affection, unity, and  understanding among various sectors. The Army chief has urged  everyone to regard the interests of the people and the country  as major goals.    "We never want to have conflicts with others," said the Army  spokesman. Asked if Gen. Chawalit, as a former Army commander  and Armed Forces supreme commander, may have received some  information about it, Col. Phalangkun declined to comment.    As for opinions of military officers on this issue, an Army  officer commanding military forces, said that Chawalit's remark  was meant to divert public attention from the problem of the  deteriorating image of politicians, although he knows very well  that at present there is no way the military can successfully  stage a coup. Today, the military does not even think about a  coup and Gen. Chawalit should know this well.    "Chawalit can carry out his political activities, but he  should think about peace for the country and the people and also  his younger brothers in the Army. At present, we are all right.  We would be angry if another had said this, but the speaker is  Chawalit, a military man and former leader of the Army. But we  do not feel well at all about what he has said," the  high-ranking military officer noted.    He emphasized that everybody knows that a coup will be  impossible in the near future, but afterward it is not certain  because it depends on the situation.    Meanwhile, during an interview with reporters in Nonthaburi  Province, when asked about a coup, Gen. Chawalit only replied:  "Who said?" and said nothing more.</p>

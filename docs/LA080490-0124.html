			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE TRUSTEES HIKE STUDENT FEES 10%  </P> <P> Trustees of the California State University system Friday increased most  student fees 10% as a result of the tight state budget and warned that cutbacks  in class schedules, library hours and maintenance at the 20 campuses are likely  over the next few months.  </P> <P> "It will result in considerable deterioration in the quality of programs,"  acting Chancellor Ellis E. McCune said of the impending austerity measures.  </P> <P> Cal State trustees said Friday that they had no choice but to follow state  budget guidelines and raise annual student education fees 10%, to $708, for a  full-time, in-state resident; that increase was double the amount previously  planned. Tuition for out-of-staters was hiked $500, to $6,160. Cal State  students who already have paid and registered for fall classes will be billed  for the difference.  </P> <P> The fee increases would raise about $16 million, the trustees said.  </P> <P> Unlike other sessions dealing with student fees, Friday's meeting in Long Beach  produced no protests -- which observers attributed to the August timing, when  campus activism is in a lull. Leaders of the Cal State Student Organization  could not be reached for reaction.  </P> <P> The specially empowered trustee committee also authorized $71.2 million in  reductions to reach what is tentatively a $1.7-billion budget. In the largest  single item, $23 million in lottery funds will be used for general operating  expenses instead of, as previously planned, to purchase computers, pay stipends  for guest scholars and artists, and fund a student community service internship  program. In addition, administrative cost trims were ordered.  </P> <P> However, Cal State officials said they fear the up to 3% in additional cuts the  Deukmejian Administration can order in many state programs under the budget  agreement reached earlier in the week. If fully implemented, reductions  totaling $51.7 million will be spread among the 20 campuses, with layoffs of  some part-time instructors anticipated and fewer courses offered.  </P> <P> As of Friday, the overall Cal State budget was actually 2% higher than last  year, but that increase is more than eaten up by inflation and contractual pay  increases, officials said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the UC Board of Regents, facing similar circumstances on their nine  campuses, may hold an emergency meeting later this month to raise undergraduate  fees for California residents 10%, to $1,624, not including room, board or  books; increase tuition 10.5%, to $8,040, for most out-of-state students, and  hike fees for medical and law education 35%, to $2,000 a year.  </P> <P> Dale Kelly Bankhead, executive director of the University of California Student  Assn., said she would argue against only the out-of-state and professional  school increases. Although $2,000 a year is a bargain compared to the costs of  private law and medical schools, Bankhead said, she fears that the increase  will cause UC law and medical students to borrow more money and avoid  community-service-oriented jobs.  </P></p>

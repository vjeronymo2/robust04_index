			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI to report quarterly Thorn EMI, the London-based leisure and electronics group, is to publish its trading results on a quarterly basis in line with new guidelines from the Stock Exchange. The Exchange has published a consultative document on insider dealing which urges companies to make quarterly statements in order to keep all investors more regularly informed of its trading position. More frequent reporting would mean that less information is held closely within a company or by its advisers, thus reducing the opportunity to trade on inside information. But the Exchange's consultative committee, which included representatives of the 100 Committee of Finance Directors and several shareholders' groups, stopped short of calling for full quarterly trading statements such as those issued regularly in the US. Large UK companies whose shares are traded in the US already provide quarterly statements, and several leading UK shareholders have called for more regular public statements from companies in order to limit the risk of insider dealing. Mr Simon Duffy, group finance director at Thorn, said the company would have begun producing quarterly reports regardless of the Exchange's recommendations. About 18 months ago, the company instituted a new financial reporting system for internal management accounting. 'We found we could produce quarterly reports with zero incremental costs.' Thorn said the system it has developed is commercially available to others and the company is in discussions with 'a number of other people' about selling its system to them. Mr Duffy added that Thorn has no view about whether companies should be required to publish quarterly trading statements. 'There are some businesses where it is appropriate, others where it is not so useful,' he said. See Lex</p>

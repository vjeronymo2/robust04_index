			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Strong gains in US on low inflation figure A BIG drop in consumer confidence, good news on inflation and a successful two-year auction helped bond prices post strong gains yesterday, despite a better-than-expected third-quarter gross domestic product report. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/8 at 95 21/32 , yielding 7.614 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  5/32 at 99 1/2 , for a yield of 4.255 per cent. Although the early news of a 2.7 per cent rise in third quarter GDP surprised the market, which had been expecting a smaller gain of about 1.5 per cent, prices held steady. Most analysts said the data did not tell the whole story, and argued that the revised GDP figure would give a clearer indication of economic conditions during the quarter. Investors were also cheered by the low measure of inflation in the GDP report. Prices did not take off until the Conference Board announced that its consumer confidence index had fallen from 57.3 to 53.0 in September. The big fall in confidence pleased the market because it suggests that consumer spending could be especially weak in the final quarter. Later, strong demand at the two-year auction also buoyed sentiment. UK government bonds surged on rumours of a sharp cut in interest rates, gaining more than half a point on the day after a volatile session. The gilt market opened on a weak note, mainly due to dissent within the Conservative party over the Maastricht treaty, but prices later picked up on speculation about a cut in the base rate. Dealers said prices were further boosted by gloomy economic news from Germany yesterday. A report released by Germany's five leading economic research institutes forecast weak economic growth and low inflation in 1993, raising the market's hopes of a cut in interest rates in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. The 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 opened at 119 and fell to 119.00 in the morning before recovering to end at 120.00. GERMAN government bonds rallied following gloomy forecasts from Germany's five leading economic research institutes, as the predictions of poor growth and low inflation next year rekindled hopes of a cut in domestic interest rates. However, the bund market later lost some of its gains on profit-taking, to end little changed on the day. The Liffe bund futures contract rose from 91.41 to a high of 91.70, before dropping back to end the day at 91.48. JAPANESE government bonds climbed to new highs in the cash and futures markets, spurred on by domestic buying early in the trading session. The December futures contract reached 107.26, its highest level since February 1989, but later fell back to close at 107.15, against an opening of 107.02. In the cash market, the yield on the No 145 issue moved from 4.79 per cent at the opening to end at 4.77 per cent, as dealers noted strong demand among domestic institutions for ten-year bonds. Dealers said that some investors had hoped to see an easing in interest rates this week, possibly in conjunction with the quarterly meeting of the Bank of Japan's branch managers, which started yesterday.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brewing review plan abandoned THE government has abandoned plans for a full review of the effects of the beer orders on the brewing industry. The orders, in the wake of a 1990 Monopolies Commission report, obliged big brewers to dispose of some pubs and to accept 'guest' beers as a way of safeguarding independent brewers. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday that it was 'highly desirable that both brewers and pub tenants should now have a period of stability.' The full effect of changes, brought about by the Monopolies and Mergers report and commercial pressures, would only gradually become apparent, Mr Heseltine told the Commons agriculture committee. A full scale review later this year, as originally planned, would further prolong uncertainty in the industry. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, would continue to monitor the market and would investigate any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour, he said. But a full review would be left to the European Commission which is due to re-examine the effects of exclusive 'tied' beer supplies to pubs and clubs in 1997. National brewers, who have had to sell or lease nearly 12,000 pubs to comply with the beer orders, last night welcomed the decision. 'This is very good news,' said Allied-Lyons. However, Mr Anthony Fuller, chairman of Fuller Smith &amp; Turner, the London brewer, said: 'I do not think that it is right to leave the review to Brussels alone.' Evidence by the Department of Trade and Industry to the committee said the MMC believed the beer market had become more competitive after the beer orders. The freeing of 12,000 pubs - a third of the national brewers' estates - had significantly reduced the proportion sold through tied outlets. The free pub trade now accounted for 49 per cent of beer sales compared with 37 per cent in 1989. Mr Heseltine told the committee that while the retail price of beer had risen an average 13 per cent a year between 1989 and 1992, the increase over the last 12 months had been less than 1 per cent. These claims brought a sceptical response from Sir Jerry Wiggin, the committee chairman. He said the industry picture 'was not a happy one'. Mr Heseltine said it was difficult to distinguish between the effects of the recession and of the beer orders in many changes that had occurred.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said yesterday that he  was not prepared to welcome Taiwan President Li Teng-hui, who is  arriving on a private visit.    President Li Teng-hui is visiting several ASEAN countries,  including Indonesia and the Philippines, on a swift and vehement  "money diplomacy" offensive. He is scheduled to arrive in the  southern province of Phuket for a vacation. An earlier source  said that Prime Minister Chuan would meet President Li Teng-hui  on this famous island on the western coast of southern Thailand.    Responding to this report, Prime Minister Chuan said that  the  Thai Government adheres to a "one China" policy. Prime Minister  Chuan said that the Foreign Ministry has already stressed  Thailand's policy in this regard. The prime minister said,  however, that Thailand has maintained good relations with  Taiwan. These relations are economic; they involve members of  the private sector and have nothing to do with politics. The  prime minister said that Thailand has to be careful in the way  it handles some sensitive issues because it adheres to a "one  China" policy. In particular, Thailand has to honor its  diplomatic commitments, because it has good relations with its  neighbors. Thus, it is able to clarify some issues.</p>

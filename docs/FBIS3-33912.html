			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Mr. Abdelhak Benhamouda, secretary general of  the General Union of Algerian Workers [UGTA], said today that  the UGTA has agreed to the resumption of negotiations with  international financial institutions. He added that he is also  prepared to accept a devaluation of the dinar provided that  practical measures are taken to help improve productivity and  reduce the unemployment and inflation rates. During this  meeting, Mr. Benhamouda also confirmed that 200,000 workers  could be made redundant in the next two years. He added that a  significant number of jobs would be made available in 1995,  particularly in the sectors of public works, construction,  irrigation, textiles, and food industries. This, he said, will  reduce unemployment by a considerable extent.    Regarding the efficiency of the unemployment fund, Mr.  Benhamouda indicated that this resides in the possibility for  redundant workers to receive social benefits, such as social and  health security during the legal period, in addition to the  unemployment benefit which could range between 2,000 and 5,000  dinars. This, he added, will reduce the deficit which the  social security fund and the pension fund are complaining about.    The UGTA secretary general also talked about the positive  aspects of early retirement which would alleviate the burden  caused by a surplus of workforce, and other burdens which are  weighing down the enterprises. He added that the success of the  early retirement scheme depends on the existence of a firm  economic and investment policy which would provide the  conditions for growth.    Massoud Ramdani interviewed Abdelhak Benhamouda and asked  him  about the agreement recently signed with the government.    [Begin Behamouda recording] We regarded the agreement signed  on 17 January as a beginning for organizing future negotiation.  For example, in the context of the 17 January agreement we said  that we will not open the wages file. We agreed to the minimum  because there must be stages and a gradual progress. If we do  not define a secure minimum national level for wages, we will  not be able to open the wages file. [passage omitted]    We have agreed on the issue of an unemployment fund but we  have not yet finalized it. The same applies to an early  retirement fund. We have also talked about a national fund for  social services. We have agreed on all these issues but we have  not agreed on the details. [end recording]</p>

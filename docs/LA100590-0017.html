			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> SATIRICAL LOOK INTO THE EYE OF THE SPY;  </P> <P> TANGO BY ALAN JUDD, SUMMIT BOOKS, $17.95, 293 PAGES  </P> <P> The unlikely hero of "Tango," Alan Judd's parodic spy novel, is a pudgy  Londoner managing an English bookstore in an unspecified South American country  known for gargantuan beefsteaks, sensual senoritas and volatile politics -- all  potentially dangerous for the uninitiated.  </P> <P> Though William Wooding seems blissfully unaware of the fact, the bookstore is  generally regarded as a front for English espionage, an activity not only  tolerated but apparently encouraged by the ruling junta.  </P> <P> At first, Wooding seems a blandly apathetic young fellow, complacently sharing  household chores with his restless wife, compensating for his footling job and  dreary marriage by overindulging in food, wine and romantic daydreams. He is a  bumbler, clearly destined for dissolution in an agreeable backwater.  </P> <P> He's actually having lunch in the main market, sharing a communal table with a  pair of gorgeous girls, when he's recognized by the new president of the  country, touring the market on a flesh-pressing stroll.  </P> <P> Our hero and the president-elect had attended the same minor public school in  England, though if the women at the table had been homely, that fact might  never have come to light. Because one of the girls is sensationally beautiful,  and because one of the perks of the presidency is first choice of the local  women, Wooding is warmly greeted by his old acquaintance.  </P> <P> By evening, the entire capital city believes that the bookstore manager has a  direct line to the palace. Within hours, Wooding is summoned to the British  embassy, where a mysterious Mr. Box is eagerly awaiting him.  </P> <P> Arthur Box has been sent to recruit Wooding for the Special Information  Service, a newly privatized clone of the secret service. An under-utilized  Briton with free time is just what Box's outfit is looking for, and Wooding  needs little persuasion to sign on. Spying might be risky, but it's  considerably more challenging than dusting the office windows, refilling old  invoices, and faking an interest in his wife's teaching schedule.  </P> <P> The pace of Wooding's life picks up immediately. Box has the full spy kit and  obviously relishes his work. He's not only a figure of fun with his obsolete  transmitter and his exaggerated adherence to the rules of the game, but he's  also eerily plausible.  </P> <P> Wooding quickly shows himself to be a natural at his new profession. Instead of  dull evenings alone in the flat with his taciturn wife, he's dashing around the  town, arranging the president's dates with the ravishing Teresa, boyishly  enjoying the whole business of false names, secret codes and clandestine  meetings; all to prevent the unstable country from falling into Communist  hands.  </P> <P> Inevitably, Wooding himself falls in love with Teresa, dismissing as irrelevant  both his marriage and her current position as the president's mistress, a role  she reminds him she's fulfilled for scores of lesser lights. He couldn't care  less, and since Teresa is so sensible, charming and straightforward, we can  practically see her reformed and married to Wooding, graciously serving tea to  the vicar and president.  </P> <P> Throughout the book, the author balances on the high wire separating farce from  comedy, regaining his equilibrium just as the entire act seems certain to crash  into slapstick.  </P> <P> Preposterous as the ensuing events seem, they're firmly grounded in  contemporary reality, making the resemblance between fiction and fact more than  coincidental.  </P> <P> Consistently diverting, "Tango" begins as a sendup and ends on a deeper note as  highly relevant political satire.  </P> <P> Conscientiously minding his declining business, lulled into complacency by the  ease of his life, eager for the adventure and excitement that have always  eluded him, Wooding is exactly the sort of man who turns up in a boxed window  on "Nightline," an inadvertent victim of events not only out of his control but  utterly beyond the scope of his imagination.  </P> <P> That, of course, is no laughing matter, as the author of this sophisticated  entertainment subtly reminds us.  </P> <P>  Next: Carolyn See reviews "I Cannot Get You Close Enough" by Ellen Gilchrist  (Little, Brown).  </P></p>

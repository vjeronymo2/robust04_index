			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 4 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus  arrived for a two-day working visit this afternoon.    Klaus will meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday  [5  April] and also will hold talks with Premier Viktor  Chernomyrdin. An agreement on support and protection of  investments is expected to be signed during his visit.    Klaus will discuss the payment of Russian debt which amounts  to some 3 billion USD [U.S. dollars].    After his arrival in Moscow Premier Vaclav Klaus stated  that he wanted "to try to resolve some issues we have not able  to settle at lower level."    The Russian debt to the Czech Republic is among the issues,  he added.    He said he arrived with some proposals regarding the Russian  debt. Klaus is to meet President Boris Yeltsin and Premier  Viktor Chernomyrdin during his two-day visit.    Russian media have speculated that Klaus would attempt to  achieve a more accommodating approach by Russia to the Soviet,  currently Russian, debt which amounts to 3 billion USD at the  governmental level and 380 million USD with respect to the  companies.    Before Klaus's visit started Prague and Moscow made it clear  that a part of the claim could be satisfied by imports of  Russian goods. Czech representatives have indicated they are  interested in petrol.    A preliminary agreement on export of seven million tons of  petrol and 6.9 billion cubic metres of gas was signed by the  relevant ministries last week. However, it is not yet clear  whether the document will be signed during Klaus's stay.</p>

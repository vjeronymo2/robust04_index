			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Street fighters ignore UN pleas HEAVY street fighting continued yesterday in the south-western Bosnian city of Mostar, despite attempts by the United Nations to mediate a new ceasefire between Bosnian Croats and Moslem-led government forces. Much of the eastern, Moslem-held section of the city was in flames as Croat troops battled to break a Moslem foothold on the west side of the Neretva River, which bisects Mostar and which Bosnian Croats want to mark as their eastern-most boundary. The Croatian Defense Council (HVO) was holding more than 1,300 Moslem civilians at the airport building outside Mostar, after forcing them from their homes, UN officials said yesterday. Meanwhile, General Philippe Morillon, the UN military commander, met leaders of the Bosnian army and Bosnian Croat forces in Medjugorje, about 20 km south-west of Mostar, in an effort to agree a ceasefire. He was also to meet with Bosnian Croat leader, Mr Mate Boban. In eastern Bosnia, the UN evacuated the first 22 of about 200 wounded from Zepa, one of six 'safe areas' declared by the UN security council last week, after Serbs had blocked the departure of UN helicopters for five hours. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday said he expected the inhabitants of his self-styled state would vote against the peace plan to divide Bosnia into 10 provinces along ethnic lines in this weekend's referendum. Bosnian Serbs have turned down a call by the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, to attend a joint session of an 'all Serbian' parliament to ratify the UN peace plan. They opted instead to go ahead with the referendum on the UN proposal. Serbia has imposed sanctions on the Bosnian Serbs for refusing to back the plan.</p>

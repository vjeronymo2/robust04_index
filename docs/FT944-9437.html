			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Top aides go in Major's shake-up Mr John Major extended the shake-up of his inner circle of advisers yesterday by announcing that two of the most prominent backroom politicians in Downing Street would be replaced. In a further restructuring of the team that will mastermind the Conservative party's campaign at the next election, the prime minister's office announced that Mrs Sarah Hogg would stand down as head of the No. 10 Policy Unit. Mrs Hogg, one of the prime minister's closest aides, has held the post for four years. But she has recently been strongly criticised by Tory MPs for some of the prime minister's policy failures. In addition, Mr Jonathan Hill is leaving his job as political secretary to the prime minister. He will be replaced by Mr Howell James, a former director of corporate affairs at the BBC and one-time adviser to Lord Young, the former trade secretary. Downing Street emphasised that Mrs Hogg, who has been in charge of the prime minister's political strategy, was leaving at her own request and had told Mr Major of her wishes last summer. Her replacement has not been announced, but senior Tory figures said Mr Nicholas True, deputy head of the policy unit, was a strong candidate. The advisers' departure further indicates Mr Major's determination to make a clean sweep of the top jobs in his kitchen cabinet with little more than two years until the next election. Yesterday's moves follow the appointment of Mr Christopher Meyer, a former diplomat, as press secretary, and of Mr John Ward, the MP for Poole, as his parliamentary private secretary. Rightwing Tory MPs did not disguise their pleasure at the departure of Mrs Hogg, who is regarded as a staunch supporter of European Union integration and of Britain's ill-fated membership of the exchange rate mechanism. Mrs Hogg has also been seen as the architect of the prime minister's unsuccessful 'back to basics' campaign. However, Mr Major expressed his sadness at her decision to leave. 'Her staunchness and her wise advice have been of incalculable value,' he said. Hogg opts for change, Page 9 Observer, Page 25</p>

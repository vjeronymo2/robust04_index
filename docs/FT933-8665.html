			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Italian judge faces probe MR Diego Curto, one of the most senior judges on the company law bench at Milan's court of justice, has been placed under investigation in Italy's 18-month political corruption scandal. The move followed an inter-rogation on Thursday at which Mr Curto, who has been practising law in Milan for the past 34 years, was questioned about his role in the period before the demise of the Enimont chemicals concern. Executives at Montedison, the industrial arm of the troubled Ferruzzi group, allegedly paid about L135bn (Pounds 56m) in kickbacks to politicians during the lifetime of Enimont, the ill-fated chemicals joint venture between Montedison and the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group. Because Mr Curto himself is a judge, the allegations against him of aiding and abetting a crime will be investigated by magistrates in Brescia, which is responsible for disciplinary matters in the Milan judicial district. He yesterday protested his innocence.</p>

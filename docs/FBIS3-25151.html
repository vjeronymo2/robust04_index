			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Freedom Alliance says its leaders are unable  to make further concessions to reopen the constitutional  negotiations with the government and the ANC [African National  Congress]. Our political staff reports that it is now almost  certain that the group will not participate in the election.  [passage omitted]    The government's chief negotiator, Mr. Roelf Meyer, said the  Alliance was making a big mistake in withdrawing from the  negotiations. He said progress had been made in the past two  weeks with the ANC and the government having made concessions.  He said parties which did not take part in the election were  minimizing their political roles. Mr. Meyer invited individual  parties in the Alliance to take part in more negotiations.</p>

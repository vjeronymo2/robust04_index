			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS: BYRNE, BABY, BYRNE  </P> <P> Musician/composer/filmmaker David Byrne of Talking Heads fame will perform  Tuesday at the Ventura Theatre, but don't expect a medley of his greates hits.  </P> <P> Never shy about breaking new ground, Byrne currently is touring with a Latin  American band, performing pieces from his most recent release, "Rei Momo," a  combination of Latin and pop.  </P> <P> Last year he came out with the albums "Beleza Tropical: Brazil Classics Volume  One," and "O Samba: Brazil Classics Volume Two," a collection of samba and  pagode music. Byrne's interest in Brazil has inlfuenced his video endeavors as  well. His film "Ile Aiye" (The House of Life), a documentary about the  country's Candomble Nao religion, looked into Yoruban dance-music rituals. The  film debuted as the opening program of the PBS series "Live From Off Center."  </P> <P> Byrne's interest in Afro-Brazilian culture dates to 1979, as evidenced by the  African flavor of his music at the time. So real Talking Heads fans should be  ready to samba.  </P> <P> The theatre is located at 26 S. Chestnut St., Ventura. Show time is 8 p.m.  Tickets are $27.50  </P></p>

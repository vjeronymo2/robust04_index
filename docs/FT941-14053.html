			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / PM backs CrossRail despite Treasury opposition The prime minister has decided to push ahead with plans to build CrossRail, the Pounds 2bn east-west railway link beneath central London. It is understood that Mr John Major overruled an attempt by Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, to block the project. Mr Major and a group of senior ministers decided to back - and even extend - plans to build the CrossRail link, central London's biggest public transport project since the Victoria Line opened 25 years ago. The project would enable passengers travelling on suburban trains into British Rail's Paddington and Liverpool Street stations to reach the West End and the City without having to change to the Underground system. However, ministers say that Mr Portillo and some Treasury officials raised strong objections to the project, to be jointly funded by the public and private sectors. The exchequer's share of the cost would be about Pounds 1bn. It is understood that Mr Portillo argued at a meeting on Thursday that the project should be deferred because of cost. He backed suggestions that commuter congestion might be relieved more cheaply by developing existing Underground stations. But the meeting, which was attended by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, and Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, overruled this and decided to allow the CrossRail construction plans to be examined at a committee stage of the House of Commons on Tuesday. It was also agreed to link the line to six London stations, one more than at first envisaged. The additional station is Holborn. The CrossRail line will pass from Paddington in west London to Liverpool Street in the east. The decision to push ahead with the project was welcomed yesterday by London First, a business-led initiative to promote London. Mr Stephen O'Brien, its chief executive, said: 'We are absolutely delighted the government is not going for a truncated version of CrossRail.' However, the decision may be seen as a defeat for Mr Portillo. Technical plans for CrossRail have been drawn up over the last four months by British Rail and London Transport, two of the project's sponsors, as part of a private bill being brought before parliament. They are confident that once the bill reaches royal assent, it will receive financial backing from the private sector. A study carried out by the consultants, Sir Alexander Gibb and Bovis, says the CrossRail project would provide private sector backers with a commercial return, while guaranteeing the Treasury an 8 per cent return on the public sector investment.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Jordan has paid its last respects to the late  Queen Zayn al-Sharaf, the queen mother, who passed away  yesterday morning in Switzerland after a life fully dedicated to  goodness and bounty.    King Husayn, who was in Britain for an ear operation,  accompanied the body of the queen mother's final homecoming late  last night.    The late queen's flag-draped coffin was carried on a gun  carriage accompanied by an escort from Raghadan Palace to the  Royal Guard's Mosque where the funeral prayers took place after  which the body was laid to rest at the royal cemetery.    His Majesty the King, their royal highnesses the princes,  and  the sharifs, accepted condolences after the funeral. Thousands  of mourners also paid their last respects to the late Queen Zayn.    The funeral was attended by foreign dignitaries, including  the visiting president of Mali, and delegations from the PLO and  Oman. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Learning how to mix it The faltering start to Mr John Major's campaign was accidentally highlighted in a comment after his unusually aggressive speech at the rally in Manchester on Thursday night. According to an aide, the prime minister said it was the first time in 16 months that he had said what he felt. Quite apart from the admission that he had not really hit his stride until some days into the campaign, the comment points to a fundamental change of strategy. An earlier plan was for Mr Major to be above the political fray in a statesmanlike fashion, leaving the negative campaigning on Labour to those without quite such nice smiles. But the speech on Thursday showed that Mr Major is prepared to mix it with the opposition. His speech did indeed, as he was at pains to point out, cover education, housing and the Citizen's Charter. It dealt more passionately - and to more applause - with Labour's tax plans, the last Labour government's continuation of a 'forelock society', and the unfitness of Labour to govern because of its stand on defence and, implicitly, the putative hot-headedness of its leader. The speech acquired lift-off with Mr Major's delivery. This was enlivened by his encounter with a jostling group of demonstrators as he tried to do a walkabout in Bolton on Thursday afternoon. He abandoned his usual monochrome style for a note of passion, and his normal bureaucratic turn of phrase to denounce 'the ugly face of Labour that I hate'. There is a clear downside to television pictures showing a leader being the focus of a hostile protest. For someone against whom one of the main charges is blandness, there is a brighter side as well. And the Tory tour party is in the business of being positive, after a week which began flatly, as the economic output figures hijacked Tuesday's campaigning, and unemployment dominated much of Thursday's. Among the hopeful signs is the belief that the worst of the economic indicators have already come out. Most hopes are pinned on the new 'bite' in Mr Major's setpiece campaigning. The prime minister still seems nice rather than Churchillian to the few innocent bystanders he meets on tour, but he has at least shown that being pleasant is not incompatible with behaving and sounding as though he really does not want Labour to win.</p>

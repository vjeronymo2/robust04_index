			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Air France chief appointed as strikers prolong protest AIR FRANCE ground staff yesterday voted to continue striking at least until tonight, in spite of the French government's decision to withdraw a controversial cost-cutting plan that has triggered a crippling strike at the airline. Mr Christian Blanc, reputed to be an industrial reformer and friend of leading socialist politicians, was meanwhile named as Air France's new chief. The vote in favour of continued action means that a broader protest planned for today, dubbed 'Black Tuesday' by the French press, is expected to go ahead. Ground staff are due to be joined in a 24-hour strike by Air France pilots and cabin crew as well as many union members at Air Inter, the national carrier's domestic airline subsidiary, and Aeroports de Paris, the airports operator. Today's protest may, however, represent the peak of the dispute. Force Ouvriere, one of the union groups which has spearheaded the protest, said its members could return to work tomorrow. The task of resolving the dispute and negotiating a new recovery plan for the lossmaking airline now falls to Mr Blanc, chosen by the French government to succeed Mr Bernard Attali. Mr Attali resigned on Sunday when the government scrapped his proposed austerity measures, which included 4,000 job cuts by the end of next year and pay cuts. Mr Blanc is the former head of RATP, the urban transport authority which runs the metro and bus system in Paris. He implemented a substantial reorganisation at RATP before resigning last winter following a strike in which he failed to win government support for a change in labour practices. President Francois Mitterrand last night expressed sympathy with the striking workers, saying their complaints about the recovery plan were felt by many people to be good sense. The decision to withdraw the original austerity plan represents a serious blow to the government of Mr Edouard Balladur, which was forced into a climbdown in the first serious industrial dispute that it has faced since taking office in March.

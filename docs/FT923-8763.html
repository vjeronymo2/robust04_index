			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: Rimsky's rescue of Musorgsky THURSDAY'S Prom at London's Royal Albert Hall interestingly, discreetly offered a northern view of music. Russian, Polish and Finnish works were played by an excellent northern orchestra, the BBC Scottish Symphony, under its principal conductor, the Pole Jerzy Maksymiuk. Musorgsky's Night on the Bare Mountain was given in its original 1867 version, as a tone-poem completely of Musorgsky's own composition; and one realised how much of Rimsky-Korsakov's own composition there is in his, the received version of the work. Maksymiuk's reading was lively and sympathetic, but could not conceal a tameness about Musorgsky's piece, a dourness and artificial danciness. It is clearly not, unlike the spellbinding Rimsky recension, a masterpiece. Rakhmaninov's quite rare fourth piano concerto (1927), a fine product of his later, brittler compositional period, was played with metallic brilliance and, on occasion, touching delicacy, by Nikolai Demidenko, making his debut at the Proms. The concert ended with the Finn Sibelius's seventh symphony, and its modern element was the Pole, Witold Lutoslawski's Livre pour orchestre, a work of 1968. This assured performance brought back keen memories of the clear, hard-hitting dissonant sounds natural to those avant-garde days. Lutoslawski has compared the conducting of his works to tending a garden. Maksymiuk was suitably green-fingered. ***** The latest in this year's Proms series of BBC commissions - Augury for chorus and orchestra by the Russian-born, British-based Elena Firsova - made a cloudy impression at its premiere on Tuesday. The work is a slowish and somewhat meandering orchestral rhapsody which closes with a choral setting of Blake's 'To see a World in a grain of sand'; the manner is late-Romantic, all-purpose poetic, a fusion of Delius and Mahler. Committed execution by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus under Andrew Davis could not disguise a vacuousness at the heart of the inspiration and invention.</p>

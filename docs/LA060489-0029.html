			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KNAPP NOT TO BLAME  </P> <P> Regarding the April 23 column by James Flanigan, "We Haven't Seen the End of  S&amp;L Crises":  </P> <P> The column states that Charles Knapp "took the old Financial Corp. of America  to bankruptcy." This is another example of The Times wrongfully blaming Knapp  for things he did not do.  </P> <P> Knapp left FCA in August, 1984. At that time, FCA was solvent and not on the  verge of bankruptcy. Knapp was not involved in FCA's management for more than  four years before its bankruptcy and had nothing to do with FCA's financial  results since 1984.  </P> <P> To state that Knapp "took" FCA to bankruptcy is irresponsible reporting.  </P> <P> ARTHUR N. GREENBERG  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> The writer, a lawyer who represents Charles Knapp, is with the firm of  Greenberg, Glusker, Fields, Claman &amp; Machtinger.  </P> <P> </P></p>

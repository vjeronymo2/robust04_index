			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Maghreb fund launched The Framlington Group has launched a Dollars 30.5m Maghreb Fund, the first listed North African investment fund available to institutional investors in the US, Europe and the Middle East. One third of investment will be made in Tunisia, the balance in Morocco. The investment targets include second-tier companies which are already listed on the Tunis and Casablanca stock exchanges and companies which are not quoted at present but are expected to be soon. The Framlington Investment Fund, which is listed in Dublin, will provide institutional investors with an opportunity to participate in markets which have, until recently, been largely inaccessible to foreign investors. The International Finance Corporation has taken a 20 per cent stake in the fund and the Abu Dhabi Investment Fund 10 per cent. Most other investors are London-based global emerging market funds. The fund is advised by Framlingham Maghreb, in which Banque Commerciale du Maroc and Framlington have a stake.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Aids drug sales boost Wellcome SALES by Wellcome, the pharmaceutical group, were 20 per cent higher in the last four months of 1991 than in the comparable period in 1990. Sir Alastair France, the chairman, told yesterday's annual meeting that 'our main anti-viral products, Zovirax and Retrovir, are exhibiting particularly encouraging growth.' The return to growth in the sales of Retrovir, the Aids drug, helped Wellcome shares rise 12p to Pounds 10.34. Members of Wisa, the Wellcome Independent Shareholders Association, pressed for a cut in the price of Retrovir and a freezing of the dividend to pay for that. Mr John Robb, the chief executive, said that pricing policy was under continual review.</p>

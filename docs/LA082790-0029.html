			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> ROCKETS BLAMED FOR OZONE LOSS  </P> <P> Exhaust from space shuttle and other rocket launches makes the government one  of the biggest contributors to ozone depletion, an environmental group charged  last week.  </P> <P> "Each launch of the space shuttle or the Air Force's Titan IV does more to  deplete the fragile ozone layer . . . than the annual ground-level emissions of  chlorofluorocarbons from most individual (industrial) plants," the report by  the National Toxics Campaign Fund of Boston said.  </P> <P> Shuttle launches are exempt from air safety regulations, and unless they can be  brought into compliance, NASA should be forced to abandon solid rocket fuel,  the report said. Space shuttles and Titan IV rockets are propelled by solid  rocket fuel, which produces exhaust that causes environmental damage.  </P> <P> The European Space Agency's Ariane rocket and the Soviet Energia rocket use  liquid fuel, which the report said is less damaging.  </P></p>

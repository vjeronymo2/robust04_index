			<p>BFN     [Text] Regardless of its strained financial situation the  provincial people's government recently appropriated its special  funds to the higher educational institutions to deal with the  practical problems cropping up in the fixed-quota supplies of  grains and cooking oil to these institutions, in protecting the  quality of supplies and restricting price hikes, in subsidies  for students who have encountered exceptional difficulties, and  in subsidies for the meat price hike.    In his personal approval for the special funds, Acting  Governor Tian Fengshan asked Zhang Chengyi, assistant to the  governor, to hold specific discussion with the responsible  comrades of the financial department, the education commission,  and the general office of the provincial people's government, on  the issue of carrying out detailed analysis over the  difficulties that should be dealt with urgently and over the  prominent problems cropping up in the education circles. They  should also make overall arrangements in this regard so as to  use the funds where they are needed most.    The special funds are being distributed to various higher  educational institutions. Subsidies for the price hikes of  student mess and those for the students who have encountered  exceptional difficulties will enable the student from the border  areas, the minority nationalities, and the poor localities to be  at ease in study.</p>

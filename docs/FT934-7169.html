			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Try your luck with Ernie - With interest rates at low levels, the prize potential of Premium bonds make them an increasingly attractive investment WITH inflation running at less than 2 per cent and building society savings rates as low as we have seen them for some time, this could be the moment to resume your acquaintance with Ernie - the electronic random number indicator equipment used by National Savings. Premium bond winnings are free of UK income tax and you do not lose your capital. You can cash in your holding at any time. Each month, Ernie selects more than 180,000 prizes, ranging from Pounds 50 to Pounds 250,000. Bonds can be bought at the post office or direct from National Savings at Lytham St Annes, Lancashire. They are available in blocks of 10 numbers of Pounds 1 each and there is a minimum cash investment of Pounds 100 unless you are re-investing Pounds 50 prizes. But you have to wait three months after purchase before your bonds go into the draws. The maximum holding was increased to Pounds 20,000 earlier this year and spouses may each hold the maximum. Bonds may also be bought for children, up to the same amount, subject to the Pounds 3,000 annual inheritance tax limit for each parent. Parents do not pay tax on prizes won by children. The value of bonds eligible for the draw now totals about Pounds 2.5bn. A prize fund, which may be varied from time to time, is calculated at 5 per cent on this figure and allocated according to a formula set out in the National Savings prospectus. Every month there is one prize of Pounds 250,000, five of Pounds 10,000 and 25 of Pounds 5,000. Weekly draws are for one prize each of Pounds 100,000, Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 25,000. The remainder of the prize fund is split between prizes of Pounds 1,000, Pounds 500, Pounds 100 and Pounds 50. Most prizes - more than 160,000 - are worth just Pounds 50. What, then, are the chances of winning a prize? National Savings calculates that the probability of each single Pounds 1 bond winning a prize in each monthly draw are 15,000 to 1. At these odds, it reckons the chances of not winning any prize, if you own the maximum holding for a year, are 8,900,000 to 1. A person with 'average luck' holding the maximum of Pounds 20,000 is likely to win 16 prizes a year. If each prize were the minimum Pounds 50, the tax-free return on capital would be 4 per cent a year - within spitting distance of the net return on an instant access building society account. One larger prize puts you firmly in the money. One north London investor quotes his return so far this year on a holding of Pounds 10,000 as 7.5 per cent, with two months still to run. And then there is the delicious prospect of a big win. At this point, I hear murmurs. Is it fair? Is it not rigged in favour of investors in the south? Do not people who hold blocks of Pounds 500 or Pounds 1,000 stand a better chance than those with small numbers? National Savings goes to great lengths to make sure that all bond numbers stand an equal chance of winning. People from the south do win more often, but that is because they own more bonds. People usually assume that the bond numbers are inputted and a computerised tombola does the rest. In fact, Ernie is provided with the configuration of letters and figures which it must use, and then assembles its own patterns entirely at random. These are matched separately against bond numbers in the draw to find the lucky ones. Tests are made by the Government Actuary before and after each draw to ensure that the random nature of the process is operating correctly. Premium bonds are worth thinking about if you are going to have cash to spare for a reasonable period of time - say, a year or so. Those paying tax, and especially people on fixed pensions, surely resent paying tax on interest from building society or bank deposit accounts. While interest rates and inflation remain at a low level, it costs little to take a punt; after all, at worst, all you stand to lose is the net interest you would have earned on your deposit and the inflation effect. For many, the thrill of a letter in the post from Ernie is part of the lure of the investment. Some sort of prize could arrive on your doormat at just about any time. But, if you get tired of waiting, you need the cash or your faith in Ernie runs out, you can always ask for your money back.</p>

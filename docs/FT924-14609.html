			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Currencies rise against D-Mark STERLING, the dollar and the lira gained ground against the D-Mark yesterday as expectations grew that the Bundesbank may cut interest rates later this month. Amid signs that the currency tensions across the world may be easing, the Bank of Italy cut its official borrowing rate to take advantage of the reduced pressure on the lira in recent days. Italy's cut in its Lombard rate by 0.5 percentage points to 16 per cent followed an easing in money market dealing rates over the past three days in Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark. Yesterday's reduced strains on European currencies and the dollar followed indications last week that the Bundesbank may be preparing the ground for a cut in its credit rates soon, on account of the gloomy outlook for the German economy. However, a member of the Bundesbank council attempted to reduce some of the speculation about an imminent cut in German rates. Mr Johann Gaddum said recent interest rate adjustments had led some people to conclude that the bank had undertaken a fundamental change of course. 'It is imperative to warn against these false expectations. The medium-term aims of our policy remain unchanged,' he told a Luxembourg conference. On foreign exchanges, sterling gained nearly two pfennigs to close in London at DM2.49, and rose further in New York to DM2.4967. The rise came in spite of a cool response from markets to Mr Norman Lamont's speech at the Tory party conference, on the grounds that he specified few changes in economic policy. Hopes of a cut in UK rates, now 9 per cent, gave a spurt to share prices on the London stock market, where the FT-SE 100 Index gained 21.7 to 2,538.8. The dollar rallied against the D-Mark, partly because of speculation that US interest rates are unlikely to come down before the US presidential election. The dollar closed in London at DM1.4730, more than 3 pfennigs up on the day and nearly 6 pfennigs higher on the week. In New York it advanced to DM1.4825. The lira closed at L888.0 against the D-Mark, L22.9 higher on the day, and L92 higher than its low point on Tuesday, giving the Bank of Italy the opportunity to cut rates to inject demand into the flagging Italian economy. In New York the lira was quoted at L880.41. The market's belief that German interest rates may soon come down is partly based on the Bundesbank's recent operations in the German money market. Late last week, the Bundesbank reduced the rate at which it deals in the German money market to 8.9 per cent, 0.6 points below its key emergency Lombard rate. Economists believe that the reduction in market dealing rates makes it technically easier for the bank to cut the Lombard rate without adversely affecting the D-Mark. At the same time, the Bundesbank has fuelled expectations of a further cut in rates by softening the emphasis it places on one of its key indicators in the growth of money supply. Recent policy statements by Bundesbank council members suggest that the bank is drawing back from its insistence that the M3 measure of money supply - which includes cash in circulation, current accounts and short-term deposits  -should be regarded as the most important indicator of monetary stability. In his speech yesterday, Mr Gaddum reasserted the bank's strategy: to steer money supply growth rates back into the target range of 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent a year, and reduce inflation. However, he warned, it would not be possible to meet money growth targets this year. After running at 9 per cent in August, growth in the main M3 measure was further accelerated by the bank's interventions during the recent currency crisis. Yesterday, Denmark's central bank cut the rates at which it deals in its money market by 0.2 points to 8.9 per cent, in line with the Bundesbank's move.

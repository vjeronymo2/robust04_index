			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: S&amp;P sees US newspapers recovering THE US newspaper industry is showing signs of recovery, with prospects for a strengthening of profitability toward the second half of 1992, according to a report from Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency. A survey by the agency of nine publicly-quoted newspaper groups concluded that earnings in the last quarter of 1991, while mixed, were generally encouraging. Advertising lineage figures for the month of January, meanwhile, pointed to a near halt to the decline in advertising demand. S&amp;P said ratings on most newspaper companies would not be downgraded this year, although the rating outlook for several group - including Dow Jones, Knight-Ridder and Times Mirror - remained negative because of concern that the recession may last longer than expected. Mr Robert Nelson, a senior vice-president at S&amp;P, said it appeared that most of the newspaper groups examined were beginning to emerge from what he called the industry's worst ever downturn. Most newspapers had taken what S&amp;P termed 'prudent measures' to bolster creditworthiness. These measures included a more cautious investment profile, cuts in operating costs and the lowering of debt burdens. S&amp;P noted that Dow Jones - whose flagship paper The Wall Street Journal is dependent upon national and financial advertising - had a stronger fourth quarter last year, with advertising lineage at The Journal down by only 0.7 per cent and advertising revenues 3.3 per cent higher. Mr Nelson said recessionary pressures on US newspaper companies would abate slowly during the first half of 1992, with more rapid strengthening likely in the closing months of the year. The well-diversified groups, such as Gannett and Knight-Ridder, might show better results sooner than companies such as the Times Mirror group, which relies on the harder hit north-east and southern California regions.</p>

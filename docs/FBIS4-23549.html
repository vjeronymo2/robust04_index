			<p>BFN     [Text] Nigerian elites and members of the political class  have been cautioned against the temptation of using force to  take over power from the military. The Senate president in the  Second Republic and a member of the National Constitutional  Conference Commission, Dr. Joseph Wayas, gave the warning at a  news briefing in Abuja today.    Dr. Wayas drew the attention of politicians to the fact that  even the military, who were forced out of their posts by their  colleagues, have refrained from using force to insist on  returning to power. He stressed the belief that the crisis  surrounding 12 June which the country was currently facing was  created and promoted by those who think Nigeria could not  survive unless they were in power.    Dr. Wayas stressed the need for those he called campaigners  of disorder to reflect on the fortitude, forebearance, and sense  of responsibility displayed by media political actors who came  before them. He condemned the recent statement credited to the  president of the defunct Senate, Mr. Ameh Ebute, in which he  declared the Provisional Ruling Council and the government as  illegal.    The former Senate president, who noted that the Senate of  the  ill-fated Third Republic had no legal standing, wondered why  those who participated in illegality should speak of the  illegality of any administration.</p>

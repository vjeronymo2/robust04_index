			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Economic data put US Treasuries in reverse US Treasury bond prices slipped yesterday amid fresh questions about the economy fundamentals and the timing of the next increase in short-term interest rates. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/32 lower at 86 5/16 , with the yield rising to 7.397 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 7/32 , to yield 5.99 per cent. Bonds gave back some of Friday's big gains after the National Association of Purchasing Management released the results of its July survey. The overall index of business activity showed only a slight gain at 57.8, from 57.5 the previous month. But analysts had expected a decline, and the disappointment depressed bond prices across the board. Last week's bullishness had stemmed largely from data showing an unexpected rise in business inventories, suggesting a slowdown in activity during the third quarter. The NAPM report not only suggested the economy was speeding up, but it offered evidence that manufacturing stockpiles had receded last month. In turn, the market's confidence that monetary policy was on hold had to be re-evaluated yet again. But damage was contained at modest levels, partly because of an encouraging dip in the NAPM's prices-paid index, which indicated that upward pressure on the cost of raw materials had eased. The figures allowed inflation-sensitive bonds to trim their losses going into the afternoon session in sluggish activity. Earlier in the day, the market traded higher on weaker-than-expected readings on the consumer sector. The Commerce Department said personal income had edged ahead 0.1 per cent, against forecasts of a 0.4 per cent gain. Personal consumption climbed 0.4 per cent, slightly below forecasts of 0.6 per cent. European government bonds ended a quiet session little changed, drifting sideways in thin volume. Investors were reported to be holding back, limiting themselves largely to intra-market trades, such as yield curve lengthening, or inter-market dealing, switching from one market to another. 'Customers aren't putting any new money into the market - there's still a lot of nervousness around,' said Mr Troy Bowler, international strategist at Paine Webber in London. UK gilts recouped early losses to end little changed on very thin volume, but sentiment remained fragile after Friday's flurry of speculation over interest rates. Expectations of a pre-emptive interest rate increase largely abated after the Bank of England left money market dealing rates unchanged in yesterday's operations, indicating that base rates were to be held at 5.25 per cent. But traders were loth to sound the all-clear before today's publication of the central bank's quarterly inflation report. A bearish report could reignite fears of a rate increase, they said. Friday's rush of speculation, which began when the Bank accepted bids at up to 5.75 per cent at its weekly T-bill auction, has left the market on tenterhooks. 'People will be just that bit more nervous about interpreting the Bank's moves in the future,' said Mr Peter Fellner, gilt strategist at NatWest Markets. 'We now have a situation where the market will constantly look for some sort of evidence that could trigger a move,' he added. The September long-gilt future on Liffe ended the day at 101  21/32 , up 1/32 on the day. German bonds ended a quiet session a touch firmer in extremely thin trading. 'We're caught in a range and with retail investors sidelined, that's where we'll stay, for now,' said a bund salesman. The September bund future on Liffe ended at 93.78, up 0.13 point. French bonds tracked bunds slightly higher in similarly trendless trade. The September notional futures contract on Matif ended at 117.26, up 0.24 point. Spanish bonds put on the best performance, rising by more than a point at the long end. The rally was partly supported by continued investor switching out of Italian bonds, traders said. Also, investors appeared to be focusing on Spain's improving fundamentals, especially its encouraging inflation outlook, they said. The yield spread on the Spanish 10-year benchmark bond over its German counterpart narrowed to 337 basis points from 358 on Friday. Italian bonds ended on a firmer note, in spite of fresh supply of 10- and 30-year bonds. However, sentiment remained nervous ahead of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's appearance before parliament today, where he will answer questions about plans to separate his public office and business interests.</p>

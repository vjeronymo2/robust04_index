			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Proteus in development talks with nine companies Proteus International, the USM-quoted drug designer, is in talks with nine pharmaceuticals companies over development programmes in the immune system and in treating arthritis. Five large pharmaceutical companies are interested in its Adjuvant immune system booster for use with vaccines, with commercial arrangements possible next year. Talks with one US and three Japanese companies about a technology to stimulate cartilage growth which could reduce the need for surgery in arthritis victims are at a preliminary stage. The conclusion of at least one set of discussions is likely this financial year, said Mr Kevin Gilmore, executive chairman. The company already has collaborations with four other companies in human and animal health including American Home Products and UK company Medeva. Proteus also reported results for the year to March 31 which showed research and administrative spending rising from Pounds 3.93m to Pounds 6.47m as potential products progressed through their development programmes. As with many young biotechnology companies, sales were zero, against Pounds 21,000, and pre-tax losses rose from Pounds 3.55m to Pounds 6.62m. Losses per share rose from 13.52p to 24.36p. Just after the March 31 year end, the company completed a 1-for-7 rights issue at 284p. The proceeds raised the net cash position from Pounds 1.6m at the year end to about Pounds 12m. The shares rose yesterday by 7p to 208p. Mr Gilmore said that all of the 30 drug development programmes were ahead of the schedule set out in the rights issue offer document. 'Modest revenues are anticipated to commence during 1994-5,' he said. Sales would grow 'to provide a base for substantial expansion in 1996-7'. The company's strategy is to develop new drugs and to licence them to companies for the late stages of development, manufacture and marketing.</p>

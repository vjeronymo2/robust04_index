			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Mitsui signs multi-media deal with NET Mitsui, Japan's second-largest trading house, yesterday cemented another element in its multi-media ambitions when it signed an agreement with Network Equipment Technologies, the US telecommunications equipment manufacturer. Last year, Mitsui's Adamnet subsidiary began building its multi-media expertise aimed at providing network services from installation to management. The deal allows Mitsui to become NET's sole agent in Japan for three years. The company will invest several million dollars in research and development to adapt the US technology for Japan. NET is strong in local area network technology. The company is developing an expertise in asynchronous transfer mode, which allows for the rapid transmission of the text, audio and visuals necessary for multi-media communications. Mitsui projected sales for the 1994 financial year of Y1bn, and Y4bn within three years.</p>

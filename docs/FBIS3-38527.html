This military school, which is renowned throughout the world  for its marine mine warfare training, can now use a computer to  simulate the maneuvers of a whole fleet. [passage omitted]    Belgian and Dutch naval officials proudly explained on  Thursday: "With all its possibilities and its exceptional  performance, this simulator is the only one of its kind in NATO,  and indeed in the world. The ships and different types of  sensors and weapons systems can all be simulated by the computer  database, and the consoles are of a universal type. It will  even be able to accurately simulate future NATO systems in a  very realistic environment."    Officers from both countries participated in the design of  this new tool, developed by the American company CAE Link which  specializes in simulation.    The construction of the simulator launched on Thursday was  financed by NATO, in return for which the allied navies can hire  the system to train their own crews. [passage omitted]    The simulator can also display on screen the image, in fact  the "virtual reality," sent back by the camera on a  minisubmarine sent out to hunt for mines on the sea bed.  [passage omitted]    This system also makes it possible for crews to discover  potential new operations areas. [passage omitted]</p>

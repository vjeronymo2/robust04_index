			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Rocky road offers no respite for bonds: A continuing bear market Bond fund managers have had a rough ride in the first half of this year, and the second half is shaping up to be just as difficult. Most investors expected last year's bull run to continue, fuelled by further cuts in European short-term interest rates and low-inflation economic growth. Instead, government bond markets have experienced a collapse in sentiment which has pushed up nominal 10-year yields in Europe by between 170 and 250 basis points since the end of 1993. Reversing last year's convergence trend, yields have diverged sharply, with the higher-yielding markets worst hit. The yield spread of the UK 10-year gilt over the German bund has widened to about 150 basis points, from 41 at the start of the year; the French spread has expanded to plus 62 from minus 9; and the Italian yield premium has jumped to more than 350 from 256 in April. The sell-off began early in the year, when hedge funds and other highly leveraged players took profits, offloading massive bond holdings. When on February 4 the US Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates, this signalled the end of the low interest rate era and inflation fears prompted further selling. Since then every piece of data showing strong growth in the US economy and recovery in Europe has triggered further falls in the bond markets. Rising commodity and oil prices have further fuelled fears of inflation. In this bearish environment, most bond funds have put in a sorry performance. According to Micropal, the fund performance measurement service, 96 UK-based global bond funds posted an average loss of 6.4 per cent in the first five months of the year, with performances ranging between plus 5.2 per cent and minus 15.8 per cent. So, what now? 'Judging by the fundamentals, with low inflation and low interest rates, bonds everywhere look extremely cheap,' says Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International. 'Yet we have been saying that for three months now and they are still getting cheaper by the day.' After getting their fingers burnt, ling markets, most investors have embarked on a 'buyers' strike' and are refusing to take on new positions. Many say the markets' inflation paranoia is overdone. They point to the current benign environment - with inflation rates in the US, Germany and the UK at or below 3 per cent - and to forecasts that inflation will remain subdued for the rest of 1994. Yet bond markets continue to fall, and implied future interest rates in the money markets indicate that dealers expect European interest rates to rise before the end of the year. But while inflation fears and other perceived risks may have contributed to the rise in nominal yields, 'the key is the rise in real yields', says Mr Shepperd. Real yields - over and above inflation - have risen to about 4 per cent in the UK from 2.9 per cent at beginning of the year. The main reason is a sharp increase in supply: investors offloading their bond holdings, financial institutions offsetting losses in their marketmaking and proprietary trading activities, and, most importantly, government issues to finance large budget deficits. Real yields have also been driven higher by the pick-up in world economic growth. Capital will be needed to fuel that growth, and there is talk of an impending global capital shortage. What is more, 'there has been a sea change in the international economic policy environment', says Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London. 'Governments' commitment to keeping inflation down, rather than stimulate growth to reduce unemployment, is being doubted.' Political uncertainty in Europe's election year, further fiscal slippage, continued growth of German money supply and hints of disagreement in the UK between the central bank and the Treasury are fuelling doubts. 'My advice to investors is to use any rally to reduce exposure to bonds,' says Mr MacKinnon. Ironically, the sharp rise in long-term yields may turn out to be a blessing. Higher long-term interest rates, to which a large amount of borrowing is pegged, may damp some growth optimism and resulting inflation fears that initially contributed to the bond sell-off. Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers in New York, says the increase in European yields 'will undermine growth expectations directly'. Moreover, 'the latest bond yield rise up will increase the pressure on European governments to tighten fiscal policy further, rather than watch passively as higher debt financing costs push budget deficits - and real long-term bond yields - still higher', Mr Lipsky argues. Some take an even gloomier view. 'The risk is high that the world will sink back into recession before the end of the year,' warns Mr Stephen Lewis, director of research at the London Bond Broking Company. Many say the outlook for the second half hinges on US developments. If growth there shows signs of slowing, fears of further interest rate tightening may ease, allowing treasuries to stabilise. Until then, European bond markets are expected to be volatile. 'We are running defensive positions consisting of cash, short-dated paper and reduced exposure to the peripheral markets in favour of the core markets,' says Mr Paul Abberley, head of fixed income at fund managers Lombard Odier. Historically, bear markets have lasted for two to three years. By that standard, the current bear market is still in its early days.</p>

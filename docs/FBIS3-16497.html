			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valer Kalinowski: "Belarusian Popular Front Will </F> Not Support Shushkevich"]    [Text] On 12 March, the Belarusian Popular Front [BNF]  Council discussed the development of the political situation and  prospects for elections in Belarus. As was pointed out by  Zyanon Paznyak, the BNF does not aim to electioneer before the  adoption of the constitution, as is being done by S.  Shushkevich, M. Hryb, and A. Lukashenka during their numerous  clamorous tours across the Republic. However as soon as the  elections are announced, the BNF will definitely launch its  electoral campaign. According to Y. Khadyka, the BNF has plans  to reach a preelection agreement with other parties. The  content of the agreement will depend on the concrete situation  and will, at a maximum, envision support for one candidate or,  at a minimum, joint control over observance of the law in the  course of the elections. The BNF leadership believes that their  organization has realistic chances for success. Yet, according  to Z. Paznyak, this would happen only if the electorate faces a  clear-cut dilemma of choosing between a man from the opposition  and a representative of the old nomenklatura. A third candidate  and a third way would be a threat. Zyanon Paznyak pointed out  that Stanislav Shushkevich is the man specifically threatening  BNF's future and added: "Someone either advocates independence  or opposes it; there is no other option." In Paznyak's opinion,  Shushkevich is the concrete politician responsible for what  happened in Belarus.    Due to BNF support, Shushkevich became deputy chairman and  then chairman of the Belarusian legislature. However in the  end, he abandoned the BNF and chose his own path, tolerating the  annulment of the referendum and the legalization of the  Communist Party of Belarus. The BNF cannot forgive this. Thus,  Paznyak pointed out, (and was supported by other council  members), the Popular Front would no longer support Shushkevich  and quite probably, would campaign against him. Shushkevich's  aspiration to take part in presidential elections and his  attempts to look for support from political parties and the  electorate had evidently irritated the BNF. In Paznyak's  opinion, "This situation causes confusion and discord in the  democratic camp. Democrats will lose. When opportunists come  to the fore, the nomenklatura will be victorious."    Nevertheless, the BNF faction believes that it is rather  improbable that there will be several candidates for president.  The draft law on presidential elections provides for the  nomination of candidates by either 70 lawmakers or 100,000  electors. Alternative candidates will encounter enormous  difficulties. However the BNF is not going to dodge them.  Making use of its experience, the organization will begin  collecting signatures, aware that a candidate nominated by the  electorate will be in an advantageous position as compared to  his opponent nominated by Supreme Soviet deputies. In the  electoral campaign, the BNF intends to seek support from young  people, workers, and intelligentsia. It also stresses the need  to form veterans and pensioners organizations faithful to the  idea of independence, and to appeal for women's support.</p>

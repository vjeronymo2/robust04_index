			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Fresh tax rules for foreign companies win wary backing INTERNATIONAL tax lawyers and foreign governments have responded with cautious approval to new rules from the US Internal Revenue Service on the taxation of earnings by foreign-owned companies. The new rules, put out on a temporary basis, are expected to be less helpful to foreign corporations than the current ones, which date from the 1960s, but still represent a significant retreat from proposals put out by the IRS last year, and widely denounced by US and foreign multinationals as unworkable. The Section 482 transfer pricing regulations control the way companies price the goods and services they exchange with their overseas subsidiaries. Many members of congress, as well as President-elect Bill Clinton, have claimed foreign companies manipulate these intra-company prices to make profits appear at home, rather than at the level of the US subsidiary. Most international treaties stipulate these transfer prices should be determined on an arm's-length basis, as if the parent and the subsidiary were selling their goods or services to an unrelated company. Regulations proposed by the IRS last year imposed a 'comparable profits interval' test as a mandatory check that the foreign-owned subsidiary was reporting similar profits to its US competitors. Companies will now be able to choose from a variety of approaches, though required to produce a considerable volume of documentation to justify their transfer pricing structure. 'They do represent a more realistic approach to the tests which one must make,' Mr Carr Ferguson, tax partner with the law firm of Davis, Polk and Wardwell, said. 'It's a lot more acceptable than the proposed regulations, and much more in keeping with the arm's-length principle,' a European diplomat. added. 'We think these regulations are fully consistent with the arm's-length principle,' said Mr Alan Wilensky, assistant-secretary for tax policy at the US Treasury. Some accountants warned the new Section 482 rules would impose a burden on companies to document from the outset the business decisions behind their transfer pricing structures, rather than attempting to justify their pricing retrospectively. It is unclear what future awaits the new rules, promulgated just a week before the new Clinton administration takes office, but which do not take effect until April. 'The incoming administration has been given a 90-day window to act,' said Mr Steven Hannes, national director of transfer pricing with the accounting firm of Deloitte and Touche. But Mr Clinton may be under such pressure to fulfil his campaign promise to levy an extra Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.2bn) a year from foreign companies that further legislation is likely, and some Washington lawyers believe foreign governments need to take tough pre-emptive action. 'Clinton made it an article of faith. The only thing Congress will listen to is pressure from the grassroots, and retaliation,' Mr Dan Burt, of the law firm of Burt, Maner and Miller, said.</p>

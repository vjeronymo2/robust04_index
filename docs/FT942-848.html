			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: USA must wait as Romania and Switzerland go through Romania, inspired by tireless midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, produced a disciplined display last night to burst the USA's bubble by beating them 1-0 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The result, along with a 2-0 victory for Colombia over Switzerland in San Francisco, means Romania finish as winners of Group A. Switzerland also progress to the second phase on goal difference from the US, who must wait to see if their four points will be good enough to take them through as one of the four best third-place finishers. After taking the lead in the 17th minute through Dan Petrescu following poor positioning by US keeper Tony Meola, Romania showed some of the inventiveness and dominance missing from their drubbing at the hands of the Swiss earlier in the week. They could - and should - have put the game beyond reach by the first ten minutes of the second half, Raducioiu in particular having several good opportunities. But the US team pressed relentlessly in the last half hour, without ever making the crucial final breakthrough. In San Francisco, Switzerland were all but certain of a second round place for the first time for 40 years, and their play was suitably passionless. Colombia's midfielder Hernan Gaviria scored with a close-range header just before the end of a first half which his side had dominated with some delightful approach work. Gaviria nodded home a free kick by Colombian captain Carlos Valderrama to round off the team's most sustained display of open, attacking soccer since the start of the tournament, in which Pele had seen them as potential champions. Substitute Harold Lozano sealed victory with a second goal in the final minute. But the win was not enough to stave off elimination for the Colombians after two defeats in their earlier matches.</p>

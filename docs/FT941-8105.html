			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Finmeccanica in talks on McDonnell Douglas link Finmeccanica, the Italian state engineering group, is considering possible shareholding links with McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace group, according to Italian newspapers, Reuter reports from Rome. A spokesman for Finmeccanica's parent Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale declined detailed comment on a report in La Repubblica that the Italian group was planning to buy a stake of up to 20 per cent in the US group. Finmeccanica confirmed that talks were being held but that there had been no discussion on the size of any possible holding. The IRI spokesman added that a recent IRI board meeting gave the go-ahead to Finmeccanica to hold talks with McDonnell Douglas, but declined to elaborate on the purpose of the negotiations. Earlier this month, Flight International magazine reported Finmeccanica was considering buying a 10-20 per cent stake in the US group's Douglas Aircraft subsidiary. Finmeccanica last week agreed to buy eight defence and aerospace firms controlled by Efim, Italy's third state holding group which collapsed in 1992. Finmeccanica is part of the ATR consortium which makes medium-range commuter jets.</p>

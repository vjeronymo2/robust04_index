			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (18): A new chapter for the EDC - As it enters the domestic credit market, debate is hotting up over how broad the agency's mandate should be / Canada's Export Development Corporation Canada's Export Development Corporation is about to enter uncharted - and potentially turbulent - waters. Under a law passed by parliament last year, the government-owned export credit and insurance agency has for the first time gained the power to write capital leases and domestic credit-insurance policies, and to take an equity participation in foreign projects. The EDC thinks it should be applauded for improving and expanding its services to Canadian exporters and their foreign customers. But the new powers have raised questions about how broad a government agency's mandate should be, especially when its activities bring it into head-to-head competition with the private sector. Just how much of a threat the EDC will be to the private sector will not be known for another month or two. Although the new law was passed last June, regulations implementing the changes have yet to be promulgated. Paul Labbe, EDC's president, says the new powers are the culmination of a process begun more than five years ago to make the EDC more responsive to the needs of its customers. 'We adopted the vision that we want to be the best in the world in providing those financial services to our customers,' he says. Besides the new law, the EDC has stepped up in-house training programmes, modernised its computer systems, and brought in new skills. Its senior ranks include a general manager for quality and customer satisfaction. The fruits of these efforts are evident in a rapid growth in the EDC's business. Its export finance commitments have more than doubled since 1991, including a 54 per cent surge last year to CDollars 3.2bn (Pounds 1.57bn). Insurance volumes climbed by 30 per cent last year to CDollars 8.6bn. To its credit, the EDC also enjoys wide respect in international capital markets for its innovative debt strategies. It has become a sizeable player in derivatives markets. But Canadian banks and insurance companies make no secret of their nervousness at the prospect of stiffer competition from an institution which pays no taxes and is subject to less stringent capital and provisioning rules. The private-sector groups are withholding final judgement until the regulations are finalised. But Mr Parker Gallant, who heads Toronto-Dominion Bank's trade-finance division, says that the EDC 'should be there as a lender of last resort, not doing everything for everybody'. Tom Leonard, president of Trade Indemnity, a private-sector credit insurance underwriter whose business has grown even more rapidly than the EDC over the past five years, notes that no other government agencies in developed countries are going into the domestic-credit market: 'Why should the EDC?' Mr Leonard asks. Critics complain that the EDC's moves are based on its own selfish ambitions. Instead of being a facilitator of private-sector financing and insurance such as the US's Eximbank, the EDC 'wants to be a bank, and it wants to be an insurance company to the detriment of a strong private sector,' Mr Leonard says. Especially galling to its critics are signs that the EDC operates under different rules to its private-sector competitors. Its credit and insurance losses have climbed to levels which would be unacceptable to most banks or insurance companies. Non-performing loans, totalling CDollars 2.3bn, amounted to 30 per cent of its total assets at the end of 1993. Loan losses last year were more than four times the original projection. Insurance claims paid out soared to CDollars 47.7m from CDollars 18.4m, due largely to higher claims on shipments to Iran, the US and Cuba. Mr Labbe acknowledges that, when the new rules come into force, 'there's going to be a little shaking-out period on both sides, from the banks, the insurance companies and ourselves.' But he notes that the new law provides for a five-year review of the EDC's activities. By then, he hopes that the corporation and private lenders will be collaborating more closely in joint financings. According to Mr Labbe, the EDC has come under growing pressure to provide capital lease facilities and other types of off-balance sheet financing, especially for purchases of Canadian aircraft and power-generation equipment. The EDC's presence in the domestic credit-insurance market, Mr Labbe says, will help exporters who want to deal with a single provider of export and domestic receivables insurance. Its move into pre-shipment financing is also designed to make life simpler for the exporter. In the past, the corporation had to confine these facilities only to the export portion of a company's output. Mr Labbe promises that the EDC will not rush into equity partnerships 'just for the sake of increasing volumes'. But the privatisation of many infrastructure projects, such as power stations, highways and airport terminals, has created new opportunities for exporters. 'The ability to take an equity position at the front end, which would securitise to a certain degree the other lenders, enhances the chances of a project coming off,' Mr Labbe says. The EDC has gripes of its own against some of the multinational lending agencies with which it would like to collaborate. For instance, the corporation has so far done relatively little business in eastern Europe, and none in partnership with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The security assigned to each lender in a joint financing is one of the stumbling blocks which still needs to be ironed out between the EDC and EBRD. 'We don't particularly want somebody to rank ahead of us if we're sharing the risks,' Mr Labbe says.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Analysis and Forecast of China's </F> Economic Situation in 1994"]    [Text] How will China's economy develop in 1994?    Economists from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  [CASS]  and the State Statistics Bureau made their analyses and  forecasts a few days ago.    This so-called "Spring Report," based on an analysis and  forecast of China's economic situation in 1994, was made by a  study group presided over by Liu Guoguang, former president and  now guest adviser to the CASS, and led by Li Jingwen, director  of the CASS Institute of Quantitative and Technical Economics,  and Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist in the State Statistics Bureau.  The group was comprised of many economic researchers from the  CASS and the State Statistics Bureau.    It is considered by international economic circles as a  comparatively advanced method of analysis and forecast to use  the means of combining modelization with positivist analysis to  forecast the macroeconomic trend. The study group, which uses  this method to analyze and forecast the economic situation in  our country, divides its analysis and forecast into a "Spring  Report" and a "Fall Report."    "The Overall Measure for Macroeconomic Regulation and  Control  in 1994," carried in the last issue of this magazine put forward  suggestions on the basis of last year's "Fall Report." The main  points of the study group's "Spring Report" on the trend in  economic development in 1994 are as follows:  <H5>  The Main Characteristics of China's Economic Development in </H5> 1994    In 1994, our country will maintain a considerably fast  economic growth rate but the macroeconomic regulation and  control will also face fairly serious problems. Generally, the  economic development this year will have the following main  characteristics:    After two successive years of rapid growth, the speed of our  economic growth rate will tend to slow down but the fall will  not be too big. The economy will maintain its momentum for  fairly high growth throughout the year and it is expected that  the GDP will grow by 11.5 percent. The seasonal growth this  year will tend to be fast at first and then it will slow down.  Viewed from the growth structure of industries, the added  values of the primary industry, secondary industry and the  tertiary industry will rise by 3.5, 16, and 10.5 percent  respectively. The gap between the growth in the tertiary  industry and the growth of GDP will further narrow. This will  be advantageous to the rationalization of the industrial  structure.    It is necessary to maintain a fairly fast economic growth  rate in 1994.    First, it will help avoid major fluctuations in the economic  development, limit the effect of shocks caused by cyclical  fluctuations of the economy, maintain the stability of economic  development, and maintain the situation of social stability and  unity.    Second, a complementary relationship exists between the  vigorous development of infrastructure and basic industries and  the maintenance of a fairly fast economic growth rate. Basic  industries cannot depend solely on stock adjustments to increase  their supply capacity but must chiefly depend on investment to  increase new supply capacity. This requires that the economy  grow at a considerably high speed to supply funds and materials.  It is only when the "bottleneck" restriction of the basic  industries is alleviated that the economy can maintain rapid  development.    Third, it is also necessary to maintain a fairly high  economic growth rate, especially in the comparatively backward  and poor areas in central and western China, to improve the  uneven economic development between areas and narrow the income  differences between residents in various walks of life.    Fourth, given that China relies chiefly on speed to obtain  efficiency, only by maintaining a fairly rapid economic growth  rate is it possible to ensure a steady increase in residents'  incomes and constantly improve the people's living standards.    Fifth, the world is "upbeat about China." In 1993, actual  use of foreign funds increased by 91.5 percent while direct  foreign investment increased by 130 percent. A sharp decrease  in the economic growth rate will affect the introduction of  foreign funds.    The possibility exists of maintaining a fairly rapid growth  rate in our economy.    First, the deepening reform has provided a better  environment  in terms of economic structure. The development of economic  sectors under different systems of ownership has strengthened  the vitality of the whole economy.    Second, in 1993, infrastructural construction developed  fairly quickly, with communications and post and  telecommunications doubling and redoubling and the production  output of basic industries increasing fairly rapidly. With  great increases in state investment in basic industries and a  fairly quick development of the national economy for several  years in succession, the "bottleneck" sectors have strengthened  their adaptability to the speedy development of the national  economy. Consequently, their restriction has been alleviated  and will be further alleviated.    Third, the nearly 2,000 billion yuan investment in fixed  assets in 1992 and 1993 will gradually develop into productive  capacity and consequently improve the supply condition.    Fourth, in 1993, per-capita income of residents in cities  and  towns increased by 10.2 percent, that of rural residents  increased by 3.2 percent, and investment in fixed assets on a  society-wide scale actually increased by 22 percent. In 1994  the income of the residents and investment will remain at a  rather high level. This will increase social demand and make it  possible for the economy to grow quite rapidly.    However, the analysis of the necessity and possibility  of maintaining a comparatively fast economic growth rate is only  one side of the problem. Under the current situation wherein  the pressure of inflation is quite serious, we should be  flexibly in coordinating the objective of controlling inflation  with the objective of maintaining a fast economic growth rate  and strictly prevent the occurrence of malignant inflation  brought about by the blind pursuit of high growth rates by  localities.    Investment Remains the Chief Impetus For Pushing  Economic Growth Ahead in 1994    In 1994, investment will remain the chief impetus to push  economic growth ahead. The growth rate of investment will still  outstrip that of the GDP. It is estimated that the total  societywide investment in fixed assets for the year will reach  1,500 billion yuan, an increase of 27 percent or an actual  increase of about 12 percent.    The growth in investment scale will slow down but it is  still  necessary to maintain moderate investment. The main reasons are  as follows:    First, the maintenance of a certain scale of society-wide  investment in fixed assets is highly necessary for the  realization of a stable transition of the national economy. It  will help prevent the occurrence of economic slide and the  intensification of the contradictions between the general supply  and general demand.    Second, in 1993, the total society-wide investment in fixed  assets increased by 50.6 percent, the highest increase since the  reform and opening to the outside world began. However, because  the construction scale was over-extended and the funds were far  from being made available, the commissioning rate of investment  in fixed assets was only 47 percent last year, the lowest for  the past 10 years and more. Under such circumstances it is  necessary to maintain a moderate investment scale. Any method  of major retrenchment or big cuts will be inappropriate and  cause bigger losses, mainly because it will weaken market demand  and increase sedimented funds.    Third, in terms of investment structure, in 1993, with the  exception of communications and telecommunications, the  proportion of investment decreased in those weak sectors that  needed to be strengthened urgently, such as agriculture, energy,  and raw materials. It was the lowest since the reform and  opening to the outside world began. To ensure funds can be  concentrated for the development of the "bottleneck" sectors and  to carry out structural readjustment in an active way, it is  also necessary to maintain a moderate scale of investment. The  stress of investment in 1994 should be laid on structural  readjustment and the strengthening of the weak links to reduce  losses and optimize the structure.    Fourth, after the rectification of the financial order in  1993, the monetary system itself has a lot of overstored  currency. By the end of 1993, the provision rate [bei fu jin lu  0271 0102 6855 3764] of specialized banks in the central bank  was as high as 11.9 percent. Besides, the pressure of  increasing currency issues will no longer aggravate because of  the reform of the tax system and the implementation of the new  system of financial revenue and expenditure. Therefore, the  banking financial system has the credit capability to support a  moderate investment scale.    Fifth, although there are still deficits in foreign trade  the  cash balance has increased, thus increasing the room for  maneuver.    However, one problem that cannot be neglected is that  the scale of investment has become the most fundamental root  cause of the pressure of inflation. The problem now is not how  to make investment up to a moderate scale but how to control  investment within a moderate scale. This requires that we  should control the force of macroeconomic regulation and control  appropriately and implement the financial, monetary, and fiscal  policies correctly, while accelerating reform of the investment  structure. So long as finance is not out of control, that is,  the issue of new currency does not exceed 160 billion yuan and  the scale of newly added loans does not exceed 550 billion yuan,  the scale of investment in fixed assets will not be out of  control.  <H5>  The Main Characteristics of the Current Inflation in Our </H5> Country    Since the last quarter of 1993, the price levels of our  country have shown a continuous tendency to rise. Since the  beginning of 1994, the situation has tended to be more serious.  In the first quarter of the year, the national retail price  index increased by 20.1 percent over the same period last year.  The central government has taken various measures to restrain  the momentum of rocketing price hikes.    Since March, price increases have tended to slow down.  According to predictions, the commodity retail price index for  the whole year will rise by 13.2 percent while the cost of  living index for the residents will rise by about 14.5 percent.  The increase rate will generally be the same as last year or a  bit higher. The price index of investment goods will rise by  about 15 percent, lower than last year.    If we do not restrain excessive price increases quickly,  this  will hamper the reform, affect development, and also cause  social instability. So, the price problem can by no means be  treated lightly. We should analyze the causes of excessive  price increases so as to take corresponding measures. On the  other hand, we should flexibly coordinate-ordinate price control  with the maintenance of a rapid economic growth rate.    From the beginning of reform and opening to the outside  world  in 1979 up to 1993, the average annual economic growth rate was  9.3 percent while the annual rate of inflation was 6.4 percent.  This situation was very satisfactory. However, in 1993 the  inflation rate almost equalled the economic growth rate and, in  1994, there has surfaced the danger that the inflation rate will  exceed the growth rate of the economy. So, the primary task of  macroeconomic regulation and control at present is to balance  rationally the maintenance of rapid economic growth and the  control of inflation so that the national economy can grow at a  considerably high speed and the inflation can be controlled at a  comparatively low level.    There have been obvious changes in the operating mechanism  and the level of economic development of our country and the  changes are still going on. In the course of the changes, the  occurrence of inflation to a certain degree is the price we must  pay for the realization of the reform and economic development.  However, the present inflation has exceeded the normal scope.  Its chief characteristics are: First, prices rise at the same  pace both in cities and rural areas; second, the increase in  service prices exceeds that in consumer prices; and third, the  hefty price increases of daily necessities have caused strong  dissatisfaction among residents. On the other hand, the problem  of delinquency among enterprises is getting more serious and the  stocks of certain goods keep increasing. The signs indicating  that the cycle of economic operation is not smooth have emerged.    These contradictory phenomena are worth our notice.    There are various causes of the abovementioned abnormal  phenomena. The direct causes which triggered excessive inflation  in the first quarter of 1994 are mainly as follows:    First, in 1993 prices rose because the investment and credit  scales exceeded those planned and the structural price  adjustments and price liberalization were carried out in a very  big way. The aftereffects will bring the commodity retail price  index up by 5 to 6 percentage points.    Second, the nationwide grain price fluctuation which spread  from south to north at the end of 1993 gave the impetus to hefty  price increases. At the same time, the decision to raise the  purchase prices of grain and cotton in 1994 also had a certain  effect.    Third, the personnel and salary reforms in the public  servants system had the social effect of causing price increases  to a certain degree.    Fourth, although the implementation of the new tax system  does not affect the total tax revenue very much, most of the 28  percent of the enterprises on which added tax are levied produce  goods in short supply. The prices of their goods will therefore  rise while the prices of goods produced by the 26 percent of the  enterprises that have their taxes deducted are not reduced.  Moreover, in the actual implementation of the new tax system,  there have been instances of distorting the tax system and  causing abnormal price increases.    Fifth, when the foreign exchange rates were unified at the  beginning of 1994, the single exchange rate was at first higher  than the weighted average exchange rate before the unification.  Consequently, the actual price rose on the foreign exchange  market.    Moreover, another factor which should receive attention is:  As the old system of planned economy is being transformed into  a new system of market economy, the traditional closed economy  is transformed into a modern, open economy; the management, with  administration playing a leading role, is transformed into one  wherein the legal system plays a leading role;  microinflexibility is transformed into microflexibility; and  families with low incomes are changing into well-to-do and rich  ones. Especially with the change from state price controls over  most commodities to the liberalization of price controls over  more than 95 percent of commodities, the interest principals in  China are becoming increasingly diversified. So, before the  establishment of a perfect market price management system,  prices have become the important means through which different  interest principals make profits. For a period of time,  unstandardized phenomena such as arbitrarily raising prices,  driving up prices, and willfully raising prices by monopolistic  businesses will inevitably become more serious because  management of the market cannot follow up immediately.    The present price increases are not simply double  inflation but are of a comprehensive type. To deal with this,  we should not only depend on the control of supply and demand,  especially control of excessive investment scale, but we should  also supervise and control the practice of driving up prices and  profiteering, establish a sound legal system, and order the  market economy. We should change the situation in which the  strength for price reform is strong, whereas the strength for  price management is weak, and raise the work level of the  government in controlling and keeping down prices.  <H5>  Analysis of the Trend of Economic Development in 1994 </H5>   The "Fall Report" of 1993 predicted that there would be  three  possible futures for the development of China's economy. First,  if the strength of the macroeconomic regulation and control is  handled properly then the momentum of the "overheated" economy  will be controlled, the inflation rate will begin to drop, and  the growth rate of the economy will also drop to about 10  percent. Second, if the strength of the macroeconomic  regulation and control is too strong or the retrenchment is  excessive, the economic growth will lose too much speed and the  economic "hard landing" will occur. Third, if the deep-rooted  contradictions which impede the healthy development of the  economy are not settled the macroeconomic regulation and control  will be loosened in haste, amid the complaints about "funds  shortages" by local authorities and enterprises. Consequently,  the economic growth rate will regain its speed too early so that  inflation will be rekindled.    The economic situation in recent months indicates that the  third result has occurred. So, stronger measures have to be  taken and the danger of their leading to the second result still  exists but it is possible for us to strive to achieve the first  result.    According to a positive analysis of the relationship between  the development of the national economy and the price increases,  generally, the abovementioned first and third results can be  described quantitatively as follows: If the economic growth  rate and the rate of price increases are basically kept at the  same level in 1994, the GDP growth rate is 9 percent and the  price increases are controlled beneath 10 percent, then the  first positive result will be achieved. In view of the present  actual situation, if the growth rate of the GDP is 11 to 12  percent and the retail price index rises by about 13 percent, it  will still be a considerably positive result. If the price  increase rate exceeds the economic growth rate by over 5  percent, as it did in 1988 when prices rose by 18.5 percent  while the growth of the GDP was 11.3 percent, then we can judge  that the economy has deviated from its normal development.    So, one of the emphases in the economic work of 1994 is to  achieve coordination and balance between economic growth and  price controls. We should understand that the price raise, to a  certain extent, is unavoidable in the course of the reform and  that it is the cost we should pay for the reform. However, we  should also note that price increases should be controlled  within the scope sustainable by the people and society to create  conditions to push the reform ahead and maintain a considerably  fast economic growth rate.    We can say that both opportunities and risks exist in 1994.  If we fail to control both the investment and credit scales,  even if the economic growth rate rises by one or two percentage  points, the loss will outweigh the gain if the prices rise by 20  percent for the whole year. Eventually, it will lead the  development of our national economy to a trough, seriously  affecting the course of establishing a socialist market economy.  If we do a good job in 1994, we can expect that economic  development will further approach the expected goal of  macroeconomic regulation and control. The growth rate of the  GDP will be around 10 percent while the growth rate of  investment will drop to around 20 percent and the price  increases will be controlled at around 10 percent. Our economic  development will further follow a steady upward course.</p>

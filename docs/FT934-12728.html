			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (26): When the patron backs out - Theatres are closing and orchestras slimming THE closure last month of two of Berlin's most famous theatres, the Schiller and the Schlosspark, provided a grim illustration of how public funding for the arts is under pressure as a result of the recession. The Bonn government and the federal Lander say they want to preserve a wide and varied range of cultural activities. But because of the strain on their finances, they are having difficulty living up to their ambitions. In contrast to Britain and the US, where the arts are financed by a mixture of subsidies and private sponsoring, German theatres are largely publicly supported. Ticket sales yield only about 15 per cent of their income, and the rest comes from the public purse, overall a total of some DM4bn for theatres, operas and orchestras. At federal government level, the Interior Ministry is responsible for cultural affairs. It promotes only cultural projects of national importance  -such as the annual Bayreuth festival. The Lander and local authorities account for the lion's share of public funding. The Interior Ministry's culture budget is to be slashed next year to barely half its current level - down from DM1.3bn to DM701m in 1994. If the Bundestag passes the draft budget - and it has been sharply criticised from both sides of the house - it will threaten a host of projects, above all in eastern Germany. Under the unification treaty, the eastern states were to receive cultural aid of DM650m a year from 1990-94, to tide them over their immediate financial problems. The Finance Ministry has axed that money from the 1994 budget in its latest round of drastic savings measures, and a decision is still pending on whether it should be reinstated. Also open is the question of which institutions will be faced by cuts in 1995. Among them could be the German Music Council, which supports young musicians and sponsors national concerts and concert tours. The Bach archives in Leipzig, the Society for the Promotion of the German Language, the Berlin festival, and the Ruhr festival could all be affected, along with film promotion activities, and the protection of monuments. One thing is certain: sweeping cuts are on the way. But one area may be spared. The Bayreuth festival, the Nuremberg national museum and Munich's German museum are all thought to be safe: they are all prestigious projects in Bavaria, the home state of Mr Theo Waigel, the Finance Minister in Bonn. At the state and local level, most cities' cultural facilities have accepted cuts. Art galleries have been unable to obtain new pictures, and have had to put on fewer exhibitions. Some municipal theatres have been forced to close for weeks at a time, and some orchestras, such as the Hesse state radio light orchestra and the Berlin symphony orchestra, have disbanded. The directors of the big opera houses have tried to form a joint plan to face the crisis. Mr Gotz Friedrich, director-general of the Berlin opera, said: 'Opera is no luxury. It is an integral part of the cultural landscape.' The end result of the directors' meeting, however, was very modest - an agreement between the individual opera houses setting common salaries for singers, thereby ending *something in here (HP) * competition between them. The federation of German theatres has argued that no other country has such a variety of theatres and operas as Germany. They insist that they should go on being publicly financed, because of the vital contribution they make to the 'social and cultural fabric' of their towns and cities. But in one way they do want to change their public status: as far as their employees are concerned. There are seven different agreements on wages and working conditions in German theatres, with five different trade unions. Because they are in the public sector, many employees enjoy the statutory privileges of public servants. The theatre federation wants its members to become independent enterprises, and then to have a single wage deal for all employees. The one other way in which they hope to save money is in agreeing to more co-productions, or exchange of productions between several theatres. So how will a big opera house react to the financial squeeze? At the Frankfurt opera, the city's plans will reduce overall cultural spending by DM50m next year. Job cuts are inevitable. Personnel and administration costs account for almost 85 per cent of DM65m total spending. The remaining 15 per cent are earmarked for artistic purposes, such as guest stars. Mr Martin Steinhoff, the managing director, says that as many as 350 of the 1,000 employees may have to be dismissed. This means that of 135 musicians today, barely 80 will be kept on. It means that presenting a Wagner opera in future would be out of the question, because the opera choir would be too small. Repertory theatre would become impossible, because there would not be enough stage hands to raise and dismantle the sets every evening. The upshot is that only much more limited productions of short duration and narrow scope remain feasible, and then only with guest performers, and not with a resident ensemble. The wholesale privatisation of cultural facilities is not seriously under discussion. As revenues from ticket sales account for such a minor share of theatre and museum budgets, the gap is considered too wide to fill. In Berlin, the city's cultural department quite simply ordered the Schiller and Schlosspark theatres to survive without subsidies. They had long been criticised for poor management and boring performances. With a budget of DM41m, they were the highest-subsidised theatres in the country - a daily subsidy per seat of DM100] The decision to close them was greeted in the theatre world as 'an artistic assassination attempt'. There were appeals to President Richard von Weizsacker, the former mayor of Berlin, to save them. To no avail. The question is, where will the axe fall next?</p>

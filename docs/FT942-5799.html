			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (1): Chastened traders yearn for trend - Peter Norman assesses the outlook as the markets try to cope with frustrated expectations The time for easy pickings is over. After several years of rapidly growing turnover and strong profit growth, the global foreign exchange business is suffering. The markets this year have had to adapt to adverse conditions and cope with frustrated expectations. The dollar has been weak, instead of rising as widely predicted. This year's bloodbath in the world's bond markets has inflicted heavy losses on some of the more aggressive currency traders leading to a shrinkage of liquidity and an injection of caution into their activities. 'The mood among the big foreign exchange and bond players is grim,' says Jim O'Neill, head of global research at Swiss Bank Corp in London. According to one senior analyst, trading conditions 'are the worst they have been for six years and some people have made big losses'. The current gloom contrasts with the boom years of the early 1990s when global turnover soared to Dollars 1,000bn a-day and currency traders and investors were presented with a number of relatively safe bets. With the industrial countries in recession, it was easy to work on the assumption that interest rates were heading downwards and make money accordingly. The market could also exploit policy errors, such as the determination of the UK and Italian governments to defend sterling and the lira in the European exchange rate mechanism until their forced exits in September 1992. The decision last August of the European Union's finance ministers to widen the ERM fluctuation margins to 15 per cent either side of the system's bilateral central rates from 2.25 per cent and 6 per cent previously, removed one of the biggest one-way bets from the market at a stroke. The French franc and British pound have been effectively sidelined in currency trading this year. Most action has been in the 'triad' currencies - the dollar, the yen and the D-Mark. And it is in those currencies that some of the smartest operators have come unstuck. At New Year, the forecasters' consensus was that the dollar would fluctuate between Y112 and Y114 and DM1.75 and DM1.78 between Easter and the end of the year. Early last month, it was heading towards record low levels against the yen and threatened to breach the psychologically important Y100 barrier. The dollar remains groggy despite subsequent central bank intervention, rising US interest rates and falling rates in Germany. The dollar's weakness has been a reminder of how fickle markets can be. In January, the dollar looked sure to rise because the US economy was generally expected to grow faster than its main trading rivals, forcing interest rate differentials to move in the dollar's favour as the US tightened monetary conditions and Germany, and possibly Japan, eased. Instead a US-Japanese confrontation on trade and the spill-over effects of higher US interest rates on highly leveraged bond markets achieved the reverse effect. The Clinton administration's aggressive tactics and 'shoot-from-the-lip' diplomacy to force Japan to cut its bilateral trade surplus with the US were construed - rightly or wrongly - as signs that the US wanted a higher yen to achieve its trade goals. Open disagreement between President Bill Clinton and the former Japanese prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, at a meeting on February 11 caught speculative traders, including some lightly regulated offshore hedge funds and the proprietary trading desks of some large investment banks, off guard. As the US currency slumped in response to the trade news, they were forced into a costly liquidation of positions built on borrowed funds in anticipation of a rising dollar. The decision of the Federal Reserve Board earlier in February to start raising US interest rates was intended as a pre-emptive, confidence-building strike against inflation. Instead, it caught the global bond markets unprepared. The subsequent scramble out of bonds caused heavy losses among highly leveraged operators including hedge funds, destroying part of their capital and curtailing their ability and willingness to indulge in further speculation in the foreign exchange and other financial markets. There had already been some victims from the ERM upheavals of 1992 and 1993, including Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, which made the costly mistake of backing sterling in 1992. This year's speculative turmoil has claimed new scalps. George Soros, the financier who reported making Dollars 1bn during the 1992 sterling crisis, admitted losing Dollars 600m when a bet against the yen went sour. One senior analyst estimates that this year's trading losses have shrunk the hedge funds' capital from around Dollars 30bn to Dollars 15bn. On the assumption that such funds leverage their capital tenfold, their losses have taken about Dollars 150bn in liquidity from the market. Possibly reflecting the hedge funds' problems, recent attacks on the Greek drachma and Portuguese escudo have appeared half-hearted compared with the assaults on EU currencies in previous years. This year's trading upsets have encouraged some other changes in behaviour. Symptoms of a 'back-to-basics' trend are a determination among some banks to pay more attention to customer business and a revived interest in 'fundamentals' in the analysis of currency movements. More attention is being given to the global flow of funds. Some fundamentalists ascribe the dollar's weakness to a continuing diversification by US financial institutions, such as pension funds, of their investments outside the US while Japanese investors are pulling back from involvement abroad. Others, such as Neil MacKinnon, Citibank's chief currency strategist, say the market paid insufficient attention to 'volume analysis' showing that market participants were very heavily invested in the dollar last summer. That has meant little natural demand for the US currency even when it has appeared a bargain. Another group, including Mr O'Neill, a long-time dollar bear, argues that the dollar is bound to be soft given the chronic US current account deficit that has totalled Dollars 1,025bn since 1984. The International Monetary Fund has forecast a continuing deterioration in the US current account to Dollars 166bn in 1995 from Dollars 109bn last year. If nothing else, constrained liquidity and increased uncertainty have enhanced the power of one group of players: the central banks. Intervention by up to 17 central banks headed by the US Federal Reserve successfully halted a threatened fall by the dollar through the Y100 level last month. But although this was the first instance of large-scale concerted intervention since October 1992, it does not presage a new drive by the leading industrial nations to enforce currency stability. The collapse of communism and the installation of an 'America-first' administration have weakened the ties among the Group of Seven nations. Concerted intervention, if and when it takes place, will reflect an opportunist consensus or temporary identity of interests among the big industrial powers and is therefore likely to be a relatively rare event. These various forces have left the market 'yearning for a trend to emerge', says Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Union Bank of Switzerland. After investing heavily in their foreign exchange operations in recent years, few operators are happy with the present regime of relatively small plays and correspondingly small gains. A clear trend could appear if the current uncertainty over the dollar crystallised into either a break with, or confirmation of, what remains of the bullish consensus for the US currency. That would mean renewed volatility in trading, offering a chance for this year's losers to rebuild their profits.</p>

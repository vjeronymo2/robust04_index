			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> THAT'S ALL FOR THE RALEIGH TIMES  </P> <P> The Raleigh Times published its last edition today, bidding farewell with the  headline, "That's All, Folks."  </P> <P> The afternoon paper, which traces itself through various names back to 1879,  folded so that The News and Observer, the morning paper owned by its parent  company, could be expanded, The News and Observer Publishing Co. said.  </P> <P> As a result of the closing, The News and Observer will have later deadlines,  allowing publication of more up-to-date news and sports stories, the publishing  company said.  </P> <P> Raleigh is the fourth major North Carolina city to lose an afternoon daily.  Afternoon dailies, all sister papers of morning publications, have closed in  Charlotte, Greensboro and Winston-Salem in the 1980s.  </P></p>

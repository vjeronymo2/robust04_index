A team representing 15  civilian opposition parties yesterday complained to President  Joaquim Chissano that they have been largely left out of the  process that will lead to general elections in the country in  October of this year. In a memorandum delivered personally to  the Mozambican head of state, the team accused the government of  monopolizing the state budget. That document also said that the  unarmed opposition faces such financial difficulties that it has  not even been able to select its representatives in the  electoral, provincial, and district commissions. That document  also accuses the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] of  continuing to divide the country into two separate territories.  This afternoon, we interviewed Inacio Chire of the National  Convention Party, PCN. We began by asking him what difficulties  the Mozambican civilian opposition is faced with at this stage.    [Begin recording] [Chire] In practice, everything remained  as  it was during the days of the one-party system. There have been  no major changes in terms of posture, leadership, or governance  by the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] government. Thus,  it continues to be very difficult to be in the opposition in  this country. This has been a very difficult task for  Mozambicans willing to bring about changes in the country.    [Unidentified correspondent] What difficulties in  particular?    [Chire] For instance, only five parties have installations  in  Maputo. No party has installations in the provinces.    [Correspondent] Which parties are you referring to?    [Chire] The PCN, the Mozambican Nationalist  Movement-Mozambique Social Democratic Party, the Mozambique  United Front-Democratic Convergence Party, the Mozambique  Peopre's Progress Party, and the Mozambican National Union.  Although registered, the other parties have no installations.  The parties I have just listed have no installations in almost  every province of the country. So, you can imagine the  situation, particularly at a time when elections are due to be  held in seven months' time.    There is also the question of funds. No party is entitled to  draw funds from the State General Budget. The international  community has made promises to give us funds, but there is  nothing concrete. Only the Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] has been receiving funds from the international  community. Of course, the government has been using the State  General Budget.    Other difficulties have to do with the structures of a  democratic state. There are no division of powers. There is no  clear-cut separation between the state and the ruling party.  So, you can imagine what the consequences are. We have always  stood for the separation between the pacification process --  which includes the demobilization, confinement of troops, and  selection of troops from the two sides for the new armed forces  -- and the training of a so- called nonpartisan army. There can  be no nonpartisan or even a national army when its forces are  drawn from two parties. It is an army that can be easily  dismembered at any time. That is what the experiences in other  countries tell us. So, we believe that that process should only  be dealt with by Frelimo, Renamo, and the United Nations because  they are more directly involved in the process. There is,  however, the process of democratization and of transition to  democracy. We believe civil society as a whole should be  involved in that process, not only political parties, but also  every grouping. Unfortunately, in Mozambique the Frelimo  government still wants to conduct the process on its own. [end  recording]</p>

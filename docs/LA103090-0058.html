			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO-INDEPENDENCE BLOC WINS IN GEORGIA REPUBLIC  </P> <P> An anti-Communist opposition bloc advocating independence for the southern  Soviet republic of Georgia captured a large majority of seats in a  parliamentary election, preliminary results showed Monday.  </P> <P> Zviad Gamsakhurdia, a longtime dissident who leads the coalition Round  Table-Free Georgia, said his bloc won 70% of the 250 seats at stake in the  free, multi-party elections on Sunday.  </P> <P> The official Soviet news agency Tass reported that the Round Table won 34 out  of 125 districts and the Communist Party won 22. One deputy from the Georgian  Popular Front won a seat, and runoff elections must be held for the other  seats.  </P> <P> An additional 125 seats will be filled by the parties based on the percentages  they win in the election.  </P> <P> "We expected the victory," Gamsakhurdia said in a telephone interview. "The  Communist Party is not popular among Georgians. It is a criminal party -- a  party of the mafia, not a nationalist party. The Georgian people support only  the Round Table; no other parties are popular."  </P> <P> The chairman of the Election Commission, Irakli Zhordania, said he could not  yet give exact results. "But I can say that the Round Table won a big  advantage," he said by telephone. "The Communists were big losers compared to  the Round Table."  </P> <P> Another member of the Election Commission, Argil Chirakadze, said the Round  Table won at least twice as many races as the Communist Party, the  second-largest vote winner.  </P> <P> According to Gamsakhurdia's figures, his bloc of seven pro-independence parties  won at least 70% of the 250 seats on the republic's Supreme Soviet or  legislature, the Communist Party won 20% of the seats and other parties shared  the rest.  </P> <P> But two rival nationalist parties boycotted the election, refusing to  participate in any form of Soviet rule.  </P> <P> Many high-ranking Communists, including Georgian Prime Minister Nodar A.  Chitanava, were defeated, according to Gamsakhurdia. Election commission  officials refused to confirm this, pending final results.  </P> <P> Although nationalist movements have won majorities in elections in other Soviet  republics, the Georgian election was the first time that rival groups have been  registered under a new Soviet law as formal political parties.  </P> <P> About 35 parties, most of them grouped in blocs, participated in the election.  Voter turnout was 70%, according to the Election Commission. Official results  are not expected until the end of the week. Runoffs for races where no  candidate won 50% of the vote are scheduled for Nov. 11.  </P> <P> Gamsakhurdia, a strident anti-Communist imprisoned under the late Soviet  President Leonid I. Brezhnev, is a likely candidate as Georgia's next leader.  </P> <P> "I feel very good," Gamsakhurdia said. "A few years ago, I could have never  imagined this could happen."  </P> <P> Round Table was created in April as Gamsakhurdia's 14-year-old group, the  Helsinki Union, joined with younger organizations.  </P> <P> As soon as the Round Table gains control of the republic's government, it  intends to lead Georgia into a transition phase from its current status as one  of the Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics to complete political  independence, Gamsakhurdia said. Establishing economic independence from the  Soviet Union will be a priority, he said.  </P> <P> Except for a brief year of independence in the 1920s, Georgia has been part of  the Soviet Union and the Russian empire for nearly two centuries. A  battleground as well as crossroads, the small, mountainous republic has been  fought over by Turks, Mongols, Persians, Arabs and Russians since the 6th  Century.  </P> <P> The Round Table has not yet outlined a timetable for independence. "This will  depend on Moscow," Gamsakhurdia said, indicating his reluctance to confront the  Kremlin immediately.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has urged the republics to remain within the  Soviet Union but with greater rights to manage their own affairs.  </P></p>

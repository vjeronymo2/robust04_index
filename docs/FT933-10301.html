			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Voting reforms approved in Italy THE PROSPECT of an early general election in Italy has drawn closer following approval by the lower house of parliament, the Chamber of Deputies, of crucial electoral reforms. Yesterday's decision, which came after Senate approval late on Tuesday night, means the election will largely be fought on a majority voting system, with a small element of proportional representation. The decisions were the final stage of a process begun after a referendum in April gave overwhelmingly support for a change in voting for the Senate. Though not required by law, this provided the impetus for similar changes in respect of the lower house. This week's final approvals, which required both chambers to pass each other's reforms, remove one of the biggest obstacles to a new election. Voting, originally expected later this year, will probably take place early in 1994, as parliament now has four months to draw up and approve new constituency boundaries and pass the 1994 budget. Under the new voting arrangements, three-quarters of the seats in the upper and lower houses will be allocated via a UK-style 'first past the post' system. The rest will be filled by proportional representation. Polling will take place on a single day. The current electoral system, based purely on proportional representation, has been blamed for the fragmentation of Italian politics and the proliferation of parties. Electors in future will complete two voting forms for the lower house: one for the 'first past the post' constituency-based system, the other to express a party preference for the remaining seats. Parties will be excluded if they win less than 4 per cent of the votes nationally under the proportional system, which divides the country into 27 electoral regions. Support for the reforms has not been unanimous. Several parties favoured either an exclusively majority voting system, or two-rounds voting as in France. Attention in parliament, in recess from the end of this week, will now switch to redrawing constituencies.</p>

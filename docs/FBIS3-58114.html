			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jerome Thorel: "To Forget Mururoa, Is It </F> Possible To Simulate a Nuclear Explosion?"]    [Text] The fate of nuclear testing is currently being  discussed around microscopic silica and polymer capsules.  Attempts are being made to reproduce the phenomenon of  controlled fusion in pellets filled with a gas similar to  hydrogen. The current moratorium on nuclear testing -- with the  possibility of a total ban treaty -- has led the major powers to  begin vast simulation research programs. The final goal is to be  able to begin a real process of "virtual dissuasion" and to  design thermonuclear weapons without the need for a full scale  testing stage.    For the experts in the Atomic Energy Commission's (CEA)  Military Applications Department (DAM), a nuclear test is  already a simulation -- a real simulation. In an interview with  SCIENCES ET AVENIR, DAM Chief Roger Baleras insisted that  "performing a test is not the same as designing a weapon. Of  course, the testing is done to `qualify' a weapon, but it is  also a way for us to check our propositions in physics." A test  serves to validate the theoretical laws of basic physics.  Encyclopedic manuals tell us that there are mathematical models  that can simulate every basic aspect of an explosion (equations  of state, hydrodynamics, neutron transport, and radiation  transfer).    Running on supercomputers, these models become numerical  codes that make it possible to follow the thermodynamics of the  system (pressure, density, temperatures, etc.), finally giving  the energy balances and the effects of nuclear reactions. To  ensure that the physical laws are correct, the codes must be  supplied and validated using experimental data -- obtained from  nuclear testing. The current challenge is to validate these  numerical codes with supercomputers rather than nuclear tests.  There are two main categories of test: Safety and reliability  tests related directly to designing new weapons and maintaining  the existing stockpile; and tests to calculate the destructive  effects of the atomic charges.    Of the four "recognized" atomic powers, only the United  States and France have an advanced simulation program. In  France, the simulation program started in 1991 by the DAM was  christened PALEN (Preparation for the Limitation of Nuclear  Testing). The brain center for the operation was the  Limeil-Valenton research facility, to the east of Paris. In the  United States, where simulation work has been underway for a  much longer time, the current AGEX (Above Ground Experiments)  program draws its impetus from the fact that the three national  nuclear research centers are competing with each other (Lawrence  Livermore in California, and Los Alamos and Sandia in New  Mexico). These programs are highly confidential. However, in  this sea of "classified" data, the calmer waters of civil  research into "controlled fusion" gives a slightly clearer view.    For the military physicists, the basic problem --  reproducing  in the laboratory the temperature, density, and radiation  conditions in the confined area inside a nuclear weapon -- ties  in with the civil race to "harvest" the energy produced by the  fusion of hydrogen or its isotopes. In both cases an energy  gain is sought: The energy released must be greater than the  energy consumed by the reaction. In the civil domain, this gain  is converted into electricity, while in the military domain it  is converted into physical data. Simulation is only worthwhile  if the phenomenon can be measured (if there is an "outgoing  radiation"), or in other words, if the energy released is  greater than the original energy.    This is the problem for fusion reactions. The principle  comes down to switching from an environment of light atoms to  heavier elements. This creates a mass defect which is at the  source of energy. The most efficient type of reaction consists  of fusing the nuclei of deuterium and tritium (hydrogen  isotopes). The neutron and nucleus of helium (an alpha  particle) carry kinetic energy equivalent to 350 MJ (megajoules)  per gram of deuterium-tritium mixture, i.e., as much energy as  would be generated from the combustion of 10,000 liters of crude  oil. In a thermonuclear bomb, this same gramme of  deuterium-tritium releases energy equivalent to 20 tonnes of  TNT. Nuclear physics has its limitations, however. Notably,  this type of fusion requires temperatures in the region of 50  million degrees Celsius. In these conditions, the matter is in  a plasmic state, meaning that the ions and electrons are  dissociated. The reason for such high temperatures is that  positive ions increasingly repel each other the closer they are  together. To fuse them they have to impact at high speed, and  it is this collision which generates the very high temperatures.    How is this plasmic state of matter obtained? In a  thermonuclear bomb, the fusion of deuterium and tritium is  obtained by a fission reaction, with a mini A-bomb sparking the  combustion. To simulate this type of explosion in the  laboratory, another source of heat was required: particle beams  or lasers (photon beams). In any event, what is needed is a  fairly intense impulse to heat the matter to its ignition  temperature. While laser is the most advanced method, we still  need energy sources a hundred times more powerful than we have  today to produce a sufficient gain.    A French expert states: "Using very powerful lasers, we can  reproduce in the laboratory the conditions (temperature,  density, etc.) similar to those that exist inside nuclear  weapons. We are simply trying to validate the numerical codes  that in the past we checked by carrying out real tests." The  Phebus laser used by the DAM at Limeil can generate several  kilojoules (kJ) of energy. When applied to matter, this gives  "hot plasmas" of several dozen million degrees, which is enough  to recreate the heat conditions inside a thermonuclear weapon.    It then remains for us to recreate the same conditions of  density. To do this, laser science is opening the way up to  "inertial confinement" fusion (ICF), competing on the civil  level with magnetic confinement: The Joint European Torus (JET)  experiments in this area have already been described at length.  In either case, the plasma has to be kept confined long enough  for a sufficient number of fusion reactions to occur.    The exact use of inertial fusion for simulations remains  "defense classified." Nevertheless, ICF -- initially designed  with military aims in mind -- gives researchers an effective way  of bringing matter in the laboratory to densities comparable  with those inside a weapon. The DAM claims that there is  another way to do this.    The many parameters needed for good implosion are ensured by  the type of laser impulse used. Lasting just one nanosecond,  this impulse is tunable to the point where cold compression of  the target occurs (this is better for gaseous bodies) while  creating hot spots (the condition required for ignition). The  quality of the implosion depends greatly on the beam wavelength.  In the context of civil thermonuclear fusion research for  energy production, the work with hot plasma done by the French  National Scientific Research Center's (CNRS) Laboratory for the  Use of Intense Lasers (LULI), based in the Polytechnic school at  Palaiseau, has shown that short wavelengths (0.26 micron and  0.35 micron) are more efficient for converting laser beam energy  into plasma heat energy.    French and American experts stress, however, that this light  impulse is not sufficiently uniform to attack or light the  target: compression must be symmetrical at every point of the  silica shell. Civil and military experts know that X-rays can  give a finer degree of uniformity, and this led to the so-called  "indirect attack" principle. The light energy is first  converted into X-ray radiation and it is this that then attacks  the target. In addition, X-rays have shorter wavelengths than  lasers (10,000 times shorter). Since they carry more energy  than the visible rays, X-rays can better penetrate the solid.  We should note that this is one of the most "classified"  aspects of the simulation debate, with indirect attack touching  on the same aspects of radiation transfer as inside a weapon.  In PHYSICS TODAY, John Lindl's team summarized the state of  official data: "A laser beam or a particle beam is first  absorbed in a cavity (a complex target, termed an `empty space')  which embodies the capsule. This cavity then emits X-rays which  attack the capsule until it implodes (...) The ablations of a  target attacked by X-rays are hydrodynamically more stable." No  further details are given, of course, on the conversion method  or the materials used.    Nevertheless, at the current time, no laser exists that is  powerful enough to exceed the famous break-even [preceding word  in English] point, i.e., capable of releasing more energy than  it uses. The world's experts agree that what is needed is an  ICF reactor capable of supplying megajoules of energy. This  estimation results from the Halite/Centurion experiment carried  out in the United States in the mid-1980's, in which the X-rays  produced during a nuclear test were claimed to prove the  feasibility of ICF by indirect attack. We are still a long way  off, however: Currently, the largest laser in the world, the  Nova at the Lawrence Livermore site, is capable of producing  "only" 40 kJ. At the same frequency (0.35 micron) and for the  same impulse time (1 nanosecond) the Phebus laser (American in  origin) can supply 8 kJ. To arrive at the MJ or "Upgrade"  [preceding word in English] laser, we need to increase power by  a factor of 100. France and the United States are working  together in this area to reduce costs by designing other  amplification methods.    Even if laser technology has an uncertain future -- the  Americans claim that heavy ion particle beams (xenon, cesium,  and bismuth) are better suited for the development of an ICF  reactor -- it still remains the most advanced technology. Thus  the first stage in the AGEX program will begin with the National  Ignition Facility (the $400-million successor to the Nova  laser). This new 1-to-2-MJ laser is expected to be able to  produce an energy gain of 20-30 MJ...but not before the year  2002. A recent study showed that this installation will already  be able to simulate many of the tests examining the effects of  nuclear weapons.    The French PALEN project appears less certain. Military  experts state: "There will be no simulation tools if we are not  allowed to validate them. In other words, we need to perform  another series of experiments if we are to eliminate the need  for them." The Americans would appear to be some way ahead in  this area. According to a report issued by the Defense  Committee of the National Assembly in November, 40 tests have  already been performed in the United States to validate  simulation instruments, as opposed to just one in France. The  same report underlines that at least 10 tests are needed before  1997 if PALEN is to be developed, but the DAM has refused to  comment on these figures. This program -- which will have a  budget of 600 million French francs next year -- is only a  preparation for the limitation of testing. A ministerial source  states that the development of new types of weapons, such as  those with variable power or triggered electromagnetically, will  always require real tests, thus rejecting the political  possibility of a "Comprehensive Test Ban" (CTB) on nuclear  testing. No doubt political decisions will continue to affect  what is a truly scientific challenge, with those small silica  capsules acting as the scapegoat.</p>

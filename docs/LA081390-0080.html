			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> BALBOA ISLAND PARK PLAN TO BE STUDIED  </P> <P> City Council members today will consider a proposal to turn the site of a  former gas station at Marine and Park avenues into a mini-park for residents of  Balboa Island, Little Island and Collins Island.  </P> <P> The Unocal station has already been demolished, and the city has budgeted money  to buy the site and build a fire station on the major portion of the land,  which sits at the southeastern corner of the intersection.  </P> <P> The fire station plans have been put on hold, however, because area homeowner  associations have expressed interest in building and maintaining a small park  at the location. Their urgings prompted City Manager Robert L. Wynn to devise a  proposal calling for the city to finance the demolition and then build a  mini-park.  </P> <P> Council members will not take any action on the issue.  </P></p>

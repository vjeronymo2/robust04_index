			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Interviewed by a UNIAN  correspondent, Shimon Peres, head of the Israeli external  political department, noted that in spite of this being his  "first time in Odessa," he "understood why this beautiful city  is the soul of all the world's Jews."    Asked whether he could draw a parallel between the issue of  Crimean autonomy in Ukraine and that of Palestine in Israel, the  minister answered in the affirmative: "Undoubtedly so. In both  cases, efforts to improve relations are more expedient than  amending borders. Under conditions of tension, there is no  point in talking about borders. An atmosphere of mutual respect  should be created. This would guarantee success in our  negotiations in the United States. Progress begins when the  sides realize that force gives in to intelligence."</p>

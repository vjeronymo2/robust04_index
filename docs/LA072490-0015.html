			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: THE QUESTION: TO TOSS OR NOT TO TOSS JUNK MAIL?  </P> <P> The trouble with junk mail is that you can't afford to throw it out without  slitting the envelope and taking a look inside. It might contain money.  </P> <P> I don't mean those envelopes that say "You have already won a million dollars!  or a trip to Bermuda." Somebody might win a million dollars but I know it won't  be me. The odds make it hardly worth opening the envelope.  </P> <P> However, I have been twice burned. Many years ago, when I was struggling to  make ends meet, Reader's Digest excerpted five words of mine for its "rich,  beautiful prose" department or whatever it was called. They did not ask my  permission; they did not advise me. They simply sent me a $100 check, which I  promptly threw into the wastebasket. Somehow I had second thoughts. It occurred  to me that my name and address were typewritten, not stamped. I retrieved the  letter.  </P> <P> What a windfall that was!  </P> <P> Many years later, in fact not long ago, I evidently dropped a corporation  mailing into the wastebasket, only to learn later that it had contained 80  shares of stock. I went to a great deal of trouble to have the stock replaced.  </P> <P> Even so, I find it hard to open all my junk mail. It is too tedious. I take  chances. All envelopes that say I have won something I automatically throw  away. I am a little more careful with the others.  </P> <P> For instance, I opened a mailing the other day from an Eric Utne. I had never  heard of Eric Utne and felt pretty sure that I didn't want to.  </P> <P> The contents contained a pitch for a new magazine that, I had to admit, was  more beguiling than most. I do not need a new magazine. I do not want a new  magazine. I give magazines away by the cartonful. Hundreds of them. Magazines  are stacked high on all our tables. We have at least two dozen unread  Smithsonians. Good stuff, I know, but reading Smithsonians takes time that  could otherwise be devoted to sex and violence on TV.  </P> <P> It turned out that Eric Utne publishes something called Utne Reader, which is  not a very attractive title. But its production method is appealing.  </P> <P> Utne says the magazine has a staff of four, plus "Nina, my bemused wife; a  Buddhist physics professor, a socially responsible philanthropist; a Jungian  dreams analyst; a candidate for the U.S. Senate; an anarcho-punk theorist; an  organic herb farmer; plus a dozen media junkies who lend a hand."  </P> <P> "For two months," Utne says, "we all read and clip whatever we find of interest  in more than 1,000 alternative publications. Political exposes. How-to  lifestyle pieces. Money advisories. Interviews with unusual people. Stories  about the environment, survival, shenanigans in high places. Any and everything  that you're not likely to find in mainstream newspapers and magazines."  (Actually, I think you can find all of that stuff in The Times, in abundance,  except maybe input from an anarcho-punk theorist, whatever that is.)  </P> <P> Then, near deadline time, "we all get together in an all-night gathering that's  come to be known as the Alternative Press Reading &amp; Dining Salon. We  discuss what we've read. We talk. We argue. We nibble on pizza and popcorn. And  by dawn's early light, we've got it -- what we feel is one of the most  exciting, yet useful, magazines you can read today. . . ."  </P> <P> An explanatory sheet begins with the kind of facts you can expect to find in  Utne Reader. "If you believe that exercise will help you live longer . . . that  small companies are better to work for than big ones . . . and that you can't  possibly make money while maintaining your principles . . . there's something  you should know. It won't. They aren't. You can. . . ."  </P> <P> Gee, I read just the other day that every step you climb adds four seconds to  your life. And what about "a penny saved is a penny earned," and "honesty is  the best policy?"  </P> <P> It adds: "If revelations like these contradict axioms you learned at your  mother's knee, there are more surprises to come. Just open Utne Reader to any  page. Overturned truisms. Shattered shibboleths. Debunked bromides. Truth!"  </P> <P> As I say, I'm intrigued by the Utne Reader's editorial methods, but I'm not  sure I want to base my perceptions of our society on a journal put out by the  likes of a Buddhist physics professor, a bemused wife, a Jungian dreams  analyst, an organic herb farmer and an anarcho-punk theorist sitting around all  night digesting pizza and clippings from 1,000 alternative press journals.  </P> <P> However, if it's shattered shibboleths you crave, the address is Utne Reader,  P.O. Box 1974, Marion, Ohio 43306.  </P> <P> Unfortunately I've lost my post card for a free copy.  </P></p>

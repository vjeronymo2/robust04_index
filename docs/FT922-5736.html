			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Perot seeks clutch of expert advisers POLITICAL experts known for their work in the Carter and Reagan presidential campaigns have been asked to help plan Mr Ross Perot's drive for the US presidency. . Among them are Mr Hamilton Jordan, Mr Carter's campaign manager in 1976 and subsequently White House chief of staff; Mr Ed Rollins, instrumental in Mr Ronald Reagan's victory in 1984; and Mr John Sears, who ran Mr Reagan's narrowly unsuccesful bid for the Republican nomination in 1976 and was his campaign manager again before being replaced early in 1980. Mr James Squires, Mr Perot's spokesman, confirmed that approaches had been made but denied that Mr Jordan and Mr Rollins were being offered joint leadership of the Perot effort. However he said both 'could fit nicely into this campaign in a number of ways.' Mr Rollins, now a political consultant whose wife works in the Bush White House, said yesterday he thought Mr Perot had a good chance of being elected president, whereas two months earlier he had dismissed such a prospect. Mr Jordan has been quoted as being an admirer of Mr Perot, though his former boss, Mr Carter, has come out strongly for Governor Bill Clinton. Mr Jordan, after a spell running the Association of Tennis Professionals, is now president of Whittle Communications. There may be some irony in Mr Perot, the ultimate outsider, considering recruiting quintessential Washington insiders, but this was probably bound to happen as the campaign gathered momentum.</p>

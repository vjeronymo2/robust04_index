			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / German trade surplus soars to DM4.9bn INDUSTRY'S efforts to soften the impact of looming strikes helped boost German exports to new records during March. Overseas sales of goods surged unexpectedly to DM63bn (Pounds 21.4bn) from DM55bn in February, and the federal trade surplus more than doubled to DM4.9bn, the statistical office said yesterday. Imports rose 10 per cent to DM58bn. 'We saw the same in 1984 before the last big metal workers' strike,' Commerzbank said. Then, manufacturers shipped finished products into overseas distribution networks and built up stocks of imported components as they braced themselves for what developed into a two-month stoppage. Meanwhile, the leadership of the IG Metall engineering union pressed on with plans for official strike action as 42,000 members staged warning stoppages, mainly around Nuremberg. Mechanical and electrical engineering companies such as AEG, Bosch, Siemens and MAN bore the brunt. Employers made no advance on their 3.3 per cent pay offer at talks with union officials in the Hesse region yesterday. A meeting of union leaders in Frankfurt this morning is expected to choose targets for the main official action. Last time, when the issue was shorter working hours, strikes in the south halted virtually all motor manufacture. Most car and truck makers, Germany's leading exporters, have since switched to just-in-time manufacturing processes. They routinely hold low stocks of components and rely on round-the-clock deliveries from suppliers to keep production lines running. Because a breakdown of yesterday's trade figures will not be available for at least a week, most economists and bankers were cautious about the significance of one month's results. Commerzbank, for example, saw no justification yet for revising its in-house forecast that the national trade surplus would climb to DM15bn in the last quarter. March's DM4.9bn surplus, a huge advance on the DM2.8bn recorded a year earlier, was more than double most forecasts and the second highest figure for unified Germany. The east, struggling to recover from restructuring, accounts for less than 3 per cent of all-German exports. The deficit on the current account, a wider trade measure including services and some foreign transfers, shrank sharply to DM300m, compared with DM1.9bn in February and DM6.4bn in March last year.</p>

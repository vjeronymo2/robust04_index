			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Baghdad, 25 May (INA) -- [passage omitted]  Commenting on the recognition of the government of the  secessionists in Yemen by the secessionist Somalis, who call  their illegitimate regime "Somaliland," the political editor of  the Iraqi News Agency has stated the following: The  secessionist Somalis have found in the secessionists in Yemen a  tool through which they can support each other in order to  strengthen secessionist trends, backed by colonialism and its  agents.    He added: It is known that Somalia was enabled to join the  Arab League under special circumstances in order to strengthen  the positive factors in Somalia's ties with the Arab nation and  to play a constructive role in its cultural progress and unity,  rather than a separatist and opportunist role.    He also said: This announcement by the secessionist Somalis  who are rejected by the Somali people is aimed at harming the  Arab nation as a whole and its pan-Arab concepts and trend, as  well as Yemen and Yemen's unity. This should make the  secessionist Somalis know that the benefits they may take from  such a opportunist position are much less than what they can win  from sound relations with the Arab nation and its goals.</p>

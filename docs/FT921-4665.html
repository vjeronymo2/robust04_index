			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / MPs urge fresh review of Army cuts ARMY CHIEFS are hopeful that the next government will reconsider the scale of planned troop cuts after a critical report by MPs yesterday called for 'a fresh assessment' of manpower requirements. Ministers have repeatedly warned that only a significant worsening of the international situation would justify a change in plans announced last year. The Commons defence committee said it feared the Army reductions - from 156,000 to 116,000 - had been 'taken too far' and might leave insufficient leeway for the Army to deal with an unexpected crisis. Even peacetime tasks might cause 'unacceptable strain'. A particular source of concern was how units assigned to Nato's new Rapid Reaction Corps would cope while being liable for six-month emergency tours in Northern Ireland. The committee, chaired by the Conservative MP Mr Michael Mates, said it did not propose 'another major upheaval' on the lines of the Options for Change review. The report called into question the way regiments had been selected for merger or disbandment, and upbraided ministers for refusing to account in detail for the rationale behind the decisions. Senior Army officers believe it may be possible after the general election to revise the target figure of 116,000 by several thousand.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): The peak of Groen's career? A holiday in the Himalayas would seem to be the perfect spot for pondering the future of one's career if one lives in the unending flatness of the Netherlands, writes Ronald van de Krol. Or so it was for Harry Groen, the driving force behind the international expansion of Dutch credit insurer NCM, who returned from Nepal last week and announced he would be resigning in May after more than 30 years at the company. His surprise resignation is the second big upheaval within the three-man NCM board this year. In August, the deputy chairman Dick Bruinsma quit abruptly in circumstances which have never been fully explained. Bruinsma has not yet been replaced. Groen denies that his own departure is the result of tension with the company's board of supervisors following Bruinsma's resignation. 'After 31 years at NCM, of which 20 years were in a director's role and seven spent as chairman, the time had come to reconsider my future,' he says. Still only 50, Groen joined NCM as a 20-year-old clerk and quickly worked his way up the corporate ladder. Under his stewardship, the credit insurer took a great leap into international expansion when NCM acquired Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department when the UK government privatised in 1991. Since then, it has found partners or opened offices in Israel, Sweden, Norway and Belgium. Groen says he has absolutely no idea what the future holds for him now. 'No idea' is also his response to whether he will stay in financial services or even whether he will remain in Amsterdam.</p>

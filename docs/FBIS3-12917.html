			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second part of interview with Faruq Qaddumi, head of the </F> PLO Political Department, by Sa'id al-Gharrawi and 'Ali Husayn  in Tunis; date not given]    [Text] [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] What is the significance of  the PLO-Jordanian economic agreement that you have signed?    [Qaddumi] The economic life of the Jordanian and Palestinian  peoples is a joint economic and social life. There is no way we  can separate the aspects of these two peoples who have common  interests in all spheres. We must strengthen these interests  and create institutions capable of protecting them so that they  will stand up against all the challenges that will face us in  the future and that will try to devour the Palestinian economy.    The agreement with Jordan and the one with Egypt seek to  strengthen the Palestinian economic infrastructure and depend on  the Arab parties and international aid to build a growing and  independent Palestinian economy capable of freeing itself from  Israel's grip.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Don't you think there is a  contradiction in the course of Palestinian planning between the  economic appendices of the Oslo agreement and the  Jordanian-Palestinian agreement?    [Qaddumi] This contradiction has not surfaced so far. We  have agreed with Jordan on several economic aspects but have not  reached any agreement with Israel, even though the economic  appendices provide for cooperation in all spheres. We view this  cooperation by our own concept, which is cooperation to free  ourselves from the Israeli economy, in a basic way. This will  ensure peace in the region. But if Israel wants to swallow up  the Palestinian economy, peace will not be established.  Israel's attempts at economic containment will fail, no matter  what.    Therefore, we are against customs cooperation with Israel.  They have their own customs system, which is suitable to their  advanced Israeli society. We also have our own customs system.  However, there can be understanding on the import of goods from  abroad.    Undoubtedly, this course will protect the peace process and  put it on a sound and correct path. If Israel tries to impose  its will on economic matters, we will absolutely reject its  measures. As I have stated, Palestine's economic life is tied  to fraternal Jordan's economic life. There is no way we can  ignore this fact but we must strengthen these economic ties.  Our people live on the two banks and our Jordanian people are  part of us. We have passed through a successful unity  experiment. We cannot distinguish between a Palestinian and a  Jordanian. The two people have common interests and ties that  must be strengthened.    As for economic relations with Israel, I clearly say: We  will not allow the Israeli finance minister to decide which  goods must pay customs fees. If there is a need to change the  customs system or to alter the customs tariff on a certain  commodity, we will do it.    This is our stand, which is sound. No one can compel us to  accept a unified customs system. In addition, the import  policies are not uniform in the world. Each country has its own  policy. If we take into account the low standard of living in  the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the customs tariff imposed on  imported goods cannot be similar to the customs tariff imposed  in Israel. In short, Israel has its own system and we have our  own system, which is considerably similar to the Jordanian  customs system.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Occasionally, it looks as if  Palestinian-Jordanian relations pass through difficult periods.  We have seen Jordanian statements criticizing the PLO's weak  coordination with Jordan. What is the truth about these  relations and what is their present status?    [Qaddumi] The slogan of coordination between Jordan and  Palestine is raised by both sides but coordination has not  reached the level that we or our brothers in Jordan want. The  obstacles to the implementation of the agreement confirm and do  not preclude the need to strengthen this coordination. This  coordination must result in a broad plan of understanding  between us and our brothers in Jordan. This led to the signing  of the first economic agreement and then the second economic  agreement, which includes many matters mentioned in the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement. The second agreement covers all  aspects of life--administrative, security, and economic aspects,  as well as displaced people, refugees, borders, legislative  affairs, and laws.    Hence, we have actually begun following the correct course  for coordination and cooperation that we should have followed a  long time ago.    I do not say which side is to blame. We were all busy with  the peace process. When the proper time came to consolidate  this coordination and cooperation, we began holding intensified  meetings at the highest level (ministerial level) and drafted  the terms of this coordination. The committees began to work.  A few days ago, the Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Political  Committee held a meeting in Amman and reached agreement on most  of the tasks of the committees that we have formed and appointed.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] There has been talk about  establishing a Palestinian central bank as a symbol of  Palestinian sovereignty and as preparatory groundwork for  building a state. But looking into the articles of the  agreement with Jordan we see that the task of this bank has been  given to the Jordanian Central Bank.    [Qaddumi] This is not absolutely correct. The  Jordanian-Palestinian accord referred to an agreement of the PLO  and Jordan to reopen the Jordanian banks that existed before  Israel's occupation of the West Bank and this responsibility  extended to cover the Gaza Strip. We accepted this and said  that the Jordanian Central Bank will supervise these Jordanian  banks that have branches in the West Bank.    There is a joint technical and fiscal committee that  supervises the tasks and responsibilities of the Jordanian  Central Bank. On the one hand, the Jordanian Central Bank  oversees these banks and, on the other hand, there is a joint  Palestinian-Jordanian technical committee that receives a full  report from the central bank after frequent inspections and  supervision of the aforementioned Jordanian banks. This  practice will continue until a Palestinian monetary authority  has been established. When such an authority is established, it  will assume all the responsibilities; in other words, the  functions of the Jordanian Central Bank will cease after a  Palestinian monetary authority is established.    We know perfectly well that when talking about Jordan or  Palestine, we do not talk about different states but of our  concern as one team for the joint interests of these two nations  who live on the two banks and in Gaza.    Hence the Jordanian-Palestinian accord is the pinnacle of  coordination and cooperation between the brothers in Palestine  and Jordan. Then came subsequent agreement to enhance this  cooperation with our brothers in Jordan.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] And what about the agreement with  Egypt?    [Qaddumi] We also signed an economic agreement with Egypt to  help us develop our economy inside the occupied territories.  The agreement stipulates Egypt's right to open branches of its  banks in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. All this is aimed at  investment, transferring capitals, developing the Palestinian  economy, and building its infrastructure.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Do you believe that the U.S.-Syrian  summit will have a positive impact on the Syrian-Israeli  negotiating track, which could delay any progress on the  Palestinian track?    [Qaddumi] I disagree with those who hold this opinion  because  any progress on the Palestinian track helps advance the Syrian  track and vice versa. Any progress on the Syrian track helps  advance the Palestinian and other Arab tracks.    We wish the best for Syria if it progresses in its  negotiations with Israel, and we support sisterly Syria in its  negotiating process to achieve its national rights. That is why  I said at the beginning that the Syrians will not sign a deal  before the Palestinians do. There was a mutual agreement at the  ministerial coordination meetings that genuine progress in the  negotiations has to be made on the Palestinian track because  there are differences between this track and other Arab tracks.  That is to say, we are first negotiating over a transition  phase that we want to finish and then will move on to  negotiating the final phase. This transition phase does not  exist on the other Arab tracks, on which the delegations  negotiate only the final phase.    So any progress on the Syrian track will serve the  Palestinian track because this means that Israel will withdraw  from the Golan and south Lebanon. This helps us because  everyone agrees that a final solution must be reached  simultaneously, and all the Arab parties should sign a  comprehensive peace deal on the same day.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Despite the coordination and  agreements  you mentioned, Syria continues to deliver sharp criticism  against every Palestinian move toward a transitional solution  that you mentioned. What is your comment?    [Qaddumi] Not only Syria criticized these moves; I was one  of  those who criticized them. We admit there are flaws in the  Palestinian-Israeli accord and the Palestinians criticized the  Cairo agreement. Regrettably, the Israelis placed one option  before us. This does not mean that it was an acceptable option,  but rather an option imposed on us because we want to advance  this process to return our land.    What distinguishes the negotiations on the Palestinian track  is that we are trying to enable our displaced people to receive  their land. The point is that our people should live on their  land not that we should just retake our land. The issue centers  on the Palestinian refugees' return to their land; there is no  such issue on the other Arab tracks. This is our basic concern  and such issues and concerns do not exist on other tracks.    Therefore, we often sacrifice other issues to guarantee our  nation's return to its land; afterward, the nation can undo the  shackles, with which the Israeli occupation tied it.    Actually, this is the main difference between us and the  Arab  tracks. No matter how long the negotiations on the Arab tracks  take, they do not have much effect on the Palestinian track. We  want to halt the settlements and want the enemy to withdraw from  every inch of our land so that the enemy will not build more  settlements.    The presence of our people there puts an end to settlement.  It also makes it hard for waves of settlers to come to our  Palestinian land. This is because the implementation of the  agreement means Israel has no right after today to build any  settlement on the Palestinian territory, despite its  paramilitary presence on this territory. Also, the presence of  our people on their land will put us in a stronger position to  prevent the building of new settlements because the Israeli  objective is to absorb the Palestinian land. The Israeli  extremists and the fanatic Zionists in the world, particularly  in the United States, claim that the Palestinian land is a  disputed territory. As for the Golan, everybody admits that it  is part of Syria, and the same goes for south Lebanon, which is  recognized as part of Lebanon. So we are struggling to give the  Palestinian identity to this land and force an Israeli  acknowledgement that this land is Palestinian and, thereafter,  it would be impermissible to establish any settlements on it.  This is what the Arabs must understand when talking about the  transitional period, in which things get mixed up, criticisms  and queries increase, and the question is often asked: Why do  the Palestinians accept this or that matter? As I have stated  once, we are facing tough choices and the majority of the  Palestinian leadership opted for the lesser evil, particularly  following the Malta summit between U.S. President George Bush  and then Soviet President Gorbachev. At this summit, they  agreed to bring thousands of Russian immigrants into Palestinian  land. The Baghdad Arab summit studied the new situation to  protect the Palestinian land from being swallowed.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Did the Syrian leadership understand  the Palestinian motives?    [Qaddumi] The details of the Palestinian position  demonstrate  that we have a clear-cut strategy, and the Arabs realize it.  However, they cannot back what we too are criticizing. What we  have accepted is a choice imposed on us. We are struggling to  gain more rights for our people so that they may have full  sovereignty over their territory. The Arab brothers are trying  to avoid discrepancies between the Palestinian track and the  other Arab tracks. That is, they want the Syrian track to be  similar to the Palestinian track. But the fact is it cannot be  similar to the Palestinian track, because the facts regarding  the Palestinian track are different from those of the Syrian or  Lebanese tracks. We too back Syria and Lebanon when they say  that the tracks are different and that a solution cannot be  similar in all tracks. However, a solution must involve a  comprehensive, explicit, and clear withdrawal and the removal of  settlements. We are moving inch by inch on the Palestinian  track to ultimately achieve these goals, but the methods we use  may differ from those of the other tracks.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] You mention the question of removing  the settlements, but there is no text that explicitly refers to  the removal of settlements or even to a halt to building  activity.    [Qaddumi] The political settlement is based on international  legality; that is, "land for peace." The definition of land is  that we must enjoy sovereignty over it. Thus, an Israeli  settlement built on Palestinian land cannot remain. But how can  it be removed? This is the question that we have to solve. When  and how? In addition, the Security Council resolutions rule  that these settlements are illegitimate and must be removed, and  Israel must remove them because the final solution, as  stipulated in the agreement, must comply with Security Council  Resolution 242. This resolution calls for Israel's withdrawal  from the Palestinian territory, a just solution to the question  of Palestinian refugees, and the inadmissibility of seizing  others' territory by force.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Doesn't Brother Abu-al-Lutf [Qaddumi]  believe that making progress on the Palestinian track, with  tangible deadlocks on the other tracks, is a success for the  Israeli strategy of creating a schism in the Arab front and  separating the tracks?    [Qaddumi] In fact, separate negotiations with each Arab  party  have been going on since the Madrid conference, but the Arabs  are negotiating while coordinating among themselves. From the  start, the PLO has sought to achieve this Arab coordination and  cooperation in the negotiations. We tried to break the ice  between us and Syria and started to coordinate with it; the same  is true of Lebanon. We also straightened out our relations with  Egypt, which in turn started to undertake its pan-Arab duties in  the best possible way. This means that inter-Arab coordination  proceeded well until the Oslo agreement; the fault here lies not  with the Palestinians but with U.S. President Clinton. When I  and brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] met President Hafiz  al-Asad in Damascus and handed him a copy of the agreement he  said: We will study it, but we have some observations. We will  not say that we are either for or against this agreement, but we  will say that the Palestinian institutions, the PLO, and the  Palestinian people are responsible for accepting or rejecting  this agreement. In the meantime, we will give you some  observations. Later, we were surprised to see that President  Clinton insisted on the need to sign the agreement on 13  September. brother Abu-'Ammar tried to postpone the signing  ceremony but it was a date imposed on us. This is what made  brother Abu-'Ammar, in the end, go to Washington to sign the  agreement. But the truth is that it was neither brother  Abu-'Ammar's intention, nor the intention of the other brothers,  to sign the agreement on that date because we were waiting for  the observations promised by the brothers in Syria, Lebanon, and  Jordan. The mistake of the U.S. President and his  administration was that they hurried the signing on 13 September  to tell the world that the United States had made an important  accomplishment in the Middle East.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Could this U.S. behavior be  interpreted as a lack of interest in the facts about the region  or a U.S. attempt to harm inter-Arab ties?    [Qaddumi] This interpretation cannot be adopted. In my view,  the United States at the time was going through a difficult  economic crisis. It was said at the time President Clinton was  reluctant to make crucial decisions. Thus, a political  accomplishment was needed to improve the ratings of the U.S.  Administration.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] We notice a U.S. tendency not to  intervene in the Palestinian-Israeli talks. Do you expect the  U.S. Administration to make a ceremonial act like it did in  September?    [Qaddumi] The United States is the primary sponsor of this  process and cannot abandon its responsibilities to bring the  views closer, promote the peace process, and put pressure on the  parties concerned, particularly Israel, which shows  intransigence. Without this, the peace process will not work.  If the United States gives up acting as an unbiased sponsor  this process will stumble. Unless real accomplishment is made  on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, the peace process will  stumble entirely.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] But how can we talk about an unbiased  U.S. role when U.S. officials do not let any opportunity pass  without emphasizing their commitment to Israel's qualitative  superiority over the Arab states?    [Qaddumi] The United States always raises the claim that it  is "an impartial sponsor". So it has to act in this way; that  is, by making the peace process succeed in accordance with  former President Bush's initiative in March 1991, which  contained the principle of "land for peace," the recognition of  the Palestinian people's political rights, and the  implementation of Security Council Resolution 242 as a basis for  a settlement. Judging by the promises it made to Israel, we  knew from the start that the United States, particularly this  administration, is biased. However, as time went by it started  to realize that this bias would not serve peace in the region  and that it had to be more sensitive to things that serve peace.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Can we talk about a normalization in  Palestinian-Gulf relations following the visit of brother  Abu-'Ammar to Saudi Arabia and his meeting with the Saudi  monarch?    [Qaddumi] Brother Abu-'Ammar's visit to Saudi Arabia and the  visits of other Palestinian delegations to the Gulf states  earlier were not only an attempt to normalize Palestinian-Gulf  ties. On the contrary, they were attempts toward full  inter-Arab reconciliation. We set up and participated in the  committee formed by the Arab League to achieve Arab  reconciliation. Without this reconciliation, the Arab position  will remain weak. There must be reconciliation among all Arab  members of the Arab League and an Arab charter must be drafted  that clearly defines inter-Arab ties and their future. Thus, the  Palestinian delegations' visits to the Arab states or the Gulf  serve Arab purposes. They seek to create an appropriate  atmosphere not only to serve the peace process, but also Arab  reconciliation, which Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat  'Abd- al-Majid is exerting strenuous efforts to achieve.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] The Oslo agreement did not contain a  clear-cut and explicit clause about the return of the displaced  persons. It looked as if the PLO had abandoned a legitimate  right recognized by Security Council Resolution 437, which  stipulated the right of the displaced persons to unconditionally  return to their lands. Doesn't this sound logical?    [Qaddumi] This is incorrect. A reference to the displaced  persons of 1967 exists in the Oslo Agreement. A quadripartite  Palestinian-Jordanian-Israeli-Egyptian committee must be set up  during the interim period. These displaced persons number more  than 760,000. As for the refugees, the agreement mentioned that  negotiations must be held to discuss their problem after the end  of the second year of the transitional period. Also, the  refugees committee of the multilateral talks is discussing this  question although Israel remains intransigent and rejects  Resolution 194, which stipulated the right of the Palestinian  refugees from 1948 to return to their homes or, for those who do  not want to return, to be compensated. Thus, negotiations  between us and Israel over the refugees have been put off for  two years, but this does not mean that we are not raising this  issue in all international forums, in the UN General Assembly,  in international conferences, and in bilateral relations. All  efforts focus on the need to get Israel to recognize in  principle the Palestinians' right to return to their homes in  accordance with Resolution 194.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] But, Brother Abu-al-Lutf, the recent  "Cairo agreement" spoke about "residents" whose names are  registered in the records of the Israeli authorities and about  "visitors" of the Palestinian territory. It did not touch on  the question of the displaced persons?    [Qaddumi] The Cairo agreement is, one way or another, an  annex to the Oslo agreement. It talks about who should and  should not enter the Palestinian territory in the coming stage.  As for the displaced persons, there are clear provisions about  them in the agreement. As I said, a quadripartite committee  (from Palestine, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt) will be formed to  define the rules for their return; there is no room for argument  about this. As for the refugees, they must not return to Gaza  and Jericho but to their homes in Yafo, Haifa, the Galilee, etc.  In other words, they must return to the places from which they  were evicted. If they want to go as visitors to the West Bank  and Gaza, they have the right to, but Israel must be informed if  these persons will visit their relatives for one or two months  and, in such case, they would have a visitor status. As for the  question of their return, they must return to the places from  which they were previously evicted.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] You recently took part in a  ministerial meeting of the Nonaligned Movement in Jakarta. What  is your view of the movement's role and actions now that the  Cold War is over, and how important is that role?    [Qaddumi] The end of the international struggle that was  called "the Cold War" has brought the nonaligned countries  closer together. During the international struggle between the  two superpowers, some of these countries were affected by the  political stands of and received economic aid from one of the  sides. As a result of these conditions in some nonaligned  countries, differences arose within the movement. But following  the end of the third world war (the Cold War), the developed  countries started to have an almost identical view of these  countries because interests that led to a rapprochement with  them have disappeared.    Hence, the big powers began to treat many nonaligned  countries similarly. They started to feel that they were close  to these countries and that their interests are identical and  intertwined. The nonaligned countries began to feel the need to  strengthen their solidarity in order to face the challenges  presented by the developed countries. The struggle has in fact  become more of an economic one than a political one. Therefore,  we can say that the objective conditions are now present for the  nonaligned countries to increase their cooperation on a regional  basis, after which they will move toward comprehensive  cooperation within the Nonaligned Movement's framework, because  all these countries are in the south and in a struggle with the  countries of the north to obtain technology and reduce their  debts and the interest and services imposed on these debts.    As we know, all the nonaligned countries have similar  conditions and stands toward the major powers. Each one of  these countries produces one or two commodities that are the  basis of their economy. The developed countries in the north are  trying to control the price of these commodities while the price  of the developed countries' industrial goods are constantly  rising. This creates an imbalance in the nonaligned countries'  economic structure and makes them rally together to repel the  dangers created by the developed countries' economic and trade  policies.    Hence, the struggle between north and south in all branches  of the economic sphere will intensify. This will double the  importance of solidarity among the nonaligned countries to  confront the challenges imposed by the differences between the  north and south.    The Nonaligned Movement has become more important now than  in  the past because it affects the life of the citizen and his  social and economic wellbeing, which in turn affect the  political situation in these countries that are in dire need for  political stability.    We have seen a number of unstable political situations that  resulted from the economic imbalance and troublesome debts of  these countries. From this comes the importance of cooperation  among the nonaligned countries, because the developed world is  exploiting them regardless of their geographical positions or  political stands.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] But does not brother Abu-al-Lutf  believe that the name "Nonaligned Movement" has become a relic  of the past and that current conditions demand that it be  changed?    [Qaddumi] There is no need to change the name. We discussed  this issue at length at the movement's conferences and it was  decided to keep it, that is "the Nonaligned Movement", as an  international movement.    [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] The Palestinian-Israeli conflict  entered a new phase on 13 September 1993. What is the scope of  this conflict?    [Qaddumi] The tools of the conflict will be political and  social, in addition to foreign pressure. It will be a race of  economic development and there will be serious attempts to  organize Palestinian society so that it will be capable of  facing the challenges of building and developing our  institutions, training qualified cadres, finding all the honest  means to enable every citizen to live a dignified life, and  modernizing our institutions to absorb the developed societies'  technological and scientific advances.</p>

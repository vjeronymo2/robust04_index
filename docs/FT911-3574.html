			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin price forecast to rise by 50% TIN PRICES will rise by 50 per cent in the next 12 months from the current low levels which make most of the industry unprofitable, forecasts the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) research group. This is a less-optimistic prediction than the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) and the EIU admits that there is 'a high probability' that its forecasts will be wrong because 'at some stage it will no longer be appropriate for consumers to keep stocks at a bare minimum. 'No one wants to anticipate that moment, but equally no one wants to be left out once it arrives. When prices do rise, they will rise very sharply,' the EIU warns in its latest World Commodity Forecasts report. It predicts that tin prices will move up from an average Dollars 2.53 a lb in the first quarter this year to Dollars 3.80 in April-June 1992. Primary tin output will fall by nearly 12 per cent to 159,000 tonnes this year because of cuts by producers. Consumption is forecast to slip by 2.7 per cent to 175,500 tonnes, which would imply a deficit in the west of 12,500 tonnes. Sales from the US strategic stockpile and imports from the eastern bloc are expected by the EIU to account for some of the deficit, leaving western stocks to be reduced by 10,000 tonnes - well below the 13,000 tonnes hoped for by the ATPC. The EIU expects next year's mine production to recover by more than consumption - to 162,300 tonnes against consumption of 177,100 tonnes. Stocks might fall again, by another 7,800 tonnes, the EIU suggests, putting an upward pressure on prices. World Commodity Forecasts. Published six times a year.

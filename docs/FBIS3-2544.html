Mayor Zhang Lichang told the municipal people's congress  that  a blueprint for the building of the seaside economic zone has  been completed after a long time of preparation and deliberation  and his government will redouble efforts to implement it.    He revealed the basic framework of the emerging economic  zone, which includes the Tianjin Port, the free trade area, and  the economic and technology development zone along the seaside.    The zone, featuring the export-oriented economy and booming  industries such as the metallurgy and chemical industry,  commerce, finance, and tourism, will be developed into a free  port area with complete infrastructural facilities and  multi-functional services.    In addition, the zone's gross domestic product (GDP) and  gross export value are expected to account for over 40 percent  of the city's total in the coming decade, Zhang said.    Describing the future of the seaside zone, Zhang said that  emphasis will be placed on the construction of the Tianjin Port,  the development zone, the free trade zone, the chemical  industrial area, and infrastructural facilities.    The Tianjin Port will be made one of the country's  first-class ports, capable of handling over 40 million tons of  goods and over 500,000 standard containers.    The development area will enlarge Tianjin's foreign  investment and expand its foreign economic trade. The total  industrial output value is targeted for 11 billion yuan.    Meanwhile, the construction pace of the free trade zone will  also be quickened. A good service system for storing,  transporting, and processing will be built in order to bring  them into line with the requirements of the world market.    The official said that more funds will be pooled for  infrastructural projects, such as expressways, highways, water  works, and thermal-power plant.</p>

The Russian  politician attended the congress as a guest.    Bryczkowski said that a strong Russia was the guarantor of  the existing European borders. "No one should think that Polish  borders can be guaranteed by NATO," Bryczkowski added.    Zhirinovsky, whom Bryczkowski described as "a great friend  of  Poland," told the congress that Russia had no territorial  pretentions and its army would never move on the West. He also  added that Russia would not allow Western armies to come through  Poland to the east. The Russian guest stressed the need for  pan-Slavic solidarity in which Russia and Poland had great roles  to play.    At a press conference held before the congress debates,  Zhirinovsky claimed that Russia was already changing its  policies in tune with his party's programme. He explained that  President Yeltsin had to come to respect the outcome of the  parliamentary elections in which the Liberal Democrats won 25  percent of the vote. Zhirinovsky admitted he hoped for the  removal of Andrey Kozyrev and Sergey Shahrai from the Russian  Government by next June.    Asked about his earlier pronouncements which questioned the  existing Polish borders, the Russian politician said that the  best possible border between Poland, Russia and Germany is the  sea border on the Baltic.</p>

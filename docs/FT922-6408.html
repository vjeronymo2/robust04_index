			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Bonn to lift barriers against Bosnia refugees GERMANY agreed yesterday to ease its border rules for refugees from Bosnia-Hercegovina and urged other west European countries to do likewise. The move came as the international community prepared to step up sanctions against Serbia as a means of halting the bloodshed and stemming the refugee crisis in the disintegrating Yugoslav federation. Germany's gesture came at a meeting of Mr Rudolf Seiters, Bonn's interior minister, and his ministerial counterparts from the 16 German states. They agreed that Germany should open its frontiers to children and to the sick and wounded from Bosnia-Hercegovina. Others would be allowed into Germany if friends, relatives, churches or humanitarian organisations undertook to house and feed them, said Mr Friedel Lapple, the Saarland interior minister. Still more would be allowed in if an agreement on quotas was reached with other European countries, he said. Mr Seiters said that 300,000 of the estimated 1.3m displaced people in the former Yugoslavia were trapped in Bosnia-Hercegovina. He stressed that Germany had already done more than most to help Yugoslav refugees. Germany had allowed in about 48,000 Yugoslav asylum-seekers in the first three months of this year, and Germany's cash contribution of DM25m (Pounds 8.5m) formed the lion's share of EC aid promised so far to Croatia and Slovenia. The ministers agreed that Croatians and Bosnians already in Germany should be allowed to stay until at least the end of September. But they insisted that visa requirements should not be lifted and urged that all refugees be sent back as soon as feasible when the conflict was over. Allowing people in without visas would 'send the wrong signal' and lead to uncontrollable immigration, Mr Seiters said. In Vienna, officials from 10 European countries and several international aid organisations failed to agree on more than token measures to help Yugoslav refugees, reflecting growing helplessness in the face of Europe's worst refugee crisis in 45 years. They decided to send camps and supplies for 100,000 refugees to Croatia and provide special aid for children and the injured. Mr Alois Mock, Austria's foreign minister, termed the wave of refugees 'the greatest political and human tragedy since the end of the Second World War' and called for 'a massive increase in humanitarian aid'. The United Nations agency for refugees hopes to resume sending convoys into Bosnia soon, after deciding to suspend its operations in the republic yesterday because of harassment by Serbs. Officials said convoys would be suspended until talks could be held on safe passage. UN officials were locked in negotiations with Serb leaders from Bosnia about the return of 12 relief lorries carrying supplies of food and medicine. Serb irregulars on Thursday seized the convoy at a checkpoint in Teslic, 90 miles northwest of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo. Earlier this week Serbs attacked a Red Cross convoy, leaving a Swiss relief worker dead and two wounded.</p>

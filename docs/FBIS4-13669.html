			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says a new and  aggressive type of religious conversion has evolved in the Arab  world, and its seeds are being felt even in the Israeli Arab  sector. This is an extreme religious approach whose adherents  refuse to recognize any non-Islamic political entity. This  credo motivates the activities of Hamas and other radical  organizations in the territories. Therefore, an arrangement  with the PLO is the only possibility. The prime minister made  these remarks in a meeting with kibbutzim members.</p>

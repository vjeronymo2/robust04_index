			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Alisher Niyazov report under the "They're Shooting All </F> Around" rubric: "Tajik Opposition Settling a Score"]    [Excerpt] Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander  of the Russian border troops in Tajikistan, has charged the  extremist wing of the armed opposition with unleashing terror  against the Russian military contingent in the republic, as well  as against ethnic Russian officers serving in the national Armed  Forces.    He made this statement at an extraordinary press conference  for Russian and foreign correspondents. To all appearances, the  patience of the Russian command has become exhausted in the wake  of yet another killing, this time involving a senior officer of  the Russian border troops staff, Lieutenant Colonel Sergey  Leontikov. He was shot and killed, according to eyewitnesses,  outside his garage by three unidentified persons. All in all  eight Russians, including six servicemen, were killed between 31  May and 4 June.    In A. Chechulin's words, those well-organized and directed  terrorist acts are nothing else but the carrying out of threats  by leaders of the Islamic Rebirth Movement of Tajikistan. A.  Chechulin promised that the Russian military would no longer  tolerate the bandit threat from whoever it comes, and that  authorized weapons and equipment would be drawn upon to protect  Russians. Mechislav Senkevich, who took part in the press  conference, stated toughly that Russia would take all measures  to protect both the Russian servicemen and the Russian-speaking  population in Tajikistan.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, March 22 (AFP) -- European Union [EU]  foreign ministers remained deadlocked here Tuesday [22 March] in  an escalating crisis over how to adjust the decision-making  rules of the expanding Union.    The quarrel, which has set Britain and Spain against their  10  EU partners, is blocking the entry of Austria, Finland, Norway  and Sweden into the Union by a target date of January 1 next  year.    Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said there had been  no  movement in negotiations Tuesday and that no acceptable  compromise was in sight. "We're not moving. It's a position of  principle," he said over Spain's refusal to allow any weakening  of its ability to block decisions when new members are accepted.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said: "I am not very  hopeful of reaching an answer today. ... So far we do not have  on the table a proposal satisfactory to Britain."    Earlier the Belgian, Dutch, German, French and Luxembourg  ministers, who oppose the British-Spanish stand, all expressed  doubt that the quarrel could be overcome at Tuesday's meeting --  the fourth in so many weeks.    Dutch diplomats said 10 of the EU's 12 countries had  hardened  their refusal against compromise to satisfy the British and  Spanish demands.    On the sidelines of the meeting, Swedish European Affairs  Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel warned that the dispute could affect  the chances of the Swedish electorate accepting entry into the  Union.    The four applicants, which completed negotiations to join  the  EU earlier this month, must all hold referendums before the end  of the year to ratify their membership accords.    Asked whether the EU quarrel could turn the Swedish  electorate against EU membership, Dinkelspiel said: "Yes,  certainly" -- an answer which diplomats say applies equally to  the other three applicants.    Commenting on Tuesday's meeting, French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe said: "Nobody is moving. Better no accord than a  bad accord."    Spain is backing the British position that the enlargement  of  the EU should not dilute the power of the Union's bigger  countries to block decisions they do not like.    The Spanish want to maintain the power of three countries to  block unpopular decisions. The British want to brake the  accelerating shift of power from EU governments to a central  authority.    The rest of the 12-nation Union want the threshold of  blocking majorities raised from 23 votes out of 76 to 27 out of  90 to take account of the incoming members.    But this would weaken the ability of the EU's bigger  countries to block controversial decisions, because a coalition  of one small and two large countries could no longer make their  "no" stick.    The issue involves a balance of power between north and  south, between big countries and small, between free traders and  protectionists.    Prominent members of the European Parliament have warned the  Euro-Parliament will not ratify the enlargement accords if  concessions are made to Britain and Spain.    Euro-MP Jean Cot said Tuesday: "The British will be to blame  if the enlargement fails. They want to widen Europe but they  are trying to weaken it too."    Cot is the leader of the Socialist group, the largest bloc  in  the Euro-Parliament. "Douglas Hurd is playing with fire," he  said, adding that the parliament would accept no compromise to  satisfy the British or Spanish.    But Hurd insisted that Britain had no intention of  jeopardising the enlargement of the EU to take in the four  applicants. "We intend to work until we get a satisfactory  result," he said.    If there is no agreement Tuesday, the issue is likely to  dominate a meeting of the EU foreign ministers at Ioannina, in  northwest Greece, Saturday and Sunday.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Chicago fillip for Clinton Congressman Dan Rosten-kowski, one of the most powerful members of the US House of Representatives, has won a fierce battle for the Democratic nomination in his Chicago district, aided by a campaign visit from President Bill Clinton last month. It was as much a victory for the president, struggling to put the Whitewater affair behind him, as for the chairman of the influential House ways and means committee. Mr Clinton took a gamble in supporting a congressman who has come under a political cloud because of a continuing federal grand jury investigation of his finances that recalled old Chicago-style politics based on perks and patronage. At ways and means Mr Rostenkowski has been a faithful ally of Mr Clinton, overseeing the administration's most important initiatives. He has been in Congress since 1958, but his seat was for the first time thought to be at risk in the three-man nomination race. In the end he won with 50 per cent of the vote. Mr Rostenkowski acknowledged the president's role in the win. 'There was a point, a pivotal moment in the campaign, when a very, very gutsy and honourable and courageous man named Bill Clinton came to town,' he told his supporters. 'I'm proud to be a soldier in the president's march for change.'</p>

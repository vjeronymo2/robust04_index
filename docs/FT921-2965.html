			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Eurodollar yields hit by sell-off SOME Eurodollar bond yields have tightened in relation to US Treasury yields following the sell-off in the Treasury market on Friday which pushed the long-bond yield above the 8 per cent support level. Dealers said that Eurobonds with current coupons - that is bonds with coupons which accurately reflect current yield levels and therefore trade around their par value - have outperformed the market, tightening by three or four basis points. Spreads on recent new issues which are still unplaced had already widened, but the unsold paper still shows little sign of attracting any investor interest. In the dollar sector yesterday, Toyota Motor Finance launched a Dollars 200m three-year deal via Credit Suisse First Boston. The deal was considered reasonably priced at 35 basis points above the comparable Treasury yield, and dealers said that the short end of the market is attracting what investor demand exists. Some money managers are extending to short-dated bonds, where they perceive value in the wake of the sell-off, according to some traders. Toyota's outstanding 6 1/2 per cent bonds due November 1994 are currently trading at just 8 basis points above the curve, because those bonds are tightly held by investors. The deal was bid at 99 7/8 , around the level of its fixed price re-offer. A FFr1bn 10-year offering for Aerospatiale, the French aerospace company, suffered from an aggressive pricing in unfavourable market conditions. Political uncertainty surrounding the local elections, scheduled for next weekend, is exerting a negative pull on French bond prices. The Aerospatiale deal, priced at 52 basis points above the interpolated yield curve, widened by several basis points, as the trading level fell to 99.65 from 99.90. Dealers said that a two-year bond issue for Aerospatiale launched last month had widened from a launch spread of 35 basis points above the comparable BTAN to a current spread of 44 basis points.</p>

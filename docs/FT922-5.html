			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Rate cut hopes rise on weakUS home sales Wall Street US SHARE prices rallied sharply yesterday after some unexpectedly bad home sales data raised investors' hopes for an interest rate cut, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 37.45 ahead at 3,319.86, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 5.49 to 408.94. The American SE composite improved 3.06 to 377.10 and the Nasdaq composite advanced 10.96 to 558.80. New York SE turnover, however, was modest at 177m shares. After a string of poor economic data last week, hopes for a rate reduction were already high, but the morning's announcement of a 5.6 per cent fall in May new single-family home sales heightened the expectations. The decline in monthly home sales was the fourth in a row, and indicated that the rebound in the housing market, which many had hoped would be the driving force behind the economic recovery, has stumbled. Investors hope that monetary policy will be eased some time this week. The Federal Reserve's key policy-making Open Market Committee meets today and tomorrow to appraise the state of the economy, but it may wait until the employment report for June is released on Thursday before taking any action. Banks were mostly higher in anticipation of lower rates, which could boost bank revenues. Chase Manhattan firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 28 1/8 , BancOne Dollars 1 to Dollars 45 1/4 and Citicorp Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 21 1/2 . The exception was BankAmerica, down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 39 and still disturbed by the unexpected resignation last week of Mr Robert Smith, the group's recently named president. A range of Dow constituents enjoyed solid gains. IBM put on Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 98 5/8 , Merck Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 48 7/8 , Caterpillar Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 52 7/8 , General Motors Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 43 3/4 and Texaco Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 62 3/8 . USAir jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 12 3/8 in active trading on reports that the airline is negotiating to purchase a large part of TWA with the help of British Airways, which would, according to the reports, buy a stake in the new combined carrier. Waste Management fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 34 3/8 in volume of 3.3m shares after the company said that it would record a charge of Dollars 96m in the second quarter related to the adoption of new accounting procedures. McDonnell Douglas advanced Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 38 5/8 and Boeing shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 39 after the former beat the latter to a Dollars 1.2bn contract to produce 40 narrow-body jetliners in China. Aetna lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 after announcing it would take a Dollars 145m second-quarter charge to cover a job-cutting programme. Canada TORONTO followed the strong upturn in New York, the TSE 300 index improving 24.5 to 3,375.8. However, advances and declines were even at 272 each. Volume was 20.3m shares. Moore Corp said its second-quarter earnings will be substantially below expectations and well below those of a year ago due to weak sales in April and May. The stock was off CDollars  7/8 at CDollars 22 3/4 .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUN 29                             Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Open    10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1146.84  1145.94  1145.38  1143.60  1142.32  1141.24  1141.48  1141.48                Day's High  1147.12    Day's Low  1140.53        Jun 26      Jun 25      Jun 24      Jun 23     Jun 22       1145.05     1148.67     1145.09     1148.49    1149.77  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

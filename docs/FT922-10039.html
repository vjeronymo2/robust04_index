			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Italians sail into yachting history ITALIANS' fanatical interest in sport has suddenly expanded from a narrow diet of cycling and football to embrace sailing. Yesterday the yacht, Il Moro di Venezia, and its crew became instant national heroes as they beat New Zealand off San Diego and won the right to challenge the Americans for the America's Cup. This is the first time in almost 30 years a European challenger has reached the run-off of the top event in yachting. In little more than a week, Italy has been swept by 'Moromania' as growing numbers of people have stayed up late to watch the final eliminating races live from California. At a time when Italy appears rudderless, without either a government or a president, the sight of a perfectly synchronised crew steering Il Moro triumphantly through the Pacific swell has offered a welcome contrast. But this is not the only reason for the country's fascination with the America's Cup. Behind the Italian challenge lies a boardroom drama involving the divorce last July of Mr Raul Gardini from Ferruzzi, which he built up in the 1980s to become one of the leading private companies in Italy. A keen sailor, Mr Gardini decided in September 1988 to go for the America's Cup, creating Tencara, a tailor-made company to supervise research, development and construction of Il Moro at a new boatyard near Venice. Tencara was able to draw on the far-flung resources of Ferruzzi, particularly its special fibres and advanced materials divisions controlled by its chemicals subsidiary, Montedison. When the Ferruzzi family finally decided to part with Mr Gardini's flamboyant services, the America's Cup project was a potential embarrassment. At least Dollars 22m (Pounds 12.4m) had been spent amid considerable publicity. Four models of Il Moro were already in the water at San Diego where the 100-strong team had established a base in October 1990. The fifth, which won against New Zealand this week, was already launched. After much soul searching, Ferruzzi decided to continue but with a Dollars 40m cap on boatyard costs and a slimming down of the original project. The decision was justified by hopes of profitable spin-offs from a combination of high-profile publicity and the heavy investment in state-of-the-art yacht design and construction facilities. Mr Gardini, who remained in charge of the project, thus retained an industrial link with Ferruzzi-Montedison (his wife is a Ferruzzi). Il Moro has been pioneering special light carbon skins for the 27-metre hull and has developed a distinctive dark-coloured carbon fibre-based material for the sails. Almost 75 per cent of the vessel is made from advanced composite materials and only 1 per cent wood. Only 20 years ago, America's Cup challengers were 50 per cent aluminium and 30 per cent wood. Never before in the America's Cup has a competitor been sponsor, designer and builder. With competition costs and advertising, plus some overruns, the cup will cost the Italians close to Dollars 100m - almost four times as much as any other competitor. Success has brought the two camps together and eased the pain of last July's divorce which saw Mr Gardini and his wife obtain a Dollars 386m pay-off. There is only one jarring note to nationalist euphoria over Il Moro: the skipper, Paul Cayard, is an American. But then that famous son of Genoa, Christopher Columbus, hired himself to the Spanish 500 years ago when the Italians failed to back his bid to discover the Americas.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / People: Item: new chief economist It may be a bad sign for the UK economy. The chief economist of the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, the only independent UK forecasting group which uses the Treasury model, is heading off to Japan. Brian Pearce, who will take up a job as an economist at Swiss Bank Corporation in Tokyo, says 'the Asian region is where all the exciting growth opportunities are appearing.' Pearce's replacement will be Paul Droop, above, an Australian who came to England four years ago to join the Item Club as an economist, having worked at County NatWest Australia. Droop describes himself as 'a product of a neo-classical/neo-Keynesian synthesis' - an appropriate compromise for someone who suffered the divided loyalties of having been born in Melbourne and brought up in Sydney. The Item Club's new chief economist says the UK economy 'is at a distinct crossroads. The correct policy choices could bring a sustained period of prosperity for the country, the wrong one a rapid return to a damaging stop-go cycle.' Droop feels it is too early for the Bank of England to be raising interest rates, though if the economy continues to grow at its current pace, it should consider a rise to 6 per cent or so around the end of the year. The Item Club is owned by a number of its members; Baring Brothers, Crown Agents, JP Morgan, OEF and Schroders.</p>

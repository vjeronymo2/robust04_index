In 1992, Toyota introduced a new 1.6 l DOHC 4-valve lean  burn  engine to Japanese market, which was adaptable to medium class  vehicle and vehicle with automatic transmission.    In this paper, a comparison is made between Toyota's  previous  lean burn engine and the new one. Further description is given  upon fuel economy and exhaust emission performances of new lean  burn engine, which are achieved through technologies such as a  new intake port design and a new lean mixture feedback control  system with combustion pressure sensor.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   Reduction of fuel consumption has been attracting much  attention in viewpoint of energy saving and prevention of global  warming. In such a background, many engines adopt the system in  which the air-fuel ratio is controlled in the window gate of  3-way catalyst. This system is very effective in reducing the  exhaust emission, but leaves a room for improvement in terms of  fuel consumption because the air-fuel ratio is controlled at the  stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. A lean burn engine is attracting  attention as a means to reduce both the exhaust emission and the  fuel consumption.[.sup]1,2[/]    Toyota Motor Corporation has long been studying the lean  burn  engine and has introduced several lean-burn  engines[.sup]3,4[/] into the market since 1984 (Figure 1).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-102A>      Figure 1. History of Toyota Lean-Burn Engine Development </FIG>    In this paper, we will clarify the problems with the  previous  lean burn engines and report a new lean burn engine we have  developed for solving such problems.  <H5>  2. Basic Construction of Lean Burn System </H5>   Figure 2 shows the principle of satisfying the requirements  of low fuel consumption and NO[.sub]x[/] emission in the lean  burn engine. When the conventional engine is operated with a  lean air fuel ratio, the NO[.sub]x[/] regulation standard  cannot be satisfied within the allowable torque fluctuation  limit. If the following problems are solved, improvement of fuel  consumption can be attained while satisfying the NO[.sub]x[/]  regulation standard within the allowable torque fluctuation  limit:    (1) Combustion improvement in lean mixture conditions    (2) Precise control of air fuel ratio in lean mixture  conditions   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-102B>      Figure 2. Principle of Lean-Burn System </FIG>  <H5>  3. Outline of Previous Lean Burn Engine and Existing Problems </H5>   3.1 Outline of Previous Lean Burn Engine    Figure 3 shows the construction of the 4-valve, 4-cylinder,  1587 cc engine system for Europe (satisfying German exhaust  emission control annex 23) used as the base for development.  This is different from the conventional three-way catalyst  system in the three following points:    (1) Intake port with a swirl control valve (SCV) (Figure 4)    With a partial load, the SCV is closed to make the intake  air  flow only in the helical passage to generate a swirl to attain  lean burn, while the SCV is opened to attain a high output, with  a high load.    (2) Sequential injection control    The injection timing is optimized to satisfy both the  specified torque fluctuation and NO[.sub]x[/] emission.    (3) Air-fuel ratio feedback control in lean mixture area by  a  lean mixture sensor    A lean mixture sensor for detecting the air-fuel ratio from  the oxygen concentration is adopted. It also serves as the  O[.sub]2[/] by switching of the input circuit when the load  is high.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-103A>      Figure 3. Previous System Construction </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-103B>      Figure 4. Previous Intake Port </FIG>     3.2 Fuel Consumption Improvement, NO[.sub]x[/]  Emission and Problems    Figure 5 shows the relationship between the NO[.sub]x[/]  emission and fuel consumption in each test mode. The vehicle  used for the test was a manual transmission (M/T) vehicle in  European specification with an equivalent inertia weight of 1.25  ton. In the FTP-75 and EPA-HWY modes specified in Annex 23, the  NO[.sub]x[/] regulation standard was satisfied while the fuel  consumption is improved by 10 percent or more compared to that  with the three-way catalyst system (stoichiometric mixture  system). There, however, exists the following problems:    (1) Enlargement of lean mixture area    In the new EC mode (maximum speed: 120 km/h), NO[.sub]x[/]  emission is relatively high and the fuel consumption improvement  effect is relatively low. This is because the volumetric  efficiency with closed SCV is low in the high speed area and  relatively richer mixture is required to obtain the enough  output. To reduce the NO[.sub]x[/] emission and improve the  fuel consumption in the high speed range, it is necessary to  enlarge the lean mixture area by increasing the intake air flow  when the SCV is closed.    (2) Reduction of NO[.sub]x[/] emission    In the domestic 10-15 mode test, the fuel consumption is  improved by about 10 percent as compared with the stoichiometric  mixture system, but the NO[.sub]x[/] emission does not  satisfy the standard. At present NO[.sub]x[/] purification by  the catalyst is impossible in the lean mixture area, reduction  of the NO[.sub]x[/] emission from the engine itself is  necessary to realize the lean burn engine on a vehicle with  automatic transmission (A/T) while satisfying the domestic  standard.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-104A>      Figure 5. Comparison of NO[.sub]x[/] and Fuel </FIG>  <H5>  4. New Lean Burn Engine </H5>   4.1 System Outline    The outline and performance of the new lean burn engine are  to be reported here. The engine used for the test is planned to  be mounted on M/T or A/T vehicle with an equivalent inertia  weight of 1.25 ton while satisfying the domestic emission  control standard (in 10-15 mode). Figure 6 shows the new system  composition. The differences from the previous system are as  follows:    (1) Enlargement of lean mixture area by adoption of new  intake port    (2) Reduction of NO[.sub]x[/] emission by a new air-fuel  mixture control system using a combustion pressure sensor    (3) Improvement of fuel consumption in stoichiometric  mixture  area by adoption of electrically controlled EGR system (A/T  vehicle)   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-104B>      Figure 6. New System Construction </FIG>    4.1.1 Structure of New Intake Port and Its  Performance    In the lean burn engine, improvement of combustion was  realized by high in-cylinder turbulence such as swirl. The  previous swirl intake port was designed to increase air flow  velocity by restricting the cross section of the intake port  (see Figure 4). In consequence, it was very difficult to satisfy  both high volumetric efficiency and combustion improvement at a  high engine speed when the SCV is closed.    To overcome this problem, a new intake port for 4 valves has  been developed as shown in Figure 7. This port consists of a  helical port and straight port which are almost separated. The  helical port has a projecting wall for swirl generation. A  two-hole type injector is adopted and placed downstream the SCV.  With a partial load, the SCV is closed and the intake air flows  mainly through the helical port to generate a swirl. A part of  the flow is led through the connecting passage between the  helical port and straight port and generates a high speed flow  for atomization of the fuel on the straight port side. While the  fuel was atomized and homogenized by a strong swirl (swirl  ratio: 2.2) in the previous intake port, the new intake port  adopts the fuel supply system with relatively low swirl ratio of  1.7 to 1.8 to realize lean burn. As a result, the constriction  of the intake port can be relaxed to attain high volumetric  efficiency when the SCV is closed, and to increase the intake  air flow by 45 percent.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-104C>      Figure 7. New Intake Port </FIG>    We have compared the performance of the new intake port with  that of the previous intake port. Figure 8 shows the comparison  of the partial load performance in the lean mixture area with  that of the previous intake port. The combustion performance is  equivalent or superior to those with the previous intake port.  It has also been found that the improvement of the lean mixture  limit is effective for the improvement of the limit of dilution  of the mixture by the EGR gas. Figure 9 compares the lean  mixture area. The lean mixture area is greatly enlarged by  adoption of the new intake port, and is wide enough to cover a  practical cruising area in Japan. It also shows that the full  load performance is much improved.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-105A>      Figure 8. Lean-Burn Performance </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-105B>      Figure 9. Comparison of Lean Mixture Area and Full Load Performance </FIG>    4.1.2 Lean Mixture Limit Air-Fuel Ratio Feedback  Control With Combustion Pressure Sensor    The target air-fuel ratio in the feedback control with the  lean mixture sensor should be set with a margin on the rich side  from the lean mixture limit in consideration of dispersion of  the sensor or engine and the weather conditions (Figure 2).  Reduction of this margin will enable the NO[.sub]x[/]  emission to be reduced. For this purpose, a new air fuel ratio  feedback control system using a combustion pressure sensor has  been developed. In this system, air fuel ratio is controlled to  maintain the torque fluctuation at the specified level by  detecting the lean mixture limit or torque fluctuation limit  directly from the combustion state.    Figure 10 shows the structure of the combustion pressure  sensor. The combustion pressure is transmitted from the  diaphragm to the force detecting device via the ceramic rod and  hemisphere. The force detective device converts the pressure  into the voltage by the piezoelectric effect. This signal is  output after amplification by the built-in amplifier.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-105C>      Figure 10. Structure of Combustion Pressure Sensor </FIG>    In this system, the combustion pressure sensor is installed  only at cylinder No. 1.    The control method is explained below.    (1) Calculating the torque substitution value (T)    The value substituting the torque can be calculated  according  to the following equation by measuring the combustion pressure  sensor signal near the end of the intake stroke (P[.sub]0[/])  and at the specified crank angle in the expansion stroke  (P[.sub]1[/]-P[.sub]4[/]) as shown in Figure 11.    T = _a_[.sub]1[/](P[.sub]1[/] - P[.sub]0[/]) +  _a_[.sub]2[/](P[.sub]2[/] - P[.sub]0[/]) +  _a_[.sub]3[/](P[.sub]3[/] - P[.sub]0[/]) +  _a_[.sub]4[/](P[.sub]4[/] - P[.sub]0[/])    where _a_[.sub]j[/] is the pressure-torque conversion  coefficient with the crank angle as the parameter.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-105D>      Figure 11. Study on Torque Substitution Value </FIG>    Figure 11 shows the good correlation between the torque  substitution value obtained by this method and the brake torque.    (2) Calculating torque fluctuation [_D_T]    Calculate the average of the absolute difference between the  preceding and current torque substitution values over N times of  measurements.      (3) Air-fuel ratio control    Fuel injection time TAU is corrected according to the result  of comparison between _D_T and criterion _b_.    F[.sub]i[/] = F[.sub]i - 1[/] + _g_(_D_T - _b_)    TAU = F[.sub]i[/]-TP    _g_: Constant (positive value)    F[.sub]i[/]: Fuel injection time correction term    TP: Basic injection time    Figure 12 shows the feedback controllability by this method.  This figure shows the case where the lean or rich signal is  input forcibly.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-106A>      Figure 12. Feedback Controllability </FIG>    In either case, the degree of convergence to the target  torque fluctuation level (criterion _b_) has been confirmed  sufficient. Criterion _b_ here is determined according to the  allowable surge level actually felt on the vehicle.    As a result of the lean mixture limit feedback control, it  has become possible to reduce the NO[.sub]x[/] by about 30  percent as shown in Figure 8, with the fuel consumption ratio  remained in the same level.    4.1.3 Electrically Controlled EGR System    The EGR driven by a stepping motor has been adopted for A/T  vehicle to improve the fuel consumption in stoichiometric  mixture area frequently used in acceleration (Figure 13).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-106B>      Figure 13. EGR Valve Structure </FIG>    As compared with the conventional EGR system, the new system  has good EGR controllability near to the limit. And it allows  EGR to be possible even in the high load area while the intake  manifold pressure is low, because new system does not need a  vacuum source for valve operation. As a result, improvement in  fuel consumption is obtained as shown in Figure 14.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-107A>      Figure 14. Effect of Electrically Controlled EGR System </FIG>    4.2 Effect of Fuel Consumption Improvement    As compared with the conventional three-way catalyst system  engines, the new lean burn engine has been confirmed to bring  about improvement of the fuel consumption by 9 to 11 percent,  both in the 10-15 mode and at a constant speed of 60 km/h as  shown in Figure 15 while satisfying the NO[.sub]x[/]  regulation standard.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-107B>         Figure 15. Effect of Fuel Consumption Improvement </FIG>  <H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>   (1) A new intake port satisfying both lean burn and high  output up to the high intake air volume area has been developed.    (2) The NO[.sub]x[/] emission has been reduced by  introduction of lean combustion limit feedback control using the  combustion pressure sensor, allowing application of the lean  burn engine to the 1.25 ton class and A/T vehicles.    (3) The electrically controlled EGR system adopted in the  A/T  vehicles has successfully reduced fuel consumption in the  stoichiometric mixture area.  References    1.

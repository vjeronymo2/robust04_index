With Wall Street stocks posting strings  of record highs while Japanese shares lagged, net Japanese  buying of U.S. securities jumped to 21.93 billion dollars in  1993 from 8.75 billion dollars, the ministry said in an annual  report.    Surging share purchases from October in the roaring Hong  Kong  and Southeast Asian bourses pushed net Japanese securities  buying in the ministry's "other" category 3.63 billion dollars  from net sales of 1.85 billion dollars in 1992, a ministry  official told reporters.    Steady bond markets helped boost net purchases in Germany to  17.38 billion dollars from 8.13 billion dollars and in France to  10.03 billion dollars from 2.53 billion dollars, he said. But  Japanese sold a net 17.96 billion dollars' worth of Luxembourg  securities, compared with earlier net sales of 2.81 billion  dollars, on redemptions of dollar-denominated Japanese warrant  bonds there, the official said.    As foreign exchange losses forced them to bail out, Japanese  investors sold a net 4.38 billion dollars of securities in  Australia, against previous net sales of 1.73 billion dollars,  and sold 5.76 billion dollars' worth in Canada, a turnaround  from 1992 net purchases of 1.58 billion dollars.    Net purchases of British securities dipped to 16.76 billion  dollars from 17.06 billion dollars, while those in Switzerland  climbed to 2.05 billion dollars from 708 million dollars.    As previously reported, net foreign securities purchases  totaled 43.51 billion dollars, up from 32.47 billion dollars.</p>

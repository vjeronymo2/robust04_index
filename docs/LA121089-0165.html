			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RISE IN EXISTING-HOME VALUES IS SLOWING  </P> <P> In another sign that the Southland's once-sizzling housing market is cooling, a  survey conducted by a real estate research group says appraised values of  sample existing homes are rising at their slowest rate in the last five years.  </P> <P> The biggest slowdowns were recorded in Orange and Ventura counties, according  to the semiannual survey conducted by the Real Estate Research Council of  Southern California. The council is a nonprofit organization headquartered at  Cal Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> Estimated values in Orange County rose an average 18% from October, 1988 to  October, 1989, down from the 27% annual appreciation rate logged from April,  1988 to April, 1989.  </P> <P> Values in Ventura County rose at a 14% annual clip in the October-to-October  period, less than half the 29% yearly rate recorded six months earlier.  </P> <P> "The housing market is cooling, but it's still pretty strong," said Michael  Carney, the economist and Cal Poly professor who conducted the survey.  </P> <P> "Home prices are still rising. It's just that they're not rising as fast as  they were before."  </P> <P> Results of the survey are based on the appraised value of 214 existing homes  scattered across seven Southern California counties.  </P> <P> The same homes are appraised every six months, regardless of whether they are  sold, in order to track general price movements. New homes are excluded from  the survey.  </P> <P> Estimated values in Los Angeles County were up 24% from the year-ago survey.  Values in the East San Gabriel Valley-Pomona subregion were up 32%; in the San  Fernando Valley, 27% and the North Central-Pasadena area, 25%.  </P> <P> Values have risen an average 24% in the Westside-Santa Monica market and in  Southeast Los Angeles over the past year.  </P> <P> Appraised values rose fastest in San Bernardino County, a huge area where  values surged 29% from October, 1988 to October, 1989, the survey said. That  was nearly three times the appreciation rate recorded a year earlier, according  to the report.  </P> <P> Values in Riverside County rose a healthy 23% over the past year.  </P> <P> "Prices in San Bernardino and Riverside are catching up with the rest of  Southern California," Carney said. "Demand there has been helped by all the  people who want to buy a house, but can't afford a home in Los Angeles or  Orange County."  </P> <P> The survey found that values in San Diego County are up 24% from a year ago,  while values in Santa Barbara County are up 18%.  </P> <P> Overall, values in the seven-county area rose an average 8.1% over the past six  months and are up 22.9% from a year ago, the report said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : JOIE LEE, SPIKE'S SISTER, FINDS HERSELF IN A 'MO' BETTER' PLACE  </P> <P> Joie Lee grew up in Brooklyn, the only girl in a family of six children. "I  considered myself one of the boys," she says. "My brothers didn't spoil me at  all, not at all. I was very tomboyish. It wasn't as if I was like a princess or  anything like that."  </P> <P> There's nothing tomboyish now about the 28-year-old actress who currently is  starring in her big brother Spike Lee's new film, "Mo' Better Blues." She plays  Indigo Downes, one of two beautiful women in the life of jazz musician Bleek  Gilliam (Denzel Washington).  </P> <P> Lee and her siblings were encouraged from childhood to go into the arts. Her  father is a jazz musician who scores the music to Spike's films; her mother was  a schoolteacher. "It was just our way of life," she says. "When you grown up in  that kind of environment, it's not something you question. When you are a  youngster, I think most kids want to do what their parents do. We lived and  breathed (the arts). It wasn't anything that was oppressive."  </P> <P> Education was also very important in her family. "My mother passed away when I  was 14, so there were certain things I missed in terms of upbringing," says  Lee. "Maybe my mother would have said, 'You have to get a real job.' I don't  know because I didn't have that experience. My fortes in school were Spanish,  sports, reading and theater. That's what they encouraged."  </P> <P> After attending a private school for gifted students for 12 years, Lee dropped  out of Sarah Lawrence College during her sophomore year. "I wasn't ready for  school," admits Lee. "It was more important to me to have a job or have an  apartment or have a boyfriend. That's what I wanted to experience at that  time."  </P> <P> Lee worked at various odd jobs until four years ago when Spike gave her a small  part in his first feature film, "She's Gotta Have It." "Acting is something I  always wanted to do and knew I could do," says Lee. She's subsequently worked  with her brother on all of his features and is about to begin his new movie,  "Jungle Fever."  </P> <P> Between acting assignments, Lee hopes to find time to complete her education.  "I want to have a degree," says Lee. " It wasn't important at 18 when you are  flitting about, but it's important to me now. I want to finish school." SUSAN  KING  </P></p>

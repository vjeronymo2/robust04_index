			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / World Trade News: Poland to give birth to Fiat's new baby - FSM is to produce a brand new car under licence FIAT is about to become the first western car maker to start production of a new car range for western and eastern European markets exclusively from a plant in eastern Europe. The Italian company is to launch early next year a new mini car, the Fiat Cinquecento (Fiat 500), which will be assembled under licence by FSM, one of the two Polish state-owned car makers. It is the first time that a model to be licensed by Fiat for production at a foreign plant has been developed from scratch rather than derived from an existing Italian model. Fiat has invested L1,000bn (Pounds 453m) in developing the Cinquecento and in plant and equipment to modernise the FSM assembly plant at Bielsko Biala, Silesia. Initially 160,000 cars a year will be produced. About 100,000 will be exported to western Europe. Output could rise later to 220,000 cars a year. Plant and equipment worth DM900m (Pounds 302m) has been supplied to FSM under the Cinquecento development and production contract signed in 1987. About half of this is being supplied by Italian machine tool and components companies outside the Fiat group. The currency needed by Poland to pay for the investment at FSM will be generated by cars purchased by Fiat for sale through its dealer network in western Europe. As a result of this arrangement Fiat has taken on the entire commercial risk for credit extended to Poland to buy plant and equipment both from the Fiat group itself and from other suppliers. Cover provided by SACE, the Italian state export credit insurance agency, is limited to the risks of loss of revenue because of political events and catastrophes, and actions by the Polish authorities which might limit FSM production or block exports of finished cars. The Cinquecento - named after Fiat's first baby car which pioneered the mini car sector in the 1930s - will replace the existing Fiat 126, the smallest car in the Fiat range. The 126 was first produced in 1972 at the group's Cassino assembly plant in Italy, but production was gradually transferred to the FSM plant at Bielsko Biala from 1979. The Polish plant has been the sole production source for the 126 since 1981. Fiat is still seeking Polish government backing for a more far-reaching plan to modernise and rationalise the entire Polish motor industry. It wants to create a holding company combining FSM and FSO, the two state car makers, in which Fiat would take the role of 'strategic investor', to build engine and gearbox plants, and a licensing agreement to assemble the Fiat Tipo at the FSO plant in Warsaw. There is confusion over the future of the antiquated FSO operations, however, which are centred on production of earlier Fiat designs under licence. Fiat's radical plan appeared to have gained the backing of Polish President Lech Walesa on a recent visit to Italy, but FSO is also conducting competing negotiations with General Motors for the assembly of Opel/Vauxhall cars in Warsaw. Mr Jack Smith, GM vice chairman responsible for international operations, visited Warsaw last week for talks with FSO. The US car maker has completed a feasibility study and is expected to begin negotiations with the government and FSO within a month. GM is considering investing Dollars 100m to establish an assembly operation for 30-50,000 cars a year (on two or three shifts) at part of the existing FSO facility.</p>

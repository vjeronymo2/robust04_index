			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (30): Flexibility in the securities business - Case Study / London Global Securities / A recently-formed securities firm has used a fourth-generation language to develop a fast-moving system for its own needs SOFTWARE development requires more than just a clever programmer: it must also have a great deal of input from the user or from an expert in the field. Indeed, using a fourth-generation language can significantly diminish the amount of computer expertise required. Moreover, in fast-moving businesses, advantage can be gained by being able to develop a product more quickly than a competitor. London Global Securities (LGS) is a securities lending intermediary which was formed 18 months ago by experts in the market. It teamed up with international software house K-Tek to produce a system. 'Like many of the players, we have used the Reuters Blend system until now,' says director of operations, Stephen Jennett, 'but it's a bureau system. We have spent the last 12 to 15 months specifying and building our own system, which is in parallel running now and should go live in the next few weeks.' K-Tek specialises in financial software systems for multi-national companies which borrow and lend on, internationally. It has already installed a general ledger system at LGS running on an IBM RS/6000. This will be fed directly by the new administration system, once it is live. K-Tek recommended the use of System Builder's SB+, a tool which uses Pick, for this development. Pick is a relational database-cum-fourth-generation language which offers a high degree of portability and flexibility. On LGS' RS/6000, this runs with the Universe Pick system - 'it's easy to add reports, the system is very powerful and it looks like a PC,' says Mr Jennett. 'The problem with the bureau system is that if we want to make a change we have to tell the bureau. If it is acceptable, every other user benefits, so we do not gain competitive advantage. The bureau has to be convinced that it is to its advantage to make changes.' However, Reuters Blend has enjoyed a monopoly until recently. Several larger companies and software houses are working on their own products, but these are not yet written. LGS believes it will be the first, because it is using a fourth-generation language. 'We've no historical foundation to build in, because we're a young company. We started later than some, but we are using up-to-date technology and architecture.' The product will be fully supported by K-Tek, which will also market it under licence to other companies, with modifications or tailoring as required. Its name will be Global One, and there is already interest from US agents. Using fourth-generation language techniques, the developers have brought together software expertise, and the user experience of LGS, without becoming bogged down in technicalities. The result is expected to be a flexible product which should find a niche, and be ahead of its opponents. Michael Powell</p>

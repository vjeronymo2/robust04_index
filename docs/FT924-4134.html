			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Belgium (1): Keeping in the fast lane - Business wants to attract outside investment and yet retain a degree of national management autonomy. This is a perennial dilemma for Belgium, which is certain to be at the core of the European single market BELGIUM is inexorably moving towards economic and monetary union with its neighbours - Maastricht treaty or no Maastricht treaty. EC-wide approval of Maastricht would of course profit a small country like Belgium, but if ratification cannot be achieved and a two-speed economic Europe is the only alternative, Mr Philippe Maystadt, the country's finance minister, says Belgium will be in the fast lane. 'We export 75 per cent (of total exports) to our partners in the European Community, and 60 per cent towards our three direct neighbours,' he says. 'It is essential for Belgium to be in the same group as Germany, France and the Netherlands.' It was Mr Maystadt who decided to tie the Belgian franc to the D-Mark in June 1990, a policy acclaimed by both the IMF and OECD in recent reports on the Belgian economy. 'In a way, we have already lost our sovereignty, at least in the monetary field,' he admits. 'We see monetary union as a way to recover collectively that sovereignty. At least in a European central bank we would have something to say. Today (when the Bundesbank makes monetary decisions which affect the Belgian economy) we have no say.' With or without the treaty, Mr Maystadt says Belgium must continue to aim for the Emu criteria - in particular, the strict requirement to bring the country's large budget deficit down to 3 per cent of gross national product by 1996. For the long-term outside investor in Belgium, such determination must be good news. It means that, geographically and politically, Belgium is certain to be at the core of the European single market. Recent events have shown the value of this strategy - particularly links with the D-Mark. Mr Marcel Cockaerts, chairman of Kredietbank, one of Belgium's three largest banks, points out that the Belgian franc stayed firm amid September's European currency turmoil, and at one point was even stronger than the D-Mark. 'To step back from (the policy of shadowing the D-Mark) would mean the loss of our credibility for the next 100 years,' he warns. However, in spite of this stable foundation, the government must overcome a number of short-term domestic hurdles before it can rest. The centre-left coalition - formed in March - has introduced rigorous 1993 budget measures aimed at bringing the budget deficit down to 5.2 per cent of GNP by the end of next year. That compares with 6.3 per cent for 1991 and a forecast 5.9 per cent for the end of this year. But whether the government has the political clout to keep to this line largely depends on the parallel attempt to push through long-awaited constitutional reform. This package would devolve more powers, including financial responsibilities, to Belgium's regions and linguistic communities. The latest signs are that the government will be able to win the two-thirds majority it requires in parliament for such reform, albeit narrowly. Approval would immeasurably strengthen the government - and its economic policy. Where does that leave the humble investor or business in Belgium? Analysts say the political turmoil - as always in Belgium - has made little difference to business. Most Belgian companies remain in the doldrums, becalmed by the same economic downturn that is hampering their counter- parts in the rest of Europe. Few forecasters predict GNP growth of more than 1.6 per cent this year, and 2 per cent next year. The average forecast is more like 1.4 or 1.5 per cent for 1992. Since 1990, annual investment growth has slowed down from 12 or 13 per cent to less than 3 per cent. Mr Jan Herremans, director of the economic department at the Federation des Entreprises de Belgique (FEB), says that orders from overseas are very low and there is little sign of improvement this year or in the first half of 1993. Domestically, according to a recent report from Namur Assurances du Credit, Belgian companies are suffering from the diminishing profitability of capital stock, high interest rates and the general drop in profits. As a result, the Belgian credit insurer expects bankruptcies this year to exceed 5,000 for the first time. Company failures, Namur says, have increased by 26.7 per cent against 1991 in the third quarter alone. The gloom is reflected in the stock market, where most industrial stocks which dominate the Brussels bourse are still bumping along the bottom of their cycle. Exceptions include the Belgian banks, buoyed up by takeover news and ripe for rationalisation. Analysts admit it is not clear how such changes will come about. The social and financial cost of a merger between the big players - each of which has a branch on every Belgian high street - would be too great to countenance. Nonetheless, it is obvious that banks which continue to concentrate on the Belgian market are not going to prosper once internal EC frontiers come down. One possible route is takeover from outside Belgium, or co-oper- ation with other financial institutions. For example, Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), another of the Belgian big three banks, has been courted recently by Internationale Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch banking and insurance group. A bid and co-operation in the lucrative 'bancassurance' field was under consideration. BBL's announcement 10 days ago that the bid would not take place has spared Belgian business further heart-searching about one of the country's perennial dilemmas: how to attract outside investment and yet ensure that Belgian companies retain a certain national management autonomy. Mr Cockaerts of Krediet- bank, for example, says he would consider it 'an impoverishment of the whole of Belgium' if too many great Belgian names were lost to foreign buyers. Abandonment of the ING/BBL deal will not kill this highly political issue. It is bound to come to a head when the government - bent on privatisation - announces the first sales of state-owned enterprises before Christmas. In the context of the long-standing tension between French- and Flemish-speakers in Belgium, this is not just a question of national pride. For example, the government of Flemish-speaking Flanders is already expressing its concern that the state might favour sales to francophone buyers. In reality, however, there is little that can be done to prevent foreigners buying into Belgium - and indeed there is little that the government wants to do. Belgian business can only lament that after the war, when other countries were building up national champions through restrictive share structures and general protectionism, a job-starved Belgium was opening its borders and boardrooms to all-comers. It was perhaps a case, agrees Mr Jean Peterbroeck, the distinguished broker who heads the Brussels bourse, of too much free trade, too soon. More optimistically, however, it is now an indication of the continuing attractiveness of Belgium to foreign investors, in spite of the downturn. The government has done its best to maintain the incentive for inward investment, by pursuing its successful 'co-ordination centres' initiative - tax breaks for multinationals which establish administrative headquarters in Belgium. At the same time, Belgium's regions - Flanders, French- speaking Wallonia and Brussels itself - play an important role in attracting investment, as befits a country which will formally become a federal state if constitutional reform is approved. Mr Georges Walckiers, who heads BBL's corporate finance department, warns potential investors against reading too much into the unduly gloomy picture of a Belgium saddled with large debts and riven by regional strife. If Belgians were asked to be frank about their country's attractions, Mr Walckiers suggests they might quote Talleyrand. Asked what he thought of himself, the French statesman replied: 'Tres peu quand je me considere, beaucoup quand je me compare' - not much when I consider myself, but a great deal when I compare myself to others.</p>

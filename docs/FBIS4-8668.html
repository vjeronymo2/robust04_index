			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Adrian Ursu: "The Prime Minister Approves of </F> the Idea of Dismissing Ioan Oancea"]    [Text] On the evening of 6 April, during the meeting of  the Standing Bureau of the PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party],  several members of this leading body insistently asked the  leaders of the party to do all they can to have PUNR Deputy  Valeriu Tabara appointed to the position of minister of  agriculture. Answering this request, a PUNR delegation led by  Ioan Gavra [vice president of the PUNR and of the Chamber of  Deputies] met yesterday morning with Prime Minister Nicolae  Vacaroiu, whom the members of the delegation asked to order the  dismissal of current Agriculture Minister Ioan Oancea as soon as  possible. The PUNR's reasons for this request were the data and  conclusions of the report of the anticorruption commission and  other indications that the PUNR got hold of in various ways.  According to Gavra's declarations, the prime minister allegedly  accepted the accusations formulated by the PUNR as justified.  The two sides that participated in yesterday's dialogue agreed  that Oancea's dismissal would be opportune even before the  report on actions of corruption would be discussed in the  plenary meeting of the two chambers of the Romanian Parliament.    The participants in the meeting of the PUNR Standing Bureau  also told us that during the Wednesday evening meeting, the  participants proposed that Senator Viorel Salagean should be  appointed as leader of the group in charge of reorganizing the  Bucharest branch of the party. Considering that he declined  this mission, Cornel Brahas received the respective task.  Through this appointment -- which might also imply his  appointment to the position of president of the Bucharest branch  of the party -- the PUNR leaders wished to contradict rumors  regarding Brahas' so-called dissidence.</p>

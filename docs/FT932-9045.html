			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Calm returns after realignment TURBULENCE inside the European exchange rate mechanism subsided yesterday as the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo stabilised on the currency markets after their devaluations on Thursday, writes Sandeep Deol. The ERM remained the focus of the market's attention, but pressures on both currencies remained slight. The Spanish currency, which was devalued by 8 per cent on Thursday, closed in London today at Pta76.11 against the D-Mark from a previous close of Pta76.33. The Portugese escudo, which was forced into a 6.5 per cent devaluation, ended the day at Esc96.35 against the D-Mark from a previous Esc96.65. However, some currency analysts already believe that this week's realignment will not staunch pressures on the Iberian currencies later this year. Mr Keith Edmonds, International Economist at NatWest Markets, believes the real test of the devaluations is yet to come. He suggested that the devaluation of the peseta will prove to be 'inadequate' if the Government hopes to reduce interest rates significantly. Spain yesterday reduced its short-term interest rates by 1.5 per cent, to 11.5 per cent in the wake of the devaluation. Mr Ian Gunner, an economist at Chase Manhattan, disagreed. He expects the peseta to be well-supported at present levels, allowing further interest rate cuts. He forecasts a 50 basis point easing in short term rates ahead of the election, and nominal rates at 10 per cent in the next few months. The D-Mark recouped some of the ground it had lost earlier in the week following somewhat bearish comments on Thursday from the Bundesbank President, Mr Helmut Schlesinger. He said that the Bundesbank would do all it could to maintain confidence in the D-Mark and that the central bank could not 'take a sledge-hammer to German rates.' This dampened hopes of a large near-term easing in German monetary policy. As a result, the French franc finished slightly weaker yesterday at FFr3.373 per D-Mark against a previous FFr3.372. The dollar tested the DM1.61 level against the German currency after the release of mildly positive economic data. March industrial production rose 0.1 per cent, lower than forecasts for 0.2 per cent, but still showing signs of moderate growth. The pound was sidelined by a lack of fresh news, and saw some late buying interest which allowed it to pick up more than a cent against the dollar, to close at Dollars 1.385. It was up  1/4 pfennig against the D-Mark to close at DM2.4650.</p>

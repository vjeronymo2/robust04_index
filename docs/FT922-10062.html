			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Jordan talks of single union for engineers MR BILL Jordan, president of the new merged Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, yesterday raised the prospect of a further merger to create a single union for blue and white-collar workers in the engineering industry. Speaking after the first executive meeting of the AEEU, formed out of the AEU engineers and the EETPU electricians, he said that 'any rational person' could see that it made sense to talk about common links with MSF, the technical and finance union which organises most white-collar workers in the industry. Mr Jordan added: 'It is not really sensible to talk about this just after the current merger but anyone can see that it makes sense in the longer-term.' The AEEU will set up a white-collar section and seek to compete with the MSF but it is unlikely to have much success. The AEEU also gave notice that it would be using its new influence to force structural reform of the Trades Union Congress. Assuming that the old EETPU section of the union is allowed back into the TUC, from which it was expelled in 1988, the joint union will be paying an annual affiliation fee to the TUC of Pounds 1.2m. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the new union, said yesterday: 'Quite frankly we don't get value for money.' And a senior EETPU official said that some sign of 'serious reform' at the TUC would be useful before the members vote on whether the new union should be affiliated or not. Reformers such as Mr Laird and Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, have been arguing that with the advent of the 'super-unions' the TUC should radically concentrate its activities into areas like European lobbying, health and safety, and training.</p>

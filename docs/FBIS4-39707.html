			<p>BFN     [Text] Prospects for development, privatization, price  formation, and other issues were discussed at a Republican  seminar- conference on trade issues. Head of the Belarusian  Government Vyachaslaw Kebich delivered a report. Speaking about  prices for goods, the prime minister stated that the government  failed to stabilize them thus far. The key reason is an  exterior factor, however, the minor reason is that trade also  had its own expenditures. Many middlemen -- boosting prices --  have emerged. Their numbers can and should be minimized.  According to the prime minister, the government should bridle  price formation through the Department for Prices.    The head of the government also met yesterday with the  working collective of the Kirov factory.</p>

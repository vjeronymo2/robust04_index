			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Wiadomosci" newscast; relayed by Warsaw TV </F> Polonia Network in Polish]    [Text] [Announcer Grazyna Bukowska] The Defense Affairs  Committee of the Council of Ministers decided at its first  meeting that, until the time of changes in the Constitution, the  chief of the General Staff will continue to be subject to the  national defense minister. President Lech Walesa, on the other  hand, wants the chief of staff to be directly subject to him, as  the head of the Armed Forces.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Ministers  explained that they were unable to make another decision because  the president has agreed with the ruling coalition that there  could be no changes in the structure of power before the  adoption of the new constitution.    [National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk] Today, the  committee decided to indicate to the Council of Ministers the  second option--that is, that option in which the chief of the  General Staff remains subject to the national defense minister.  That is the option that has been in place hitherto.    [Walesa] This is still under discussion. I will be speaking,  I will be demonstrating, that the first option is the better  one. And I think we will find a compromise.    [Correspondent] During the deliberations today, the  government Defense Affairs Committee created an interministerial  crisis team that will permanently observe all threats to the  security of the state. The National Defense Ministry deems one  of the greatest dangers to be the presence of a large number of  Russian forces in the Kaliningrad District. Minister Piotr  Kolodziejczyk said today that he had obtained a promise from  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev of a significant  reduction of forces in this district.    [Kolodziejczyk] As a final figure, there are to be  altogether  25,000 soldiers and sailors stationed in this region--a clear,  far-reaching reduction of the present state of affairs, which is  about 200,000. If this stated intention is sincere, the problem  ceases to exist.    [Correspondent] According to the National Defense Ministry,  Poland has no strategic reserves in the case of war.    [Kolodziejczyk] The mobilization reserves are significantly  reduced. We are eating them away by virtue of the miserliness  of the budget.    [Correspondent] The Defense Ministry claims that the Polish  Army, in wishing to measure up to the armament levels of the  NATO states, will have to spend $2.5 billion [word indistinct]  up until the year 2010. The Defense Ministry feels that, during  this period, it is appropriate to exploit the favorable  international circumstances and prepare for eventual threats.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Apr (EFE) -- The ruling  Justicialist Party (Peronist) won in the elections held today to  choose 305 legislators tasked with reforming the Constitution,  according to private polls held "by word of mouth." The Great  Front [Frente Grande] center-left coalition won in the federal  capital and moved up to third place in Buenos Aires Province,  the country's most populated district.    It is reckoned that President Carlos Menem's Peronism won  between 43 and 45 percent of the votes in the country's 24  districts. The Great Front won between 35-36.5 percent of the  votes in the federal capital, followed by Peronism with 25.5  percent, and the Radical Civic Union (UCR) with 15 percent,  according to polls conducted by Buenos Aires television stations.    The voting results in the federal capital mean a hard defeat  for radicalism led by former Argentine President Raul Alfonsin.    Menem's Justicialist Party won 44.5 percent of the votes in  Buenos Aires Province, followed by the UCR with 15.2 percent of  the votes, the Great Front with 14.7 percent, and the right-wing  Movement for Dignity and Independence [MODIN] with 11.7 percent.</p>

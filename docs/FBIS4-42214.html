			<p>BFN     [Text] Canada has lifted all aid barriers to South Africa.  The decision follows a report from Canadian observers that said  last month's multiracial general election was fair and free. It  ended decades of white minority rule. The secretary of state  for Latin America and Africa, Christine Stewart, says this means  Ottawa can now lift the embargo on government-to-government aid.  Canada was a world leader in imposing sanctions against the  white minority government to end apartheid.</p>

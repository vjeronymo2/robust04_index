			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAKE AND DEMOCRACY  </P> <P> It would seem that Mayor O'Connor and most of the San Diego City Council do not  have the pulse of the people they purport to serve.  </P> <P> By a 7-2 vote they decided to keep the "Save Miramar Lake" referendum from  September's ballot. True, the development agreement with BCE has been  rescinded, but it still leaves no protection for the hills on the north side of  the lake. Even though over 47,000 voters signed the petition, they cannot vote  on the issue. Doesn't speak too well of our democratic way.  </P> <P> It would appear that the three members of "Gang of Five" up for reelection in  September have a fear of being "in bed" with the developers publicly if the  matter were put to a public vote.  </P> <P> A.J. BLOWER  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

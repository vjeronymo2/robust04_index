			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Book Review: Unequal to the global challenge PREPARING FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY By Paul Kennedy, Ramdon House, New York, Dollars 25 Forget hopes that the coming century will be an era of peaceful prosperity. A near doubling of the world's population over the next 50 years - to a mind-boggling 10bn people - threatens to overwhelm other more benign trends, such as the collapse of communism and the growth of an integrated, market-oriented global economy. The population explosion will degrade the world's environment, perhaps fatally, and confront fragile islands of privilege, such as Europe and the US, with a tidal wave of migrants from the dirty, impoverished and overcrowded third world. Paul Kennedy's sombre tone is somewhat surprising. The British-born Yale historian gained worldwide attention with his 1987 best-seller, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers. This argued that the US was losing its grip as the world's top nation and would eventually go the same way as Ming China, Philip II's Spain and Victorian Britain. But although Kennedy argued that a change in the pecking order of nations was inevitable, he gave no hint of a threat to global prosperity. The boring part of Kennedy's new book is a rather uninspired effort to update his earlier assessment of the economic and political outlook for the great powers. But he makes up for this with an ambitious attempt to analyse the deeper trends - demographic, environmental and technological - that underpin the fortunes of all nations. He claims to identify trends so bleak as 'to induce despair'. He wonders whether human social organisations may not now be simply 'unequal to the challenges posed by overpopulation, environmental damage, and technology-driven revolutions . . .' Historically, prophets of doom have a poor track record. At the end of the 18th century, Thomas Malthus, an English clergyman, published his famous essay on population predicting chronic famine and economic catastrophe. He was spectacularly wrong. As he was writing, the English industrial revolution - the greatest technological leap in human history - was gathering momentum. Britain's population increased fourfold during the 19th century - confirming Malthus's worst fears - but stunning gains in productivity led to a fourteenfold increase in national product. Instead of starving, Britain ended up richer than anybody had imagined possible. Kennedy believes the global economy is now poorly placed to cope with a similar Malthusian threat, albeit on an incomparably larger scale. The world's population, having increased from less than 1bn in Malthus's day to about 2bn in the 1930s and more than 5bn today, may nearly double again before stabilising late in the 21st century. For Kennedy, it is 'inconceivable that the world can sustain a population of 10bn people devouring resources at the rate enjoyed by the richer societies today - or even half that rate'. The problem is not just the changed scale of the population threat (the world is adding a quarter of a billion mouths every three years, rather than every 75 years), but also the alarming geographical mismatch between demographic pressures and technological resources. Britain defied Malthus's predictions because the population and technology explosions took place simultaneously in the same society. There was also the escape valve of migration: during the 19th century 20m people left Britain for underpopulated regions such as the US and the Antipodes. Today's demographic explosion is occurring exclusively in developing countries whereas the technological advances are taking place in rich, advanced countries where birth rates are falling. Poor countries thus lack access to the technologies that might save them. Short of a far more ambitious effort by industrialised countries to promote third-world development, Kennedy thus foresees a horribly unstable future. The already yawning gap in living standards between the advanced industrial democracies and developing nations is set to grow steadily wider. Environmental problems will intensify. And affluent nations, surrounded by a heaving mass of impoverished humanity, will face enormous pressures to relax immigration controls. Kennedy's book is thought-provoking but perhaps unnecessarily pessimistic. His 1987 analysis of the economic and political fortunes of the great powers was compelling because he was able to exploit his considerable historical expertise. In this new book, he has branched out into fields - such as the environment and technology - in which he is much less expert. He shows no sign, for example, of having digested the World Bank's recent work on sustainable development. The bank argues that rapid growth in the third world need not pose unmanageable environmental problems, provided countries adopt clean technologies and use price mechanisms to curb polluters. The bank may be wrong but Kennedy fails to show why. Kennedy's previous book, moreover, amply demonstrates the limitations of futurology. Like most observers, he failed to anticipate either the collapse of communism or the acceleration of moves towards economic and monetary union in western Europe. He also, as he tacitly concedes in his new book, exaggerated the relative economic decline of the US. Yet Kennedy deserves credit for tackling big and important issues. His book is an antidote to the excessive optimism of analysts who argue that the end of communism and revived faith in market forces must result in a brighter future. With most western politicians absorbed by relatively trivial domestic concerns, he is correct to identify unchecked population growth as the principal source of misery in the world and the greatest potential threat to global stability in the 21st century.</p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> TRASH RATE HIKED TO $9.45 PER MONTH  </P> <P> In response to higher fees at county landfill sites, the City Council this week  approved a $1.69 increase in monthly residential trash rates. The new rate of  $9.45 takes effect July 1.  </P> <P> "This is a major increase," said City Manager Darrell Essex, "but one  unfortunately brought on by landfills.".  </P> <P> Since January, 1989, landfill rates have been steadily on the rise. Gate fees  have risen from $6.12 a ton in 1989 to the current level of $17.75 a ton.  George Briggeman, who operates a disposal service for several cities including  Cypress, says costs for new landfills as well as operating existing landfills  have forced the increases.  </P> <P> Next month's increase probably won't be the last. Briggeman told the City  Council that county officials predict landfill rates may nearly double by 1995.  </P> <P> To counter the rate increases, several recycling proposals are currently being  studied, Essex said. Recycling would decrease the amount of trash going to the  landfills and thus reduce the costs, he said.LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

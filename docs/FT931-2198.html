			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Post-communist dilemmas for would-be activists IT IS ironic, as well as potentially disastrous, that the collapse of communism and the consequent pleas for western aid and trade arrived at just the time when western capitalism was slipping into one of its periodic bouts of recessionary angst. Russian President Boris Yeltsin might feel disappointed at the rather lukewarm support, financial or otherwise, that the west has been able to offer him over the past 18 months as his post-Soviet day of reckoning has approached. Warm words of support, he may reflect, are one of liberal capitalism's cheaper commodities. Yet the collapse of the Soviet planned economy has also made economic and political life very difficult for western governments with activist inclinations. The electoral failure of the French Socialists suggests that left-inclined governments must offer something more than monetarism laced with protectionist rhetoric. The challenge for US President Bill Clinton, elected to reverse a decade of 'trickle-down' economics, is to find a government activism which works. The US administration has chosen to emphasise the need to raise the low level of US investment in order to raise productivity and growth. Professors Bradford De Long and Lawrence Summers, previously economists at Harvard University and now key members of Mr Clinton's Treasury team, have exhaustively investigated the relationship between investment and economic growth. Their findings confirm that those countries which achieve a high level of equipment investment do tend to have higher rates of growth of output per head. The link exists, they argue, because the technical expertise of the workforce depends on the availability of capital on which to learn and gain experience. Hence equipment investment is much more important for growth purposes than investment in buildings and residential construction. They find that each extra percentage point in the equipment investment share of GDP raises growth by 0.3 percentage points compared to a mere 0.02 percentage points for other investments. But is the link causal? The correlation is certainly powerful - differing levels of equipment investment explain about three quarters of the variation in output growth among relatively high productivity countries and two fifths when developing countries are included - but does this imply that more investment means more growth or instead that fast growing economies tend to attract more investment? De Long and Summers' answer leads directly to their policy prescriptions. If the causal chain ran from growth to investment, then the higher demand for capital goods in fast-growing economies should mean higher prices for capital equipment relative to other goods. But fast-growing economies tend to have a lower relative price for capital equipment which in turn makes investment more profitable. Indeed, investing in Japan is attractive in part because the relative prices of equipment are 20 per cent less than in economies with comparable productivity as prices are so high in Japan's distorted service sector. Rather than artificially raising the prices of services, De Long and Summers prefer policies which reduce the relative price of new investment, perhaps a more permanent version of the Clinton temporary investment tax credit. But they oppose protectionist industrial policies which tend to raise the cost of investment and acknowledge that Japan's success can also be attributed to its high level of national savings. Raising US saving means either higher taxes or less government spending, thus clipping activists' wings. The Soviet experience of non-market investment promotion provides a further qualification. Post-war Soviet economic policymakers certainly succeeded in boosting the level of capital investment to much higher levels than the US achieved. But the effects on living standards were disastrous and politically difficult to reverse, a fact to which Mr Yeltsin can testify. Equipment Investment and Economic Growth: how strong is the nexus?

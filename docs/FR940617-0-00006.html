			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1546 of the FPPA, as enacted in 1981 (99 Stat. 1343&hyph;1344), required the Secretary of Agriculture to report to Congress on the progress made in implementing the FPPA. Only one report was required; and it was due within one year after the date of enactment, December 22, 1981. Section 1546 provided that the report should include information on: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The effects, if any, of federal programs, authorities, and administrative activities with respect to the protection of United States farmland; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The results of the reviews of existing policies and procedures required under section 1542(a) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As amended by section 1255 of the Food Security Act of 1985, section 1546 (7 U.S.C. 4207) now requires an annual report due at the beginning of each calendar year. The existing regulation, which was published prior to the amendment of section 1546, does not include any provisions for an annual report to Congress. Further, under the existing regulation, once agencies have completed their site assessments on the Farmland Conversion Impact Rating Form (Form AD&hyph;1006), they retain these forms and proceed to make their own decisions regarding the use of the site for the project in question. They do not make a regular practice of returning the form or a copy of it to SCS. Thus, SCS receives no record of the agency's use of the form or the agency's ultimate decision on the project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, the existing regulation does not require a federal agency to report regularly to the Department on the progress made with the review of current provisions of law, administrative rules and regulations, and policies and procedures applicable to the federal agency to determine whether any provision thereof will prevent such unit of the federal government from taking appropriate action to comply fully with the provisions of the FPPA. This review is required by section 1502(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4203(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Now that the Act requires an annual report that includes both the effects of federal activities on the protection of farmland and the reviews undertaken by agencies, it is necessary for the Department to modify its existing regulations. Accordingly, the proposed rule in 1987 included two amendments to the existing regulations to enable the Department to carry out its reporting obligations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first of these amendments would have added a new &sect;658.4(g) to request federal agencies to return a copy of their completed Form AD&hyph;1006 to SCS after a final decision on a project has been made. This amendment received support in comments from all nongovernmental organizations and individuals, from the State of Rhode Island Statewide Planning Program, and from the Clarke County (Virginia) Board of Supervisors. However, the response was different from federal and state agencies that work with Form AD&hyph;1006 and would be responsible for returning it to the SCS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two federal agencies, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Michigan Department of Transportation and that of Oklahoma expressed concern that this requirement would generate additional, burdensome paperwork. The FHWA suggested that only those forms in which the selected site had a score of more than 160 be returned to SCS. HUD proposed to advise SCS of any tracts of farmland for which financing of housing subdivisions was being approved, but said it would be hard-pressed to return a Form AD&hyph;1006 for each action taken by HUD, especially those involving individual mortgage insurance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Michigan Department of Transportation and that of Oklahoma made comments that were almost identical to one another. On federally supported highway projects requiring environmental assessments or impact statements, the Form AD&hyph;1006 is included in such documentation and SCS receives a copy of the final document. Lesser projects, on the other hand, do not require an environmental assessment or impact statement, because they are often categorically excluded from review by regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act. These projects ``usually require only minor amounts of right-of-way and thus have a very minimal impact on prime farmland,'' the Oklahoma Department of Transportation stated. Both Michigan and Oklahoma objected to having to submit Form AD&hyph;1006 on these types of projects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recognizes that this change in its regulation may increase the paperwork requirement on federal public works and other federally, assisted programs that are already burdened with reporting requirements. Congress, however, directed that each year the Department is to report on the effects federal programs and actions are having on farmland, and the Department believes that collecting the Form AD&hyph;1006 data generated by the affected federal agencies is the best way to compile this information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has made changes in the final rule to reduce reporting burdens. Under the current rule, SCS determines whether the site or sites in question are of the type of farmland subject to the FPPA. Even in cases where SCS determines the FPPA does not apply and SCS returns a Form AD&hyph;1006 to the referring agency, further tracking of agency decisionmaking is carried out with a report back to SCS on the final decision regarding the initial referral. New procedures set forth in &sect;658.4(g), give agencies the option of referring questions of FPPA applicability to SCS or of making these determinations themselves, and in cases where SCS makes a negative determination, there is no further tracking of matters in which none of the alternatives involve farmland subject to the FPPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

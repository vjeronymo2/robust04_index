			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Anglo American betters forecasts ANGLO American, South Africa's largest company, performed slightly better than market forecasts to record an 8 per cent fall in attributable earnings, to R1.53bn (Dollars 480m) for the 12 months to March. Last year's figure of R1.67bn was boosted by a R114m tax break. Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said he was pleased with the results given weak commodity prices and domestic recession. He said the results reiterated the value of the group's business and geographic diversity - a further indication that Anglo is not planning to follow the unbundling route taken by Gencor, South Africa's next largest mining house. The results were accompanied by news of six new projects in which Anglo is involved. These are the Moab, Namakwa Sands and Mantos Blancos mining projects, and the Columbus, Del Monte/Royal and High Energy Battery non-mining projects. 'We're a dynamic group with lots of exciting developments before us,' Mr Ogilvie Thompson said. Net income before tax fell 13.5 per cent to R2.12bn from R2.45bn. This reflected an 11.4 per cent decline in investment income, to R1.47bn from R1.65bn, a function of lower income from interests in diamond and platinum; a 4.5 per cent slide in trading income to R484m from R507m; a smaller surplus on the realisation of investments; and improved interest and fee income. With retained earnings of associated companies unchanged at R929m - a decline on the diamond side was offset by improvements from platinum, FNB and South American interests - equity-accounted earnings were 5.3 per cent lower at R2.46bn against R2.6bn. Excluding the tax benefit, the decline would have been 9.8 per cent. The dividend was maintained at 345 cents per share.</p>

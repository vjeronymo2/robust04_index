			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Admiral Fuzeta da Ponte, Armed Forces chief </F> of staff, by Jose Manuel Saraiva; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Saraiva] The EMGFA [Armed  Forces General Staff] is a very bureaucratic structure. What  will you do to make this body effective, open, and perhaps more  modern?    [Fuzeta] In the first place, I will have to concern myself  with a rigorous assessment of the degrees of readiness and  maintenance of the Armed Forces. Over the past few years we  have witnessed profound changes in the Armed Forces, ranging  from the initiation of new laws governing the body to the new  personnel recruitment and pay systems, with a view to the  greater effectiveness of the Armed Forces. The changes in the  EMGFA form part of a broader plan that I wish to implement and  whose aim is to assess the final outcome of those changes.    [Saraiva] Do you believe that the material and human  resources of the Armed Forces are sufficient to implement that  plan?    [Fuzeta] No military chief anywhere in the world deems the  available resources sufficient. In the first place, the needs  are always very great. We must acknowledge that a great deal  has been done in Portugal to improve the Armed Forces. This is  a fact that must be acknowledged, but we must also remember that  the recovery of the Armed Forces started from a very low  point....    [Saraiva] What do you mean by that?    [Fuzeta] I mean that our Armed Forces were already obsolete.  Their modernization depends on the level of investment, which  means that the greater the resources allocated to the Armed  Forces, the more rapidly they will be able to achieve their  aims. We are never satisfied.    [Saraiva] How do you explain young people's enormous lack of  motivation to serve the Armed Forces?    [Fuzeta] This is a very serious matter. Over the years, the  Portuguese people have always known how to defend the  fatherland. They have always found considerable motivation to  that end. Hence the motivation to serve the Armed Forces  depends to some extent on the perception of the threats  surrounding society at a given time. An individual immersed in a  society over which looms a threat of disruption of peace is more  motivated to serve the country than in the contrary situation.  Moreover, it is important that it be said that something has  been done to improve the motivation of the personnel serving in  the Armed Forces. For instance, for career professionals the  modernization of the new resources is a highly motivating  factor. Any Army professional likes to have his M-60's, any Air  Force man eagerly awaits the F-16's; naturally, any sailor is  pleased with the Vasco da Gama-class frigates. With respect to  the contract and volunteer personnel, in addition to these  aspects we are also motivating them through accelerated  vocational training, so that, after serving in the ranks, they  will be reintegrated into civilian life. However, it is in  education that the values that lead the Portuguese people to  love their fatherland are instilled, and it is imparted in the  schools and at home.    [Saraiva] With respect to the so-called performance of  military duties, which system do you prefer -- compulsory  military service or the volunteer and contract system?    [Fuzeta] The matter is eminently political. This is an  important debate that should be conducted in the proper forum.  Technically, there are Armed Forces that have opted for the  volunteer system -- for instance, Britain -- and others that  have chosen the compulsory system, such as France, and have not  lost effectiveness on that account. I mean by this that it is  possible to have effective Armed Forces both with the volunteer  system and with the conscript system. In any event, no system  is pure. All are hybrids. Right now, we have a roster of  volunteers, but in the event of a crisis or war, we would still  have to resort to general mobilization.    [Saraiva] You referred to vocational training aimed at the  contractees and volunteers. Does the setting up of these  institutes have any parallel in the armed forces of other  countries?    [Fuzeta] There are similar measures in several European  countries -- specifically, in France.    [Saraiva] But in Portugal this is a recent innovation whose  sole aim seems to be to attract less-qualified young people to  join up.    [Fuzeta] This is in the tradition of the great services to  the nation performed by the Armed Forces. For many years,  compulsory military service to some extent compensated for the  basic education that was not given in the schools. It is well  known that many young people from the poorest families who came  from the most disadvantaged regions found a basic education in  the forces, but now that tradition in the Armed Forces is  exercised in a more sophisticated way.    [Saraiva] But there are those actually within the Armed  Forces who say that the fighting military component could be  disadvantaged for the benefit of a vocational training for which  the forces are not, at first sight, designed?    [Fuzeta] On the contrary. We can only have fighting forces  in Portugal if they are very well trained. We must have small,  but good forces. There can be no good fighter without good  training. So the vocational training process helps modernize the  Armed Forces, and if that training can be projected outside, so  as to benefit those whom have performed military service, I can  see no harm in our civilianizing the training that we currently  give young people.    [Saraiva] What role should the Armed Forces have in the  prevailing international situation?    [Fuzeta] It is, of course, different from what it was five  years ago, owing to the reduction in intensity of the East-West  conflict. At that time, there was still a large number of  forces settled on various fronts and with little flexibility.  Today, the scene is completely different. In the current  multipolar system we are witnessing several regional conflicts  that require limited but well-trained and more flexible Armed  Forces. In Portugal we must transform the Armed Forces,  precisely so that we can use them strictly in Portugal's  interest on the international scene.    [Saraiva] Do you believe that Portugal should participate  more in international crises? For instance, during the Gulf  war, some military men argued that the Portuguese Armed Forces  should have taken part more actively in the conflict.    [Fuzeta] That is a political matter. It is the political  power that decides on involvement of the Armed Forces. However,  I will simply say that Portugal should act in the just defense  of its interests. [passage omitted]</p>

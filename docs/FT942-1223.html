			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Germany and UK press for free markets Germany yesterday joined forces with the UK to press the case for deregulation and flexible labour markets in the European Union. The UK-German alliance at the Corfu summit received measured suport from Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the new Italian prime minister. Mr Berlusconi called for less law-making from Brussels, though he told Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, at a breakfast meeting, that he did not support Britain's opt-out of the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. EU leaders - joined by their finance ministers - discussed the European economy in their afternoon session against the background of an incipient recovery but no sign of a halt to the rise in unemployment. Top items were the European Commission's White Paper on employment, growth and competitiveness, including progress on starting major infrastructure projects known trans-European networks, as well as a report on the 'new information society' in Europe. Leaders also discussed the Commission's recommendations on macro-economic guidelines, the framework for the 12 members of the Union to move toward a single European currency, to be joined by Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway if they enter the Union as planned next year. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, praised the macro-economic guidelines, which call for wage restraint, budgetary discipline, and structural reforms of the labour markets to create new jobs and lift burdens on small business. Mr Clarke supported Germany's request for the establishment of an independent group of businessmen and civil servants to examine whether EU and national legislation is imposing unnecessary red tape on companies. Separately, the UK Chancellor made a pitch for faster liberalisation of the European telecommunications industry. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the Commission, avoided a re-run of last December's clash with finance ministers over funding of the trans-European networks. He failed then in his bid to win support for greater European Commission borrowing to fund the multi-billion rail and road projects. However, Mr Delors called for a 'firm commitment' to start work on 19 'priority' infrastructure projects. These include 11 transport projects such the Channel tunnel link in the UK; a high-speed rail and road link through the Brenner pass linking Italy, Austria and Germany; and an eastern EU high-speed train between Paris and Strasbourg, plus a link joining Munich, Leipzig and Berlin. In addition, there are eight multi-billion Ecus energy projects including an underwater cable link between eastern and western Denmark; an underwater electricity cable between Italy and Greece; and a natural gas line between Spain and Portugal, with energy supplied from Algeria. Aides to Mr Delors said the Commission president was most anxious to start work on the trans-European networks. If the so-called 'financing gap' materialised, then the Commission would be in a strong position to lobby for extra borrowing powers. British officials called for an in-depth analysis of the 19 projects. There was no obvious shortage of capital for the networks, given the lead role of the European Investment Bank, private capital and the newly established European Investment Fund. 'If there are obstacles, they are of an administrative, legislative or planning nature,' said one UK official.</p>

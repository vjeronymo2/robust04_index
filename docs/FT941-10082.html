			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Anti-terror law referred to European court Britain's anti-terrorism legislation was yesterday referred by the Court of Appeal to the European Court of Justice. The court will be asked to rule whether the Prevention of Terrorism Act is incompatible with a 1964 European directive providing procedural guarantees for people expelled from EU states on grounds of public policy, public health or public security. The Home Office was last night playing down the significance of the move in the case of Mr John Gallagher, an Irishman excluded in September 1991 under the act by Mr Kenneth Baker, then home secretary. It said the questions referred to the Luxembourg court were 'fairly minor' and did not call into doubt the home secretary's power of exclusion. But Mr Stephen Grosz, Mr Gallagher's solicitor, said the case would be an important test of Britain's anti-terrorism laws. 'In a field where people have so few rights it is important to hold on to those rights that they have,' he said. Mr Gallagher, who was jailed for three years in the Irish Republic in 1983 for being in possession of two rifles for unlawful purposes, obtained a job in London in April 1990. After his exclusion he challenged the legality of the home secretary's order in the English courts on the basis that he had been denied details of the grounds on which the order was made and that the Home Office had refused to tell him the name of the person who advised the home secretary on his case. The appeal judges dismissed his case under domestic law but two ruled that the European Court should be asked to consider whether the Home Office breached the 1964 European directive which requires national authorities to take independent advice before expelling someone. Mr Grosz said the European judges would be asked how someone who has been excluded can be sure the home secretary has taken independent advice if the Home Office appoints the adviser and the excluded person is not told the adviser's name.</p>

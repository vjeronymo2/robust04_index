			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Sale Tilney's Pounds 6.8m disposal of food division Sale Tilney has disposed of certain businesses and assets of Sale Tilney Foods, which comprise Peabody Foods, its UK food division, to Stevens &amp; Brotherton. STF's dried pasta distribution business is excluded from the deal and the board will shortly determine the future of this profitable business  - in the 12 months to November 29 there was an operating profit of Pounds 200,000 on turnover of Pounds 1.4m. The aggregate net proceeds of the Peabody disposal and the collection of trade debts - after taking account of payment of trade creditors, all associated closure and transaction costs and the sale of residual assets - are estimated to be Pounds 6.8m. Proceeds will be applied against the borrowings of STF. The balance of STF's borrowings, amounting to some Pounds 15m, will be serviced by the remainder of the Sale Tilney group.</p>

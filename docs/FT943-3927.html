			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / This Week: FT Guide to Coal Privatisation After 47 years in the public sector, the British coal industry is being privatised. Why? The government says its sees privatisation as giving the industry the best chance of improving productivity and ensuring the largest economically viable coal industry which the market could support aim in the long term. Another (unstated) attraction is that privatisation would free ministers from direct involvement with an industry which frequently causes it political problems like the public outcry over pit closures two years ago. What do the unions think about it? Arthur Scargill, NUM president, and other union leaders have tried hard to thwart the government's privatisation plans but to little effect. Their moment seemed to come two years ago when the public backed their campaign to halt pre-privatisation pit closures. But the government retreated only temporarily and has since closed more mines than it announced even in October 1992. The NUM remains vehemently opposed to privatisation but the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, which broke away from it after the 1984-85 pits strike, is part of a consortium bidding for some British Coal's mining assets in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. What is for sale? The government is offering the 16 operating deep mines and 32 opencast sites in five 'core' regions, and seven mothballed pits as stand-alone entities. Non-mining assets, including Coal Products, the smokeless fuel manufacturer, and British Fuel Groups, fuel distributor, are being sold separately by British Coal. Of the core regions South Wales and Scotland are likely to attract the largest number of bids because of their access to high-quality coal near the surface. The other regions are the north-east of England, which is exclusively opencast, and central north and central south regions, where all but one of the 16 operating mines are located. How much is it all worth? The proceeds are small by comparison with other privatisations but could still raise more than Pounds 1bn. The non-mining subsidiaries alone make a combined operating profit of Pounds 40m a year on turnover of Pounds 700m and, according to some analysts, could be worth more than Pounds 500m. Of the core regions, the central north and central south regions are likely to attract the highest bids because of the value of contracts with electricity generators which last until 1998. David Price, editor of Coal UK, an FT newsletter, says the annual profits of the two regions could be more than Pounds 150m a year (although this will be decreased by whatever the successful bidder pays for the assets). What is the sale timetable? Bidders for the core regions and stand-alone pits must put in their tenders by 5pm on Wednesday. The government is likely to announce a preferred bidder for each region by the end of next month and hopes to complete the sales by December 24. Timetables for non-mining sales vary, although some deals will not be completed until next year. Who are the bidders for the core regions? Although there is nothing to stop a bidder putting in tenders for all five regions, British Coal seems certain to be split up. The government favours competition and, in any case, few bidders are contemplating an all-embracing bid. Of 25 'parties' which have applied successfully for the right to bid, only RTZ is an international coal company and it is unlikely to join the fray. Of the others, recently floated RJB Mining is among the few likely to bid for all five regions. Other companies considering bids for one or more regions, but not all five, include construction companies Taylor Woodrow, Miller Group, Amec and Wimpey. Exclusively mining companies include Ryan Group and Coal Investments. CI, run by Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial director, is likely to bid for the central north and south regions in a consortium with the UDM. Other bidders include three management buy-out teams, one of which hopes to win control of all three English regions. What will happen to jobs? Coal privatisation is unusual in that the industry has been rationalised before, rather than after, privatisation. The workforce 10 years ago was more than 220,000. By the end of this year it will be about 12,000. Some 40,000 jobs have gone in the last two years alone, as the government has cut the number of operating deep mine pits from 50 to 16. More job losses are inevitable after privatisation as the industry continues to improve efficiency. More deep mines could close too. Significant changes to working practices will occur as the new owners take advantage of a recent agreement to introduce flexible shifts. Will the industry survive? There will certainly be a coal mining industry in the next century but it may be rather smaller, and possibly much smaller, than now. The two large electricity generators in England and Wales will require 15m tonnes of coal a year (half their current purchases) just for the two coal-fired power stations to which they have fitted equipment to reduce sulphur emissions. The size of the total market will depend on factors including the price of gas, the other main generation fuel, and the progress of the nuclear industry's plans to build more nuclear power stations. But the price of world coal will be the biggest influence on size; if buyers can purchase supplies more cheaply from abroad than the UK there will be nothing to stop them from doing so.</p>

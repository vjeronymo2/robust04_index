			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / EC move on state aid angers France ANOTHER rift has opened between the European Commission's competition authorities and the French government, which has complained to the European Court of Justice about Brussels' attempts to glean more information on the financing of state-owned manufacturing companies. The Commission wants to receive annual reports on financing state-owned manufacturing companies to help it identify illegal government subsidies. The French complaint has surprised Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, who said last summer when the new reporting system was announced that he had already won round the more sceptical member states such as France and Italy. A French official said yesterday that Paris objected both to 'the form and the substance' of Sir Leon's initiative. He added that as far as he knew the government had not yet responded to Brussels' initial request for back-copies of the relevant companies' balance sheets and profit and loss accounts for 1989 and 1990. The system was introduced in the form of a Commission communication last October, which France believes should have been presented to member states for approval. The French government is also concerned that the change might discriminate against publicly-owned companies, which have to provide more information than private companies. The EC treaty says the Commission should leave the question of the best form of company ownership to member states. But Sir Leon argues that state and private companies can only be treated equally if a more systematic approach to the reporting of aid to state companies is introduced. Brussels competition officials are now concerned that the transparency of French government support for state-owned industry might be further muddied by plans to merge some of the country's most important state-controlled technology companies. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, has written to Mr Giulio Andreotti, the Italian prime minister, to urge him to accelerate the process of transforming EC single market legislation into Italian law. The Commission said it was not the first time Mr Delors had felt it necessary to chide Italy, which has been a notable laggard in enacting EC directives.</p>

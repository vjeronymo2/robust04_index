			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Schmidt Will Challenge Elections"] </F>   [Text] The Liberal Forum (LF) is to challenge the diet  elections held in Salzburg last Sunday [13 March]. This was  announced by Federal Spokeswoman Heide Schmidt at a press  conference in Vienna on Tuesday.    She justified this step by pointing out that the principle  of  proportional representation, which is set down in the  Constitution, has been violated. Schmidt thinks the fact that  in Salzburg about 10 percent of the votes in one constituency  are required for a basic mandate and thus for entering the diet  is a distortion of democracy. The LF will challenge the election  results in Salzburg and, demonstratively, also in the provinces  of Styria and Carinthia, where there are similarly high  thresholds.    In addition to contesting the elections in the  Constitutional  Court, the LF will also petition the Austrian Government to  challenge the election laws in those provinces where the  principle of proportional representation is violated. Schmidt  stressed that her party had already announced its intention to  challenge the elections before election day and would have done  so even if it had entered the Diet.    Regardless of this challenge, the LF also opposes the way in  which declarations of support must be presented for a party to  be permitted to run in elections.</p>

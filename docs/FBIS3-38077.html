			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1845 GMT on 25 February broadcasts  its "Man of the Week" program, which features an interview with  Vitaliy Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister and Boris  Yeltsin's special envoy for the settlement of the Yugoslav  crisis, by an unidentified correspondent. The program combines  an interview with Churkin with biographical facts and pictures  of Churkin at work.    In the introductory extract, Churkin says of the threatened  air strikes on Bosnia: "If it had happened, if air strikes had  been carried out, that would have been regarded inside Russia as  a national humiliation, and I thought this was simply  inadmissible."    Churkin is asked by the interviewer to describe his most  unpleasant impressions from his latest visit to Sarajevo. He  replies: "My most unpleasant impression was linked with the mass  media. Generally I associate myself with the most fervent  supporters of freedom of speech and a free press. But what I  saw there forced me to think a little more deeply about the  responsibility of journalists as well. This is because on 20  February, on Sunday, about 300 journalists arrived, all the  world's leading TV companies and others besides. Most of the  journalists who arrived were war specialists, and they had come  to film a war, to film air strikes. On the Sunday, when I gave  a news conference with Izetbegovic, when we addressed the media  after our meeting, the situation was extremely tense. The press  was demanding air strikes. And I must say that that frightened  me a little, not theoretically but simply practically, because  there were still some unclear points, and it was impossible to  completely rule out the worst at that time. The fact that their  mood was broadcast on TV screens to the whole world could in one  way or another have influenced the most serious political  decisions.    "I tried as best I could at the news conference in Sarajevo  to defuse the passions, and we do not really know for sure how  successful I was, but the next day the mood of the journalists  had changed a great deal. Not because of me of course, but  because the television journalists in particular had had to  spend the whole night on the roof waiting for air strikes, even  though it was already clear to everyone by about 2100 the  previous evening that everything was all right and that there  would be no air strikes.    "So you see, there are complex and ambiguous aspects in your  profession as well."    Churkin admits that during his talks with the Serbs, the  situation seemed "almost hopeless." "However, it must also be  said that I was holding a great trump-card -- the letter from  the president containing both a request to the Serbs to withdraw  heavy weapons from Sarajevo and our pledge to then send our  troops to the Sarajevo region. If I had not succeeded, holding  such a trump-card, in having such a brilliant proposal accepted  by the other party at the talks, that would of course have been  a colossal blow for me as a professional. So it was indeed a  fairly tense moment."    Churkin says he did regard the operation as a personal  success, but adds emphatically that it was "a huge success for  the Foreign Ministry, in which the collective working on this  situation performed outstandingly well." He praises in  particular the contribution made by Deputy Foreign minister  Sergey Lavrov. "Everyone joined in and managed, in an extreme  situation and in a short period of time, to carry out a complex  diplomatic operation."    Asked how he explains his rapid rise to the post of deputy  foreign minister at the age of 42, Churkin says he has always  studied hard and he has always said what he thinks. He  describes himself as "democratically oriented," but adds that he  has never felt the need to participate in political movements.    Asked about his special strengths and weaknesses as a  diplomat, he says he is able to communicate with the most  diverse people, but that he regrets not having learned French  well.    The program ends with more general questions about Churkin's  likes and dislikes and words of praise for Churkin from the  correspondent.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Observer: Biter bit Having lost a packet on President Reagan's memoirs, top US publisher Simon and Schuster has been giggling all the way to the bank over the killing made by Kitty Kelley's unauthorised biography of Nancy Reagan. Now, however, the publishing arm of the Paramount entertainment conglomerate is apparently being made to laugh on the other side of its face by an embarrassing hoax. It is reported to have paid Dollars 920,000 for a book about a serial murderer by an unknown writer. The decision to outbid the rest of the competition for Just Killing Time was taken after glowing testimonials from John Le Carre and Joseph Wambaugh. The problem is that neither of those famous authors knows anything about the book. Could someone in the US department of dirty tricks be settling a few old scores?</p>

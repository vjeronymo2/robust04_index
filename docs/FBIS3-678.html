Molusi] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg March 11 SAPA -- The Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] has set a Friday [11 March] midnight  deadline for political parties registered to participate in the  elections to submit their candidates lists. "The name of any  party which has applied for registration but has not lodged a  candidates list by that time (midnight) will simply have to be  deleted from the ballot paper," an IEC statement said.    The IEC ultimatum will affect the Inkatha Freedom Party and  Gen Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front which registered  provisionally but have yet to submit candidates lists. The two  parties said their participation in the elections depended on  the outcome of proposed international mediation to resolve  constitutional problems, as agreed by African National Congress  President Nelson Mandela and IFP leader Chief Mangosuthu  Buthelezi.    Gen Viljoen said on Thursday all negotiations should be  terminated until the crisis in Bophuthatswana had been resolved.</p>

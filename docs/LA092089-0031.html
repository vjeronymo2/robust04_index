			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TOY BEAR RECALLED FOR CHOKING HAZARD  </P> <P> The Consumer Product Safety Commission on Tuesday recalled one member of the  "Kensington Bear" toy family because buttons may detach from clothes the bear  wears and choke small children.  </P> <P> The commission said the recalled model is number S7417. The brown, 14-inch  stuffed bear is clad in a maroon print dress trimmed with pink and blue ribbons  at the hem and three heart-shaped buttons sewn on the front. The bear's outfit  also includes white lace bloomers and a straw hat with a pink bow.  </P> <P> The panel said the buttons "may pose a potential choking hazard for children  under age 3" who might loosen and pull the buttons off the dress and swallow  them.  </P></p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Israel calls for summit with Assad ISRAEL said yesterday a meeting between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, its prime minister, and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad was essential if peace talks between the two countries were to be successful. Although it has so far been rejected by Damascus, Israeli ministers made clear their insistence on the proposal following a cabinet review of the latest round of Middle East peace talks which ended in Washington last week. 'This meeting is necessary, essential. Without it we will not be able to break through the psychological and practical barriers that prevent fast progress,' said Mr Haim Ramon, health minister. During the month-long talks, due to resume on October 21, slow but unspectacular progress was reported in the four sets of bilateral negotiations between Israel officials and delegations from Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians. The cabinet also rejected Syria's insistence that any agreement with Israel must be linked to agreements with the other Arab parties to achieve a 'comprehensive' settlement. The Palestinians have voiced concerns that Syria and Israel might achieve a separate accord, leaving the fate of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip unresolved. But Mr Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, said he had been assured by Mr Assad that Syria would not alter its commitment to a comprehensive peace accord.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Siemens keeps up rail contract fight SIEMENS, the German electrical and engineering group, is to continue fighting for a Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.55bn) high-speed rail contract in South Korea recently awarded to GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, writes Christopher Parkes. 'I have not given the contract up as lost,' Mr Heinrich von Pierer, group chairman, said on Thursday night. He had written twice to the Korean government claiming that Siemens' bid was not properly assessed. Mr von Pierer said he had considered carefully before registering his protest and such moves were not unusual in international business. He had asked for publication of the tender evaluation criteria, he said.</p>

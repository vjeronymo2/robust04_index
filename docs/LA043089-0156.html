			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DELICATE GIANTS;  </P> <P> WARMING TREND ADDS URGENCY TO STUDY OF ANCIENT SEQUOIAS  </P> <P> Thriving in pockets on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada, California's  giant sequoias have bucked the odds for millions of years, surviving raging  fires, glacial ice and the violent upheavals that create mountain ranges.  </P> <P> The good news is that, despite their tumultuous history, the Sequoia groves are  in good shape and growing vigorously.  </P> <P> But now the trees are facing a new peril, a relatively sudden global warming  that may occur as a result of the greenhouse effect.  </P> <P> Scientists are discovering that the sequoias are sensitive to subtle  temperature variations associated with global climate changes. To survive, as  they have in the past, the trees must have time to adjust, the experts report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sense of Urgency  </P> <P> These new findings have added a sense of urgency to a study of sequoias under  way here and in Yosemite. By analyzing tree growth rings, sediments cored from  nearby meadows and the mummified droppings of pack rats that lived in caves  along the Kings River 35,000 years ago, the experts hope to learn more about  how the trees have lived so long and what it will take to ensure their  continued existence.  </P> <P> The Sequoiadendron giganteum is one of the oldest and largest living things on  the planet. The prime specimen is the 2,700-year-old General Sherman Tree,  standing nearly 275 feet tall, with a base diameter of 36 feet and a trunk  weight of 1,385 tons.  </P> <P> Fossil evidence of these giants has been found in Colorado, Wyoming and Nevada,  indicating that the great forests existed there before the tectonic upthrust of  the Sierra 6 million years ago. The towering Sierra blocked the flow of Pacific  storms over the Great Basin, drying out the land, dooming the sequoias east of  the mountains.  </P> <P> Today thousands of these trees are clustered in 75 groves on the pine-forested  western Sierra slopes. The northernmost groves are in federal forests near Lake  Tahoe, and they range south 250 miles to the Tule River drainage in Tulare  County. Nearly half of the trees are in national parks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bypassed Groves  </P> <P> One riddle researchers are trying to solve is how the trees survived the Ice  Age that ended 10,000 years ago. Originally, they theorized that perhaps the  glaciers somehow had bypassed the groves.  </P> <P> Recently, however, scientists were surprised to discover that the present-day  groves date back only about 5,000 years. That meant that the groves surviving  today did not come into existence until 5,000 years after the glaciers had  melted away.  </P> <P> New research, although far from conclusive, suggests that the groves survived  by moving as the climate changed. Each new generation took root in a slow-step  march up or down the mountains, seeking suitable climate, adequate soil  moisture and nutrients.  </P> <P> As the glaciers advanced, the sequoias moved to lower elevations, and after the  ice flows melted, the groves moved to their current locations.  </P> <P> The discovery that the trees may, in fact, move in response to global  temperature changes was made by paleo-ecologist Scott Anderson, director of  Northern Arizona University's pollen laboratory in Flagstaff. Anderson studies  the pollen found trapped in sediments in Log Meadow in Giant Forest to find out  what kind of plants have lived in this part of the park since the glaciers  melted.  </P> <P> By coring 30 feet into the sediments, Anderson discovered that until 4,500  years ago, the dominant plants were pines, huckleberry and chinquapin bushes --  vegetation typical of a dry, open forest, a place without enough moisture to  support sequoia growth.  </P> <P> "There was virtually no sequoia pollen in Log Meadow 6,000 years ago," Anderson  said.  </P> <P> From that time forward, evidence of the big trees began to accumulate in the  sediments, indicating that the Giant Forest grove grew rapidly, expanding until  it began to dominate the landscape. Meadow grasses and other plants requiring  plenty of moisture also began to flourish, Anderson found.  </P> <P> The evidence suggests that immediately after the last glacial period, the area  was warm and dry. This bit of information coincides with a known warming period  that lasted several thousand years because Earth's solar orbit and the tilt of  its axis put the Northern Hemisphere closer to the sun.  </P> <P> During this time, summer temperatures rose enough to dry out the soils. When  cooler, wetter climate returned, the soil moisture increased and meadow-like  conditions made the area ideal for sequoia growth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Provide Clue  </P> <P> All this may provide some clue as to how the sequoias may react to the kind of  rapid global warming many scientists expect as a result of the greenhouse  effect.  </P> <P> "The altithermal (warm, dry period) is the best analog of what might happen if  the greenhouse effect does occur," Anderson said.  </P> <P> If temperatures do go up several degrees, as predicted, he said, "we would  expect the type of vegetation that had grown in Log Meadow 6,000 to 10,000  years ago . . . but no sequoias."  </P> <P> The question then becomes what would happen to the sequoias. The supposition  now is that the groves have survived climate changes by slowly moving and  adapting to new locations, a natural process that requires thousands of years,  park scientist Dave Parsons said.  </P> <P> The latest information suggests that the sequoias move long distances in their  struggle to survive. The evidence has come from an odd source: ancient pack rat  nests found in limestone caves in a rugged, low-elevation canyon along the  Kings River.  </P> <P> No sequoias grow in this hot, dry canyon now, but contents of the pack rat  middens strongly suggest that the trees once grew here, according to  ranger-scientist Ken Cole. The rats use the same nests, generation after  generation, accumulating twigs, rocks, bones, nesting materials and anything  else they find and can carry back to the den. The rat's urine mummifies these  droppings, preserving them for eons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pack Rats  </P> <P> Cole found several pack rat middens in the caves in Kings Canyon National Park,  just north of Sequoia Park. In these ancient nests, there were mummified pieces  of sequoia twigs and pollen, evidence that thousands of years ago the trees  were growing close by, at elevations as low as 3,000 feet. The closest sequoias  today are miles away, at much higher elevations.  </P> <P> Carbon dating revealed Cole's findings were 18,000 to 35,000 years old. That  meant the trees were here during the coldest part of the last glacial period.  </P> <P> This, according to Cole, is the first direct evidence that the sequoias grew at  these lower elevations during the Ice Age. The supposition is that as the globe  warmed and the glaciers melted, the trees marched back up the steep mountains  to their present location at around 7,000 feet elevation.  </P> <P> Whether the sequoias can out-maneuver the kind of rapid global warming  scientists now are predicting as a result of the greenhouse effect is open to  question.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Release Gases  </P> <P> Nature's slow-moving atmospheric clock has being speeded up by the impact of  modern technology. As autos and industrial plants release more carbon monoxide  and other gases into the air, more heat is trapped inside the atmospheric  greenhouse. Some experts predict that temperatures could rise two to nine  degrees over the next century.  </P> <P> There is general scientific agreement that this global warming will occur at a  rate 10 to 100 times faster than ever before, according to Stephen H. Schneider  of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.  </P> <P> In addition to temperature changes, scientists also are studying how sequoias  react to fire and drought.  </P> <P> It was not until the late 1960s that national park officials realized that fire  was an essential ingredient in the sequoia ecosystem. By suppressing fires for  a century, rangers had literally disrupted the sequoia's reproductive cycle. No  new sequoias were sprouting.  </P> <P> Now rangers systematically torch off small sections of the groves in control  burns designed to return fire to its natural place in the ecosystem.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fewer Seedlings  </P> <P> They set the blazes without fully understanding the role of fire, Ranger Bill  Tweed explained. The new studies are showing that the hottest fires seemed to  be followed by rapid regeneration of sequoias, while cooler, more deliberate  burns produced fewer seedlings and a lower survival rate. The reason why is not  known.  </P> <P> To learn more, scientists from the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree  Ring Research were given a $60,000-a-year contract to study fire and climate in  the groves. The work is being directed by Tom Swetnam, one of the country's top  tree-ring specialists.  </P> <P> Armed with a chain-saw and an old truck, Swetnam has spent the last two summers  prowling the Sierra, collecting cross-sections from sequoia stumps and downed  trees, carting tons of wood back to the university's lab in Tucson for  analysis. From the annual growth rings, Swetnam's staff can tell a tree's age,  determine when it sprouted and plot it's year-by-year growth.  </P> <P> In good years, when there's plenty of moisture, the rings are wide apart and  full of growth, in drought years there is less growth and the rings compressed  tightly together, like lines on a topographical map. Two- and three-year  periods of drought are not uncommon, the most recent occurring in the mid-1970s  and again between 1959 and 1961, Swetnam said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Big Fire  </P> <P> In the years immediately after a big fire that scars a tree, abnormal ring  growth patterns swirl like storm clouds around the wound, showing how the tree  tries to heal itself. Many of the big trees have huge fire scars. Some have  been hollowed by fire and blasted by lightning, but still they have survived.  </P> <P> One cross-section shows a tree had gone through 32 fires between AD 519 and AD  1297. In the AD 1100-1200 period, the sequoias document a long period of  drought that gripped much of the West. During wetter times, there were fewer  fires, but the burns were hotter and more widespread, burning off entire stands  of smaller pine and fir.  </P> <P> "There was one huge fire in 1297 AD in Mountain Home (State Forest) . . . that  seems to have killed off all of the understory (smaller pine trees)," Swetnam  reported. "During the next few years, there was a tremendous growth release in  the sequoias."  </P> <P> Without the competing smaller trees, the growth rate among the sequoias  tripled, and new stands sprouted in the burn scar.  </P></p>

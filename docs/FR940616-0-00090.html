			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As noted in section II of this preamble, HUD has revised the definition of ``individuals with disabilities'' in the final rule to clarify that persons with the human immunodeficiency virus disease (symptomatic or asymptomatic) are covered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Direct Threat Standard Excludes Reasonable Accommodation Requirement. One commenter stated that the ``direct threat to the health or safety of others'' exclusion derives from the case of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  107 S.Ct. 1123 (1987), but fails to include the essential caveat that ``the direct threat not be capable of elimination by reasonable accommodation''. The commenter stated that the Congress, in its discussion of this direct threat exclusion in the legislative history of the Fair Housing Act, was careful to note the reasonable accommodation requirement. The commenter requested that the reasonable accommodation requirement be explicitly acknowledged in the part 9 final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed in section II of this preamble, the Department has added a new &sect;9.131 to address the issue of ``direct threat to the health or safety of others.'' This new section provides that the agency must determine whether reasonable modifications of its policies, practices or procedures will mitigate the risk posed by the individual determined to present a direct threat to the health or safety of others. Although the commenter uses the term ``reasonable accommodation,'' which is the appropriate term within the context of the Fair Housing Act, the appropriate comparable term for section 504, generally, is ``reasonable modification,'' which reflects section 504's application to a broader range of programs and activities. However, reference to reasonable accommodation is appropriate when discussing section 504's application to the employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Delete Reference to ``Inability to Perform the Essential Elements of Job or Activity.'' One commenter stated that the exclusion from the definition of ``individuals with disabilities'' of the following phrase_``persons with a contagious disease who are unable to perform the duties of the job''_was unwarranted. The commenter stated that inquiries as to whether an individual with disabilities is able to perform the duties of a job or activity are relevant only with respect to whether the individual is ``qualified''_and then only if the individual is unable to perform the essential duties, not all duties, of the job or activity. The commenter stated that reasonable accommodation must be provided, if necessary, to assist the individual in performing the essential duties. The commenter further stated: ``Because this subsection involves the definition of `individual with disabilities,' rather than `qualified individual with disabilities,' the reference to inability to perform the duties of job should be deleted.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department agrees with the commenter's statement that without reference to the essential duties and reasonable accommodation aspects of the analysis, this particular provision of the definition is misleading. Accordingly, the Department has revised paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of the definition of ``individuals with disabilities'' to include the following language: ``An individual *&blank;*&blank;* is unable to perform the essential duties of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Definition of ``Multifamily Housing Project'' (&sect;9.103)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Multifamily Dwellings Covered by Section 504 Should Be the Same as Those Covered by the Fair Housing Act. Three commenters noted that the part 9 rule defined ``multifamily housing project'' to mean ``a project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing five or more dwelling units,'' while the Fair Housing regulations define covered multifamily dwellings to mean buildings consisting of four or more dwelling units, if such buildings have one or more elevators, and ground floor units in other buildings consisting of four or more units. The commenters stated that the dwellings covered by the section 504 regulations should mirror those of the Fair Housing Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The definition of ``covered multifamily dwelling'' found in the Fair Housing Act regulations is consistent with the definition of this term in the Fair Housing Act. The definition of ``multifamily housing project'' in the part 9 rule is consistent with the definition of this term in section 207(c) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1713), and is the definition with which HUD program participants are familiar. The definition is also consistent with HUD's section 504 regulations for federally assisted activities. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  24 CFR 8.3) Since section 504 extends only to federally assisted and federally conducted programs and activities, the Department believes that the definition of multifamily housing project, as set forth in the National Housing Act, which pertains to Federal housing programs, is the appropriate definition for HUD's section 504 regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  All HUD Housing Should Be Covered by Section 504, Including Single Family Homes. One commenter stated that the occupancy classification provision of the UFAS defines multifamily housing as apartment buildings, without reference to a number of units, and the residential section of the UFAS occupancy classification refers to one and two family dwellings. The commenter stated that the inclusion of the classification of one and two family dwellings in the UFAS indicates that these dwellings are also subject to the Barriers Act. The commenter requested that HUD make all of its housing, including single family homes, subject to the requirements of the Barriers Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The fact that the UFAS contains provisions applicable to one or two family dwellings is not determinative of whether one or two family dwellings are subject to the requirements of the Barriers Act. Whether one or two family dwellings are covered by the Barriers Act depends upon whether a statute subjects these types of dwellings to the requirements of Barriers Act. One or two family dwellings are subject to the requirements of section 504, and possibly the UFAS, to the extent that they are part of a HUD conducted program and meet the requirements of 24 CFR 9.150(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

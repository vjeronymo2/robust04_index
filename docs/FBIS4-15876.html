			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Karlov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 8 Apr -- Accidents are possible at any  nuclear power station. Not for technical reasons, either,  although the state of many stations does indeed give rise to  anxiety among specialists, the ITAR-TASS correspondent learned  today from Valeriy Sorokin, head of the Main Administration for  Radiation Catastrophes (formerly Roskomchernobyl) of the Russian  Ministry for Civil Defense, Emergencies, and Natural Disasters.    There are a number of reasons for potential accidents, the  specialist believes. Equipment works as well as the people who  operate it. At present the professional level of nuclear power  station staff has fallen sharply. Previously, many  highly-qualified nuclear workers wanted to work at stations  because of the financial and social privileges -- these have not  been in evidence for the last three or four years. Top class  nuclear power workers are leaving for commercial organizations.  It is frightening when nuclear power station workers go on  strike because for several months they have not been paid their  wages, averaging about 100,000 rubles. Many left under pressure  of public opinion when Chernobyl started to be linked with  nuclear power workers. Some believed nuclear stations should be  eliminated.    Sorokin is of the view that there is a lack of due  supervision at stations. Gosatomnadzor [State Committee for  Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety] -- which grew from  the former Ministry of Medium Machine-Building -- essentially  runs itself. At all nuclear power stations practically all its  representatives are former staff of the stations themselves and  are to a great degree dependent upon the management there.    Things are hard for Russia today. But it must choose the  priority areas of life and the problems that must be solved  first of all.</p>

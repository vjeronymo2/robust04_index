			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SENTENCING FOR 2 MURDERERS POSTPONED  </P> <P> Sentencing for Cynthia Lynn Coffman and James Gregory Marlow, who received jury  death verdicts for the murder of a young Redlands woman, has been postponed  until Aug. 30 at the request of Coffman's attorneys.  </P> <P> Coffman and Marlow are scheduled to be brought to Orange County from San  Bernardino after sentencing to stand trial in the murder of a young Huntington  Beach woman who was killed Nov. 12, 1986, just five days after the Redlands  victim.  </P> <P> Coffman attorney Donald W. Jordan Jr. told San Bernardino County Superior Court  Judge Don Turner on Thursday that he has not been able to complete a motion for  a new trial that he has been preparing.  </P> <P> Marlow's attorneys said their client is ready for sentencing but agreed to the  postponement.  </P> <P> Turner reminded the attorneys that they had assured him a month ago when he  agreed to a similar postponement that they would be ready. But the judge agreed  to the six-day continuance, warning them that it would be the last one he would  tolerate.  </P> <P> Coffman, 26, and Marlow, 32, were convicted by a San Bernardino County jury in  the murder of insurance clerk Corinna Novis, 20, who was kidnaped outside  Redlands Mall and later strangled and dumped in a field near Fontana.  </P> <P> If Turner confirms the jury's death verdict, which is usually a formality,  Coffman would become the first woman sentenced to death in California since  capital punishment was reinstated 12 years ago.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIDELITY CHAIRMAN QUITS HAMMOND BOARD  </P> <P> The chairman of Fidelity National Financial Inc. resigned Tuesday from the  board of the Hammond Co. in an attempt to ease tensions that have sprung from  Fidelity's interest in a possible buyout.  </P> <P> William P. Foley II, chairman of the Irvine title insurance company, resigned  mainly because Fidelity was making no headway in its limited talks with Thomas  T. Hammond, chairman and president of the mortgage banking firm, according to  Frank P. Willey, Fidelity's executive vice president and general counsel.  </P> <P> Foley had earned a seat on Hammond's board in July after Fidelity bought 16.3%  of the firm. Fidelity has since acquired a 23.6% stake in Hammond and said in a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in late September that it  would be interested in acquiring Hammond on a friendly basis.  </P> <P> On Nov. 8, Fidelity agreed not to purchase any more shares of Hammond for six  months. In return, Hammond was to provide business and financial information to  Fidelity so that it could decide whether to make a formal offer for Hammond.  </P> <P> Willey said the two firms had "very preliminary" talks during the summer about  doing business together by steering customers to each other and had talked a  little more in recent months about a possible purchase price for the rest of  the Hammond Co.  </P> <P> "Based on what they would like to receive for the stock on a friendly basis,  the price is more than we're willing to pay," Willey said. No offer ever was  made during the limited talks, he said.  </P> <P> "We're comfortable with where we are now," Willey said. "It's not our intent to  aggravate Tom or give him any concern over operations of Hammond Co. We'll  weigh the alternatives at the end of six months and decide what to do then."  </P></p>

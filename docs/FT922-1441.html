			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / UN funds for Cambodia top expectations THE United Nations Development Programme yesterday raised pledges worth Dollars 880m (Pounds 476m) for the reconstruction of Cambodia, far exceeding expectations of Dollars 600m, at a Tokyo conference attended by 33 nations, the European Community and 12 international organisations. The success of the conference at raising funds, however, was overshadowed by continuing doubt about the future of the UN peace process in Cambodia, where the communist Khmer Rouge has refused to comply with the crucial second phase of a programme calling for disarming and demobilising troops on the ground. The Khmer Rouge appeared isolated at the conference and was repeatedly criticised for obstructing implementation of the Paris Agreements, aimed at bringing peace to the country and which it signed last year. A meeting was under way late last night between the factions to the Cambodian conflict, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and representatives of France and Indonesia, which chaired the Paris meeting. Mr Georges Kiejman, the junior French foreign affairs minister, said the meeting was aimed at convincing the Khmer Rouge there was no alternative to the peace plan. An immediate formal reply from the Khmer Rouge was, however, not expected. It has refused to comply with the terms of the peace accord because it says Vietnamese troops remain in the country. This was denied yesterday by Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac). The Khmer Rouge has also objected to the disbursement of some funds for essential services through the existing Phnom Penh government, on the grounds that this will strengthen the government in elections scheduled for next year. Mr Akashi said, however, that spending would be strictly controlled by Untac. Delegates appeared determined to push the peace process through even if the Khmer Rouge continued to obstruct the agreement. Mr Lawrence Eagleberger, the US deputy secretary of state, told the conference: 'The peace process can go forward in their absence.' The US threat was to halt disburse money to Khmer Rouge-controlled areas. The way that money is spent has become a highly political issue because of its possible impact on the voting in elections scheduled for next spring. The UN is aiming to repatriate 370,000 refugees before the election, and how they are settled could strongly influence the voting. Japan was the biggest contributor, pledging between Dollars 150m and Dollars 200m, although some of this money had been previously pledged. The US was second largest contributor with Dollars 135m, with France providing Dollars 57m, the EC Dollars 40.2m, and Britain Dollars 30m.</p>

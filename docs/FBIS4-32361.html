			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 22 Jun (MTI) -- Having provided  scientific and methodological help to support the environmental  rehabilitation of former Soviet military facilities in  East-Central Europe, NATO now wants to set up a reference  military base in order take the process one step further.    According to preliminary plans, the base would be built on  the military facility near the town of Komarom (N. Hungary),  which Soviet troops used for nearly half a century. The new  base will provide scientific training for experts, and display  various methods for environmental protection.    The plan was disclosed in Komarom on Wednesday [22 June],  when NATO members from the division of science and environmental  protection, who are currently holding talks in Hungary, visited  the heavily polluted facility. Construction will be carried out  by NATO's environmental protection section and the joint  research centre of the Budapest Technical University and the  State University of Florida.</p>

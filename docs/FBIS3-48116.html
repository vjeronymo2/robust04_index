U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen turned up the heat in a visit to Tokyo, vowing that the  United States may "reexamine" the stalled bilateral trade  "framework" talks if no agreement is reached before a Japan-U.S.  summit on February 11 in Washington.    Hosokawa told Bentsen that "if the time comes for a  political  decision, I hope to apply leadership, making efforts to improve"  the outcome of the talks, according to a Japanese official who  attended the half-hour talks at the prime minister's official  residence.    Bentsen told reporters that Washington "will not settle for  any cosmetic agreement" on trade and that "if we do not have  credible agreements by the time of the summit, we would have to  reexamine the basis of the framework."    "We would far prefer no agreements to weak agreements," he  said. Bentsen said his remarks were not meant as a threat but  were "just the logical consequence," reflecting "the realities  of the situation."    Hosokawa told Bentsen he hopes for "satisfactory results" to  the talks, noting subcabinet-level meetings begin this coming  week to discuss the matter "more deeply," according to Takatoshi  Kato, head of the Finance Ministry's international finance  bureau.    Both sides remain far apart in the talks, which seek to  expand access to the Japanese market in such areas as insurance,  government procurement and automobiles and auto parts.    Japan blasts as "managed trade" U.S. efforts to set  standards  such as market shares to mark progress. But U.S. officials have  accused Japanese negotiators of foot-dragging and called for  political leaders to go over the bureaucrats' heads.    Bentsen reiterated at a press conference that "we have to  have indicators to show if we're making progress or not in  opening markets."    Bentsen said President Bill Clinton asked him to add the  hastily arranged trade talks with Hosokawa and an earlier  hour-long session with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to the  end of a lengthy trip to Russia and Asia.    Both sides also said Japan reaffirmed its commitment to take  steps to spur its slumping economy.    "We said very strongly that we want a major stimulus package  and that it be a sustained one," Bentsen told reporters, adding  that a short-term stimulus, such as an income tax cut offset  with a quick hike in the consumption tax, is "not effective."    Fujii vowed "serious and vigorous efforts" to launch "a new  economic stimulus package, including tax cuts," and said a forum  of the government and ruling coalition parties will continue  seeking an "acceptable decision" on tax issues, according to the  ministry's Kato.    Fujii told reporters that he asked Bentsen to "please trust  us" to try to boost the economy in the wake of the upper house's  rejection Friday of the government-proposed political reform  package. But Japanese officials said that Bentsen and the  Japanese leaders did not discuss details of a tax cut or other  measures.    Hosokawa sought support for his attempt to "pin efforts on  political reform bills over the next week" because they are  supported by the public and that the passage would have  "favorable economic effects," Kato said, adding that Bentsen  made "no specific requests."    Bentsen told reporters he appreciated that Japanese leaders  are "pushing" to craft stimulus measures and reach a trade  agreement. "They said they're ready to go ahead," despite the  current political turmoil, he said.    He declined to comment on the "local political situation,"  except to say that Hosokawa "has his work before him."    Bentsen also refused to discuss the foreign exchange market  abroad, where the dollar temporarily sank Friday to a one-month  low in the 109 yen range before rebounding. Currency dealers  said the failure of the reform bills throws the stimulus package  in doubt and increases chances that Washington will revert to  high-yen pressure to cut Japan's trade surplus.    Hosokawa remains committed to the February 11 meeting in  Washington with Clinton, both sides said.</p>

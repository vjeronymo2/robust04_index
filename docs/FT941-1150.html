			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Portmeirion 14% ahead to Pounds 4.18m Portmeirion Potteries, the pottery maker, achieved a record Pounds 4.18m in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31, a 14 per cent rise on the Pounds 3.67m for 1992. Turnover improved by 9.6 per cent to Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 22.5m) with sales in the UK 17.2 per cent ahead and in continental Europe 21.4 per cent better. Production difficulties in the glazing department of the Stoke factory, however, led to low stocks in the US and sales there grew by just 2.7 per cent. Operating profits on continuing activities improved to Pounds 4.12m (Pounds 3.7m) and the pre-tax result was after a Pounds 109,000 (Pounds 189,000) contribution from associates and reduced net interest charges of Pounds 54,000 (Pounds 224,000). Earnings per share emerged at 28.42p (22.67p) and the dividend is lifted to 9p (7.75p) with a proposed final 6.75p (5.5p). Mr George Hesp, managing director, said 1994 had started well, with orders being taken for the group's new china, marketed in five patterns, which would be in the shops in May.</p>

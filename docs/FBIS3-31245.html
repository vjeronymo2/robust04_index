			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item; commentary by Vladimir Resetar] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, Feb 15 (TANJUG) -- The published  transcript of the phone-in programme broadcast by the  Sarajevo-based Moslem radio station Hayat on February 5, after  the massacre at the Markale open air market, a programme whose  horrendous message was -- all Serbs should immediately be  killed, has found no room in reports carried by leading foreign  news agencies.    News agencies failed to react not because they doubted the  authenticity of the Moslem calls for Serbs to be lynched but  because of their view of the reality in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a  view shaped by the political leaderships of the countries in  which the agencies' headquarters are based.    It is not clear why it is in the interest of the West to  ignore even the obvious aggressiveness of mounting pan-Islamism,  which itself, has termed the number one threat in the world.    "The arrow has been shot and is moving towards its target"  --  were the words of the sentence passed by the Iranian  fundamentalists, headed by their late religious leader Ayatollah  Khomeyni, on poet Salman Rushdie five years ago. Rushdie,  sentenced by fundamentalists for a book he has written, has to  remain in hiding because the sentence was confirmed yesterday --  Rushdie must die, as must also the Serbs in Bosnia.    The progressive world public was indignant with the death  sentence passed on Rushdie by the fundamentalists and it  strongly reacted, defending the poet. On the other hand, that  same public is threatening Serbs with NATO bombs and missiles  only because Serbs do not fit into the visions contained in the  "Islamic declaration" of Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic.    There is no answer to the question what it is that Serbs  should do to finally eliminate the threats they have been facing  for two years, i.e., since the outbreak of the Bosnian Moslem  "holy war" for Izetbegovic's state whose genuinely Islamic order  would be based on the Koran.    All negotiations to date have failed because the Bosnian  Moslem side has been set on achieving its goal, but has not been  able to do so because "there are too many Serbs and Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina," as it sets out.    The Moslems have rejected all offers made by the Serbs.  Whatever concessions the Serbs have made, the Moslems have  asked for more in an effort to achieve their goal by means of  war. They are not doing bad in central Bosnia, where they are  confronted with Croats, but they need NATO's assistance in the  case of Serbs.    The world omnipotents, who have engineered the  disintegration  of the former Yugoslavia and everything that has happened in the  past three years, surely know whether NATO's arrow has already  been shot at the Serbs or if it has just been drawn back.    The scenario and stage-managing in Bosnia-Herzegovina have  been brought to perfection, and the story continues to unfold  towards its pre-conceived end. Only Serbs in no way fit in.  They should disappear according to Izetbegovic's idea, but they  refuse to do so. And, NATO can hardly do anything about it.</p>

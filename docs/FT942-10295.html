			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / SmithKline seeks to limit generic rivalry: Drugs group to launch unbranded version of best-seller as US patent of Tagamet expires SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US drugs company, is to launch an unbranded version of its former best-selling ulcer drug Tagamet in the US in an attempt to stave off competition from makers of cut-price generic products after Tagamet's US patent expires on May 17. SB has said that as many as 10 generics manufacturers could enter the market after the patent expired. The US accounted for two-thirds of Tagamet's global sales of Pounds 673m in 1993. From next week, SB will sell Tagamet under its generic name cimetidine directly to US hospitals and the health management organisations, which run healthcare services for employers and insurance companies. Customers could include Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services which SB bought for Dollars 2.3bn last week. SB has also signed a distribution agreement with Lederle, part of American Cyanamid, known for its aggressive selling of generics. The generics will be made at Tagamet's Puerto Rican site but sold by SB's subsidiary Penn Labs. No pricing details were revealed, but Mr Jerry Karabelas, president of SB's North American pharmaceuticals business, acknowledged that previous patent expiries have seen prices fall by more than 80 per cent within 18 months. SB is unlikely to engage many more distributors of the drug because the industry has seen the results of US company Syntex's efforts to become the dominant supplier of the raw active ingredient. Over the last six months Syntex tried to cushion the blow of patent expiry by supplying the active ingredient of its anti-inflammatory Naprosyn to generic manufacturers. Sales nevertheless fell rapidly, one of the factors behind last week's Dollars 5.3bn takeover of Syntex by Switzerland's Roche. SB is likely to reveal further parts of its strategy to limit the damage of the patent expiry. They have already included legal action against US generics company Mylan, which has US Food and Drug Administration approval to sell cimetidine. That action alleges trademark infringements: Mylan's cimetidine is the same pale green colour as Tagamet and could confuse patients, said Mr Karabelas. Prescription for growth, Page 32</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bidder for Continental Airlines drops out ONE OF the potential bidders for Continental Airlines, the US carrier which has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since late 1990, withdrew from the running yesterday. Benefit Concepts, a New York-based firm which was designing an offer which utilised employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) debt in conjunction with former executives of the airline, said it was abandoning the effort because of Continental's refusal to supply confidential financial information. Continental, by contrast, said Benefit Concepts failed to meet the standards of a 'qualifying bidder', and hence was not entitled to the information. So far, three outline investment proposals - from Mr Hurwitz's Maxxam group, from Mr Alfredo Brener's Houston Air, and from Air Canada in conjunction with a Texan investment partnership - have met the qualification requirements. The approach from Lufthansa, in conjunction with Mr Marvin Davis, the Californian investor, is still be evaluated. A deadline of November 9 was recently set for all bidders to submit proposals.</p>

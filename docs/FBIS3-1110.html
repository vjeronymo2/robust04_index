			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] A Goldstone Commission report has linked three  senior officers of the South African Police and Inkatha Freedom  Party officials to organized violence in the country. [passage  omitted]    [Begin De Klerk recording, in English] It is indeed a very  serious matter when some of the top management of a police force  are implicated in deeds which obviously militate against the  interests of the country, which are in direct contrast to what  should take place. Therefore, I regard this report as--if the  facts finally are proved to be fully correct -- as shocking.  And resulting from that, I believe that very, very strong steps  would then be needed. However, as you would have noted the  report itself emphasizes the fact that nobody can be regarded as  guilty, but that it does present strong prima facie evidence.    As is customary under such circumstances, the government is  called upon to take some immediate steps, firstly, in order to  ensure that further investigations will not be hampered in any  way and the first recommendation of the report also suggests  that such steps should be taken. As a first step, I would like  to announce that all those implicated in the findings of the  commission, implicated in any unlawful act or aiding or abetting  any unlawful act, or being involved in the whole plot and the  activities described by the report, are immediately put on leave.    We haven't had time to fully analyze the situation and to  distinguish whether in some instances further immediate  disciplinary action, going further than that, is justified.  There are various options that one can look at. The government  feels that the best option at this time, and this we will be  discussing with the TEC [Transitional Executive Council], would  be to immediately appoint a high-level international police  investigation team, to simultaneously ask one of the attorney  generals to work very closely with such a team, and to ask the  TEC to nominate an expert, a jurist, to also together with the  attorney general, work very closely with this investigation  team. They will obviously have the support, inasmuch as they  require it, of the South African Police.    This is the first time where we have evidence through the  Goldstone Commission, and the Goldstone Commission was inter  alia created to deal with these allegations about a third force  -- this is the first time that such prima facie evidence is laid  before us, and I am now keeping my promise and that is to take  immediate action. I would also like to highlight the fact that  the report itself emphasizes that we have....[pauses] We are  dealing here with the possibility of a relatively small group of  people, and any conclusion that this means that the South  African Police force, as a force, is involved in political  violence would be more than grossly unfair. [end recording]    The kwaZulu Police commissioner, Lieutenant General Roy  During, this afternoon denied that his police force received any  weapons from General Smit, who has now been placed on compulsory  leave.    [Begin recording] [During, in English] No, I'm afraid not.  We have spare arms. I'm sure we could use them in kwaZulu, but  there is most certainly no contact between myself and Basie Smit  with regard to arms or arms deals at all.    [Unidentified correspondent] Doesn't kwaZulu basically get  their arms from South Africa? They work with the South African  Police, don't they?    [During] Well, I'm afraid I'm not going to give away our  secrets -- where we get our arms from -- but we have our  suppliers in South Africa, yes. [end recording]</p>

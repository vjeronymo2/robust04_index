			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Blurred vision of a split personality: The worst may be over for John Major, but he has yet to establish a distinct identity for his administration It has been a wretched year. Mr John Major's government has contrived to heap bad judgment onto generous helpings of bad luck. It has left the prime minister struggling to establish a sense of purpose for his administration. The nation has been left to ponder whether he or his party have the will to do so. In fact the odds are that the worst is over. Mr Major may yet face the shock of a defeat in next month's Newbury by-election. But beyond that a gentle economic recovery should bring with it a modest upturn in the government's fortunes. For what it is worth in such febrile times, the consensus at Westminster is that Mr Major will lead his party into the next general election; and he has a good chance of winning it. But no one, these days, is prepared to bet too much of their own money on such predictions. The prime minister cannot rest easy until the Maastricht treaty is ratified. If by some fluke the opposition parties and the Conservative Euro-sceptics manage to overturn the natural pro-European majority in the House of Commons then he will fall. For those who like backing outsiders, the bar-room betting on that possibility among Conservative MPs oscillates between five and 10-1. The assumption, though, must be that Mr Major will govern for at least the next three or four years. The question that must be then be answered is how. Even in his own cabinet no one is quite sure. Some believe that the legacy of the past year may drive the prime minister into another burst of Thatcherite radicalism in an attempt to placate his party's right wing. The Tory right has the welfare state firmly in its sights. Others are convinced that once free of the snare of Maastricht he will reassert the social market Conservatism with which he always intended to replace the ideological passions of his predecessor. Others still, in private moments, confess that they simply do not know. There is no agreed route map. His election victory on April 9 1992 promised to liberate the prime minister from his party's past and stamp his own indentity on Conservatism. Instead the 12 months since have shown us two John Majors. The first remains the careful, shrewd, politicial tactician who outflanked his more experienced rivals to steal the succession to Mrs Margaret Thatcher. It is a persona still visible to those around him: in his clarity of thought at cabinet meetings; in careful judgements of the mood of the party; in an instinctive preference for pragmatism over theology. At least one of his most senior colleagues is convinced that Mr Major was the only leader capable of holding together the Tory party during the past year. Under anyone else the European issue would have split the Conservatives for a generation. Other colleagues remind his critics that it was Mr Major's preference for consensus over confrontation that won an election which his predecessor almost certainly would have lost. It is this side that persuades the prime minister that he will survive. There has been the odd moment during the past year when he has suggested that he would not be hard pressed to build a life outside politics. If he had lost a crucial Maastricht vote last autumn he probably would have quit. Yet far more frequent have been the private occasions when he has lifted his horizon above not just his immediate problems but also the next general election to speculate on the shape of a Majorite Britain in 2000. He intends to stay. Here though we come to the second John Major. This politician has appeared an uncertain leader, hamstrung by a small parliamentary majority. His pragmatism and a tactical rather than a strategic focus have left him too often looking weak and insecure. This prime minister has yet to find a rhetoric, still less a more solid framework, for the brand of Conservatism he sold to the electorate only a year ago. The trauma of sterling's exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, the depth of the recession, the civil war over Europe, and the coal industry debacle, have left him subject to sharp swings in mood. At one moment the Conservative Euro-sceptics are reviled and threatened. The next they are courted, assured that Maastricht is an obstacle to European integration. The prime minister promises to build an industrial strategy to replace the ideological indifference to manufacturing of the 1980s. Then, accused of ditching Thatcherism, he protests the change is one of style rather than substance. There have been many occasions when the first Mr Major appears determined to lead. But too frequently there have been others when he has preferred appeasement. So enthusiasm for the consensualism with which he replaced the blinding conviction of his predecessor has given way to doubts about whether he can set his policies within a long-term strategy. Mr Major blames bad luck. Who foresaw the slide into world recession? Who predicted the No vote in the Danish referendum on Maastricht? Who guessed that the ERM could be so badly fractured by the speculators? But in politics bad luck and poor judgment are impossible to disentangle. Voters rarely distinguish between them. It was the prime minister who decided first to make the ERM the core of his economic strategy. He negotiated Maastricht. Who else can be blamed for the appalling state of the public finances and the broken pledge not to raise taxes? The cabinet must accept collective responsibility. There are notable exceptions - Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Portillo among them. But too often other senior ministers have looked exhausted and bewildered. Too many of them are politicians whose ambition to reach the top has long taken precedence over a coherent philosophy for government. When Mrs Thatcher took the decisions there was no need for others to dabble in the world of ideas. There is now. After the pain of the past few years the electorate will demand more than a gentle economic recovery. The prime minister needs to find a tune to which the country can whistle. He has policies. Sometimes it seems too many - for education and training, for standards in public services, for privatisation, for the promotion of individual responsibility and ownership, for local authorities and, perhaps, for manufacturing industry. It is possible (not certain) that a credible medium-term economic policy will emerge eventually from the ashes of the ERM. It can be argued that if and when Maastricht is ratified, the less-ambitious mood in the rest of Europe will restore to Britain a voice in shaping its future. But beads need a thread. The risk is that Mr Major will remain a prisoner of his small parliamentary majority. He may steer too far in the direction of the Euro-sceptics. He could be driven to mount the assault on the welfare state that his predecessor never dared. Events rather than its own sense of purpose would then remain the guiding force of his government. To avoid the trap Mr Major must establish the personal political presence - at Westminster and in the country - which has so far eluded him. It may well be that the age of heroism in British politics has long since passed. Margaret Thatcher was the exception rather than the rule. James Callaghan, Edward Heath, Harold Wilson and Harold Macmillan are more appropriate yardsticks against which to judge the present prime minister. But in their different ways all of those leaders managed to imprint on the nation's consciousness a distinct political identity. Mr Major must do the same.</p>

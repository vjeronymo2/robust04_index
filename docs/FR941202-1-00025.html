			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to clarify how these two provisions apply and work together, the sequence of the two provisions has been reversed and minor revisions have been made. These changes are intended to clarify that the grant-by-grant rule is the general rule under which compensation arrangements are tested for purposes of determining whether they are performance-based. Thus, whether a compensation arrangement is performance-based is generally determined without regard to other compensation arrangements. The changes make clear that the aggregation rule requiring all plans, arrangements, and agreements providing compensation to an employee to be taken into account is a limited exception to the general grant-by-grant rule, and applies only for the purpose of determining whether the employee would receive, regardless of whether the performance goal is attained, compensation that purports to be performance-based. Thus, for example, if payment under a nonperformance-based compensation arrangement is contingent upon the failure to attain a performance goal under an otherwise performance-based arrangement, neither arrangement provides for compensation that is performance-based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendments also provide that, if a plan providing for performance-based restricted stock also provides for the payment of dividends on the stock prior to the attainment of the performance goal, the restricted stock and the dividends will be considered separate grants, and the payment of dividends will not ``taint'' the performance-based character of the restricted stock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Outside Directors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(3)(i)(D), an outside director is one who does not receive remuneration, either directly or indirectly, in any capacity other than as a director. Remuneration for this purpose includes any payment in exchange for goods or services. Remuneration is deemed to be paid to a director if it is paid to the director personally, to an entity in which the director has a beneficial ownership interest of greater than 50 percent, or (if more than de minimis remuneration) to an entity by which the director is employed or in which the director has a beneficial ownership interest of at least five percent but not more than 50 percent. See &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(3)(ii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Remuneration is de minimis for this purpose if, during the publicly held corporation's preceding taxable year, payments to the entity did not exceed the lesser of $60,000 or five percent of the entity's gross income for the entity's taxable year ending with or within the publicly held corporation's taxable year. See &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(3)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commentators have asserted that the $60,000 limit of the de minimis rule may be unrealistically low in cases where goods or certain types of services are purchased from entities that employ their directors. Thus, under the proposed amendments, the $60,000 de minimis limit applies only if the payment to the entity employing the director is remuneration for personal services or if the director is a five-percent-or-more owner of the entity. In addition, the proposed amendments clarify that a director of an entity will not be considered employed or self-employed by that entity solely on account of services as a director of the entity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under new &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(3)(iv), remuneration is not for personal services unless two requirements are satisfied. First, the remuneration must be paid to an entity for personal or professional services, consisting of legal, accounting, investment banking, and management consulting services (and other similar services that may be specified by the Commissioner in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin), performed for the publicly held corporation. For this purpose, remuneration for personal services that are incidental to the purchase of goods or nonpersonal services are not taken into account. Second, the director must perform significant services (whether or not as an employee) for the corporation, division, or similar organization (within the entity) that actually provides the personal services described above to the publicly held corporation, or more than 50 percent of the entity's gross revenues must be derived from the personal-service-providing organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

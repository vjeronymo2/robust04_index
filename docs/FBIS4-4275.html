			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 28 (CNS)--Director-General of the  Civil Aviation Administration of China [CAAC] Mr. Chen Guangyi,  speaking at a national civil aviation security meeting here  today, said he hoped that the Taiwan authorities would  coordinate with the Mainland in cracking down on airline  hijacking.    Airline hijacking, Mr. Chen said, was a commonly recognized  serious crime. CAAC had adopted a series of security measures  to prevent airline hijacking in the past two years. It required  the Taiwan authorities to repatriate Mainland hijackers in line  with the "Quemoy Agreement" signed in September, 1990. The  Taiwan authorities, however, practised a policy of separating  hijackers from the airlines and refused to repatriate them  immediately, resulting in hijackers feeling confident of  escaping punishment and was in fact a form of connivance with  the hijackers.    Mr. Chen said that in view of the responsibility for the  safety of life and property of passengers including Taiwan  compatriots and the desire to promote personnel and economic  exchange between the two sides of the strait, the Mainland  sincerely hoped that the Taiwan authorities would positively  coordinate with the Mainland in jointly cracking down on plane  hijacking and that the Mainland-based ARATS and Taiwan-based SEF  would reach an agreement on the repatriation of hijackers as  soon as possible.    Mr. Chen also said that the Mainland had noted the promise  made by the Taiwan authorities that they would not grant  political asylum to hijackers and would punish them severely.  It also noted the consensus achieved by ARATS and SEF on the  repatriation of all hijackers in principle and reached a basic  framework for the agreement regarding such repatriation. The  Mainland thanked figures from various sectors in Taiwan for  their support for repatriation of hijackers as soon as possible.  Mr. Chen said he believed that so long as the two sides  cooperated and made joint efforts to seriously crack down on the  crime of hijacking and made immediate repatriation of hijackers,  such crime would be halted and the safety of passengers and  property guaranteed.</p>

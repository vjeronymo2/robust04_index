			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES SHOPPER: HIGH-QUALITY BARGAINS ABOUND IN CARIBBEAN  </P> <P> Caribbean bargain-hunting is so good that many vacationers design  island-hopping itineraries around shopping.  </P> <P> Prices on liquor, perfume, sweaters, woolens, famous-maker clothing,  accessories, jewelry, china, crystal, linens and other labelled merchandise are  similar throughout the islands, about 20% to 30% below U.S. mainland retail.  Basic differences have to do with ambience and U.S. Customs regulations.  </P> <P> There is no dollar limit on merchandise that may be brought home duty-free from  Puerto Rico. Imports from the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa are  duty-free up to $1,200. From foreign Caribbean countries, $600 worth of goods  may be imported duty-free, if citizens have been abroad at least 48 hours.  </P> <P> For greatest savings, know the prices at home and on board ship before island  shopping. Principal shopping areas are usually near piers, and many ships  provide shopping brochures, bulletins and/or maps for their ports of call.  </P> <P> Except in Puerto Rico, liquor and perfumes are cheaper if bought in-bond (for  export only) and delivered to your ship. Most shops deliver free of charge  before your departure.  </P> <P> When choosing your cruising-for-bargains itinerary, these top shopping ports  deserve special consideration:  </P> <P> San Juan, Puerto Rico -- La Plazoleta del Puerto, a crafts market opposite the  piers, has stalls of folk art by local potters, needle workers and doll makers.  </P> <P> On nearby Calle Fortaleza, Barrachina Center (No. 104) has small but noticeable  diamond rings for under $120. Ole's (No. 105) handcrafts include Ecuadorian  basketry, Chilean silver and Puerto Rican santos. The Butterfly People's (No.  152) Lucite-encased arrangements of multicolored butterflies are $20 and up.  Puerto Rican Arts &amp; Crafts (No. 204) has pottery, woodcarvings, textiles  jewelry and papier-mache masks, plus paintings and prints by Puerto Rican  artists. Bared &amp; Sons (No. 264) has designer crystal and china, watches and  jewelry, but know the U.S. prices to assure yourself that their claim of 50%  discounts is accurate.  </P> <P> On Calle Cristo, Casa Cavanagh (No. 202) sells English, French and Italian  crystal and china at about 30% discount. Don Roberto's (No. 205) offers  Colombian leather goods, costume jewelry and gift items, plus antique Puerto  Rican santos (wooden carvings pertaining to saints) and ceramics at fair but  not cheap prices. Galeria Botello (No. 208), in the former home of artist Angel  Botello, exhibits works by top Puerto Rican artists, plus antique santos.  </P> <P> Factory outlets are found on Calle Cristo: Hathaway (No. 203) has Christian  Dior, Ralph Lauren, Chaps and other big-name labels for up to 50% off list.

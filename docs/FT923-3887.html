			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Rafsanjani China visit raises N-arms fears PRESIDENT Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran arrived in Beijing yesterday accompanied by his defence minister, amid western speculation that the three days of talks will include discussions on nuclear weapons co-operation. The Iranian defence minister, Mr Akbar Torkan, will meet his Chinese counterpart, Qin Jiwei, today, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. The US has been concerned for some time about long-term Iranian plans to develop nuclear weapons with Chinese help. US officials believe China has supplied equipment to the Iranians which could make enriched uranium for nuclear weapons. China dismisses the US fears and claims the mini-reactor and nuclear technology it has supplied to Iran are for peaceful purposes only. Iran also rejects US charges. In July Beijing said it had started negotiations with Iran, Egypt and Bangladesh to export Chinese-made 300MW nuclear power stations. Mr Rafsanjani's visit returns one made by Chinese President Yang Shangkun to Iran and Pakistan last October, a trip dogged by controversy over China's arms sales to both Islamic countries. President Yang's visit pointed to the emergence of an embryonic alliance between Pakistan, Iran and China. All three have a common concern over the domination of the post-cold war world by the US, and particularly its expanding presence in the Middle East following the Gulf War. Persistent speculation points to substantial Chinese assistance to Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme. Beijing denies nuclear military help, but it is building Pakistan a nuclear power plant. Early this year China admitted that it had transferred M-11 tactical range missiles to Pakistan. Iran and China both have interests in the newly independent central Asian republics and their Islamic revival movements. Iran is jockeying with Turkey for spheres of influence in the region. China's extensive border with the central Asian republics give it, too, a substantial strategic interest. And the existence of its own Moslem populations makes China wary of the spread of militant Islamic influences from the former Soviet Union. The issue of Chinese arms sales to the Middle East is of growing international concern in the light of China's threat to withdraw co-operation from UN Security Council disarmament talks following President Bush's decision to free sales of US F-16 fighters to Taiwan.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / US allows more flexible transfer pricing The US Treasury unveiled new tax rules yesterday that will allow companies greater flexibility in determining the transfer prices of their internal cross-border transactions. Transfer pricing, in which companies allocate prices of their transactions with a foreign subsidiary or parent, has become a highly contentious area in the international tax arena. Foreign companies operating in the US have often been accused of manipulating transfer prices in order to reduce their tax liability. In the 1992 election campaign President Bill Clinton hit at foreign companies for paying too little tax in the US. The new rules, which formalise and extend temporary regulations introduced last year, give companies more leeway over the methods by which they determine their transfer prices. They are called upon to choose the 'best method' for their particular circumstances from a range of options. However, in turn, the Internal Revenue service will be able to impose financial penalties of 20-40 per cent where it determines underpayments of tax have been made due to transfer pricing adjustments. 'Although the rules are broader in application and based on more general principles, they also give the IRS the tools to go after companies trying to cheat,' a treasury official said yesterday. While the regulations 'afford considerable leeway for the exercise of judgment by the IRS and the taxpayer, taxpayers may feel pressure to excercise that judgment appropriately, given the substantial penalties that could be imposed if they did not apply the regulations in a reasonable manner,' the treasury said. The benchmark for determ - ining accurate transfer prices is the arm's length principal, which asks what a similar commercial transaction between unrelated companies would cost. The final regulations 'are intended to maximise the extent to which relevant information may be taken into account in evaluating a taxpayer's results under the arm's length standard,' the treasury said, adding that it does not believe that the changes are likely to result in any significant rises in revenue. However, companies which were not complying under the old system could well find themselves paying more, it said.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Balkan call to Nato for troops BOSNIA'S President Alija Izetbegovic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman yesterday issued a joint call for Nato to send peacekeeping troops to their republics, Reuter reports. They were addressing a news conference in Vienna after inconclusive peace talks in the Austrian capital. It was not clear if they intended Nato to supplement or replace the current UN peacekeeping mission. Talks between Croats and Moslems made more progress in Zagreb, where the International Red Cross confirmed that the Bosnian government army and Croatian military forces had agreed in principle to free more than 5,000 prisoners of war. UN military officials expressed alarm about renewed fighting in Bosnia. They said clashes were reaching a 'disturbing' level. 'What we are concerned about is it building up again to a significant conflict,' said Colonel Bill Aikman. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees suspended the evacuation of sick and wounded from Bosnia, accusing the warring parties of manipulating the operation for political ends. Saying the situation was 'more alarming than ever' Mrs Sadako Ogata, launched a Dollars 700m appeal to fund humanitarian operations in former Yugoslavia until June next year. She said her agency expected to look after almost 4.3m people over the coming months.</p>

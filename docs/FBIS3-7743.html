I have  had a telephone conversation with Jozef Stank, the Slovak charge  d'affaires, about some areas that were discussed today.    [Begin recording] [Stank] During the meeting with Minister  Nemec, who is, among other things, in charge of the council for  minorities as well as the council for scientific and  technological development, we discussed above all the document  whose concept had been approved recently by the Czech Government  and that deals with the problem of national minorities. What is  interesting for us in this document is, above all, the premise  stating that a member of any national minority is above all a  citizen of the Czech Republic [CR], and he is perceived as such  from this civic principle. The best protection of the rights of  members of national minorities is a democratic and legal system  that guarantees the protection of the rights of all citizens.    [Ondas] I would like to ask: Did you find a common language  in the key questions with your Czech partners?    [Stank] Let us say it frankly. This civic principle used in  relation to national minorities is to a certain extent very  interesting for us, and I think it could provide a certain  alternative or certain understanding, certain approach also for  us in this area.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with Defense Minister Safet Zhulali </F> by Amalia Dhamo in Tirana on 7 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] A high-level military delegation led  by Defense Minister Safet Zhulali left for the United States  today. The delegation will visit the National Guard in South  Carolina and will hold special meetings with high-level  officials at the Pentagon and U.S. State Department, including  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry. Our correspondent  interviewed Mr. Zhulali before his departure:    [Dhamo] Mr. Minister, at the invitation of the National  Guard of South Carolina you are leading a high-level military  delegation on an official visit to the United States. What do  you hope to achieve during this visit?    [Zhulali] The goal of this visit is to further strengthen  the extremely good relations that exist between Albania and the  United Sates in the field of defense. There is an  infrastructure of political and economic relations between  Albania and the United States, and we can now add relations in  the field of defense, which were implemented with the signing of  a memorandum and other developments between our two armies.    In return for the visit paid by the delegation of the  National Guard of South Carolina and upon their invitation, we  are visiting the United States to aquaint ourselves with their  experiences in organization, drills -- mainly with reservists --  the training of noncommissioned officers, and the possibility to  profit from them in all the activities they organize, which are  of a wide variety. We also want to learn about the fields of  organization and legislation.    My visit to the United States could be divided into two  parts: The first part is in South Carolina and the second part,  which constitutes, shall we say, the political part of the  program, includes very important meetings at the Pentagon with  political and military officials, including Defense Secretary  William Perry, and meetings at the State Department with  congressional representatives, senators, and various politicians.    I plan to inform them about the successful development of  reform in Albania, the further consolidation of democracy, the  close relations between Albania and the United States, the  further support that Albania asks from the United States to  consolidate democracy, and the progress of the reform. We will  request the same from our military colleagues, who, seeing the  good progress of the reform in the Army, have supported it.  However, we think they should give more support for the  Albanian Army, which, just like all our state structures, plays  an important role in the peace and stability in the region.</p>

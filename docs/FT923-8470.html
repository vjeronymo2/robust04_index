			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Land developer calls for receiver EUROPEAN LAND, a development company run by Mr Jim Cookson that specialises in large business parks, has asked National Westminster Bank to appoint an administrative receiver. Its most prominent project is at Ashford, Kent, where it is seeking planning permission for a large business park. Two joint-venture companies owned by Mr Cookson and CIN Properties, the property investment arm of the British Coal Pension Fund, which are promoting business parks in the north-east, are not part of European Land. Mr Cookson is confident of their future. Mr Cookson said a scheme for a new town in northern Spain was also unaffected by European Land's receivership.</p>

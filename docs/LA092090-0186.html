			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIFT FROM TAIWAN GIVES ASIANS ACCESS TO FAR EAST AUTHORS;  </P> <P> MONTEREY PARK: BRUGGEMEYER MEMORIAL LIBRARY IS SUBSCRIBING TO A COMPUTER  NETWORK THAT WILL ALLOW IT TO SEARCH FOR BOOKS IN CHINESE, JAPANESE AND KOREAN.  </P> <P> Librarians soon will be able to search for titles, authors' names and subjects  on a computer screen -- in Chinese, Japanese and Korean.  </P> <P> With a $20,000 gift from the Taiwan chapter of Lions Club International,  Bruggemeyer Memorial Library is subscribing to an on-line computer network that  will allow it to share information about its Asian book collections with  libraries and universities around the world.  </P> <P> The network is provided by Dublin, Ohio-based Online Computer Library Center, a  nonprofit organization that enables libraries to store bibliographical  information, borrow books from other libraries, and even print and sort their  own card catalogues.  </P> <P> "This will benefit the surrounding libraries as well," said Christina Yueh, a  senior librarian. "If we have the system, we can share it with them."  </P> <P> Andrew Wang, who directs the library center's Asian/Pacific Services, said  10,000 libraries in 39 countries subscribe to the English-language network. The  Asian-language network, however, is used mainly by scholars in 30-40 large  universities with extensive collections from East Asian countries, including  Harvard, UCLA and UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> Monterey Park will be only the second city, behind Chicago, to join the Asian  program, Wang said. When the system is installed, librarians will be able to  scan the entire collection of the National Center Library in Taipei, Taiwan.  </P> <P> And in several years, they'll have access to a catalogue of all the works  written in mainland China from 1911-1949, Wang said.  </P> <P> The National Library of China in Beijing has signed an agreement with the  library center to provide a complete bibliography of about 120,000 works from  that period, beginning with the rise of the Kuomintang Party and ending when  the Chinese Communist Party took over.  </P> <P> Yueh said the computer program also will simplify the tedious task of  handprinting all of the library's 20,000 Chinese titles and filing them in the  card catalogue. Because of the time it takes to copy and file information by  subject, author and title, more than half of the Chinese collection isn't even  included in the catalogue, Yueh said.  </P> <P> Officials said Monterey Park will have to pay several thousand dollars for the  system each subsequent year, the exact amount depending on usage.  </P></p>

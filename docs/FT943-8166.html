			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: First contract award for Cray Computer Cray Computer, the struggling US supercomputer venture, has won a contract from the US National Security Agency to develop jointly a very high performance supercomputer. Formed in 1988, Cray Computer is a spin-off from Cray Research, the world's largest supercomputer company. Both were founded by Mr Seymour Cray, the pre-eminent supercomputer designer. The NSA will provide Cray Computer with its first revenues and ease a cash shortage that threatened to force it to close. Cray has been seeking strategic partners or investors, so far without results, and had acknowledged that its funds would run out by the end of this year. The contract may help Cray avoid the fate of Thinking Machines, another US supercomputer company, which earlier this week filed for bankruptcy protection. Cray Computer will be paid up to Dollars 4.6m for development costs. However, the company is responsible for the balance of development costs which could total Dollars 9.2m. Most of these have already been incurred by the company in the development of its prototype Cray 3 supercomputer.</p>

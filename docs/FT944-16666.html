			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Buoyant operating showing at TLG Operating profits at TLG, the holding company for Thorn Lighting, which is coming to the market next month, jumped from Pounds 2.63m to Pounds 6.06m for the five months to August 31. The figures, published yesterday in the pathfinder prospectus, also showed turnover ahead 4 per cent at Pounds 136.5m. Higher interest charges of Pounds 4.21m, against Pounds 12,000, depressed pre-tax profits which declined 41 per cent to Pounds 1.85m. TLG, Europe's second biggest supplier of professional lighting systems, was the subject of a Pounds 171.5m management buy-out from Thorn EMI in August last year. Its flotation involves a placing and public offer to raise about Pounds 77m of new money. The company is expected to have a market capitalisation of approximately Pounds 225m. Analysts are forecasting operating profits of some Pounds 25m for the full year. Most of the proceeds will go to repairing TLG's balance sheet, which currently has gearing of 93 per cent. Following the float, gearing will drop to just over 23 per cent. Mr Hamish Bryce, TLG's executive chairman who led the MBO, stressed the company's cash generative nature and said acquisitions could not be ruled out. Germany, which has a fragmented lighting industry, was one area TLG had earmarked for expansion. Following the float, management, which is currently interested in 3 per cent of the shares, would hold up to 11 per cent. Thorn's share of 12 per cent would be diluted to about 7 per cent, while Investcorp, the Bahrain-based international investment bank, would see its 77 per cent interest fall to approximately 45 per cent. The shares will be priced when the full prospectus is published on October 27. Applications close on November 3, with the basis of allocation announced the next day. Dealings in the shares will commence on November 10.</p>

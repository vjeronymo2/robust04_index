Muhammad Subayh, secretary of the Palestine National  Council,  told MENA that the misunderstanding resulted from the fact that  the contents of several documents that had been submitted were  inaccurately conveyed to the leaders.    Subayh explained that the points raised by President Yasir  'Arafat in connection with the Gaza-Jericho agreement are part  and parcel of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles  signed in Washington 13 September.    Subayh stressed that the Palestinians have a definite wish  to  implement the Gaza-Jericho agreement and they believe that the  Israelis have the same wish.</p>

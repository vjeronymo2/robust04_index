			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: The zenith of the central banks Britain this summer is suffering from a surfeit of anniversaries. One of the grandest is the 300th anniversary of the Bank of England. Central bankers have always been lavish in mutual appreciation, and 150 other central bank governors are in London for the occasion. They have been entertained at Buckingham Palace and attended a closed concert at the Barbican, where they heard Walton's Belshazzar's Feast: a feast which was interrupted by the appearance on the wall of the mysterious words 'Mene, Mene, Tekel' and 'Parsin' which foretold the destruction of Babylon. They pay for it all today by participating in an academic conference on central banking. The Bank of England is not quite the oldest central bank. The Sverige Riksbank was founded 26 years earlier in 1668. The Bank of England was the government's bank from the beginning, as it was established to raise Pounds 1.2m for William of Orange, whose main interest in the English throne was in the funds it could provide for his native country's war against France. What gives central banks their unique function is their monopoly of the note issue and their role of lender of last resort to the commercial banks. The Bank of England was not a real central bank in its earlier years. It did not acquire a full monopoly of the note issue until Robert Peel's Bank Charter Act of 1844, and did not take on full lender of least resort obligations until the Overend, Gurney crash in the late 1860s. The most famous governor the Bank has ever had was Montagu Norman, who both reigned and ruled from 1920 to 1944. Norman became a bete noire in political circles, as he was blamed for forcing Winston Churchill to return to gold in 1925 at the 1914 parity, and for resistance to Keynes's anti-Depression policies. There was no way the Bank could have avoided postwar nationalisation. But the Bank wasted a golden opportunity in the pre-nationalisation discussions, when it had a chance to seek clearly defined responsibilities, but confined its attention to the narrow question of statutory powers over other banks. As early as 1945, the governor of the Bank of Canada, Graham Towers, wrote to Lord Keynes: 'The half-way arrangement under which the central bank is neither a department of government pure and simple, nor directly responsible to the public for its actions, may contain the worst elements of both worlds.' There was then a long postwar period when fiscal and even incomes policy had precedence over monetary policy. Even when the latter came back into favour, central bankers were hamstrung by official insistence that they stick to monetary rules by which they were unconvinced. Central bankers are now, however, at a peak of prestige, having benefited from the widespread loss of faith in governments. The last word in mainstream economic wisdom is that it is credibility, rather than targets, that matter; and this is best achieved by leaving central banks independent of government control to achieve price stability by methods of their own choice. But, like Belshazzar, they will be hard pressed to sustain their present eminence. Although they have gained in relation to governments, they have lost in relation to markets. How do central banks intend to carry out their monetary responsibilities? Michael Prowse explained in the Financial Times on Monday that the Fed operates according to two unpublished rules: it will raise short-term interest rates if real economic growth appears likely to exceed the annual 2 1/2 to 3 per cent it regards as sustainable; and it will also raise them if inflation shows any sign of rising above the current level of just under 3 per cent. Mervyn King of the Bank of England has explained explicitly that the Bank's policy is based on a projection of where the inflation rate will be in two years. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank sticks to targets for a wide measure of money, but is prepared to override them. These guidelines may be better than the political instincts of governments; but can we be at all confident that they will stabilise either the financial system or the economy? Indeed, central banks seem more and more to follow the lead given by bond markets rather than take the initiative. Indeed, some analysts are suggesting that the whole development of central banking has been a mistake. There was always a free banking school that queried the central bank monopoly of the note issue. This has been joined in modern times by advocates of currency competition, not only between national currencies, but between private enterprise ones as well. 'Why should banking be treated differently from any other industry?' has been the cry. Until recently I had been put off the free banking movement because its members had no reply to two questions: What prevents the competitive supply of money today, given that the official restrictions apply only to notes and coin, and that the overwhelming part of the money supply consists of deposits and financial liabilities of various kinds? How can the unregulated banks, say of Scotland in the early 19th century whose experience is so frequently cited, really have been competitive suppliers of money when their notes were convertible into gold and silver, which were then seen as true currency? I have, however, at last discovered an economist, David Glasner*, who faces these questions head on, without a trace of the crankiness which often affects writers of this school. The author's answer to the first question is to accept that financial markets can and do create many different kinds of money, even though that money is denominated in terms of the coin of the realm. He cites the development of the Euro-currency markets as an outstanding example. His argument with the central banks is that these developments should be accepted, not fought Canute-like. But in contrast to many free bankers, he accepts that there must be a stable non-inflationary form of base currency into which reputable bankers should be prepared ultimately to convert their deposits. He proposes, following many turn-of-the-century economists such as Alfred Marshall and Irving Fisher, an adjusted Gold Standard whereby government currency becomes once more convertible into gold, but at varying rates calculated to stabilise the general price level. Obviously the idea needs more analysis. Meanwhile the heretics provide persuasive critiques of the habit of monetary authorities of underwriting bank deposits, whether through credit insurance or bailing out individual banks like Continental Illinois, and extracting a quid pro quo in the shape of banking supervision. It is this combination which enables central bankers to go around as grave-faced financial overseers concerned with so much more than the mere interest rate decisions that engage their economists. A free banking perspective has the advantage of ending the artificial distinction between discussions about monetary policy conducted as in church and real world bankers' concerns about where to extend operations and where to contract them. The heretical insight is that, given the right institutional structure, banking can be treated like any other industry and the amount of deposit money and other financial liabilities left to ordinary competitive forces. If we rely too much on the central bankers' discretion, we will find that our emperors are without any clothes. *Free Banking and Monetary Reform, Cambridge, 1989</p>

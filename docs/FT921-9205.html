			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexico sets its sights on derivatives trading - The country's plan to offer on-shore warrants and options BY JUNE, Mexico's stock market authorities plan to be offering listed warrants on the bolsa index and on some 10 to 12 leading stocks. The move is an effort to bolster liquidity and stem the growing tide of derivative business conducted off-shore. Mr Guillermo Prieta, vice-president at the Comision Nacional de Valores (CNV), said the creation of covered warrants would itself increase turnover in the underlying market. He said investors would also be able to use the warrants to protect their investment portfolios from unfavourable price changes. If the warrants market is successful, the CNV would establish a listed options market which the Mexican authorities would bring under the same level of close regulation that it has planned for the warrants market. In a third stage, the authorities plan to set up a financial futures market. Mr Prieta also revealed that Mexico would shortly introduce an intermediate market for the thousand or so businesses worth between Dollars 3m and Dollars 30m. The listing requirements for the smaller companies market will be lighter than those in the main bolsa. Foreign and domestic investors interested in buying options on the bolsa currently have to buy offshore warrants listed in Luxembourg on baskets of Mexican stocks offered by Merrill Lynch, Nomura and the Mexican bank Banamex. Merrill Lynch also offers off-shore warrants on seven individual Mexican stocks. US-listed options on Telmex, the telephone monopoly, whose American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, are also available. These have proved popular, and have threatened to divert business away from the underlying Mexican stock market, according to Mr Juan Jose Suarez, head of derivatives at Banamex. As securities houses sell options and warrants mainly on ADRs, they have tended to buy and sell the underlying ADR, rather than the Mexican stock, to cover the risk. At the end of 1991, some 74.3 per cent of foreign investment, or Dollars 14.2bn in Mexican stocks, was in the form of US-based ADRs. This was mainly because many US institutional investors are only allowed to buy dollar denominated shares. But the demand for Mexican-listed stocks has also been damped by the high cost of buying them, their low liquidity and constraints on hedging - problems which will be reduced when Mexico introduces its own options market. The Mexican brokerages hope that by offering derivatives they will also attract more foreign investment in Mexican-listed stocks. Foreign investors seem to agree. Mr Lincoln Rathbone of Scudders, Stevens, and Peabody, points out that if the derivatives are liquid, 'it is a big plus for Mexico . . . since this allows you to employ tools regarding controlling risk that we are used to'. Mr Tim Davies, of James Capel, echoes this view. 'There is no real way to hedge the country risk of investing in Mexico - that makes some foreigners more hesitant.' The Mexican warrants will also be on-shore, and thus open to many more US and Mexican institutional investors than the Luxembourg warrants. However, foreign investors may not gravitate to Mexican warrants if the regulators do not guarantee the warrants and options through a controlled clearing system, as happens in the US. Without guarantees, the purchaser of a warrant or option is accepting the credit risk of the Mexican broker or bank that issues the option - which often is significant. (Under Mexican law only domestic institutions will be able to issue derivatives). Mr Suarez, of Banamex, suggests further problems. The bolsa prohibits margin trading; short sales are almost impossible because of burdensome regulation; brokerage fees are much higher than in the US; and proprietary trading - essential to liquidity - is difficult. All these restrictions make it impossible to use options and warrants as proper and efficient hedges (because they inhibit the arbitrage between the underlying and derivative market). Investors will probably continue using off-shore instruments, if they are legally free to do so. Mr Prieta seems aware that the regulation of Mexico's underlying bolsa needs to be reduced, and suggested that in the near future some restrictions will be lifted, including those on proprietary trading. This should increase liquidity, and allow the Mexican market to compete more effectively.</p>

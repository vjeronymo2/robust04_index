			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ALBANIA SHOWS SIGNS OF EASING UP AS LAST OF STALINIST STRONGHOLDS  </P> <P> The government of Albania, Europe's last Stalinist bastion, is under siege.  </P> <P> Economic necessity and fears of following other East European Communist  governments into oblivion are forcing the country's reluctant leadership to  open what may be the most closed of Marxist societies and undertake limited  domestic reforms.  </P> <P> Rarely since the Communists seized power in 1944 has the government appeared  more vulnerable to unpredictable domestic and foreign forces, in the view of  diplomats and analysts who are speculating about when -- not if -- the  government here will fall.  </P> <P> A five-day visit to Europe's most reclusive, repressive and impoverished  country, a land of 3.2 million people on the mouth of the Adriatic Sea flanked  by Yugoslavia and Greece, suggested that the Albanian government is becoming  defensive about the hard-line, isolationist philosophy under which it has  governed.  </P> <P> As a result, the Albanian leadership, which long ago distanced itself from  other Communist powers and insists that it will not follow other East European  countries down the road of reform, is trying to impose gradual change from  above, out of fear of being swept out of power from below. As one diplomat put  it, Albania is experimenting with perestroika -- Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's name for his restructuring efforts -- "without calling it  perestroika."  </P> <P> But diplomats and other analysts say the changes being made by the country's  leaders are likely to accelerate demands for change from a people said to be  tired of the secret police repression, lack of basic freedoms and shortages of  meat, milk, soap, toilet paper and consumer goods.  </P> <P> "This time something is brewing," said a foreign visitor with extensive  knowledge of Albania. "People are ready to explode."  </P> <P> In December, students at Tirana University protested a lack of adequate heating  as well as other living conditions, according to reports. Then, in mid-January,  a student-led demonstration erupted in the northern city of Shkoder, according  to reports accepted as accurate by foreign governments.  </P> <P> The crowd's attempts to tear down a statue of the late Soviet dictator Josef  Stalin sparked speculation about a nascent democracy movement in this country,  where dissidence in the past has been met with ruthless repression. As many as  400 arrests were made in Shkoder, according to specialists in the West who  follow Albanian affairs, and about 100 people are believed still in custody.  </P> <P> Some specialists speculate that pro-democracy sentiment here could be focused  in Shkoder, with a long Roman Catholic record of anti-Communist resistance, and  in the increasingly restive ethnic Greek community. Together, the Christian  minorities make up about one-fifth of the population in the atheist state.  </P> <P> Traditionally, the ruling Communists have kept the population in line through a  mixture of repression, nationalist pride and fear of foreign invasion.  </P> <P> But now, the government faces dangers for which the thousands of concrete  bunkers scattered across the land serve no practical purpose. Ingredients for  turmoil are at hand despite the reputation for effective repression of the  Sigurimi, the pervasive and dreaded secret police.  </P> <P> For one thing, Albania is strapped for hard currency. Furthermore, insufficient  rains this winter point to a third successive bad harvest, and the government  recently announced cutbacks in hydroelectric power. Albania's ill-maintained  and obsolete industrial plant is nearing exhaustion.  </P> <P> Because of the collectivization of farming and sizable food exports for hard  currency, the government is barely able to feed Europe's poorest -- per capita  annual income is estimated at under $900 -- and fastest-growing population,  which increases by about 60,000 people every year.  </P> <P> People's expectations also appear to be rising. Because of access to Greek,  Italian and Yugoslav television, Albanians are aware of events abroad, and some  indicated in conversations here that they are impatient for a consumer society.  An English-speaking Albanian university student in Tirana spoke knowledgeably  about CBS, NBC and American serials broadcast in English on Yugoslav  television.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, party propaganda sounds increasingly defensive. "We could have been  a second Switzerland," said a Communist Party tour guide, "but we preferred our  independence and feel proud that we did not hold out our hands to anyone for  aid."  </P> <P> In the past, such appeals to nationalist pride have struck a deep chord among  Albanians for whom the last 45 years of Communist rule represent their longest  unbroken period of independence. Albanian history has been marked by five  centuries of Ottoman occupation, neighbors' efforts to partition the country  after formal independence was declared in 1912 and an Italian invasion during  World War II. It is not at all clear if such an appeal will have the same  effect now.  </P> <P> So far, Communist leader Ramiz Alia has reacted cautiously to the growing  pressures. In late January, the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of  Labor, as the Communists call themselves, adopted potentially significant  reforms. But they stopped well short of following Communist parties in other  countries that abolished their guaranteed leading role in society and  introduced multiparty democracy.  </P> <P> Key measures approved here included decentralizing political and economic  decision-making, introducing production incentives, developing private home  ownership and improving Albania's much criticized human rights record.  </P> <P> Under consideration is penal code reform, including a reduction in the long  list of infractions punishable by death, and re-establishment of the Justice  Ministry and the right of a defendant to have a lawyer, both of which were  abolished in 1967. Such changes would eliminate the people's tribunals that  human rights organizations abroad have criticized as allowing condemnations on  the basis of little more than hearsay.  </P> <P> In the first, if indirect, response to charges of failing to provide official  information about political prisoners, the government said in March that 83 of  the country's 3,850 prison inmates were detained for seeking to overthrow it  "by violence." Other sources said there may be 15,000 to 20,000 political  prisoners. The last annual report of Amnesty International, the London-based  human rights monitoring group, said, "It is impossible to estimate their  numbers."  </P> <P> Overall, the reforms appear to reverse trends toward greater agricultural  collectivization and centralized industrial planning. But so far, no enabling  legislation has been adopted, despite repeated promises in recent weeks by  high-placed Albanian officials that the rubber-stamp Parliament will act this  year.  </P> <P> The delay has sparked speculation that Alia and his pragmatic allies are being  stymied by old-guard Stalinists grouped around the widow of Enver Hoxha, the  government's founder who ran Albania with an iron hand for four decades by  liquidating rivals.  </P> <P> Five years after his death, Hoxha's influence is still felt, thanks to a  personality cult featuring billboard exhortations from 69 published volumes of  his writings, statues, photographs and an expensive memorial in Tirana.  </P> <P> Underlining Alia's inability to put his personal stamp on domestic affairs is  the fact that the ruling People's Assembly has been unchanged for the last six  years. He has, however, encountered less resistance in foreign affairs.  </P> <P> Even before what Alia recently called "the tragedy" of the fall of East  European communism, Albania sought to improve long-spurned relations with  foreign governments and international institutions as a way out of its economic  and financial predicament and self-imposed diplomatic isolation.  </P> <P> Despite a constitutional clause outlawing foreign debt, the government has  signed important deals with Western firms based on "buy back" provisions paying  off foreign investment with products.  </P> <P> An Italian firm is interested in offshore gas and oil prospecting rights and  provides agricultural machinery and a regular truck ferry service to Trieste.  West German firms are renovating chrome and nickel plants, and France recently  signed an important contract to supply hydroelectric turbines.  </P> <P> Business sources also have reported that Albania has streamlined its once  cumbersome bureaucracy since the East European order collapsed in 1989.  </P> <P> This winter, the government also signaled a desire for accommodation with the  United States and the Soviet Union. In what diplomats called a  characteristically Albanian rewriting of history, Deputy Foreign Minister  Sokrat Placa told the Associated Press in February that the lack of relations  with Washington is "not our making" and that "the ball is in their court."  </P> <P> Perhaps even more surprising has been Albania's improved ties with its southern  neighbor, Greece, which persuaded Tirana to join a foreign ministers conference  with four other Balkan powers.  </P> <P> Only late last year, Greek Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras and the Greek  Orthodox Church complained about human rights violations of the Greek minority,  including a case involving four brothers caught trying to escape across the  border and allegedly tortured and dragged through their village behind  tractors.  </P> <P> But early in April, Albania gave way in a landmark case involving a 28-year-old  ethnic Greek who jumped over the Greek Embassy fence and sought asylum. The  man, who had been imprisoned repeatedly for his religious beliefs, was issued a  Greek passport and flown to Athens nine days later.  </P> <P> Albanian determination to improve long-spurned relations with the rest of the  world now centers on a visit scheduled this month by U.N. Secretary General  Javier Perez de Cuellar. Although Perez de Cuellar is expected to raise human  rights violations, his presence will help build Albania's self-image as a  member of the world community.  </P> <P> The government has proved adroit in suggesting that it will tolerate greater  liberalization than it in fact does. For example, direct dial telephone service  initiated and paid for by the U.N. Development Fund opened with 54 countries  recently, an advance in telecommunications that elsewhere could be construed as  opening yet another major window on the outside world. But few telephones,  public and private, exist in Albania, and those that do can be easily  monitored.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, visitors said they note a relaxation of suspicion and a greater  tolerance for once-taboo foreign influences.  </P> <P> Greek visitors, previously obliged to sleep in government-owned hotels where  surveillance is assured, are now allowed to stay with Albanian relatives. Until  last year, only Albanian emigres were allowed to enter on U.S. passports, but  two American journalists were allowed to visit Albania with no more ado than an  admonition to "write positive articles."  </P> <P> That is a far cry from the days when dollars sent by emigre Albanians were  returned as tainted capitalist money. Dollar shops are now located in major  towns and offer refrigerators, television sets, tape decks and other consumer  goods in exchange for family heirloom jewelry sold to the Albanian Central  Bank.  </P> <P> What is more, running shoes, T-shirts, tape decks and pop music cassettes can  be found among the young with families abroad who can provide them with  once-banned Western imports or other ways to procure them.  </P> <P> And starting this spring, more Albanians are expected to be allowed to go  abroad on group visits to Greece, Italy and Turkey. In the past, few Albanians  were allowed to travel abroad -- mostly party and government officials,  university professors and other members of the Establishment.  </P></p>

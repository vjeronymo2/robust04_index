			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Low prices hit recycling A COMPANY that buys waste newsprint in central Scotland for recycling has told councils it can no longer afford to pay for the paper they collect, because of low prices in the waste newsprint market. Stirling Recycling, of Gartcosh, near Glasgow, is no longer paying for the waste newsprint it takes from Edinburgh, Glasgow and Falkirk district councils. The councils collect old newspapers and magazines which local people have put in recycling banks and pass them on to Stirling Recycling, which sells them to newsprint processors. Mr David Symmers, chief executive of the Independent Waste Paper Processors Association, said: 'This sort of problem is happening all over Britain - some companies are charging councils for taking the newsprint off them. 'The market is weak because Europe is flooded with surplus waste paper from the subsidised German recycling system.' The oversupply of waste newsprint in Britain and the increasing unwillingness of the companies that take it to pay for it means that the cost to local authorities of running newsprint recycling schemes will escalate. If Edinburgh District Council receives nothing from Stirling Recycling up to the end of this financial year, it will forgo income of Pounds 26,000 - or Pounds 10 per tonne - and still have to pay to collect the paper. 'It can cost companies up to Pounds 30 per tonne to collect, bale and clean the waste newsprint,' said Mr Symmers. 'Yet they may only be getting Pounds 25 for selling it.' Germany, where both producers and consumers are legally obliged to pay for the recycling of waste paper and packaging, is blamed for flooding the European market with surplus waste. Other European Community countries are trying to persuade Germany to change its recycling policies. Mr Symmers said that the UK needed more plants such as the one proposed in Aylesford by SCA Group and Mondi. 'We badly need one in Scotland,' he added. A project spearheaded by North British Newsprint, part of Stirling Recycling, to build a Pounds 220m recycled newsprint mill at Gartcosh has been stalled since 1991 when Abitibi-Price, the Canadian paper company, pulled out. Mr Christopher Wilkins, chairman of North British Newsprint, said it would review its plans for the plant in the light of events at Aylesford. 'The project is fully developed and a major company is currently contributing towards it,' he said. 'We are waiting for the appropriate time to start.'</p>

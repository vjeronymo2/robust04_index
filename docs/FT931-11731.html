			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Argentaria opens with profits of Pta67.4bn ARGENTARIA, the state-owned Spanish banking corporation due for partial privatisation, reported net profits of Pta67.4bn (Dollars 607m) and a cash-flow of Pta200m in 1992, its first full financial year. Mr Francisco Luzon, chairman, said Argentaria's 'excellent' results guaranteed 'a successful flotation', but he said the government, which is Argentaria's sole shareholder, had 'not as yet taken an explicit decision' to put the banking group on the market. 'All the necessary conditions are in place for us to go to the market as soon as the shareholder decides,' Mr Luzon said. The government would not comment on the timing of the flotation, but analysts believe the finance ministry, which is seeking to raise funds through disposals to reduce the public deficit, is anxious to give the go-ahead as soon as possible. Mr Luzon said he hoped there would be 'a major share placement' both in Spain and abroad which would bring in 'some 200,000 shareholders'. He said he wanted Argentaria to be 'a liquid, blue-chip stock' in Spain and on the New York and London stock exchanges. Argentaria was created in May 1991 when the government pooled five financial institutions it controlled, including Banco Exterior which is now the group's flagship bank, into a single banking corporation. The 1992 net profit represented a 14.7 per cent increase on the income earned by Argentaria's units during 1991. The banking group, which is particularly active in the mortgage market in financing local authorities, had average total assets last year of Pta9,717bn, making it Spain's largest financial institution. Mr Luzon said Argentaria's return on assets last year stood at 0.98 per cent, up from the 0.86 per cent calculated for the group in 1991.</p>

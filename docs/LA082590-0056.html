			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV TO IRAQ: OBEY U.N. CALLS OR FACE NEW MEASURES;  </P> <P> EMBARGO: HIS WARNING IMPLIES COLLECTIVE MILITARY FORCE UNLESS HUSSEIN LEAVES  KUWAIT AND FREES DETAINEES.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in an urgent personal message to Iraq's  leader, warned Saddam Hussein on Friday that if he does not immediately obey  U.N. resolutions, the world body will be forced to impose "extra measures" --  an apparent hint at the use of collective military force.  </P> <P> With the Bush Administration pushing hard at the United Nations for the  approval of embargo enforcement powers against Iraq, Gorbachev in his message  stressed "the pressing need for the Iraqi government to begin fulfilling  without delay" U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding the unconditional  withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait and the immediate release of an  estimated 12,000 Western detainees.  </P> <P> "Evading the fulfillment of the resolutions will inevitably compel the Security  Council to adopt corresponding extra measures," Gorbachev warned Saddam in his  message, according to a summary carried by the official Tass news agency. "It  now depends on the Iraqi side how the Security Council will choose to act."  </P> <P> In the light of the Kremlin's evolving position at U.N. headquarters,  Gorbachev's message is likely to prove disquieting to the Iraqis -- perhaps  precisely because of the ominous vagueness of the "extra measures" envisaged by  Gorbachev. The message described the situation in the Persian Gulf as  "extraordinary and extremely dangerous."  </P> <P> On Thursday, negotiators for the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France  and China announced tentative agreement on a U.S.-sponsored measure endorsing  military force to uphold a trade embargo against Iraq. American and British  envoys expressed hope that the agreement by the Security Council's five big  powers meant that Kremlin objections to the proposed resolution were ending and  that the full 15-member body would adopt it by Sunday.  </P> <P> Earlier, Moscow had declined to support the American drive for a U.N.  resolution authorizing "minimum use of force" to block Iraqi shipping. Only two  days before Gorbachev's message to Hussein, in fact, Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze said U.N. resolutions already adopted -- including the imposition  of the worldwide economic boycott against Iraq -- "clearly define the basis for  a gulf settlement and the methods to attain this."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, in what Tass called his "urgent personal message" to Hussein, held  out the hope that conflict in the Persian Gulf could still be avoided by urging  the Iraqi leader to "immediately take proper steps" in line with the U.N.  resolutions.  </P> <P> State-run Soviet media and government officials were at pains to stress a tough  line against Iraq after the admission earlier this week that Soviet military  advisers were still teaching the Iraqis to use their Soviet-made weapons. The  tough line also followed a visit by a top-level Iraqi envoy to Moscow and  Shevardnadze's willingness to give "serious attention" to Hussein's proposal to  release the Western captives in exchange for a U.S. military rollback.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's message to Hussein, whose country was a longtime Soviet ally in the  Arab world, "reiterated the Soviet Union's position of principle that the  annexation of Kuwait was illegal," Tass said. Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri  A. Gremitskikh used the same word -- illegal -- at a government news briefing.  </P> <P> "After several days of 'doubts' caused by the recent visit to Moscow of Iraq's  special representative Saadoun Hammadi, international observers accredited in  Moscow apparently were convinced today that the Soviet Union's attitude to  Kuwait's annexation remains unchanged," Tass correspondents Alexander  Kanishchev and Yuri Rublevsky wrote in a commentary.  </P> <P> Soviet officials spent much of the week in talks seeking a way out of the  crisis via diplomacy and have not cut all ties with Iraq, in an apparent effort  to maintain their status as potential mediators. On Wednesday, Saudi Arabia's  ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar ibn Sultan, met with  Shevardnadze in Moscow and said the Kremlin could help "persuade" Hussein that  he had erred by invading Kuwait.  </P> <P> At lunchtime Friday, about 100 Arab demonstrators chanted anti-American slogans  in a well-choreographed protest held on a parking lot across a side street from  the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Men in their late 30s or 40s dressed in suits  instructed the assembly, described in leaflets as a grouping of "Arab  students," on what slogans to shout.  </P> <P> As dozens of Soviet police officers stood between the embassy building and the  protesters, the Arabs waved Iraqi flags and portraits of Hussein and chanted in  Arabic.  </P> <P> No trouble was reported, but U.S. officials were worried enough beforehand to  clear the sidewalk in front of the embassy of its customary throng of visa  applicants and to post memos warning embassy personnel to stay away from  windows.  </P></p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / French Government Bonds: Issues hold up well in face of weakening franc THE CURRENCY markets have been casting a shadow over the French bond market, as a series of attacks against the franc have raised the question of whether the French government is prepared to raise interest rates to defend the current parity within the European exchange rate mechanism. Such considerations were evident in last Thursday's FFr18bn bond issue. The issue of two-year and five-year bonds went reasonably smoothly, although the shorter-term issue reflected anxieties about the currency market. It saw an average yield of 5.95 per cent, which is higher than expected and compares with 6.16 per cent at the last auction in June. The five-year bond saw an average yield of 6.13 per cent, compared with 6.36 per cent at the June auction. In general, however, bond analysts said that French issues had held up reasonably well in the face of the weakening franc. Spreads on French 10-year bonds over German bunds narrowed from 24 points to 14 points over the course of the week, while the short-term end of the market stayed relatively stable. 'We were seeing increased buying interest in French bonds at the end of last week,' says Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, international economist at Midland Capital Markets. She says that with French yields back above German ones at virtually every maturity, there is again the attraction of capital gains on French bonds. But this attraction may be short-lived if the current turbulence within the ERM forces the French government to resort to an increase in interest rates. 'If the speculators really try and prise the franc out of the ERM, which is possible, then the French government isn't going to have much choice,' said one analyst. Inflationary prospects in France will be one factor preventing yields slipping below those on German bonds again in the near future. Consumer price statistics for June, released last week showed stable inflation, the result of falls in the prices of food and oil, but the impact of increased indirect taxes introduced in July - including a rise in petrol taxes - suggests that inflation will pick up in the second half of the year. One economist at a Paris-based bank said he expected year-on-year inflation to be nearer 2.5 per cent in July, as against 2 per cent in June. In addition to the two-year and five-year issues, last Thursday also saw an extraordinary repo issue, the result of the successful launch of the 'Balladur bond'. Official results, released on Monday, confirmed the bond had attracted about FFr110bn, almost three times the target level. Thursday's issue of BTFs (short-term money market instruments) was designed to counteract the drain on the money markets as subscribers to the Balladur bond settled their accounts on Friday. The extraordinary repo issue did not, however, fully compensate for the drain on the market. And combined with sale of about FFr60bn of BTFs earlier in the week, there was a strong tightening of liquidity. The oversubscription of the Balladur bond - which yields 6 per cent and has a maturity of four years - will not necessarily reduce the French government's future capital raising plans. 'They ought to overfund in this kind of environment,' said one economist. 'It might make sense to issue more bonds than they need now. It is likely to be more difficult later.'</p>

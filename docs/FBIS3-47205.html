"That is a very fine thing," Hosokawa told reporters.    Hosokawa's remarks came after U.S. President Bill Clinton  announced Monday in Brussels that Ukraine will sign an agreement  with Russia and the United States on Friday on the scrapping of  its 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 1,800 warheads.    A government source noted that the fate of nuclear weapons  left on Ukrainian soil after the disintegration of the Soviet  Union has served for some time now as a source of anxiety.    The source called it "good news" that Ukraine will agree to  remove them.    But when asked about the prospect for Japanese technical or  financial assistance in helping Ukraine with that task, the  source replied that no such assistance is planned.</p>

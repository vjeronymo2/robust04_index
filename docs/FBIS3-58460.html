The ambassador in  Islamabad [Staes] failed to inform the Ministry about the  official issuing of a visa, Claes told the parliamentary foreign  affairs committee on Wednesday [12 January]. Do not  underestimate the consequences of the affair, said Claes, also  regarding my own safety.    Claes was questioned once again by Agalev [Flemish Ecology  Party] Senator Magda Aelvoet about the issuing of a visa to  Amanullah Khan, president of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation  Front (JKLF).    Khan was arrested with that visa in his pocket when he came  to Brussels on 18 October, at the invitation of the Socialist  Group of the European Parliament. Following a negative response  by the call for his extradition to India, he was put on a plane  back to Pakistan toward the end of December.    Claes said Staes had confirmed on 20 October that the visa  had officially been issued without consulting the central list  of wanted persons (CBS), and that he (Staes) himself had  approved the issuing of visas to the Khan party. In order to  prove this, Claes showed the cable Staes sent him on the  above-mentioned date. He refuted allegations of having quoted  only selected passages from the cable from Staes in answer to  questions in the parliamentary committees on 3 November.    An internal inquiry is still under way.</p>

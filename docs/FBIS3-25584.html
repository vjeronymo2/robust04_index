			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kevin Davie] </F>   [Text] Who will be the Minister of Finance after April 30?    Opinion polls and candidate lists suggest that Nelson  Mandela  will be State President and F.W. de Klerk and Cyril Ramaphosa  his deputies. Finance Minister is the next most powerful  position. Many in business see Derek Keys as the automatic  choice, but ANC [African National Congress] indications are that  this is by no means certain.    ANC leaders say they would like Mr. Keys in the cabinet of a  government of national unity, but as Minister of Trade and  Industry, not Finance. Would Mr. Keys take the relatively  junior position? Many think not.    The ANC is shopping for a suitable candidate. Outgoing  Nedcor [expansion unknown; a major financial institution] chief  executive Chris Liebenberg is said to have been approached. But  Mr. Liebenberg is believed to have declined because he does not  have political ambitions. Senior ANC people fancy Thabo Mbeki  for the job. But there are suggestions that Mr. Mbeki may be  reluctant to occupy the hot seat at this stage of his career.    What are the ANC objections to Mr. Keys? He has, after all,  done a very good job under extremely difficult circumstances.  There are mutterings that he is too authoritarian and not  sufficiently in tune with the need for investment in human  development. He is also said to be too strongly associated with  the National Party for a senior job in the cabinet. Others say  powerful ANC members, such as Jay Naidoo, who fancies himself as  Minister of Reconstruction, do not want Mr. Keys controlling the  purse strings. One cannot easily imagine Mr. Naidoo telling his  voters that he would like to spend, spend, spend, but Mr. Keys  won't let him.    Can Mr. Keys live with the ANC's reconstruction and  development programme (RDP)? He says it should be subject to  discussion with interested parties in the National Economic  Forum, including government departments.    Opinion polls show Mr. Keys is the favourite among business  people. Agenda-Sacob-Weekly Mail polled 100 businessmen and  found 89 percent support for Mr. Keys as Finance Minister.    ANC economics head Trevor Manuel polled a lowly 4 percent.  Mr. Manuel, 20th on the ANC's election list, and Tito Mboweni  (32nd) are not in the running for top jobs, although deputy  ministerships are possible.    A complicating factor in Mr. Keys' case is that on the  latest  polls the NP will get five cabinet posts, including Deputy  President. With provincial leaders first in line and the NP's  senior negotiators also in with a claim, there are not many  cabinet posts to go around. There is unlikely to be a lot of  "after you" going on in the scramble for jobs.    Ultimately, the choice of Finance Minister will be made by  the new President. He will undoubtedly listen closely to his  party and to business. One scenario is that Mr. Mbeki will not  be given a cabinet position, but will be in the President's  office with overall responsibility for implementing the RDP.  This would open the way for Mr. Mandela to appoint Mr. Keys  Minister of Finance. He is, after all, so far ahead of the  others on the election lists that this is a one-horse race.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-PRESS AIDE BRADY TO HELP THE DISABLED  </P> <P> Former White House Press Secretary James S. Brady, severely wounded eight years  ago this month during an assassination attempt on former President Ronald  Reagan, announced Monday that he has accepted an unpaid full-time job as vice  chairman of the National Organization on Disability.  </P> <P> In a dramatic gesture, Brady -- who uses a wheelchair most of the time --  walked with the aid of a cane in slow but steady steps from his wheelchair to a  seat at the microphone.  </P> <P> "The Bear is back for good now," he said, referring to a nickname he received  in college "because of the way I look," which was perpetuated by the Washington  press corps. "And you'll be hearing from me often."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recently Retired  </P> <P> Brady, 48, who recently retired from the federal government on disability, said  that he has learned first-hand "the frustrations and the cuts and slights" of  being disabled.  </P> <P> "You vow then to make it better," he said. "That's what I'm going to try to  do."  </P> <P> The National Organization on Disability, a private, Washington-based group, was  formed in 1982 to work to expand the participation of the nation's 37 million  disabled persons in the mainstream of their communities and to enhance public  understanding of disabled persons.  </P> <P> "Now that I'm one of those 37 million Americans, I know what it's like . . . "  Brady said. "I want to help the National Organization on Disability sensitize  non-disabled people to what it's like. . . . "  </P> <P> When asked to describe the kinds of daily frustrations he encounters, Brady  said: "Like going out for a meal and having no table that my wheelchair fits  under," adding, with a chuckle, "and having them take the table out and chop it  up for firewood."  </P> <P> Brady, whose wife, Sarah, has been active in the gun-control movement, was  asked how he felt about recent efforts to curtail assault weapons. "I'll keep  my advice in private," he said. "But I don't think you'd have to think hard to  know what my advice would be to our new President. Our law enforcement officers  say they are outgunned in the streets by assault weapons."  </P> <P> Brady suffered a near-fatal head wound on March 30, 1981, when John W. Hinckley  Jr., attempting to assassinate Reagan, fired several shots at the President as  he was leaving a Washington hotel.  </P> <P> Brady, accompanying Reagan, was struck by a bullet that touched his brain's  left frontal lobe before passing into -- and critically damaging -- the right  frontal lobe. As a result, motor functions on his left side were seriously  impaired. He cannot use his left arm at all and his left leg is debilitated.  However, his thinking functions -- his intellect, wit, personality and  long-term memory -- were largely unaffected.  </P> <P> Brady, who was injured only two months after the beginning of Reagan's first  term, retained the press secretary's title and salary for Reagan's two terms,  although he was unable to return to work.  </P> <P> "I think the doctors, in the early days, thought Jim needed it to keep him  going," Sarah Brady said in a recent interview. "I think Jim was always hoping  he could go back full time."  </P> <P> She added: "He is capable of filling many positions, but that of White House  press secretary was just too mentally and physically demanding."  </P> <P> She said that she and Brady had talked to President Bush before the  inauguration about "Jim's staying on," but Brady declined to accept a paid  position.  </P> <P> "Jim wants to contribute without feeling like he's on the public dole," she  said. "He wants to feel his own self-respect by not taking a handout job, even  though we know that's not what President Bush meant."  </P></p>

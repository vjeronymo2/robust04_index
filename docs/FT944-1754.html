			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Jobs prospects 'best since 1990' Next year will open with the best first-quarter employment prospects since 1990, says a survey by Manpower, the employment services company. Although manufacturers have replaced the service sector as the most optimistic area of the economy, employers in the energy and water industries are much more pessimistic. The survey - based on responses from more than 2,000 employers - shows 18 per cent are forecasting job increases and 16 per cent forecasting job losses, resulting in a positive net balance of 2 per cent. This compares favourably with the balance of minus 3 per cent recorded for the first quarter of this year, when 21 per cent of employers were predicting increases. Employers in retailing are particularly pessimistic about job prospects for the first quarter, forecasting a balance of minus 24 per cent compared with a net balance of minus 17 per cent when asked at the same stage last year. Only 6 per cent of employers in the energy and water industries are predicting increased job levels over the coming quarter, compared with 43 per cent forecasting a decrease, giving a balance of minus 37 per cent. This is much more pessimistic than the net balance of minus 24 for the first quarter of this year. Manpower says the survey confirms the recovery is manufacturing-led, with 24 per cent of employers in the sector predicting an increase in job levels, against 10 per cent forecasting a decrease. Regionally, the outlook is far more positive than a year ago, with nine regions forecasting job increases compared with just three last year. The east Midlands is the most optimistic, forecasting a positive net balance of 9 per cent, compared with a positive net balance of 3 per cent last year. The north-west of England is also predicting a very marked improvement from last year, with employers predicting a balance of 7 per cent next quarter, compared with minus 20 for the first quarter of this year. Only Scotland and the south of England are forecasting a worse position than last year, although neither area is predicting net job losses. Employers in the south recorded a positive net balance of 4 per cent, compared with the 11 per cent forecast for the first three months of this year.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT FRIED CHICKEN;  </P> <P> HIGH FLYING BIRDS  </P> <P> You can tell a lot about a chef from the fried chicken he or she cooks. If,  that is, you can find a chef who cooks fried chicken.  </P> <P> Most real chefs don't consider the dish worthy of them. But I do remember  having a particularly opulent fried chicken once at Trumps. Chef Michael  Roberts had stuffed foie gras under the skin, then battered the bird and fried  it. It was probably a dish that shortened your life every time you tasted it,  which may be why the fried chicken that is now on Trumps menu is sans foie  gras.  </P> <P> It's still a pretty flamboyant bit of bird -- large, heavily battered and fried  so crisp it has an audible crunch. It comes with very good mashed potatoes and  gravy, and excellent slightly bitter greens. The chicken itself, however, while  moist and tender, is so heavily battered that it just doesn't have much taste.  Close your eyes and it could be fried anything.  </P> <P> Duplex is one of the few other upscale restaurants in town that offers fried  chicken every night. But chef Mark Carter makes a different sort of bird.  There's nothing flamboyant about his modest plate of fried chicken; in fact it  looks exactly like something your Aunt Millie might have made. This homey  chicken is not too heavily battered and has a nice sprinkling of salt on the  outside of the skin. It comes with fine homemade cole slaw too, and would be a  perfect choice on a night you really wanted fried chicken but were paralyzed by  fear of frying.  </P> <P> The very best fried chicken I've ever tasted? Without question it was the one  made by Judy Rodgers at the Union Hotel in Benicia, just north of San  Francisco. What made this chicken special was that once you got beneath the  crisp coating your teeth bit into moist flesh that shot a rush of pure chicken  flavor into your mouth. Judy Rodgers is now at San Francisco's Zuni Cafe, where  the only chicken she cooks is baked in a wood-burning oven. But I called to ask  what she had done to make her fried chicken so special. "Nothing really," she  said. "We used chickens that had some character to begin with, but the main  thing is that I cured them in rock salt for two hours. I believe that the salt  concentrates the flavor and makes the chicken both firmer and more tender. Then  I rinsed off the salt and soaked the chicken in buttermilk for another two  hours to extract the salt. After that I dried the pieces of chicken and floured  them and then let them rest for four to eight hours until they got a hard  crust. And then I fried them -- very carefully." RUTH REICHL  </P></p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Receiverships on downward trend THE NUMBER of companies passing into receivership and administration has declined for the seventh successive month compared with the corresponding period a year before, according to figures released yesterday. There were 327 appointments in August compared with 474 in July and 464 in August last year, an analysis by accountants Touche Ross, based on the official London and Edinburgh Gazettes, has revealed. Mr Christopher Morris, head of corporate special services at Touche Ross, said he remained 'cautiously optimistic' the downward trend would continue. He stressed that the decline depended on lenders 'not losing their nerve' about businesses' ability to survive. The total number of appointments so far this year is 3,519 compared with 3,928 at the same time last year. Mr Morris estimated that with the current trend there will be about 5,200 by the end of the year compared with 5,734 last year. There remained many difficulties in the motor trade, hotel and catering, and wholesale distribution, he explained. Manufacturing appointments declined to 79 for August, compared with an average monthly total of 120 in the year so far.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Books: Strange worlds and wise outlaws - Fiction Nubia played Professor Longhair and Big Mama Thornton to Egypt's Elvis: who else but Tom Robbins could see the mingling of ancient civilisations in such terms? With his second novel, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Robbins perfected his technique of audacious prose and cosmic themes, earning himself a place as one of the wildest and most entertaining novelists in the world. His new work, Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas (Bantam Pounds 6.99, 386 pages), starts suspiciously like a yuppie novel: Gwendolyn, a 29-nine year-old stockbroker, weeps into her martini on a Friday evening after a day of crash, dreading the opening of the markets on Monday morning. Her weekend turns out not to be occupied with thoughts of bulls and bears, however, but with frogs, an escaped monkey with a taste for burglary, magic mushrooms from outer space, a cure for cancer and the future of the human race as well as romance with the staple Robbins figure, the wise-cracking outlaw, bearer of both fun and enlightenment. 'Mist from the sea covers the hill where a small army lies surrounded by a large.' The Ettrick clan is about to be massacred by the Northumbrians. This is the splendid opening of Alasdair Gray's A History Maker (Canongate Pounds 13.99, 222 pages), set not in a border war of the past, but in the 23rd century where warfare has become a spectator sport and a league table. There are pre-slaughter interviews with the generals and running commentary as the Ettrick clan is almost wiped out, all according to the Geneva Conventions. The first chapter is the strongest; the rest lacks narrative thrust, (though not pelvic thrusts), being a semi-satirical essay on how life should be lived. As with all Gray's work, layout and illustrations are as important as the writing. A worthy successor to Poor Things, and ample evidence that Scotsmen can write without obsessive use of four letter expletives. A fan of Alasdair Gray and, like him, someone who builds his work around quirky conceits is Will Self. His new collection of short stories, Grey Area (Bloomsbury Pounds 9.99, 287 pages), explores strange worlds which have mutated out of our own. 'There are only eight people in London and fortunately I am one of them,' is the start of the first story, concerned with the gruelling life of the puppet-masters of the metropolis: 'only 210,542 invitations to meals of any sort last year - and of those a good 40,000 were children's parties.' A demon lover, a model village, and office paraphernalia are other springboards for Self's bizarre flights of fancy, but the best piece has to be about Inclusion, a drug that makes watching television fascinating. Finally, the past. Didier Daeninckx's A Very Profitable War (Serpent's Tail Pounds 7.99, 192 pages) features Rene Griffon, a demobbed sleuth in Paris after the first world war who is hired by a distinguished Colonel to track down someone trying to blackmail him. Daeninckx is one of France's leading thriller writers, but A Very Profitable War is one for serie noire aficionados. The most satisfying sections of the book are the historical curiosities: the Colonel, for instance, has to put down a mutiny of Russian soldiers in France.</p>

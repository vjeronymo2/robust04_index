			<p>CSO     [Text] In the absence of gravity, many interesting  phenomena arise.    Water and oil mix, for example, and a candle flame takes on  a  spherical shape. The obvious place to investigate such things is  in the microgravity environment of space. Unfortunately, that is  still an extremely expensive ``laboratory'' where few have the  privilege to work.    One alternative is to conduct microgravity experiments on  earth, taking advantage of the fact that the force of gravity  approaches zero as an object accelerates downward.    In Japan, an abandoned coal mine shaft in Kamisunagawa,  Hokkaido, has been transformed into a state-of-the art facility  for microgravity experiments providing an unprecedented 10  seconds of free-fall time. That is twice the duration of similar  facilities run by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) and the University of Bremen in Germany.    The successful completion of the Kamisunagawa microgravity  experiment facility just slightly behind schedule in 1991 is the  story of clever engineers meeting challenges as they appear.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry launched  the  microgravity project in 1987, handing over management to the  Agency of Industrial Science and Technology. Construction began  in 1988, carried out by a consortium of four companies:  Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Mitsui Engineering  &amp;  Shipbuilding Co., Mitsui Construction Co., and Toshiba Corp.  <H5>  Overcoming Resistance </H5>   The vertical shaft at Kamisunagawa is 710 meters deep, or  twice the height of the Tokyo Tower. The bottom 220m of the  shaft is equipped with an air control system, an hydraulic brake  and an emergency stopping system. The rest of the shaft is  available for free-fall experiments. At 490m, this is long  enough to provide 10 seconds of time where objects experience  one-ten-thousandth the gravity they would on the surface of the  earth.    The experiments themselves are carried out inside a large  bullet-shaped capsule which weighs 7.5 metric tons, and measures  1.8m in diameter and 7.8m in length.    The capsule is not just dropped down the shaft, but shot  down  like a rocket. Moreover, it is not simply a matter of propelling  a capsule down a hole in the ground. Numerous technologies had  to be developed to speed the capsule down in a controlled manner  that wouldn't disturb the experiments within.    In the free-fall facilities at NASA and Bremen University,  the test capsule is dropped down an evacuated shaft, so air  resistance is not a problem. But at four-times the length, it is  far more difficult to create a vacuum at the Kamisunagawa test  facility. Instead, the capsule must be propelled downward with  enough force to overcome air resistance.    The original design called for the use of a superconducting  maglev system, but that idea was scrapped in June of 1988  because of cost and technical considerations. ``They told us to  come up with an alternative by September, and we were frantic,''  recalls Shigeaki Oobayashi, deputy general manager of  Ishikawajima-Harima's new business planning and promotion  department.    The alternative they came up with was a type of cold-gas  thruster system, similar to that used to control satellites in  space. Since air resistance changes with time as the capsule  drops, the engineers ended up placing 18 thrusters on the  capsule, each capable of turning on and off as the occasion  arises to ensure smooth control of the speed of the capsule.    Being an abandoned mine shaft, a variety of hooks,  horizontal  shafts and other objects remain in place. All these objects  disrupt the air flow and make it extremely difficult to analyze  the aerodynamics of the shaft. ``We didn't have the luxury of  being able to make armchair calculations. It was a constant  process of trial and error,'' Oobayashi explains.    To shield the experimental equipment from the vibrations of  this ``rocket,'' the capsule is actually a pair of nested  capsules, separated by an evacuated chamber. An extremely  delicate balance must be maintained at all times between these  two capsules: they must drop at exactly the same speed because  any contact would disturb the microgravity environment of the  inner chamber.</p>

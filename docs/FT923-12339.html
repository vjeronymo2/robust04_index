			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Milan probe widens net THE investigation into political corruption in Milan took another turn at the weekend with the announcement that Mr Silvio Lega, assistant secretary of the Christian Democrat party, had been served with an advisory warrant. Mr Lega, 47, is being canvassed as the most likely successor to Mr Arnaldo Forlani in the key post of Christian Democrat secretary-general. Mr Forlani resigned last month after failing to obtain sufficient support for his attempts to become Italian president. Mr Lega, a deputy from Turin, has been seen as having the necessary youth and dynamism to revive the party's fortunes after its share of the vote fell to 29 per cent in April's general elections. He is being investigated for alleged illicit financing of political parties, along with fellow deputy Bruno Tabacchi, former Christian Democrat president of the Lombardy region. Both said they had nothing to hide. Their alleged involvement brings to almost 70 the number of politicians, local and national, connected by Milan magistrates to a sophisticated system of rigged contracts and political kick-backs. Mr Salvatore Ligresti, Milan's construction supremo, was arrested last week for alleged payment of bribes to secure public works contracts. The next step in Mr Lega's case will be a request to have his parliamentary immunity waived. This has already happened in the case of five deputies linked to the Milan affair. The most damaging aspect of Mr Lega's alleged involvement is the nature of the accusations. Mr Maurizio Prada, a senior Christian Democrat politician in Milan arrested earlier in the magistrates' inquiries, has alleged that some of the money he collected through bribes and contract commissions were handed over to the national party. Christian Democrat officials maintained over the weekend that Mr Prada was spitefully incriminating others after his recent expulsion from the party. But such accusations and counter-charges will affect the forthcoming election of a new party secretary. The Milan corruption scandal also promises further developments on the contractors' side. Mr Ligresti is said to be co-operating with the investigation and for the first time since his arrest two months ago Mr Enzo Papi, the managing director of Cogefar-Impresit, Fiat's construction group, is beginning to talk.</p>

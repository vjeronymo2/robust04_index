			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Construction Contracts: Fitting out major retail developments TAYLOR WOODROW GROUP companies have picked up two retail fitting-out contracts, together worth nearly Pounds 5m. The first was awarded to Taylor Woodrow Construction Southern, Southall, for the Safeway store at Thomas More Square adjacent to St Katharine by the Tower in London. Worth Pounds 2.6m, this follows a Pounds 3.7m contract by Taylor Woodrow earlier this year to build the store. The second, a Pounds 2.1m contract at Watford for BhS - formerly British Homes Stores and now part of the Storehouse Group - has been awarded to Myton, another subsidiary of the Taylor Woodrow Group and based in Hayes, Middlesex. It involves extensions at both the ground and first-floor levels into the Harlequin shopping mall, together with refurbishment of the sales areas and a 100-seat restaurant. Both contracts are due for completion this autumn.</p>

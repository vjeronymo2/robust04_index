			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (15): Commitment to peace is at the core - The Arab-Israeli conflict still dominates foreign affairs PRESIDENT Sadat could not have been aware when he travelled to Israel in 1977, of the extent to which he was anticipating the realignment of international relations in the Middle East. While the peace treaty effectively denied the possibility of the Arab confrontation states going to war again against Israel, it was the collapse of the Soviet Union which confirmed the necessity of making peace. Gone are the days when superpower rivalry could be used as a lever in foreign relations. The necessity of establishing a rapport with the US is nowhere more evident than in the changed attitude of President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, once the most hawkish of Israel's enemies and bitter opponent of Mr Sadat, now a man praised by President Clinton for his positive approach to the Middle East peace process and once more a visitor to Cairo. Gone, too, are the days when the foreign ministry in Cairo was scarely able to stifle its frustration at the lack of consultation and controversial policy initiatives of the country's president. Mr Amr Moussa, the present foreign minister, is reputed to be one of Mr Mubarak's most trusted associates - and Egypt can but benefit internationally from the presence of Dr Boutros Boutros Ghali, a former minister of state, at the UN - and of Dr Abdel Meguid, a former foreign minister, as the head of the Arab League. What remains at the core of Egyptian policy is its relationship with the US and the desire to see the Middle East peace process succeed. Mr Mubarak emphasised in an interview with the Financial Times both his total commitment to help bring peace to the region and his belief that on the issue of aid the US should treat Egypt no less well than Israel. Securing President Clinton's support for a continuation of the annual Dollars 2.1bn in civil and military aid from the US had to be the primary objective of Mr Mubarak's visit to Washington earlier this month. In return, Egypt seeks to promote itself as a strategic partner, the most reliable Arab ally, and a persuasive force for moderation in the peace process. Egypt's strategic value was proved during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis when Mr Mubarak, angered by President Saddam Hussein's personal deceit about Iraqi intentions, moved with uncharacteristic haste to support, politically and militarily, the Allied effort to liberate Kuwait. But Egypt, along with most other Arab governments, is increasingly concerned about the longer-term political consequences for Iraq of the international boycott and the two air exclusion zones which threaten to divide the country into three. At present that concern is being expressed primarily in humanitarian terms. Mr Mubarak and foreign ministry officials stress the need to limit the suffering imposed on the Iraqi people as a result of their leader's actions. They argue that Egypt has legitimate interests in Iraq through the presence there of between 800,000 and 1m Egyptians, even though many of them have taken Iraqi nationality. There is no question yet of any formal resumption of diplomatic relations, but there are regular contacts at official level. Maintaining Iraq's territorial integrity is viewed in Cairo as an essential bulwark in restraining the ambitions of Iran, especially in the south of the country where most Shias live and where Tehran might hope to exert the greatest influence. Foreign ministry officials are rather more reticent, however, about the extent to which Iran may be seeking to destabilise Egypt, one of Mr Mubarak's most repeated themes before and during his visit to the US. Officials prefer to say that relations with Iran will be frozen at the present non-ambassadorial level until Tehran again speaks with a single, authoritative voice. It is also largely accepted in Cairo that the idea of Egypt and Syria joining the six countries of the Gulf Co-operation Council for the defence of Kuwait - the so-called six-plus-two arrangement - is not viable. Instead, what may be re-emerging is the Arab Military Industries Organisation, a body set up in the mid-1970s whereby the Gulf countries invested in armaments manufacturing in Egypt. The arrangement collapsed, amid mutual recrimination and arguments over money, after Mr Sadat's peace overtures to Israel. But Kuwait has now expressed interest in reviving the project. The main foreign policy focus, however, remains the Arab-Israeli peace process, which has been given a renewed imperative in Egyptian eyes by the extent to which radical Islamic groups are gaining ground in the occupied territories and more generally in the region. As the only Arab leader who speaks openly to the Israelis, Mr Mubarak is able to act as both conciliator and conduit, but with all parties also able to have direct contact with the US Administration it is also a role which has clear limitations. Where Egypt's experience is of considerable value is in the tactics of negotiating with Israel. As the only Arab country to have successfully concluded negotiations with Israel, senior Egyptians who took part in that process provide regular advice to the four Arab delegations in Washington on how best to proceed. Officials in Cairo are convinced that the principles of an Israel-Syria agreement on the Golan Heights are almost in place, and the key issues to be resolved are now primarily technical - that is, the timing of Israel's withdrawal, the security arrangements to be put in place, and the parallel moves Syria will make in normalising relations. Far more difficult is the Palestinian issue. But if Israel can be persuaded to table again the full agreement on interim autonomy (negotiated between the Egyptians and Israel at Camp David in 1978), the peace process could be given a significant lift. Mr Mubarak has been notably complimentary about Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister; an acknowledgement of the belief in Cairo that he may be the best chance the Arabs have of winning an agreement and that, as the president put it, the last train for peace may be about to depart.</p>

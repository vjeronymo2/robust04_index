The agreement was signed by the speaker of the Bosnian Serb  parliament, Momcilo Krajisnik, and the deputy prime minister of  the Moslem government in Sarajevo, Husan Muratovic, at a U.N.  sponsored meeting.    The agreement provides for opening the road which links  Sarajevo and Visoko via Vogosca, corridors linking the Sarajevo  Serb suburbs of Lukavica and Ilidza with Sarajevo's Moslem  suburbs of Dobrinja and Butmir as well as the bridge linking the  suburb of Grbavica with the Moslem part of Novo Sarajevo.    The agreement is to take effect on March 23 and U.N.  peace-keepers deployed in Sarajevo are to supervise its  implementation.    A ceasefire has been in force between Serb and Moslem forces  in the Sarajevo area since February 10. They have withdrawn  their heavy weapons from an area 20 kilometers in radius around  Sarajevo or placed them under U.N. control.</p>

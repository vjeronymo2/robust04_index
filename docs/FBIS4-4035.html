			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg, April 26 (XINHUA) -- The first  non-racial election in South Africa began today, ending 350  years of the apartheid rule in the country.    The historic elections are recognized by the international  community as a momentous event and the completion of the  transition from apartheid to democracy. The elections are the  final repudiation of institutionalized racism in the world.    About 22.71 million South African voters will elect a  400-seat national assembly and provincial legislatures during  the three days of elections.    An estimated 16.2 million members of the Black community, or  72 percent of the total number of voters in South Africa, will  be voting for the first time in their life, marking the end of  342 years of the White domination.    Twenty-seven parties, including the African National  Congress  (ANC), the National Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party, are  contesting the elections, with another eight at regional level.    Today is the first day of the elections, or special voting  day. Voters who are physically disabled, pregnant, infirm, aged,  and ill, and members of the defense force, police force and  national peace-keeping force, are voting today at about 800  special polling stations, both fixed and mobile, across the  country.    Hospitals, homes and care centers catering for more than 200  patients are fixed voting stations while those with less than  200 patients are being visited by a mobile station which will  remain at the institution until all those who wish to vote have  voted.    Most of the South African voters will cast their ballots on  Wednesday and Thursday.    On Wednesday and Thursday, 9,000 polling stations throughout  the country will be opened at 07:00 (0500 GMT) on Friday at  between 800 and 1,000 counting centers around the country.    Initial election results are expected to be released 48  hours  after the elections and final results may be announced by the  independent electoral commission on May 1 or May 2.    The ANC, which enjoys high reputation for its anti-apartheid  struggle during the past decades, is likely to win a sweeping  victory in the elections.</p>

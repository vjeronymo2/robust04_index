			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK, China seek accord on Hong Kong appeal court: Simon Holberton on the background to tomorrow's talks as Britain seeks clarification of Beijing's attitude When British and Chinese officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs assemble tomorrow in the ornate state rooms of the Foreign Office in London, the question the British will want answered is what Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong matters, meant by his recent comments about the colony's future court of final appeal. An attempt to establish such a court in Hong Kong before the 1997 handover to China has been an object of British and Hong Kong government policy since 1988. Both these governments regard the early establishment of the court - which will replace the judicial committee of Britain's Privy Council - as vital to their aim of ensuring the continuity of the legal system in Hong Kong. The court is at the top of the agenda for the London session of the Joint Liaison Group, a bilateral body set up in 1995 to handle the detailed implementation of the handover. China was given a copy of the draft bill for the creation of the court in May and the Hong Kong government has been anxious for Beijing's response. Time is running out. The Hong Kong government, which had hoped to establish the court last year, wants to see it up and running by the summer of 1996. To meet this commencement date a bill will need to be introduced into the Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's law making body, during February and passed by July. At the weekend, Mr Lu doled out succour and woe in equal measure. He reassured Hong Kong officials by saying that China still stood by a 1991 agreement with the British and hoped it could be implemented. This provided for the establishment of the court before 1997 and specified that only one of the court's five judges could come from a foreign common law jurisdiction. But the remainder of Mr Lu's comments will have Mr Hugh Davies, the UK head of the JLG, pressing Mr Zhao Jihua, his Chinese counterpart, for clarification. Mr Lu said that the judges appointed to the court would have to be reconfirmed by Hong Kong's post-1997 government. This question over the judiciary's continuity would appear to run counter to Article 93 of the Basic Law - Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution - which states that judges appointed before the handover 'may all remain in employment'. Furthermore, under the 1991 deal, Britain conceded China's wish to restrict the number of foreign judges on the court in exchange for the court's early establishment and passage through 1997. A senior Hong Kong official overseeing policy towards the court said Mr Lu might have been suggesting by his comments that the post-1997 government had to be seen to have authority - 'it needs to make appointments'. He conceded, however, that in Beijing 'there is tremendous touchiness about sovereignty' of which the remarks about judges may be just another example. 'That's what we've got to get sorted out (in London) this week.' One western diplomat saw in Mr Lu's comments simply delaying tactics. 'I expect it is more in China's interest to have the court established after 1997 than before. Then they can have who they want on it,' he said. The uncertainty generated by Mr Lu's comments is just one of the many problems facing the Hong Kong government. Its proposal for a court of final appeal has been opposed by the Hong Kong Bar Association and many members of LegCo. In 1991 LegCo voted down the Anglo-Chinese deal on the court, only weeks after it was secured, by a margin of 34 to 11. The Law Society, which represents solicitors, has supported the government's initiative. The opposition of the barristers and legislators turns on the nature of the 1991 Anglo-Chinese deal. They say it is in violation of the 1984 Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, both of which said the court 'may as required invite judges from other common law jurisdictions' to sit on its benches. The lawyers say the word 'judges' meant more than one of the five could come from a foreign jurisdiction. The government denies this, adding that the 1991 agreement was an elaboration of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and so supersedes both. Mr Ronny Wong QC, president of the Bar Association, will have none of this. 'We see any violation of the Joint Declaration and Basic Law as fundamental,' he said. 'We believe that the spirit of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law was to allow flexibility and that it is opportunistic to accept the 1991 agreement,' he said. 'Some cases may not need any overseas judges, such as New Territories land claims, whereas other cases, such as marine, may need more than one.' Mr Martin Lee's Democrats, the pro-democracy party in LegCo, has vowed to amend the government's bill and substitute the wording concerning local and foreign judges with the more acceptable text from the Basic Law. It has also won support from some of the pro-business Liberal party politicians. Mr Lee believes that it is not in Hong Kong's interest to set up what he regards as a bad court. If the government's bill ever reaches LegCo he may prevail, at least until 1997. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Smiths Industries A third of the 12 per cent increase in Smiths Industries pre-tax profits last year was due to acquisitions and exceptional items. But it would be churlish to take issue with Smiths' achievement in attaining record profits and earnings per share at this point in the economic cycle. With half of its turnover deriving from the deeply troubled aerospace sector, Smiths' management has deftly avoided the substantial problems encountered by other companies in the sector. Smiths' success lay in defending or enhancing margins in its three core business areas. In aerospace, for example, turnover slipped but margins were maintained at more than 10 per cent. In medical systems, they rose to an enviable 23.3 per cent, in the face of rising costs and the difficult US healthcare environment. Despite Smiths' small size compared with international competitors, its concentration on profitable niches has evidently insulated the group from the full force of recession. Moreover, the ample cash generated by the core businesses has been sensibly deployed on a succession of unspectacular but well-timed industrial and healthcare acquisitions. At present, the group's aerospace activities are dormant in profits terms. After a drastic restructuring, the awakening promises to be spectacular, even if recovery in the sector is still some years off. But investors should not be deterred by the delay. Analysts expect the group to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 130m-Pounds 133m in the year to next July, putting the shares on a modest premium to the market.</p>

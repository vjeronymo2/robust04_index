			<p>BFN     [Text] New charges of corruption have been made. A high  percentage of the $20 million that has been seized since 1988  has been a source for many people to get rich illegally.    The government points at members of the Special  Antinarcotics  Force [FELCN], trustees, and former lieutenant governors as  those who are involved in corruption. Two private law  consulting firms and the government have detected a framework of  corruption in the country, which has been operating for a long  time. The poor and criminal administration of the assets  confiscated from drug traffickers has led to the appearance in  Bolivian society of illegal fortunes, according to an official  document.    Since 1988 until 6 August 1993, millions of U.S. dollars  seized from drug trafficking have disappeared due to the  negligent and guilty actions of the FELCN and people who were  appointed by the Attorney General's Office as trustees of the  assets. Former lieutenant governors in the rural areas have  also been involved.</p>

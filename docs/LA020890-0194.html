			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: SEAU WILL APPLY FOR DRAFT, ADVISER SAYS  </P> <P> Junior Seau, USC's junior linebacker, is scheduled to meet with Coach Larry  Smith today to tell him he intends to be available for the National Football  League draft, Seau's legal adviser said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Steve Feldman of Costa Mesa said Seau "absolutely" will go through the draft,  rather than return to USC for his senior season.  </P> <P> Said Feldman, a lawyer-agent who represents more than 50 professional athletes:  "You have to consider the risk of injury and the opportunity to take advantage  of the draft situation."  </P> <P> Seau, the Pacific 10 Conference defensive player of the year, has received  early attention from professional scouts. Feldman said he hoped Seau would be  among the first five players selected in the draft April 22-23.  </P> <P> Smith was out of town on a recruiting trip and could not be reached for  comment.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikita Yermakov] </F>   [Text] Paris, 4 Jun -- An accord was reached here today  with representatives of the `Paris Club' of creditor states on  rescheduling Russia's payment of $7 billion on its external  debts this year.    Sergey Dubinin, Russia's acting minister of finances, said  at  a meeting with correspondents that the talks went on for two  days and two nights, and ended this morning with the signing of  an appropriate agreement. The rescheduling concerns the part of  the basic capital and the interest on it that Russia was to have  repaid this year. The $7 billion on which the accord was  reached will be paid back later.    Russia has achieved advantageous conditions for the  rescheduling of this part of the debt. The `Paris Club' has  granted a 3-year grace period, during which no demand will be  made for the money and after which the sum will be repaid over  17 years. A favorable interest rate will be charged on this  part of the consolidated debt.    The head of the Russian delegation drew attention in  particular to the fact that the agreement with the `Paris Club'  opens the way to agreement with other creditors. Corresponding  talks are to be held with the commercial banks, suppliers, and  private banks which make up the `London Club.' As a rule,  agreements are concluded with these crditors on conditions  comparable to the conditions of the `Paris Club.' In total, it  is a matter of a sum amounting to approximately $25-27 billion.    Last year an accord was reached with the `Paris Club' on  rescheduling payments on Russian external debts amounting to $15  billion, due in 1993. Sergey Dubinin stressed that Russia's  fulfilment of the obligations it had undertaken on this  agreement are inspiring trust in creditors who also understand  Russia's economic difficulties and the efforts of its government  to reduce inflation rates.    The total debt inherited by Russia from the the former  Soviet  Union amounts to $78-84 billion. The acting finance minister  stressed that the servicing of debts taken on directly by the  Russian Government since 1 January 1992 is on schedule. For the  time being the draft state budget for the current year, which is  being discussed by parliament, allocates $4.1 billion to debt  repayment. Russia will realistically be able to pay its  creditors after talks with them within the framework established  by the law.    He said talks would take place in the fall on a general  restructuring and consolidation of Russia's total external debt  and on rescheduling forthcoming payments. To do this it is  necessary to reach agreement on Russia's economic policy with  experts of the International Monetary Fund. Afterward, the  creditors will be able to hold talks on rescheduling the  payments, as a result of which foreign debts will cease to  pressurize the Russian economy.    Replying to a question by an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Sergey  Dubinin stressed that Russia attaches great significance to  participation in the upcoming meeting in Naples of the `G-7'.  We are expecting all its participants to confirm the policy of  cooperation with Russia as defined last year in Tokyo, he said.  No dramatic turns in this policy are proposed, he said,  although a change in accent is possible in connection with the  development of events in Russia. He noted the particular  importance of attracting direct foreign investments to Russia  which, alongside Russian capital investments, guarantee a way  out of the crisis.</p>

On 30 December a Serb carrying 1.5 kg of  explosives with fuses and detonators wanted to enter Austria.  The explosives were hidden in a traveling bag in the baggage  compartment of the bus that he was driving. The driver and  owner of the vehicle, who operates a bus line between Belgrade  and Switzerland, was not transporting any passengers. During  the interrogation, he pretended not to know anything: He said  that he was unaware of the explosives. The bag was to be handed  over to somebody in Switzerland.    The Serb was arrested. The purpose of the explosives was  still unclear on Monday [3 January]. It is not known whether  the material was to be sold for profit or used for attacks.    A link with the bomb threat against [Vienna's] Schwechat  Airport on New Year's Eve has been ruled out. It has only been  confirmed that the explosive found after the double murder of  the German border policemen on the "Danube Courier" train was of  the same "type."</p>

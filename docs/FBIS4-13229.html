			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, 18 Apr (MENA)--Lebanese Foreign Minister  Faris Buwayz has reiterated his country's refusal to "naturalize  and settle the Palestinians who are living inside the camps in  Lebanon, who number between 400,000 and 500,000." He stressed  that a solution to the Palestinian problem must not be at the  expense of Lebanon.    In an interview with the Lebanese newspaper AL-SAFIR  published today, Buwayz said that many Palestinians in Lebanon  want to return to Palestine or to other countries that will  provide them with better residential and living conditions. He  added that Lebanon cannot absorb such a large number of  Palestinians because it is small in area and also because of its  particular political structure; therefore it cannot provide them  with jobs or health, social, and educational opportunities.    He revealed that Lebanon has proposed to regional and  international parties a political plan for solving the problem  of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon by returning 20 percent  of them to the territories on the West Bank and Gaza that are to  come under Palestinian authority and distributing another 25  percent in some Arab countries where they could be reunited with  their families.    The Lebanese foreign minister went on to say that there are  some countries that accept expatriates, such as the United  States, Australia, and Canada, and these could take the  remaining Palestinians. He added that the multilateral  negotiations will not be able to solve the Palestinian refugee  problem until a comprehensive peaceful settlement in the region  is reached.    Buwayz called on the United States to deal more effectively  with Israel. He said that Washington has not played the role of  an impartial mediator and driving force and has not yet  exercised dynamic mediation, as it promised when the peace  process began.    Buwayz stressed that the Arab side wants to provide every  condition and opportunity for the success of these negotiations  despite the difficulties and Israel's tardiness, for our side  does not want to appear negative in the world's eyes.    He held Israel responsible for the collapse of the situation  in south Lebanon, stressing that Lebanon will never abandon the  principle of resistance as long as the occupation continues and  Israel refuses to implement Security Council Resolution 425,  which is based on withdrawal from the Lebanese territories.</p>

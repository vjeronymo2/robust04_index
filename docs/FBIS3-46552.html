			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comes out with an editorial article on the highly important  tasks for the promotion of the country's reunification set by  the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New Year address.    It calls upon all the Korean people in the North, the South  and overseas to wage a nationwide struggle, united under the  banner of great national unity, thus making this year that opens  a new phase of national reunification.    It quotes Comrade Kim Il-song as saying in his New Year  address:    "The principles and the line of our party and the government  of our Republic on national reunification remain unchanged. In  future, too, we will make every effort to reunify the country in  the form of confederation which is based on one nation, one  state, two systems and two governments, on the three principles  of independence, peaceful reunification and great national  unity."    The article says:    Our party and the DPRK Government did every possible effort  last year to implement the 10-point programme of the great unity  of the whole nation. But their effort was fruitless due to the  anti- national, anti-reunification belligerent moves of the  South Korean authorities.    As the South Korean reality indicates, the "civilian regime"  is only a disguise. It does not differ from the successive  military dictatorial regimes which had been indulged in  treacheries.    With the Kim Yong-sam fascist "regime" left intact, it would  not be possible to achieve national reconciliation and unity,  peace and peaceful reunification, nor would it be possible for  the South Korean people to free themselves from the colonial  yokes. It would result only in confrontation and war between  the fellow countrymen.    To check the clamour raised by the United States and its  lackeys under the pretext of the "suspicion of the North's  nuclear arms development" is a crucial matter to be solved  either for peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula or  for the international justice.    The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must on any  account  be solved through DPRK-U.S. talks.    Pressure or threat will have no effect on us. Such an  attempt may invite catastrophe, far from finding a solution to  the problem.    The United States must act with discretion, aware of its  responsibility and position as the very one that caused the  nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, and come out to the  talks with sincere willingness and fair attitude.    The three principles of independence, peaceful reunification  and great national unity which we have consistently maintained  constitute the nation's common reunification programme most fair  and aboveboard which fully accords with the Korean people's  demand for independence and their fundamental interests. The  form of confederation is the most realistic and reasonable  reunification formula which reflects the specific conditions of  the country where different ideologies and systems exist.    We will as ever make all efforts to reunify the country  through confederacy based on one nation, one state, two systems  and two governments on the afore-said three principles in  accordance with the policy of national reunification put forward  by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song.    All the people concerned for the destiny of the country and  the nation, whether they be in the North or South or abroad,  whether they be communists or nationalists, haves or have-nots,  atheists or theists, must unite with each other as the same  nation, transcending all the differences, and pave the way of  national reunification with concerted efforts.</p>

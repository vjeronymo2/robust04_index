			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Setting up a club - Investment clubs are coming to Britain AN INVESTMENT club is like a DIY unit trust with the members of the club deciding which stocks to invest in collectively. Tony Drury, managing director of ProShare Investment clubs, emphasised the importance of setting up the club safely using correct procedures. ProShare's Investment Clubs manual is a guide to how to do this and contains a draft constitution and draft club rules, suggestions for the agenda for the meetings and Inland Revenue forms. SIZE The ideal number of members, according to William Lowe, who used to run the NAIC and is now President of ProShare Investment Clubs, is 15 to 18  - partly because a larger group is likely to result in fewer people having a say in discussions. ProShare suggests that the club is organised as a partnership, for which the legal maximum is usually 20 people. However, some clubs are happy to be much larger (see below) but should take legal advice about their structure. WHERE TO MEET Although some clubs meet in members' homes, this can be a strain. Since the club is meant to be as much a social affair as a way to invest money, many clubs meet in the back room of a pub or in a hotel or restaurant. ProShare suggests monthly meetings in a regular pattern, such as the first Monday of each month. At its first meeting, the club should pick a name and elect a chairman, treasurer and secretary. SECURITY OF FUNDS ProShare says it knows of no instances in which a member of an investment club has run off with the funds. It advises registering shares in the name of the nominee company of the club's stockbroker as the most secure way of holding the club's securities. Since company reports and correspondence will then be sent to the nominee company, the club should arrange with its stockbroker that the material is forwarded to it. Another common method of holding the assets is to appoint two or three members as trustees and register the shares in their name. A club will also need a bank or building society account in which to hold liquid assets. The account should be in the name of the club with cheques requiring the signature of at least two members. KEEPING ACCOUNT ProShare suggests that members probably need about Pounds 500 before it is worthwhile making their first stock market investment. It is up to the club to set the level of contributions and whether these should be collected in a lump sum or on a regular basis. The club should also decide whether it wants to pay out a dividend to members or reinvest the income. Since members will drop out of the club, or some will want to encash their holdings, it is essential to have an easy method to determine who owns what. The unit valuation system is probably the simplest way to do this. The club needs to set the initial value of units - Pounds 1 is the easiest number. If members contribute Pounds 30 each at the first meeting, they will each hold 30 units. To obtain the value of a unit at any future date, the club's net assets (its investments and cash in hand, minus liabilities) should be divided by the number of units bought by members. A member will then be able to calculate the value of his or her investment based on the number of units held. LEAVING THE CLUB Members should give notice if they want to encash units or leave the club. ProShare suggests that they should be required to give warning of their intention before the next meeting and that the rules of the club should state a maximum period of three months before a payout. Although the payout will often be made much sooner, the 90-day clause should cover the club for the amount of time it might take to pay several members giving notice.</p>

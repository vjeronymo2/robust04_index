			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Nestle tightens links with San Pellegrino NESTLE, the Swiss foods group which controls Perrier, has tightened links with Italy's leading mineral water brand, San Pellegrino, by lifting its stake from 20 per cent to 25 per cent, writes Haig Simonian. The stake is being acquired for an undisclosed sum from the Mentasti family, which controls two thirds of the capital. The purchase has been accompanied by an agreement for Nestle to distribute San Pellegrino products in France and Belgium. Links between Perrier, which Nestle bought last year after a battle with the Agnelli family, and San Pellegrino stretch back some time. Perrier bought 35 per cent of the Italian brand in 1972 and disposed of 15 per cent last year.</p>

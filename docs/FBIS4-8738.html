			<p>BFN     [Text] Immediately prior to this broadcast a radio link was  established with Gorazde, from where we have the news that a  NATO plane has been hit above Gorazde, that it is in flames and  that the pilot has bailed out. This was stated to us by Dr.  Safet Cibo, a doctor in Gorazde hospital.    Let us listen to a recording of what Dr. Cibo said:    [Begin Cibo recording] They have just hit a NATO plane --  flames, the plane is falling, the chetniks are shooting. [end  recording]    And before this we received a report about the current  situation in Gorazde.    Unfortunately we have bad news from Gorazde -- chetnik tanks  from both sides of the Drina River are already on the town's  streets. One by one they are firing shells at residential  buildings. There is no one from whom one could get reliable  information about the casualties.    There is no one who could have envisaged what would happen  here in the early evening.    After the 18-day-long fierce offensive, after several  hundred  killed and over 1,000 injured, the chetniks last night attacked  two [word indistinct]. The assualts were from three directions,  but they were particulalry intensive from the Jabuka and  Ustipraca areas. This morning, the attacks were intensified and  during the afternoon they were continued and accompanied by  howitzer shelling of the town.    There were several infantry attacks on the right bank of the  Drina. Kopaci was targeted by multiple-rocket launchers, and  tanks from Ustipraca and from the north and south have been  constantly in action. [passage indistinct]</p>

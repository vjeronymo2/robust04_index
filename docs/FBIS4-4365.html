			<p>BFN     [Text] Interior Minister General Chawalit Yongchaiyut has  said that several bombing incidents as well as the sabotage of a  train in Songkhla Province today are aimed at toppling the  government.    This afternoon Gen. Chawalit called an urgent meeting of  officials concerned with security issues. Afterward, he said  the meeting agreed that more measures are needed to strengthen  security in areas that could be targets of sabotage,  particularly the four southern border provinces and Bangkok.  The meeting also held that the motive behind the bombings is to  destabilize the government. It did not discard the possibility,  however, that these events are the work of separatists.    [Begin Chawalit recording, in progress] ...the situation  occurred in areas that are probably target areas for harassment  by the opposition. These target areas are Bangkok and the four  southern provinces. Before setting clear measures to prevent a  reoccurrence of these incidents, everyone at the meeting agreed  that the main objective of the movement behind these events is  to create confusion and worry and damage the government.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Silvio J. Mendiandua (PRENSA </F> LATINA): "The Cuban Armed Forces: In Search of Capabilities for  Self-Financing"]    [Text] Havana -- The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba  [FAR], considering they have already secured their main mission  of guaranteeing the defense of the country's sovereignty and  territory, have been working on utilizing more efficient methods  to manage the economy, and the FAR has introduced multiple  initiatives to create capabilities of self-financing.    This is the prevailing atmosphere among the high command and  mid-ranking officers who have been charged with the complex task  of making affordable military activities on the island.    General Leopoldo Cintras Frias, commander of the Western  Army, told this reporter during a tour of regional installations  the FAR leadership is demanding its officers possess four basic  skills during the current economic difficulties. They must be  good fighters, politicians, administrators, and farmers.    The tour included visits to a chemical regiment, an  artillery  regiment, the San Antonio de los Banos Air Force Base, the  country's most important air base, tunnels for the defense and  protection of the people, and a rearguard combined forces  installation, among other places.    By opening certain installations that for more than three  decades had been closed to civilians, the military wanted to  convey several messages. One is that in case of an armed  conflict, the fighters' lives and technology will be protected,  made possible by the construction of high-protection tunnels  spreading for kilometers in areas that are difficult to reach.    There are arms and ammunition in those tunnels as well as  the  necessary infrastructure for production and logistical needs to  facilitate indefinite periods of fighting, something we noticed  in the fields of operations, as the military calls those areas.  Civilians will also be safe in those tunnels, which are areas  well protected against air, heavy artillery, and other forms of  attacks of mass destruction.    Consulted sources have reported the Cuban military has  creatively resolved the challenge of training troops for combat.  This training remains at a good level despite the break up of  the European socialist bloc (from 1989 to 1991), a situation  which produced an abrupt cut in the supply line for weapons,  fuel, and spare parts, which had existed for the past three  decades.    From the beginning of this process, the FAR, using different  types of initiatives, was able to save fuel and materiel  expended in training and was able to strictly maintain its  technology.    There is a strategy in Cuba that guides the Armed Forces in  conjunction with the situation and economic possibilities during  a period of severe currency-exchange shortages.    At the San Antonio de los Banos Base, for example,  electronic  equipment located in cabins similar to airplane cabins is used  by pilots being trained to simulate, on the ground, the most  complex combat situations. According to specialists, a MiG  training flight costs no less than $3,000 for fuel. The  electronic equipment represents a considerable saving.    Another relevant aspect is the new profile assumed by the  soldiers who are now engaged in agricultural works and business  operations they had never touched. Each FAR unit has  agricultural areas, raises livestock, and keeps poultry so that  the troops have dependable supplies in peace or wartime.    The efforts are producing results. The FAR covered 50  percent of its expenditures in 1993 with funds generated from  their own units.    The Armed Forces also work hard on the artificial breeding  of  fishes and industrial and artisan production, which is directed  at providing shoes, clothes, and utensil supplies that were  previously imported.    The FAR plans to be self-sufficient in tubers, grains,  fruits, vegetables, and spices in 1995 and be partially  self-sufficient in fat and beef production, an objective that is  both tactical and economic in nature. A special push is being  given to aquaculture as a quick and economically viable way of  supplying the troops with protein and securing the raw materials  necessary for animal food.    Military production requires sustained growth. Material  encouragement is used to secure it but, rather, without  disregarding moral encouragement, which traditionally has  yielded good results in the Armed Forces of Cuba.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Envoy sees a new state THE peace agreement with Palestinians could lead to the development of an independent Palestinian state, Israel's ambassador to the US said yesterday. This marks the erosion of yet another long-held Israeli taboo in the rapidly moving peace process. Mr Itamar Rabinovich said in a television interview both sides recognised that a permanent settlement to the occupied lands was 'an open issue' to be decided in talks in three years, but a Palestinian state 'could happen'. His remarks will fuel opposition by the Israeli right-wing, which plans a 100,000-strong demonstration tonight. Israeli officials continued to insist yesterday that the peace agreement with Palestinians could be signed in Washington by next Monday, once the Palestine Liberation Organisation concluded talks about issuing a letter renouncing violence and recognising Israel's right to exist. In a six-point text of the PLO letter awaited by Israel, published yesterday in the Hebrew daily Yediot Ahronot, the PLO is also expected to suspend the intifada, the Palestinian uprising, and agree to resolve future disputes between the two sides in a joint arbitration committee. According to the text, Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, will say: 'I am turning to the residents of the territories to return to a normalisation of lives between both sides.' Mr Rabinovich's comments on the possibility on an independent Palestinian state, no matter how tentative and exploratory, will further enrage Israel's right-wing. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the former Likud prime minister, yesterday declared that the Jewish state's 'very existence was at stake' and said he was puzzled and incredulous at the pace of the peace process. Right-wing settlers in Jerusalem said they would barricade the office of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, for up to two days starting today. Three firebombs were thrown into the courtyard of a Jerusalem hotel during a wedding yesterday, slightly injuring three Israelis, police said, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. Radical Palestinians opposed to an accord have vowed to attack Israelis.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Otis in second Vietnam deal Otis Elevator, the world's largest lift producer, has signed its second joint venture agreement in Vietnam since President Bill Clinton lifted the US economic embargo against the country in February. The Connecticut-based lift and escalator maker, part of United Technologies, is joining forces with Ho Chi Minh City's Construction and Elevator Company (CEC) to sell, install, maintain and modernise lifts and escalators in the southern part of Vietnam. Otis announced a similar deal in May with the Hanoi-based Lilama construction concern to cover the north of the country. The US lift company now has a majority stake in both of these ventures, in which it has invested a total of Dollars 4.5m. Otis Elevators has moved quickly since the lifting of the embargo, because it had been worried that its European and other rivals might move into the promising Vietnamese market. Otis claims to be the first international liftmaker to return to Vietnam. In 1929 it had installed one of the country's oldest lifts at the presidential palace in Hanoi, and formal operations began in 1950, only to cease in 1975 with the US withdrawal. Otis believes that, with more than 15m of Vietnam's 72m population living in eight big cities, there is substantial potential for new lift sales and service. Plans to redress the shortage of offices, hotels and industrial buildings should also promote demand. The latest joint venture, to be known as Otis Saigon Elevator, re-establishes a relationship with CEC, which under the name Engineco was the Otis agent in Vietnam from 1968 to 1975. It will initially employ about 50 people rising to an expected 250 within five years. Lifts and escalators will be supplied from Otis' new manufacturing plant on Penang island in Malaysia.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / CD CORNER: TRIO OF RELEASES SHOW PRESLEY'S INFLUENCES  </P> <P> Elvis Presley's influence and his influences are both saluted in a series of  new compact disc releases.  </P> <P> Item 1: "The Million Dollar Quartet" (RCA Records, 67 minutes) -- Though  available since 1988 as an import CD from England's Charly Records label, this  package marks the first time the 1956 summit meeting of Elvis and fellow Sun  Records artists Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins has been released  domestically. The album, which captures one of the most celebrated moments in  rock history, is a collector's treasure.  </P> <P> Presley, who began his recording career in 1954 at Sun, had already moved on to  RCA Records and become a national sensation when he dropped in at Memphis' Sun  studio in December of 1956 during a Perkins recording session. Cash and Lewis  were also on hand.  </P> <P> During a break in the recording, the four sang gospel, country and rock tunes  -- from "Peace in the Valley" and "Crazy Arms" to Chuck Berry's "Brown Eyed  Handsome Man" to "Don't Be Cruel" -- for more than an hour. Early in the  good-natured jam, Sun's Sam Phillips turned on the tape machine and captured  the session.  </P> <P> Because Cash's voice is hard to discern on most of the album, it has been  widely assumed that he left the session after a few minutes. But Cash said  recently that he was present during the entire jam. The reason he's hard to  hear, he said, is that Presley and Lewis, who took turns at the piano, played  the songs in a higher key than Cash prefers, so he simply sang some background  parts.  </P> <P> One of the highlights of "The Million Dollar Quartet" is when Presley tells the  others about seeing Jackie Wilson, then a member of Billy Ward &amp; the  Dominoes, doing a version of "Don't Be Cruel" in Las Vegas, apparently as part  of a Presley medley.  </P> <P> "He had already done 'Hound Dog' and another (song or two of mine) . . . and he  didn't do too well, you know. He was trying too hard. . . . But man, he sung  ('Don't Be Cruel'). . . . I went back four nights straight and heard that guy."  </P> <P> Item 2: "Mystery Train" (RCA Records, 40 minutes) -- Part of the appeal of this  score to Jim Jarmusch's moody but wickedly funny film is that it features both  Presley's 1955 version of the title track and bluesman Junior Parker's original  1953 version.  </P> <P> In addition, the album offers Presley's mid-'50s version of Rodgers and Hart's  "Blue Moon" as well as such other Memphis gems as Otis Redding's "Pain in My  Heart," Bobby (Blue) Bland's "Get Your Money Where You Spend Your Time" and Roy  Orbison's "Domino."  </P> <P> (Fans of Screamin' Jay Hawkins, the colorful early rock showman who plays the  enigmatic hotel manager in "Mystery Train," will be interested in "Voodoo  Jive," a best-of Hawkins package just released by Rhino Records. It includes  Hawkins' landmark "I Put a Spell on You.")  </P> <P> Item 3: "Mystery Train/Junior Parker, James Cotton, Pat Hare" (Rounder Records,  38 minutes) -- Elvis is shown on the cover of this album, along with Parker and  Bobby (Blue) Bland, though he isn't featured on the album itself. But it does  include nine songs (five of them previously unreleased in North America) by  Parker, one of Presley's many blues influences. The Parker tunes include  "Mystery Train" and "Love My Baby," described in rock historian Colin Escott's  liner notes as one of the first examples of black rockabilly.  </P></p>

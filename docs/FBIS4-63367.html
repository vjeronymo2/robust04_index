			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- Russia is not selling weapons  to North Korea at present, but has the right to do so as no  international sanctions have been imposed on Pyongyang.    "At present there are no international sanctions against the  People's Democratic Republic of Korea. Therefore, Russia, as  any other country, has the right to ship to North Korea purely  defensive systems of armaments and spare parts to them on a  commercial basis", a high-ranking government source told TASS on  Monday.    Pyongyang's foreign debt to Moscow, which remains from the  time of the former Soviet Union, exceeds three billion US  dollars and impedes commercial operations with North Korea,  according to the source.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hamid Barrada: "Total War"; first paragraph is </F> JEUNE AFRIQUE introduction]    [Text] In Algeria, the policy of dialogue with the  Islamists has hardly been sketched out, but it is being  violently combated by the Army. Here is the chronicle of chaos  in the offing.    "We have in our hands all the winning cards for success."    So said Algerian Minister of Interior Salim Saadi on 23  March. Quite obviously, his remarks have more to do with saber  rattling or the Coue method than they do with an even slightly  realistic assessment of the situation. Furthermore, to give his  speech a degree of credibility, he was speaking in Blida, the  center of Islamic fundamentalism. Prior to his speech, it had  been necessary to make a three-day sweep of the "city of roses."  Official result: 100 dead. By what miracle was it expected that  the inhabitants, whom fear or conviction had led to side with  the Islamists, would rally to the Army once the minister's  speech was over?    Alain Juppe, the head of French diplomacy, is closer to the  truth when he talks about "catastrophic deterioration." Losses  in human life were estimated at about 15 per day at the start of  this year, but they are much more numerous today. ACHARK  AL-AWSAT, which, along with AL-HAYAT, another Arabic daily in  London, provides the best coverage of the war, counted 1,000  dead in the month of Ramadan alone. The targets are police  officers, judges, journalists, and women, with deaths being  announced every day. There are also the anonymous victims of  reprisals carried out by the "ninjas." According to Amnesty  International, "the security forces commit murders and carry out  summary executions every day with complete impunity."    For their part, the guerrilla fighters have passed to a more  advanced stage. One Western diplomat says: "With growing  boldness, they are carrying out planned operations." It is not  rare for groups of 120 or 130 fighters to attack Army units  consisting of barely 40 or 50 soldiers. The demoralization among  loyalist troops is shown by the mass desertions, particularly  among conscripts. According to French intelligence reports, the  ANP [People's National Army] can count on only 40,000 men,  whereas the Islamic army can muster 10,000! That being the case,  one can understand why the generals prefer to withdraw to their  barracks even if it means abandoning entire regions to the enemy  (see the map, which was originally published in LIBERATION).  &lt;graphic&gt;    &lt;annot&gt; Key:     1. Spain    2. Morocco    3. Algeria    4. Dellys    5. Baraki    6. Algiers    7. Blida    8. Larbaa    9. Tissemsilt    10. Tiaret    11. Saida    12. Jijel    13. Collo    14. Mila    15. Tunisia    16. Libya    * The cities and towns "controlled" by armed Islamic groups  are Saida, Tiaret, and Tissemsilt in the west; Blida, Larbaa,  Baraki, and Dellys near Algiers; and Jijel, Collo, and Mila in  the northeast.&lt;/graphic&gt;     The situation is no more brilliant at the political level.  All hope of settling the crisis has disappeared. That hope  increased at the end of January, when Liamine Zeroual took over  as head of state. A former general who is minister of defense as  well as president, he seemed to be in the best position to seek  a compromise with the rebellion. And in fact, he was soon  talking about "serious dialogue" and "leaving no one out."  Discreet contact was established with the FIS [Islamic Salvation  Front] leaders in prison, especially Abbassi Madani and Ali  Benhadj. General Tayeb Deradji, his go-between in those  contacts, publicly mentioned the possibility of their release:  "If it can put an end to the violence, why not?" Meanwhile, two  other Islamic leaders were released. Besides, what was known of  the FIS attitude was not unreasonable. It wanted the leaders of  the armed rebellion to be included in the negotiations and asked  that its leaders be released in order to talk to them. Of  course, the whole problem would be to agree on a return to the  electoral process and on the transitional period. But nothing  seemed impossible, provided that the crisis was dealt with  politically instead of by the "total security" approach that had  been in effect for two years.    A few days later, the scaffolding had collapsed. President  Zeroual's policy of dialogue had hardly been sketched out before  being violently combated within the Armed Forces. The offensive  began on 8 March. International Women's Day provided the  occasion for denouncing plans to negotiate with the Islamists.  Picking up on the fact that "Zeroual" rhymes with "seroual"  ("trousers"), one not-too-subtle banner called upon the  president not to drop his pants [that is, not to lose his  nerve]! That slogan was taken up by a daily newspaper close to  the "eradicators." The funeral of the great dramatist Abdelkader  Alloula in Oran on 16 March turned into a demonstration against  "dialogue." In his funeral oration, Prime Minister Redha Malek,  a supporter of "eradication," agreed completely. Three days  later, the daily EL WATAN attacked President Zeroual by name. It  said in substance that his policy lacked military support and  was a long way from doing so. And that it was leading the  country into disaster.    The article in EL WATAN was a first. The press, whether  captive or diversified, had never before been seen attacking a  president who is not only an Army man but also minister of  defense to boot. It goes without saying that the newspaper was  not demonstrating journalistic prowess. The explanation is of  another kind altogether.    In the greatest secrecy and for three days running--16, 17,  and 18 March--the heads of the Armed Forces conferred on the  strategy to be adopted regarding the Islamic rebellion. Clearly,  the policy of dialogue advocated by Zeroual was no longer  supported by everyone. His fiercest opponent, General Mohamed  Lamari, chief of staff and commander of the special forces,  seemed to win out. The group broke up without reaching a  decision. Publicly, however, the president talked about  dialogue. The riposte came in the columns of EL WATAN.    That exchange--also unprecedented--was an extremely serious  matter. The "military institution"--"the most democratic place  in Algerian society," according to Remi Leveau--is in the habit  of settling its differences by consensus. By making them public,  it was in great danger of settling them by other means. Putting  it plainly, the cohesion of the Armed Forces was at stake. Steps  were quickly taken to limit the damage. And again by innovation.  On 20 March, the general staff published a communique stating  its support for Zeroual. The prime minister did the same.    Paradoxically, those gestures underscored the president's  weakness, since the fact is that a boss does not need the  support of his subordinates. Their purpose was to remind people  that Liamine Zeroual had been made chief of state to carry out  the policy of the Armed Forces, which now rule out any impulse  toward negotiation in place of all-out war. To make sure that  everyone got the point, EL WATAN did it again, followed this  time by all the publications reflecting "democratic" opinion.    What is more, it was learned on 21 March that the chief of  staff, Major General Mohamed Lamari, had been given signing  authority by Gen. Liamine Zeroual, minister of defense and chief  of state, with respect to "all acts and decisions, including  ministerial orders." One detail missed by commentators was that  that provision had been part of a presidential decree dated 5  February. This means that as soon as he took office, and even  though he continued to head the strategic Ministry of Defense,  the new president had wasted no time putting someone else in  charge of that ministry. It is true that Boumediene and Chadli,  as chiefs of state and ministers of defense, had also signed  such decrees. But the delegation of authority granted by them to  the secretary-general of the ministry was purely administrative  and could be revoked at any time. The circumstances in which  delegation of authority was granted this time and the  personality of the man to whom it was delegated show that  something entirely different is involved: Zeroual is the  official president and minister of defense, but the military  strong man is Maj. Gen. Lamari. The fact that such a situation  is being pointed out--and revealed--at this precise moment shows  which side the "military institution" is on.    That is not all. On the 22d, the big demonstrations held in  Algiers and other cities turned into a protest movement against  Zeroual and dialogue. The climax came at a press conference held  by the minister of interior in Blida the next day: on 23 March.  Let us remember that date. If, God forbid, Algeria sinks into  chaos because of a general civil war, Salim Saadi's speech will  have been largely responsible. He likened the Islamists  indiscriminately to the Khmer Rouge: "A small group of  uneducated fanatics who have been joined by delinquents,  ex-convicts, crooks, drug addicts, and a good many young people  from families whose conduct during the struggle for liberation  was not honorable." Okay. But what is to be done with them? Very  simple: "Apply radical therapy to stamp out for good this evil,  which is eating away at Algerian society and poisoning its  existence." Why has the said therapy not worked so far? Simply a  mistake in dosage, Dr. Saadi replies. "Now that we know the  correct doses to administer to combat this evil,...."    From now on, as another minister of interior said during the  first Algerian war, the only negotiation is warfare. How did  Algeria reach such a point? What chance does that  strategy--which is not a new one--have of succeeding?    Part of the answer will be found in the big escape from the  fortress in Tazult (former Lambese) on 10 March. That breakout  was undeniably a turning point in the war, if only because it  provides a more accurate idea of the balance of forces. The  operation was carried out by the MIA [Armed Islamic Movement], a  strong presence in the region. But it is not impossible, as some  sources claim, that it was planned in cooperation with the GIA  [Armed Islamic Group]. It is estimated that in all, between 450  and 500 fighters took part. And of those, 150 took the prison by  storm. With the help of accomplices on the inside, they got in  almost without firing a shot: only four guards were killed.  Before the operation, other units had taken control of strategic  points in the village of Tazult and on the main roads. The  number of escapees varies depending on one's sources, but it was  certainly higher than 1,000. A selection process took place:  Islamic militants--some 700 of them, including 400 sentenced to  death or life imprisonment--were freed as a matter of priority.  Common prisoners were allowed to choose. Only about 100 chose to  run. And they accounted for most of the fugitives killed or  arrested: 24 and 114, respectively, according to official  reports. The Islamists were immediately taken by car, truck, or  bus to various regions. Most of them reached their destinations.  Vehicles used in the escape were found in Annaba, Skikda, and  Guelma, three northeastern towns. The operation had lasted one  hour and 15 minutes.    The joint investigation conducted by the Ministries of  Defense, Interior, and Justice revealed serious dysfunctions.  Among other things, the general alert was declared in various  cities at 1915. But in Batna, 40 km from the prison, nothing was  done until after 2200. And Batna happens to be the home of the  Armored School (8,000 men) and the rapid intervention forces of  the police and the Gendarmerie. It was eight hours before the  first reinforcements, from Khenchela 200 km away, arrived. The  warden had submitted reports in 1992 asking that a cordon be set  up outside the prison. Other, more recent, reports dealt with  preparations for escape. There was no follow-up to any of those  reports. It is understandable why the tripartite investigating  committee produced not one but three reports in which each  ministry tried to cast the blame on the others.    Theoretically, it was in order to come up with a calmer  assessment of the Lambese affair--and of the increasing  deterioration of the military situation it illustrated--that the  generals held a conclave in mid-March. Their conclusions  reflected their search for a scapegoat and their relentless  pursuit of the same course of action despite the evidence. It is  not by abandoning the policy of dialogue--which, it hardly needs  stating, was never begun--that the Islamic rebellion is going to  be put down. Moreover, total warfare is not something new: the  Armed Forces have not tried anything else since the start of the  conflict--with the success that we all can see.    The only thing new is the call-up of reservists that was  announced by Salim Saadi in Blida. He was echoing certain  statements by "democrats" calling for the organization of armed  militias. Was he simply boasting? Whatever the case, if such a  call-up took place, it would do nothing to change the course of  the war. The number of reservists is estimated at 150,000 men.  By what miracle would their state of mind be any different than  that of the conscripts, most of whom flee the war when they do  not swell the Islamic ranks? It is certain that their  mobilization would be a gift from heaven for the rebellion.</p>

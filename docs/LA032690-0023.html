			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> LIFE AFTER WALL ST. -- RUDE JOLTS;  </P> <P> THOUSANDS OF LUCRATIVE FINANCIAL CAREERS CAME TO AN END WITH THE 'GOLDEN YEARS'  OF THE '80S. YET NOT ALL VETERANS OF THE BOOM ARE SORRY IT COULDN'T LAST.  </P> <P> For nine years, Scott Discount lived the classic '80s success story of the  young man who finds wealth and status above the restless gorges of Wall Street.  </P> <P> Now he's living a story that's more typical of the new decade.  </P> <P> Discount was thrown out of work last January when his employer, First American  Bank, closed the trading desk where he supervised the buying and selling of  yen, marks and other currencies. In the morning, when he used to wrestle with a  heaving, $400-billion market, he now drives a circuit of New York food stores  to drop off the cakes he bakes for his one-man enterprise, "Scotty Wotty's  Creamy Cheesecakes."  </P> <P> "This has given me a whole new perspective," said Discount, 32, whose high  school classmates voted him "most likely to succeed" and who earned up to  $150,000 a year as chief currency trader.  </P> <P> He is one of about 40,000 people thrown out of work at the end of a boom that  showered wealth on Wall Street for seven golden years. Investment bankers,  traders, brokers -- and countless clerks and secretaries -- have been cast from  fabled prosperity into a difficult present with an uncertain future.  </P> <P> It's a life of rude shocks: dwindling bank accounts, unemployment lines and  interviews with prospective employers who confide that they always considered  the Wall Street crowd overpaid and overbearing.  </P> <P> Some of the displaced lament that they will never again live in the comfort  they enjoyed in the palmy '80s. Others are finding that swapping the big bucks  for more free time and less pressure can be quite agreeable, thank you.  </P> <P> It's all a result of the worst Wall Street downturn since the Great Depression,  a recession that may leave employment in the industry 65,000 jobs off its peak  of 262,000 in 1987. The convulsions began with the October, 1987, stock market  crash and continued with the deterioration of the high-yield junk bond market  last fall and a slowdown in the pace of corporate takeovers that long nourished  investment banks with huge fees.  </P> <P> Giant financial concerns such as Merrill Lynch, Shearson Lehman Hutton and  Prudential-Bache Securities lost money last year. The collapse of Drexel  Burnham Lambert, mortally wounded by weak markets and legal problems, dumped  5,300 people on the job market last month.  </P> <P> In the New York area, securities firms have laid off 17,000 employees and  perhaps thousands of others have lost jobs at Wall Street-dependent businesses  -- law firms, financial printers, restaurants, limousine services and real  estate firms. But Wall Street's distress  </P> <P> touches all corners of the economy, and thousands of jobs may also be lost in  Southern California as the recession ripples through securities firms, pension  funds, insurance companies, thrifts and other concerns.  </P> <P> In their enforced idleness, Wall Street's displaced have had time to think  about the golden age that is quickly passing into history. Again and again in  conversation, they recall how people knew the good times had to end, yet they  spent without hesitation on the restaurant meals, East Side co-op apartments,  vacation homes and luxury cars.  </P> <P> They talk about F. Scott Fitzgerald's reflections on a time of ease and excess  seven decades ago. And they allude to places like Golconda, the jewel-studded  city of Indian legend.  </P> <P> "I told the young people to enjoy their stroll through Golconda," said one  former Drexel executive. "And I told them it wouldn't last."  </P> <P> Scott Discount had a trying time at the unemployment office the other day, but  it could have been worse. He found it reassuring to pull into a parking lot  filled with expensive cars (including a Mercedes); it was a sign that former  Wall Street peers were there ahead of him.  </P> <P> Sure enough, when he reached the line, one fellow ahead of him was from Drexel.  </P> <P> "When I heard I was being laid off, I was embarrassed, and at first I tried to  hide it from people," Discount recalled. "Then I decided, the hell with it --  now it's almost in vogue to be in this situation."  </P> <P>  It has been traumatic, he says, trying to adjust to the loss of a job that was  so essential to his identity. "People would ask you who you were, and you would  say, 'trader,' " he said. "In this situation, you've got to start to think of  yourself not as a job title but as a person who can solve all sorts of  problems."  </P> <P> The quick change of careers has left him with a few awkward minor problems,  such as the $1,000 Ralph Lauren suit he sent in for alterations before the  layoff and hasn't yet retrieved. He doesn't have much use for it now, since he  makes his deliveries in jeans and tennis shoes and never wears anything  dressier than khaki slacks.  </P> <P> Discount bakes his cheesecakes from his mother's recipe. He is selling several  dozen cakes a week to fancy Manhattan stores such as Dean &amp; DeLuca and  Bloomingdale's. He thinks he can expand the business quickly, but if it doesn't  work out, he's ready to reconsider his options.  </P> <P> He has had to abandon the idea of buying a house and he can't travel as much as  he used to. His new work also isn't as intellectually stimulating as the old,  he acknowledges.  </P> <P> On the other hand, he said: "There's not the ulcer-creating pressure, and if I  want to go to the zoo in the middle of the day, there's nothing to stop me."  </P> <P> He's a former Drexel executive, now working as a stockbroker and looking back  on the '80s as some of his happiest years. "There was no better place to work  on Earth than on Wall Street in the '80s," this veteran of two decades on the  street says.  </P> <P> Yet he believes that the pay and spending habits of Wall Street professionals,  and their opinions of their own worth, began to get out of line as the Dow  Jones industrial average moved higher and higher.  </P> <P> "We were the Indians who discovered gushers of oil under our tepees," said the  executive, who requested anonymity. "What does that say about our talents? I'd  say the money was a temporary demand aberration -- maybe not a function of our  particular operating skills. Anybody who assumed it would all continue was  foolish."  </P> <P> Once a colleague proposed that he hire a young man two years out of business  school for a salary of several hundred thousand dollars. "Nobody just out of  school should be making more than the President makes, I told him," he said.  "We didn't hire the guy."  </P> <P> The veteran doesn't now face a personal financial crisis because he held down  expenses and saved. He has owned the same house in suburban Westchester County  for more than 10 years. His two children go to public schools and he drives a  station wagon.  </P> <P> It isn't the same for all of his peers. He knows several who are struggling  with deep debts they took on to buy company stock, apartments and vacation  homes. Now some of them are facing personal bankruptcy; others, older men, are  trying to rebuild their careers at a time in their lives when they had planned  to cut back their work schedules.  </P> <P> "People accumulated all these things as trophies of new wealth," the veteran  said, "but they didn't earn them -- they borrowed to take them home. Now their  jobs are gone and their debts remain."  </P> <P> He would not guess by how much his income might fall this year from its former  high point, but, he said, he's happy to "get back to the basics of the  business."  </P> <P> The moneymaking excesses of the '80s were "sort of like eating Big Macs," he  said. "You eat a few, they taste good; you eat a lot more. Only later do you  find out about the calories and fat and cholesterol."  </P> <P> It was Thanksgiving week last year when Doris Lederer learned that she had lost  her job as sales-trader at Salomon Bros.' equity options and futures desk.  </P> <P> "It was a real surprise, even though there were signs that layoffs were  coming," said Lederer, who is 38. She was taken aback because she was No. 2 in  the department, had a good reputation and was supporting a husband who is still  in law school.  </P> <P> But losing her job helped her make up her mind to move on to a career that  would allow her more time with her family, if less compensation. Though she has  since had other offers from Wall Street, she plans to move this summer to  Phoenix and open, with her sister, a fashion accessories store they plan to  call Notorious.  </P> <P> Lederer moved to Wall Street seven years ago after earning a Ph.D. in  educational psychology. She doesn't regret it. "It was a challenging career at  an exciting time," she said.  </P> <P> A typical trader on her desk earned between $250,000 and $400,000 a year before  the slowdown, and some earned much more.  </P> <P> But her interest had been flagging. After the 1987 crash, trading was thinner  and competition for the client's dollar was tougher.  </P> <P> Lederer had grown tired of what she considered the "frat house  </P> <P> atmosphere of the trading floor" and felt that the firm didn't offer women the  opportunities it held for men.  </P> <P> And the hours were long. Lederer left home in Hoboken, N.J., just across the  Hudson River from the Manhattan financial district, at about 6:30 a.m., before  her infant son awakened. By the time she returned at night, he was cranky and  ready to go to sleep.  </P> <P> Often her job involved entertaining clients after hours, too.  </P> <P> Another Wall Street firm recently offered her a job that would have allowed her  to stay home a little later in the morning -- if she would promise to begin  selling on the phone before she left.  </P> <P> She considers herself part of a group that some have called the "new  traditionalists," people who are adjusting their careers to give themselves  more time for themselves and their families.  </P> <P> This year, Lederer said, she expects to live on half the amount she paid in  taxes in 1989. "And I expect the quality of my life to improve dramatically,"  she said.  </P> <P> The young investment banker acknowledges that he is pretty desperate for a job.  But he wouldn't think of working for the financial-services company executive  who interviewed him the other day.  </P> <P> "The guy almost said straight out he was glad the people on Wall Street were  finally getting theirs," the banker said.  </P> <P> The financier, in his early 30s, was talking through a speaker phone from his  Manhattan co-op apartment one recent afternoon. He has been spending a lot of  time studying his walls and ceiling, he said.  </P> <P> He said he believes he can land a job but worries that his next salary won't be  enough to cover his debts. It's a familiar plaint: He made several hundred  thousand dollars a year but borrowed heavily to buy two vacation homes and the  co-op, among other things.  </P> <P> He calls people who now criticize such borrowing habits "incredible  second-guessers."  </P> <P> "Some of us have gotten in jams by borrowing heavily, but others have made  fortunes with smart leveraging," he said. "Some people were saying in 1983 that  the expansion couldn't last, but it did -- it went on and on."  </P> <P> The banker concedes that the spending habits of his colleagues did influence  him to buy more and spend heavily on entertaining. "To be taken seriously by  these people, you had to live like them. That was business," he says.  </P> <P> As the wind scatters a blizzard of Wall Street resumes, some employers are  enjoying a buyer's market.  </P> <P> Among them are a few profitable Wall Street investment banks, commercial banks,  regional investment firms and foreign financial firms that are trying to expand  their footholds in the United States -- such as Nomura Securities of Japan and  County NatWest Securities of Britain.  </P> <P> Some of the Drexel Burnham Lambert refugees are starting investment-banking  boutiques. Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. has hired about 60 people from  the defunct firm, including corporate restructuring experts, commodities  specialists and money-managers. Another 40 of them have gone to work for County  NatWest.  </P> <P> But when some get hired, others may get bumped. While Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.  has hired 14 people from Drexel, it also has displaced some employees in its  Boston office to make room for six bond salesmen from Drexel.  </P> <P> Executive recruiters say that the job hunters in the top tier -- which includes  proven moneymakers -- seem to glide effortlessly to new roosts. There is also  some demand for younger professionals, perhaps in part because of their lower  salary expectations and presumed greater energy.  </P> <P> Life may be bitter for those in a middle group who have experience and have  commanded higher salaries but are deal "processors" rather than deal makers.  "These guys are turning right and left looking everywhere, until their necks  are stiff," said Robert S. Rollo, managing director of the Korn Ferry  International search firm.  </P> <P> Wall Street's new reality is reflected in the pay packages now offered  investment bankers with the minimum experience.  </P> <P> Before, a junior banker might have gotten a $50,000 base salary and a  guaranteed first-year bonus of between $50,000 and $150,000. Now the salary's  the same but the bonus may be $50,000 at the maximum, said Allan Stern, partner  in the Haskell &amp; Stern search firm.  </P> <P> The retrenchment has created some incongruous situations.  </P> <P> A recently dismissed trader found herself standing in line in a store with a  "$1 off" coupon for Pampers -- wearing the mink coat she had bought while  employed. "My friend who pointed it out was hysterical," the trader recalled.  </P> <P> She used to spend money without thinking. Now she's starting to cook at home  and goes to restaurants for the late afternoon cut-price dinner specials. No  more Broadway shows and after-theater dinners; she and her husband go to the  museums on Friday and Saturday nights, when the prices are low.  </P> <P> They're thinking about selling their East Side apartment before New York co-op  prices, which have fallen about 15% from their peak, fall further. Then they  may buy a home in the suburbs.  </P> <P> But the financial worries aren't as unbearable as the tension she and others  endured while waiting to find out whether their jobs would be cut.  </P> <P> "It's like they take you into this room, and a man comes in and says, 'I'm  going to shoot you,' " she said. "Maybe they do give you the bad news that day;  or maybe they don't and you have to suffer through it the next day."  </P> <P> In California, Deborah Wall, 34, found out that her Drexel division was being  closed the day after she made the first payment on a new house in Pasadena.  </P> <P> That was last May. She was shocked but not immediately frightened because she  thought she had another job lined up at Citicorp. It was when that expected job  fell through, in July, that "absolute and total panic set in."  </P> <P> Wall, who had been chief West Coast credit officer for a Drexel division, tried  to discipline herself to make 10 job-hunting calls a day and set up a number of  interviews. "If I didn't meet my goal, I'd feel like a failure," she said.  </P> <P> Wall didn't find a job last summer. She spent four months as a temporary  secretary and only recently landed a job with a venture capital firm.  </P> <P> It didn't bother her that she had to take a temporary step down in her career.  "The important thing was working and hanging onto the house," she says.  </P> <P> Her message for others considering careers with Wall Street firms: "If you're  looking for stability, you're not going to find it."  </P> <P> Financiers and traders get the attention on Wall Street, but more than  two-thirds of those who work there -- and most of those who have lost their  jobs -- are more modestly paid members of support staff, including an army of  computer operators, clerks, accountants and secretaries.  </P> <P> Since she lost her position as a secretary at Drexel, Nettie Buonomo, 68, has  worried about losing much of her hospitalization coverage. It was important to  her because she had a mastectomy last year.  </P> <P> She can apply for Medicare but says has heard stories about how inferior the  care may be. "I'm scared to death," she said.  </P> <P> Buonomo, who lives with her poodle, Rags, in her seven-room house in Avenel,  N.J., says she could use some extra money but hasn't decided whether to try to  find work again. "I should think about looking for another job, but I've been  too befuddled by what happened."  </P> <P> Buonomo, one of 11 children, describes herself as "one of those old-time  Italians who really know the value of a dollar." She wants to make it clear  that she's not crying poverty.  </P> <P> "I'm just sorry for those young kids who were used to making the megabucks,"  she said. "What are they going to do?"  </P> <P> Staff writer Lance Ignon, in New York, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

According to Lula da Silva, the  PT-PSB alliance that will be approved in a few days during a  meeting of the two parties' executive boards will be a national  alliance. Lula da Silva said he still does not know who will be  the ticket's vice presidential candidate for the presidential  elections, but he praised Senator Jose Paulo Bisol, who was his  running mate in the 1989 elections.    Da Silva said: "I am not the one to choose but Bisol has  become a better known and consolidated figure in national  politics." Lula da Silva also said he hopes to attract other  parties such as the PPS [People's Socialist Party] and the PCdoB  [Communist Party of Brazil] for a large leftist front but he  discarded agreements with the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party] and the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], which have their  own candidates. He said: "[PDT leader Leonel] Brizola has shown  some repulsion for the PT and said more than once that he is a  candidate and is not interested in making alliances."</p>

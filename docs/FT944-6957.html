			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Kippers that taste of Scotland - A small smokehouse in the Highlands I am not much of a fisherman. But I thought I was when, one early autumn evening, the MV Hectoria hove into the little port of Achiltibuie in the far north-west of Scotland. After just a couple of hours of fishing off the Summer Isles, I had in my possession 30 large, fat mackerel. In I strutted to Am Fuaran, the local waterside pub, holding my fishing rod like a sceptre and feeling like an emperor about to distribute largesse. Who, I inquired benignly, might be interested in the gift of a sack of fresh mackerel? I expected gasps of surprise and admiration. There were none. I expected people to queue up. They did not. One man, in that stage of inebriation in which the whole world is one's friend, said he might take a couple for his cat, but then forgot about it by the next round. I went to bed remorseful, feeling, even if they were only fish, like a mass murderer. The next morning, over breakfast, Lottie Ross, my hospitable B and B host, did her best to console me. 'There is nothing wrong with mackerel,' she said. 'It's just that here on this coast we can get about anything we like. For us crabs, prawns, and lobsters are normal, everyday things. My husband Jimmy will be back from Loch Osgaig in a while; I expect he'll have caught us a few brown trout for tea.' I felt a bit better. But I also felt curious. Amid all this ocean wealth, I asked Lottie, was there any kind of food from the sea - crustacean, mollusc, or finned fish - that she liked to eat but that was not a normal, everyday thing? Lottie thought long and hard. 'Yes,' she finally replied. 'Kippers.' For Lottie, as for most lovers of the smoked herring, kippers are a treat and not to be over-indulged in. She reckons that once every fortnight or so is a good average. 'You wouldn't want them more often than that - they make a very particular meal,' she insisted. Particular they are indeed. However rarely they are eaten, kippers seem to have a curious property - they are just about the most evocative, memory-stirring and nostalgia-producing food you can eat. Lottie agreed; she can remember eating kippers as a child growing up near the Clyde. She can even remember specific meals - the arrival of wooden cases of Loch Fyne kippers and the feasts that followed. Perhaps that is because Loch Fyne, a long, deep arm of the Firth of Clyde, is reputed to provide the best kippers in the world. When I put it to Lottie that the kipper was not a Scottish invention, but originated last century in Seahouses in Northumberland - I once spent a holiday there and it is their proudest claim - she was indignant. The kipper is as Scottish as tartan plaid, she asserted, and the world's finest. How could anyone prove that, I wanted to know. 'Just head down the road a mile and see a man named Keith Dunbar,' Lottie replied, 'he knows everything there is worth knowing about kippers.' And he did. Lottie and I were both wrong, it turned out. As a specialist who for more than a decade has been smoking not just herring but everything else under the sun - salmon, sea trout, eels, venison, duck, highland beef, wood pigeon, and Arran cheeses - Keith Dunbar has amassed great quantities of literature at the Achiltibuie Smokehouse. His enthusiasm for his art has done him no harm - he may work on the wild outer edges of civilisation, but last year Dunbar and his small company, Summer Isles Foods, won the BBC's Best Smokehouse award. I surprised him, hard at work in his smoker's apron, but he nipped off happily to his files to satisfy my curiosity. Neither the Scottish nor the English, it seems, can claim the invention of the kippered herring. The origin of the word kuppen, meaning to spawn, is Dutch, and was applied originally to the smoking of out-of-season salmon. Kippering fish is also a very old art, and was practised all over northern Europe for hundreds of years as a means of preventing spoilage. As early as the 1400s fishermen in southern England were talking about a 'kipper time' in connection with what now seems an improbable activity - an annual Thames salmon fishery. But do not imagine, I was warned, that the medieval kipper enthusiast sat down to the moist, fragrant, creamy textured and delicately smokey fish that the best kippers can be. One should not even imagine, in fact, that the medieval kipper enthusiast existed at all - heavily smoked to make emaciated, out-of-season fish a bit more palatable, heavily salted to give them maximum storage life, the dry and leathery kipper was eaten more through necessity than pleasure. Keith Dunbar, though, is hardly more complimentary about the modern mass-produced product. And anyone who has tried it will probably agree - today's frozen boil-in-the-bag supermarket kipper is a disappointment: not tender but soggy, not flavoursome but tasteless, not subtly toned but artificially colour-treated. Worst in this litany of modern sins, Dunbar asserts, is that some kippers have never seen even a lick of smoke. All this is partly the consumer's fault, he admits. 'We don't shop with our noses or our sense of taste, but with our eyes. Commercial companies know this and, invariably when we buy smoked fish, we fall for that superficial sales pitch - deep, dyed colours. It is a mistake every time.' Keith Dunbar's kippers are nothing but herring, salt and smoke. 'The mass-production companies would laugh at my operation here - they deal in herring by the truck-load,' he said as he showed me his blackened smoke kiln, not much bigger than a large wardrobe, that allows him to smoke up to 200 kilos of fish at a time. 'There are three things that are vital in kippering,' Dunbar said as he showed me brine vats and hanging racks, smoke flues and fire-boxes. 'The quality of the herring, the smoking process, and the kind of smoking wood used.' If Dunbar can get plump, high-fat herring from Loch Fyne he will; sometimes he finds Faroe Island, Norwegian or Icelandic herring better. Often commercial smokehouses will smoke their herring for just three or four hours with a smoke so hot it immediately forms an impervious crust over the kipper, preventing the absorption of smoke. In Achiltibuie herrings are smoked for 18 hours using 'cold combustion', a method producing slow, cool smoke. The real secret of a good kipper, though, lies in the wood shavings that generate the smoke. Dunbar uses only shavings from sherry casks: when these are imported by Scottish distilleries for whisky storage they are dismantled and rebuilt; the scrolly mature oak shavings that result produce a deep, fragrant, subtle flavour. Who eats kippers these days, I asked Keith Dunbar, marvelling at the invoices for kipper deliveries lying on his desk. What, for heaven's sake, could the Ramada hotel in Qatar want with more than 300lb of kippers? Who orders kippers at the Holiday Inn in Katmandu? All sorts of people will try them, apparently. But strangely enough there is a fairly well-defined kipper consumer's profile, Dunbar told me. Kippers are an upper-middle class product, eaten mostly by over-55s. They are favoured by the professional classes, especially those in the law, finance and the clergy. Most kipper lovers are conservative - they harken back to the days when people could sit back and enjoy a leisurely breakfast. 'There's something very emotional about the whole business,' Dunbar told me, mystified. 'There are large numbers of elegant London ladies who buy kippers for their fathers and uncles at Christmas. 'Daddy just loves kippers', they say to me. They have become so popular I have started a Kipper Club. For Pounds 50 you can have two pairs of freshly-smoked Achiltibuie kippers delivered to your door every 30 days for six months.' Elegant London ladies were all very well; I, however, wanted to put Keith Dunbar's kippers to the real litmus test - an exacting Achiltibuie woman I happened to know. 'Wonderful,' sighed Lottie Ross the next morning as together we tucked into a feast of grilled kippers, scrambled eggs, hot toast and strong tea. 'It has just that fragrant, smoky flavour I remember as a girl.' I had no distant, kipper-related memories to dwell on. But kipper-consciousness, more evocative than any Flaubertian madeleine, will not fail me. Next time I bite into a morsel of that tender, flavoursome fish, I know I shall find myself on the rocky shore of Achiltibuie.

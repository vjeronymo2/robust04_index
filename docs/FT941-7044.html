			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Strong final quarter checks Akzo fall Akzo, the Dutch chemicals group, succeeded in limiting the decline in 1993 net profit before extraordinary items to 2.7 per cent, thanks to a stronger fourth quarter and better results in the US. The company, which yesterday changed its name to Akzo Nobel to reflect its recent takeover of Nobel of Sweden, said net profit before extraordinary items fell to Fl 693m (Dollars 355m) from Fl 712m a year earlier. If extraordinary charges for restructuring and for book losses on divestments are included in both years, net profit fell by 15 per cent to Fl 549m. Group sales were down slightly at Fl 16.5bn, compared with Fl 16.7bn. The improvement in fourth-quarter net profit before extraordinary items, to Fl 173m from Fl 127m a year earlier, compares with declines in the first two quarters, and barely changed results in the third. Akzo, which is to leave its 1993 dividend unchanged at Fl 6.50, said the recession in Europe appeared to have bottomed out, and it predicted a positive trend for the company in 1994. Pharmaceuticals put in the best performance of Akzo's four main businesses. The sector generated around 55 per cent of Akzo's 1993 operating profit, even though it accounted for only about 20 per cent of turnover. The chemicals and coatings sectors turned in roughly similar results, while Akzo's fibre business posted an operating loss of Fl 21m, compared with a profit of Fl 127m the year before. The deterioration was blamed on difficult conditions in the European car and textile industries.</p>

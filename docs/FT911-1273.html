			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Party rivalry will focus on economy ALL THREE main parties are to focus on the economy this week as the Tories aim to take the offensive and the opposition parties seek to build on their successes after the local elections. Next week's by-election in Monmouth, held by the Tories in 1987 with a 9,500 majority, now holds heightened importance in the wake of the Conservatives' large-scale council seat losses with gains shared almost equally by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, are expected to join the campaigning in the constituency tomorrow. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrats' leader, will assert his party's economic credibility in a speech to the Building Employers' Confederation today. Mr Ashdown is to underline the party's commitment to an independent central bank and an early move to the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism. He will also spell out the benefits to business of the greater stability that is claimed for proportional representation. The aim is to emphasise electoral reform as the basis for successful policies across the board, rather than as an optional extra. Labour and the Tories rebuffed Mr Ashdown's weekend statement that any party wanting Liberal Democrat support in the event of a hung parliament would have to be committed to legislating to introduce 'fair votes' within the lifetime of a parliament. The renewed emphasis on economic policy began yesterday as Labour's economic spokesmen launched a concerted attack on the government's 'complacency' about unemployment and warned that the recession had not yet bottomed out. Labour is also intending to step up its campaigning in southern England, on the economy and the National Health Service. Mr John Cunningham, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, promised that if there were no June election then the party would give the govern-ment 'a long hot summer'. The Tories, meanwhile, seized on the weekend confirmation from Mr Smith that Labour would abolish the present Pounds 20,280 ceiling on national insurance contributions, to attack the opposition's reliance on higher taxes and higher spending. Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, said Labour's 'absurd' minimum wage policy might add 2m people to those out of work.</p>

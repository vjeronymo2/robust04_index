			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / The oil has not run out: The sector's comeback Out of sight and out of mind could be the motto of the UK offshore oil and gas industry as it prepares this week to observe the 30th anniversary of the first North Sea exploration licences. With most production platforms standing far offshore and support facilities concentrated in remote coastal towns, the industry's public profile has slipped below the horizon in recent years. Not so North Sea oil and gas production. In spite of a widespread perception that the UK oil industry is long past its heyday, the sector has this year staged a dramatic comeback with a surge in production that has boosted the trade figures and flattered overall UK economic data. Average oil output for the year so far is up by 29 per cent against 1993, according to figures from the Royal Bank of Scotland, with output recently running at about 2.4m barrels a day. The high rate of growth, which follows years of decline, has taken many City economists by surprise. 'Most people had been aware that oil and gas would expand over the next couple of years,' says Mr Leo Doyle, UK economist at London brokers Kleinwort Benson. 'But they had not expected it this quickly.' The main reason is that a sizeable number of new fields have been brought onstream over the past year and are building up to peak production. Among the larger ones are Scott, operated by Amerada Hess of the US, Enterprise Oil's Nelson field and Alba, operated by Chevron. Most were approved three or four years ago, when oil prices were considerably higher than the present level of about Dollars 16 a barrel for the benchmark Brent Blend. But the new fields have also benefitted from the extensive cost-cutting undertaken by the industry in recent years, as well as from efficiency gains brought about by new technology. Technology is also helping companies to extend the life of older fields and to exploit small accumulations which in the past were seen as uneconomic, another factor behind this year's surge in output. A case in point is the Gryphon field, 200 miles northeast of Aberdeen and is operated by Kerr-McGee, the US oil company. The 100m barrel field is considered small by earlier North Sea standards, but is typical of the type of fields that will need to be developed if UK production is to stabilise at its new, higher levels. To save money, the company forsook the conventional fixed oil platform, which would have cost Pounds 400m, and bought instead a tanker-like 'floating production and storage unit' for Pounds 260m, according to Mr Roy Phillips, Kerr-McGee's general manager in the UK. The cost advantages of ship-shaped production vessels are such that they are being considered for a number of new projects, including the first phase of development at British Petroleum's Foinaven field west of Shetlands, the most exciting new exploration area in UK waters. The industry's new ability to drill horizontal wells within the seabed has also 'transformed the economics of the field,' says Mr Phillips. Development costs vary according to the field, but many companies have been able to cut them by half with the help of the new seismic techniques and drilling methods. BP for example, with one of the most extensive North Sea operations, has seen its worldwide development costs fall from around Dollars 10 a barrel five years ago to between Dollars 4 and Dollars 5 a barrel. There have been similar reductions in operating costs, with some new North Sea fields reporting costs as low as Pounds 1 a barrel, although about Dollars 5 a barrel would be the average for the central and northern North Sea. That is higher than in onshore fields in many parts of the world, but low enough to ensure that the UK continues to attract the interest of international oil companies. Political stability, proximity to markets and the UK's extensive oil infrastructure are additional attractions. So too is the government's attitude toward the industry, although oil companies were divided last year in their response to a sudden change in the government's taxation regime. It had the effect of removing relief on exploration, but lowering the tax rate on existing fields. That pleased companies such as BP and Shell, two of the biggest offshore operators with extensive but relatively high cost mature assets in need of refurbishment, but was less well received by aggressive explorers such as Amerada Hess, which has just joined the top five North Sea companies according to value of assets. There were suggestions last year that the tax changes were likely to cause some international companies to pull out of the North Sea. But there has been little evidence of that so far. Instead, many US companies, including Amerada Hess, say they want to expand their operations. Conoco of the US this month announced it intends to spend Pounds 400m a year in the UK offshore industry to the end of the decade. Such plans will please a government clearly enjoying the benefits of the present oil boom. Second-quarter oil trade, for example, was Pounds 1.31bn in surplus, its highest level in eight years and nearly three times higher than in the same period last year. This has helped to allay fears that Britain faces a worsening balance of payments as higher economic growth leads to increased imports. For how much longer can the sector maintain this performance? Most experts think output will peak sometime next year, before settling at a somewhat lower 'plateau' level. But that will still leave output above 2m barrels a day until the end of the decade, even if world prices remain depressed. A study this year by Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based consultants, suggested that 59 fields likely to be considered for development over the next few years would be economic at the current price of Dollars 16 a barrel. In addition the government's latest licensing round showed strong interest in deep water areas west of the Shetland Islands and off the west coast of Scotland. That should ensure the North Sea continues to produce substantial amounts of oil and gas well into the next century.</p>

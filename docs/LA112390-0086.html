			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO MEN'S TEAM IS YOUNG, BUT TALENTED  </P> <P> Ron McClurkin said this will be his most challenging season as coach of the El  Camino men's basketball team.  </P> <P> In his two previous seasons, McClurkin has led the Warriors to the semifinals  of the state tournament. He has a 48-20 record.  </P> <P> McClurkin believes he has the talent to repeat the feat, but not the  experience. The Warriors lost their top eight players, including every starter  from last season's 24-11 club.  </P> <P> Gone are forwards Steve Leary (St. Mary's), Jamal Ross (Cal State L.A.),  Charles Evans (Sacramento State) and David Keeter (Cal State Northridge). The  backcourt will be without guards Larry Lockley (University of Colorado), Frank  Beatty (Ft. Hays State), Allen Caveness (St. Mary's) and Keith Brown (Hampton  Institute).  </P> <P> But McClurkin says that this year's recruiting class matches the 1987 class in  talent. In 1987, McClurkin recruited Charles White, David Lee and Kirkland  Howling, the nucleus of the 1988 state championship team.  </P> <P> "We brought in guys at almost every spot," McClurkin said. "These 11 freshmen  will have a good team this year, but next year they're going to be great."  </P> <P> Unlike recent seasons, El Camino has a balanced offense that can score  consistently from the inside and outside.  </P> <P> Steve King, a 6-foot-5, 195-pound freshman from Inglewood High, will add  strength inside. Jeff Crowe, a 6-foot-6, 225-pound freshman from Morningside  High, will back up King at power forward.  </P> <P> Former Redondo High standout Mike Houck will start at small forward. Houck, a  sophomore, is the team's most versatile player and best three-point shooter.  </P> <P> "He can play anywhere," McClurkin said. "We can't seem to get by without a guy  like him. We really count on him to do a lot."  </P> <P> Anthony Kyle and Mike Reynolds will probably split time at center. Kyle is a  6-7 sophomore who played for El Camino in 1989, but was academically ineligible  last season. Reynolds is a 6-7, 180-pound freshman from Narbonne High. Neither  player is a big scorer, but both are great rebounders.  </P> <P> The Warriors' point guard will be freshman Major Whitlock, a redshirt transfer  from the University of Montana. Whitlock was an All-San Gabriel Valley player  from Nogales High.  </P> <P> "He's one of the best athletes on the team," McClurkin said. "He's built, he's  a man and he can play. We needed someone like that."  </P> <P> McClurkin said the off-guard spot is the most competitive on the team. El  Camino has three talented players fighting for that position.  </P> <P> Rick Robison, the Warriors' prize recruit, is a two-time All-CIF selection from  Torrance High. He is expected to see plenty of playing time whether he starts  or not. Darius Dubose and Keishaun Darthard, two players off last season's  team, are also expected to see action. Dubose, who will rotate with Whitlock at  the point, is one of the team's better shooters. Darthard is known as a solid  defender.  </P> <P> The Warriors' key backups are Malik Clinscales and Major Goulsby. Clinscales is  a 6-6 sophomore who saw limited action last season and Goulsby is a 6-3  freshman forward from Narbonne.  </P></p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Israel cautious over Syrian offer on Golan Israel reacted cautiously to Syrian peace gestures yesterday after US officials said Washington believed Syria had broken new ground which held out the prospect of real progress when both sides resume peace talks next week. Israeli officials said Mr Dennis Ross, US Middle East co-ordinator, had sought to persuade the government that Syrian President Hafez-al-Assad had given firm guarantees to President Bill Clinton in Geneva on Sunday he would move to normal relations with Israel, including diplomatic and trade links, if Israel was prepared to commit itself to Syrian sovereignty over the entire Golan Heights. Officials said Mr Ross had also told Israel Mr Clinton and Mr Assad had discussed the possibility of stationing US troops on the Golan to meet security and demilitarisation demands. Mr Ross also reported that Mr Clinton had agreed to press for a public meeting between Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan and Mr Simon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, in Jordan when the US president meets King Hussein of Jordan at the White House on Friday. However, most Israeli officials believe Mr Assad made the minimum concession in Geneva which, while being an important step forward, fell short of the breakthrough US officials claim. They say Mr Assad, either in public or in private talks with Mr Clinton, did not go far enough to entice Israel to make a bold statement on return of the Golan. 'A comprehensive peace means different things to Assad, the Americans and to us,' said a foreign ministry official. 'For Assad a comprehensive peace still means the full withdrawal of Israel to pre-1967 lines including in Jerusalem and the linkage of all issues together and that is impossible for us.' Jerusalem also believes that, while Mr Assad has spoken for the first time in public, the words 'normal relations' meant little without a specific timetable. 'If Assad sees normalisation as the last station of our trip and the trip includes the resolution of all issues between us and the Arab world then that is far short of enough to help the government win over public opinion,' an official said. Other Israelis believe the Clinton-Assad summit has forced Israel into a difficult corner having won the Syrian leader an important US recognition of its central strategic role in the region. '(Assad's) main goal in the summit was reconciliation with the US,' said an editorial in yesterday's respected Ha'aretz newspaper. 'He achieved this to a degree which should worry us. . . without even ending his support of terrorism.' Israel says it will not make a formal response until the peace talks restart in Washington next Monday but it expects the peace process with Syria to remain a long and difficult road. Any territorial concession in the Golan to Syria may also have to be put to an election or national referendum. See Testing Mr Assad, Leader page</p>

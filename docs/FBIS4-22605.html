			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Larisa Ilyina, DELOVOY MIR correspondent: "A </F> Business Meeting, but Without Russian Businessmen"]    [Text] The interest of American capital in the Russian  market can be felt just as clearly as, let us say, the thrust of  a tidal wave on the parapet of a quay. Half of the presidential  mission of U.S. business circles headed by Secretary of Commerce  Ron Brown that is now in Russia is made up of the managers of  leading American companies, among which are such giants as  Occidental Petroleum, Rockwell International, AT&amp;T, and  others.  And, apparently, it is not accidental that almost all the  questions raised by the guests during a roundtable meeting with  Russian ministers were concentrated on one problem: guarantees  for foreign investments in Russia.    In responding to these questions, Deputy Prime Minister  Aleksandr Shokhin reported that the parliamentary committee on  economic policy was now developing a new variant of a law on  foreign investments. He expressed the firm conviction that a  bilateral Russian-American agreement on protection of  investments will be ratified.    The range of questions discussed at a meeting Wednesday of  the interdepartmental committee on the development of economic  cooperation was very wide: power engineering, trade,  investments, U.S. technical and financial assistance provided  along the line of the Agency for International Development, the  Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and programs in  the sphere of agriculture. Objects of special attention were  such critical problems as Russian tariff and nontariff trade  barriers, delays with payments, etc. A special working group was  established that will examine questions of access to each  other's markets.    A memorandum of mutual agreement of the Government of the  Russian Federation and the Government of the United States was  signed on the establishment of American business centers in  Russia, [a memorandum on] the scope of the jurisdiction of the  intergovernmental committee on the development of business  cooperation, and also joint statements of the cochairmen of the  Russian-American Committee--O. Davydov and Ron Brown--on the  question of access to Russian and U.S. markets and improving  conditions of cooperation in the sphere of the medical industry.    The American secretary, well-known as "a builder of bridges"  between our two countries, noted more than once that one of the  purposes of the visit of such a representative delegation (it is  made up of more than 100 persons) is "to listen to the voice of  private entrepreneurs and to give American and Russian  businesses an opportunity to start direct contacts." However,  our observer did not find one representative of domestic private  and joint-stock business at even one of the meetings. Even in  the council on the development of entrepreneurship under the  Government of the Russian Federation they replied to a question  on contacts with the American delegation that they...are hearing  this for the first time. Well, perhaps they will make up for the  omission--if not in Moscow then in Yekaterinburg or St.  Petersburg, where the American presidential delegation was  continuing its trip.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Growth in average earnings down to 3% in September UNDERLYING growth in average earnings fell to a historic low of 3 per cent in September, Department of Employment figures showed yesterday. The government's figures follow reports from independent research organisations, including Incomes Data Services, that basic pay settlements have bottomed out and may be set to increase again. However, the official figures cover more than basic pay settlements. For example, they include overtime payments, which after a slight increase in July fell back in August and September. The government figures show that underlying average earnings growth for the 12 months to the end of September fell to 3 per cent from 3.25 per cent in August. Separate sector rates were 2.5 per cent for services (from 2.75 per cent on August), 4.5 per cent in production industries and 4.5 per cent in manufacturing. The latter two were stable. There are two main influences on this fall in earnings growth, which is at its lowest since a temporary incomes policy in the late 1960s. First, the public-sector pay ceiling set at 1.5 per cent by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, is depressing average pay settlements and reducing the overall service sector average. Workers covered by the ceiling make up about one quarter of the sector. The second factor was that manufacturing output faltered in the third quarter of 1993, resulting in a decrease in overtime working in manufacturing. Manufacturing output per head in September grew by 4.9 per cent in the three months to September compared with the same three months a year earlier, down from 5.2 per cent in the three months to August. Unit wage costs dropped 0.6 per cent over the same period, a lower fall than in the three months to August, when they fell 0.8 per cent.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Charge cuts bank's income A CDollars 46m special charge to cover a US subsidiary's investment losses reduced the Bank of Montreal's third-quarter net profit by about 5 per cent. Net income for the three months ended July 31 was CDollars 172m (USDollars 125), or 61 cents a share, down from CDollars 180m, or 66 cents, a year earlier and 69 cents in the second quarter. Return on equity was 12 per cent against 14.1 per cent. The special charge stemmed from investment activities at Harris Bank in Chicago. Harris invested institutional accounts in mortgage-backed securities, which dropped in value when interest rates rose. Harris absorbed customer losses and itself took a special charge in its June quarter. Bank of Montreal's nine months' profit was CDollars 557m, or CDollars 2.02 a share, up 9.6 per cent from CDollars 508m, or CDollars 1.85. Return on equity was 13.6 per cent, which was little changed. The bank's commercial property portfolio improved, leading to significant reductions in non-performing loans which stood at CDollars 1.9bn at July 31, compared with CDollars 2.3bn a year earlier. The provision for credit losses for fiscal 1994 is CDollars 510m, against CDollars 625m. Strong revenue growth was fuelled by higher volumes in most sectors while average assets reached CDollars 124bn at July 31, up 14.8 per cent year to year. Non-interest expense, excluding the special charge, was up 6.6 per cent. Noranda, Canada's biggest resource group, is to build a CDollars 25m pilot plant to test its process to extract magnesium from the hundreds of millions of tonnes of tailings in Quebec's asbestos mining area.</p>

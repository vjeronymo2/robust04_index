			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Morse urges smaller council: Tripartite governing structure proposed THE COMMITTEE headed by Sir Jeremy Morse proposes a new tripartite governance structure for Lloyd's, with the ruling council cut from 28 to 14, a 14-member regulatory board and a 16-member market board handling business decisions. To maintain its pre-eminence in the insurance world and grow in size and strength, Lloyd's needs to handle more businesses centrally, says the Morse report. It says there is insufficient focus on one forum and too little sense of ownership by the market practitioners of the executive bodies acting on their behalf. The report says the council needs revised terms of reference which explicitly require it to safeguard the interests of Names and policyholders. The terms of reference would cover only functions it cannot delegate, such as legislation, discipline and special meetings of members - along with some overall budget responsibility. The reshaped council should have six working members, four nominated members and four external members and should meet less often than at present, says Morse. External members of the council should be paid about Pounds 15,000 a year. All business issues should be debated and decided by a Lloyd's market board which would take business decisions and absorb the role of the Business Issues Committee. Morse also says that: Board members should be elected by the market. The board would lead the market, decide on central business strategy issues, decide on major investments in new trading methods, set standards and maintain the capital base. The board would have a full-time chief executive officer leading a team of executives. Market associations for different sectors would continue, but a single market association should be set up which would nominate members to the Lloyd's Board. The market board should act in consultation with representatives of Lloyd's brokers. The report recommends that Lloyd's regulatory council should be distinct from the bodies serving the business interests of the market. The market board would be responsible for recovering costs from the market, but its proposals on central charges on members would go to the regulatory council for final decision. The report says the full restructuring of Lloyd's could take several years, but a transitional structure is recommended as a matter of urgency. The present post of chief executive should be succeeded by two posts, the chief executive office of the Lloyd's market board and a head of regulation for the regulatory council.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The rising cost of paying for Burglar Bill - Scheherazade Daneshkhu contemplates the increase in insurance premiums on home contents and tells you how to cut the costs PEACE of mind is becoming an ever more expensive commodity. Home contents insurance premiums are estimated by the Association of British Insurers to have risen by 20-25 per cent over the last 12 months, for the second year running. The main reason for premium increases has been claims resulting from the rise in crime. The cost of theft from homes has increased by more than 200 per cent since the end of 1989, to Pounds 749m in 1992. Insurance companies predict more but lower increases for the next year. AA forecasts a rise of 10-15 per cent in the next 12 months. Royal Insurance foresees increases of up to 9 per cent but General Accident says it does not expect any premium rises over the next year. But many homeowners may be asking why they should be shouldering the burden of the rising crime rate when insurance companies are once again making profits. Commercial Union, General Accident and Guardian Royal Exchange are all back in profit. Three other large general insurers, Eagle Star, Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance, have been dragged down by their exposure to mortgage indemnity claims, but should record profits within the next 18 months. Insurance companies have been able to push through such large increases in premiums because competition in the industry has declined. Over the past year, companies have concentrated on tightening underwriting by using more selective rating methods, reducing premiums for customers who agree to a higher excess and restricting cover, rather than trying to expand market share. 'Basically, insurance companies are more prepared to admit that the race for market share meant they accepted risks which were poorly priced. Now, more realistic premiums are being charged and the companies are less worried about customers going to another company,' said the ABI. Insurers have moved towards 'smarter pricing' by rewarding those with a low claims history, through the use of discounts, leaving the higher-risk customers to meet ever-increasing premiums. 'We have needed to respond to rising claims but we have tried to do it in a selective way and we are not looking to put through major increases,' said Prudential. The 'direct writers' which sell to the public over the telephone in the method pioneered by Royal Bank of Scotland's Direct Line, are as cautious about bad risks in the home contents market as they are in their main industry, motor insurance. Churchill, for example, will not take on anyone who has made two or more claims from its insurance company in the last five years. In spite of the fall in competitive pressure, there is a wide variation on premiums quoted for postcoded areas as the table shows. Although the claims for the area in which you live will be the main determinant of the size of premiums, it is possible to reduce premiums, according to a number of criteria. Age. Many companies will give a lower quotation to those aged 50 and above. Direct Line says its premiums fall by about 5 per cent for this age group while Royal Insurance will reduce premiums by about 15 per cent. Prudential will give a 20 per cent reduction to those 50 and above, having reduced the age from 60 years. 'Those who are over 50 are a better risk and tend to be at home more often. We want to pick up more business in this area and retain customers of this age,' said Prudential. Age Concern offers a special home and contents insurance package aimed at those who are 60 years and over but the contents are insured to a maximum of Pounds 20,000. No claims discount. Apart from no claims bonuses, many companies will give incentives to those who do not make claims. General Accident says that it will take up to 25 per cent off gross premiums for someone who has a record of no claims over four years. Churchill says it reduces premiums by up to 20 per cent for those with no claims in a three-year period and Eagle Star offers reductions of up to 20 per cent for a five-year period. Excesses. Most home contents policies have an excess of at least Pounds 50. Homeowners can often reduce premiums if they agree to a higher excess. For example, General Accident will reduce premiums by 20 per cent for a Pounds 250 excess; Countrywide will give 15 per cent off for a Pounds 100 excess, 25 per cent off for Pounds 250 excess and Pounds 30 per cent off for an excess of Pounds 350. Security. Many companies will reduce premiums for those who are members of Neighbourhood Watch. General Accident, which last year sponsored Crime Concern's Neighbourhood Watch conference, is the most generous giving reductions of up to 40 per cent for those who are members and pass security checks. By contrast, Prudential does not set great store by neighbourhood watches, preferring to give discounts of 10 per cent for fitting locks recommended by the Master Locksmiths Association and a discount of 10 per cent off the installation of the locks. Eagle Star, Countrywide and Cornhill also reduce premiums by about 10 per cent for fitting recommended locks. Some companies will not quote unless minimum security measures are met.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ANNUAL COST OF HOME CONTENTS COVER  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Companies and premiums (Pounds) Area                  AA  Churchill        CU   Cornhill  Cntrywide  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- London W9            433        284       351        645        351 Harrow HA1           162        237       293        435        302 Stevenage SG1        142        115       110        210        110 Swindon SN2          157        115       122        195        122 Manchester M2        423        333       389        645        389 Doncaster DN1        156        123       122        255        122 Edinburgh EH1        187        156       148        255        148 Aberdeen AB1         115        106        88        180         88  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Companies and premiums (Pounds)                   Direct      Eagle Area                line      Star*        GA        Pru      Royal  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- London W9            619      refer       318        404        388 Harrow HA1           417        319       396        290        220 Stevenage SG1        177        162       183        167        118 Swindon SN2          161        189       162        167        118 Manchester M2        522        479       471        486        388 Doncaster DN1        212        213       318        213        162 Edinburgh EH1        212        256       318        213        162 Aberdeen AB1         161        148       171        154         95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Premiums are based on a 3-bedroom semi-detached house owned by a married couple aged 30, both working full-time, contents cover of Pounds 30,000 (*Eagle Star, Pounds 35,000), no claims in last 12 months.

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A NEW IMAGE;  </P> <P> DENNY'S RESTAURANTS BEING REMODELED TO GET AN EDGE OVER RIVALS  </P> <P> The brown upholstery has been replaced by shades of mauve. Pictures hang on the  walls and live, green plants are tucked between the tables.  </P> <P> Mini-blinds have replaced curtains, and waiters and waitresses wear neat  green-pinstriped shirts with green aprons.  </P> <P> This ain't no fern bar. It's the new Denny's.  </P> <P> The chain that has come to symbolize the definitive American coffee shop -- a  place where waitresses with names like Flo and Vera scurry about in white  nursing shoes with Grand Slam Breakfast plates lined up their arm -- is out to  update its image.  </P> <P> "It's more wide open, I guess. It looks like a Coco's," said David Buck of  Huntington Beach as he sat at a booth at a remodeled Denny's in Costa Mesa  sipping iced tea.  </P> <P> Denny's Inc. plans to spend $11 million this year to remodel 65 company-owned  restaurants in Los Angeles and Orange counties. By spring, 1991, the  Irvine-based company hopes to complete renovation of 146 Denny's outlets in the  two counties.  </P> <P> Company officials are banking that the new look will head off competition  ranging from fast-food restaurants and family-style chains such as Coco's and  Bob's Big Boy. Some rivals have already adopted a newer, cleaner look that  could give them an appearance edge on Denny's.  </P> <P> Sam H. Maw, president of the 1,283-restaurant Denny's chain, said similar  renovations at outlets in Arizona and Florida were so successful that the firm  decided to give its California restaurants the same treatment.  </P> <P> "Our sales and our customer counts are up in our remodeled stores," he said.  Denny's, a unit of TW Services Inc. of New York, had systemwide sales of $1.3  billion in 1989, according to Technomic Inc., a Bannockburn, Ill., industry  consulting firm.  </P> <P> Analysts say the make-over was long overdue for a chain that had retained a  look more closely associated with the 1960s or 1970s.  </P> <P> Denny's is hoping for "a little more upscale appearance," Maw said, while  trying to retain its identity as the same restaurant that legions of regular  customers know and love.  </P> <P> Maw had a first-hand look at customers' reactions to the change last weekend  when he and his wife ate breakfast at the Costa Mesa restaurant, one of two  Orange County outlets to be remodeled so far.  </P> <P> "A party came in and sat at the table adjacent to us, looked around and said,  'This certainly has changed. It's nice and bright and cheerful.' They were  presented menus and (one customer) said, 'This all looks good to me.' "  </P> <P> But he realizes that some regulars may not yet appreciate the changes. One  customer, he said, complained that the restaurant looked too much like a  doctor's office.  </P> <P> Denny's is trying to position itself as a quality, mid-priced family restaurant  serving American standards such as pot roast and chicken pie. Experiments with  such fancy dishes as stuffed trout simply didn't fit the menu, Maw said.  </P> <P> Denny's plans to launch a full-scale promotion highlighting its new look next  year. In the meantime, Maw said he is enticing new customers by offering free  meals on customers' birthdays and, to capture some business from fast-food  chains, promising service within 10 minutes on breakfast and lunch items.  </P> <P> At the Costa Mesa store, the staff says customers have been receptive to the  changes. "Everyone seems to like it better, said Rick Fields, a waiter. Some  customers, he said, note the upscale appearance and throw out quips like, "Gee,  I should have worn a tie."  </P> <P> </P> <P> DENNY'S AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Business: Family restaurants  </P> <P> Headquarters: 3345 Michaelson Dr., Irvine  </P> <P> Parent Company: TW Services Inc.  </P> <P> Top official: Sam H.

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: WEST NEWPORT: FOCUS;  </P> <P> WEST NEWPORT HAS THE RHYTHM OF SUMMER  </P> <P> The essence of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys echoes through the beaches and  neighborhoods of west Newport Beach.  </P> <P> It is an inspired setting where bodies bronze under soft blue skies and a  gentle warming sun . . . where friends and soon-to-be-friends play spirited,  impromptu games of volleyball in the sand . . . where boats majestically dot  the horizon while languorously keeping rhythm with the ocean. It is an  environment where surfers, as abundant as out-of-state license plates, dare  uncompromising waves that swallow the novice and propel the expert back to  shore.  </P> <P> It is a community where specialty shops -- hawking mostly T-shirts, bathing  suits and surf boards -- peacefully coexist with a diverse collection of  restaurants from seafood to ethnic. The dress code is simple: Neckties and  panty hose are non grata; swimsuits, shorts, jeans and black wet suits with  shocking pink, lime green or sunny yellow day-glo stripes separate local from  tourist.  </P> <P> West Newport is an older, better-heeled section of the city, and many consider  it to be one of its best kept secrets. Though the community is perched directly  on the Newport-Inglewood fault, residents remain unfazed.  </P> <P> There was a time in the late 1920s and 1930s when the city could barely give  away the land at $100 per lot. Several unwitting individuals and subdividers  did speculate on the land and built homes, but then the rains came and washed  out the houses. Swampland is like that.  </P> <P> Since the flooding cycle was bound to recur, some homeowners weighed the cost  of frequently rebuilding against the cost of taxes and decided to let the land  revert to the city. However, those pioneers who chose to stay in spite of the  flooding were vindicated when the Santa Ana River Flood Control Channel was  built in 1957. Property values in the area jumped to $15,000-$16,000 during the  1960s, $24,000-$27,500 in the early 1970s, to the current staggering price of  $500,000 for an oceanfront lot.  </P> <P> As a result, many of the homes in west Newport are old-money family dwellings  that have been passed on from generation to generation. Instead of selling and  realizing a quick, sizable profit, today's generation has opted instead to  remodel and update its inheritance. Consequently, the area is a charming,  eclectic combination of old and new. It's not unusual to find a quaint cottage  nestled between an older two-story stucco and a newer wood-and-glass  contemporary.  </P> <P> While hanging on to the family legacy may be rooted in sentiment, the sprouts  of free enterprise are blossoming as well. It is these closely held properties,  remodeled or not, that make rentals a huge business. Because the older homes  were originally built with bachelor units on the lot, current owners have the  luxury of living in the main house while generating as much as $500 to $1,800  per week in rental income.  </P> <P> There is one complication: Because residents are staying and because there is  such a large influx of non-residents who need to be accommodated as well, the  overcrowding has rendered parking a headache and traffic a nightmare. Add to  that the ritual of "cruising" Balboa Boulevard on weekends, and the situation  becomes, as one native describes it, "hectic."  </P> <P> City planners have taken steps to solve the problem by requiring two enclosed  parking spaces per unit on all new construction. And there are special driving  lanes for residents, whose orange stickers allow them to bypass normally  congested areas. But it isn't a panacea. The building restrictions apply only  to new construction; the older homes, most of which do not have garages or  carports, are exempt. In many neighborhoods, then, on-street parking is the  only kind available.  </P> <P> But there are prices to pay and compromises to be made in any situation. And  the life style of west Newport Beach apparently makes it all worthwhile to  many. So residents grumble quietly as they park the car, turn off the ignition,  gather their belongings, lock the door and begin the half-mile trip home.  </P> <P> It isn't so bad, though. Brian Wilson's songs still echo in the memory. And  that can make for very good company on the walk.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1988 est.) 6,584  </P> <P> 1980-88 change: +8.4%  </P> <P> Median Age: 31.0  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix: White (non-Latino), 91%; Latino, 7%; Black, less than 1%;  Other, 2%  </P> <P> By sex and age:  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 29.9 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 32.8 years  </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $26,231  </P> <P> Median household: $45,145  </P> <P> Average household: 53,499  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 25%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999: 29%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 25%  </P> <P> More than $75,000: 21%  </P></p>

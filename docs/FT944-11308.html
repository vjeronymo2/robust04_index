			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: German governance A consensus is emerging within Germany that aspects of the country's corporate governance need improvement. This is to be welcomed by the foreign shareholders who own a large proportion of the freely-traded shares in German quoted companies. Cosy boardroom ties between management, banks and labour have engendered a slack approach to delivering value to shareholders. The dismantling of some of these ties, combined with greater disclosure, will encourage management accountability to the broad mass of shareholders. Their legitimate desire for profits and dividends to be maximised should thus be better served. Despite the talk, there have so far been regrettably few tangible changes to German governance. Deutsche Bank and Daimler-Benz have set up audit committees - a step designed to correct some of the control weaknesses revealed in the two-tier board system. But their example has not been widely followed. No other German company has followed Daimler's brave lead in reporting its figures according to US accounting rules. None of the large German conglomerates has taken steps to unbundle itself aggressively with the aim of unlocking shareholder value. The impending privatisation of Deutsche Telekom could do the cause of governance a good service. So great is the company's need for capital that it will be obliged to woo international investors more seriously than any other German institution to date. Telekom should follow Daimler's lead and seek a full listing on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

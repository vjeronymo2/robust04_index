			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW VIDEOS: OUTDOOR FURNITURE (THE STANLEY WORKS; 1989)  </P> <P> THE DISTINGUISHING characteristic of outdoor furniture may be rough-and-ready  simplicity, but its construction tends not to be. Because the furniture  (chairs, benches, tables and planters) has to be sturdy to survive active use  and must be joined and finished to endure the elements, it should be built with  particular care. That means selecting the right wood, cutting the varied and  many pieces precisely, using the proper hardware correctly, and painting and  staining carefully. To do this you also need the correct tools, including a  chisel, bore bits, block plane, wood file, miter box, a hammer, a crosscut and  coping saws, drill and screwdrivers, among other items. Building outdoor  furniture, like building furniture, is a challenge, and one needs precise  directions if hours of frustration and failure are to be avoided. The  "Build-It-Yourself" brochure and video offer just that -- easy-to-follow,  step-by-step directions, well organized and adequately illustrated. It should  help the do-it-yourself handy-person. Available at select hardware counters or  order from The Stanley Works, P.O. Box 1800, Department PR89, New Britain,  Conn. 06050. ($14.95) Sam Hall Kaplan  </P></p>

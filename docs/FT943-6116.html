			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: Axel Springer profits jump 62% to DM52m The Axel Springer publishing group yesterday reported a 62 per cent increase in net profits to DM52m (Dollars 33.1m) for the six months to the end of June. Sales rose 1.2 per cent to DM1.7bn. The group said most of the advance was due to cost-cutting and strong earnings growth in the Bild newspaper business. Costs of materials fell 5 per cent and labour costs were trimmed by 0.8 per cent in the period, it added. Advertising revenues rose almost 3 per cent, led by a good performance from Bild. Overall newspaper sales rose 4.5 per cent, but magazines fell 3.5 per cent as increased competition affected radio and television listings publications. Rheinmetall Berlin, the German munitions and engineering group, said it expected parent company earnings to be flat in 1994, but made no forecast on group earnings, Reuter reports from Dusseldorf. In 1993, Rheinmetall's parent company made a net profit of DM19.2m and paid a dividend of DM7 per ordinary share and DM8 per preferred share.</p>

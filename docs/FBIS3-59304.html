			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ch'iu Ming-hui (6726 6900 6540) and Yang </F> Sheng-ju (2799 2573 0320): "Billionaire Politicians; Midas Touch  Financial Management Skill"]    [Excerpts] If the report of the assets of government  officials that the Control Yuan published on 9 October were to  be sent to Chin-shih-tang Bookstores throughout the province, it  would certainly make the bestseller list. Even though it might  not place first, it would certainly be the most captivating book  this week.    This special publication not only satisfies the curiosity of  the general public about the wealth of high officials, but it  also virtually changes the views of many people about  government. Everyone finds, to their astonishment, that without  money, one is virtually unable to practice politics.  Furthermore, money means not just NT$1 million, but NT$10  million, or even NT$100 million.    Of the 90 public servants whose wealth was published, it is  estimated that, surprisingly, 14 had assets of as much as NT$100  million, and if President Li Teng-hui, who bought a villa at  Tahsishan Village is included, one sixth of the public servants  have a personal worth of NT$1 billion.    Twelve of them are government officials, including Prime  Minister Lien Chan [6647 2067], Minister of Interior Wu  Po-hsiung [0709 0130 7160], Control Yuan members K'o Ming-mou  [2688 2494 6180] and Li Shen-i [2621 0135 0001], ministers  without portfolio Kuo Yuan-jung [6753 1238 1369] and Huang  Shih-ch'eng [7806 4258 1004], Examination Yuan President Ch'iu  Ch'uang-huan [6726 0482 3562], Judicial Yuan President Lin  Yang-kang [2651 3152 3263], Grand Justice Li Chih-p'eng [2621  1877 7720], President's Office Secretary General Chiang Yen-shih  [5592 1750 1102], and Deputy Director of the Planning Commission  for Recovery of Mainland China Yeh Chin-feng [0673 6855 7685].  To use the term "diamond line-up" for this top echelon of power  is no overstatement.    Not long after issuance of the Control Yuan communique, the  latest popular opinion poll fully reflected the people's  concerns. Fifty-one percent of the public felt that government  officials whose property holdings were reported had more money  than they thought. Another 46 percent of those interviewed  believed that these government officials could not have  accumulated their present wealth from their fixed salaries.    In other words, unless their ancestors passed tremendous  family wealth along to them, or unless they had a wife or an  investment advisor who was skilled at investing and managing  wealth to help them rake in money every day, these billionaire  government officials apparently deserved to be scrutinized by  Minister of Justice Ma Ying-chiu [7456 5391 0046], who daily  shouts his intention to crack down on grafters.    Careful scrutiny of this list of names shows some have lived  up to the story of "the sparrow that turned into a phoenix." Who  can imagine that an utterly destitute youth who had to go  everywhere to collect animal dung for his family use, could,  after several decades as a government official, suddenly shake  himself and become transformed into someone having a billion New  Taiwan dollars in assets. Challenged by the outside world, quite  a few government officials frequently "cry foul," saying that  their assets have been overestimated. However, for people like  Lien Chan and Wu Po-hsiung, who were born with silver spoons in  their mouths, whether they are truly worth a billion is not  important. Possibly more important is how this great wealth  should be handled.    Lien Chan, who has such good luck that even the sea gives  way  before him, and Wu Po-hsiung, whose only remaining constituency  is Alishan, but who absolutely will not withdraw from the race  for provincial governor, have been termed two immensely wealthy  government officials; they are indeed. The wealth of both comes  from land, and they also hold substantial bank shares. The  difference between them is that Lien Chan's wealth stems not  only from his father, Lien Chen-tung's [6647 7201 2639]  patrimony, but also from his mother who reportedly was also  quite adept at money management. In addition, he married Fang Yu  [2455 3768], a well-educated woman from a well-to-do family. As  a result of the combination of money and power, he has become  known as the most wealthy government official since the removal  of the Republic of China to Taiwan. This is no overstatement at  all.    Just how wealthy is Lien Chan? Leaving aside his large  tracts  of land and real estate, and just looking at the value and the  variety of the jewelry that his wife displays, for which  possibly a whole drawer must be set aside, is enough to shame  wives of officials who are not wealthy enough to declare their  wealth. This is because the jewelry that Fang Yu wears on each  occasion costs NT$1 million at minimum. Jewelry that costs less  than a seven digit figure is apparently not to her liking.    Therefore, people joke that if ever Fang Yu takes it into  her head to show off all of her jewelry, she will wear NT$3.5  million worth of yellow gold rings on her hands, diamond  earrings worth NT$2 million in her ears, necklaces of the finest  jade worth NT$1.2 million around her neck, brooches worth  several hundred thousand new Taiwan dollars on her chest, wear a  name brand diamond wristwatch and name brand clothing, and carry  a name brand purse. She will be like NT$10 million that can move  right before your eyes.    Given the Lien family's circumstances and Fang Yu's  background, the Control Yuan report figures may be somewhat low.  Other antiques and works of art are not included in the report.  People will find it hard to believe that the Lien family does  not have a single calligraphy scroll or antique worth  NT$200,000. Furthermore, the Lien family has invested more than  HK$170 million in establishing the Yungsheng Investment  Corporation, but information about how profitable this has been  is also lacking in the report.    Although the value of Wu Po-hsiung's real estate holdings is  far less, he has savings amounting to more than NT$42 million, a  figure that Lien Chan cannot match. Wu Po-hsiung's wife, Tai  Mei-yu [2071 5019 3768], does not come from a well-to-do family  like Fang Yu. Tai Mei-yu's father was killed in battle in  Southeast Asia during the Japanese occupation period; thus, she  grew up in the home of Wu Po-hsiung, Wu's father bringing her  up. For this reason, when the family land was parceled out, Wu  Po-hsiung received one portion more than the other brothers.    Wu Po-hsiung comes from a family of medical doctors. In  addition to the New Citizens Hospital, which he inherited from  his ancestors, he has quite a large amount of other property.  When this report on property was made, because of the difficulty  in calculations resulting from the different apportionment among  the brothers, there was some delay. Although Wu Po-hsiung  studied enterprise management, he rarely manages his own  finances. He has a special investment advisor to handle his  financial affairs. Tai Mei-yu may carry as much as NT$10,000 in  her purse, and if she uses it all, she can replenish it each  day. Like Lien Chan, Wu Po-hsiung also set up an investment  corporation -- the Chih-Te Investment Corporation -- in which he  invested NT$140 million to obtain tax relief.    Tai Mei-yu's and Fang Yu's jewels are as different as night  and day. More precisely put, her most valuable necklace is worth  NT$330,000. It does not qualify at all to be listed in a report  with Fang Yu's assets. Tai Mei-yu was formerly a teacher. Her  professional background, as well as the frugal character of the  Hakkas, means that Tai Mei-yu has declared only two necklaces,  and the two together are worth only NT$660,000.    Rather oddly, Wu Po-hsiung personally reported one red  dragon  worth NT$200,000. Reportedly, he has kept this red dragon for  almost 10 years. Originally, a friend suggested that Wu  Po-hsiung by this fish for his home so that he would have fish  and water, which would benefit the ambience and the atmosphere  [the Chinese word for fish sounds exactly like the word for  surplus and is a symbol of prosperity, and water symbolizes  renewed wealth]. Thereupon, Wu Po-hsiung personally selected  this red dragon. At first, Wu Po-hsiung pondered whether he  should declare the red dragon, subsequently deciding that since  it was worth more than NT$200,000, he should report it.    Wu Po-hsiung has no golf club membership since he plays golf  mostly when others invite him. Furthermore, some golf course  owners are his friends. Therefore, for him, a golf club  membership is not all that necessary. In addition, Wu Po-hsiung  and his wife have purchased nearly NT$100 million worth of life  insurance, which may be an extraordinary amount for a government  official.    Next August, Wu Po-hsiung may move to Tahsinshan Village at  Hunghsi in Taoyuan to become a neighbor of President Li  Teng-hui. The house that Wu Po-hsiung has purchased is only half  as large as Li Teng-hui's. His original reason for buying it was  that he wanted to maintain roots in Taoyuan while his old home  there was being renovated. In addition, the geomantic influences  at Tahsi are good, and he has ties there. So he bought a villa  there.    Today, thanks to the presence of Li Teng-hui, Tahsishan  Village at Hunghsi has become an abode of the powerful, and  prices have crept up too. Now, ownership of his villa alone  makes Li Teng-hui a billionaire president. By comparison with  Lien Chan and Wu Po-hsiung, Li Teng-hui has gotten ahead more  through hard work. Henceforth, more and more young students will  resolve to become president. Li Teng-hui has been in government  service for more than 30 years, four years as vice-president and  five years as president. He has virtually no inherited wealth,  but he has NT$44 million in savings, more than NT$7 million  worth of stock, a golf club membership worth more than NT$11  million, and jewels worth NT$1.8 million. This does not include  calligraphic scrolls and objects of art that others have  presented to him.    Maybe it is nothing out of the ordinary to have so much  wealth on a president's salary, but the man in the street may  change his view somewhat about political personages on this  account.    An example is Ch'iu Ch'uang-huan whose "sexual escapades"  were the talk of the town not long ago. Earlier, he often spoke  about his hardships and difficulties as a youth in an utterly  destitute family. The public learned, to its surprise, only  after publication of his wealth that this Examination Yuan  president has savings of NT$12 million, stocks worth NT$15  million, jewelry worth NT$3 million, and five parcels of land.  Furthermore, his son, Ch'iu Che-i [6726 2548 3015], and his  daughter, Ch'iu P'ei-lin [6726 0160 3829], each have a house  with a market value of approximately NT$20 million located at  Tishih Garden Square on Anho Road, East. What is more, Ch'iu  Ch'uang-huan is paying more than NT$100,000 rent on the house  that he is currently occupying.    Ch'iu Ch'uang-huan's son, Ch'iu Che-ying [6726 3548 3379],  feels that the public overestimates his father's wealth. He  cites as an example the land located at Turtle Mountain in  Taoyuan. He said that although these two parcels of land are  zoned for building, they are too far distant from a highway.  Entry is via a road that runs atop a ridge between fields.  Furthermore, this place has high winds and is damp; thus, the  value of the land is not high. Furthermore, land located along  some fields is being used to grow fruit trees and bonsai that  actually produce no economic returns.    Six or seven years ago, some friends of Ch'iu Ch'uang-huan  persuaded him to buy between 500 and 600 ping of land at Turtle  Mountain. At first, some members of his family were opposed, and  later on when it was found that this land was too much off the  beaten track for development, it was decided to sell it in 1993.  But there were no takers. The Ch'iu family's financial affairs  -- particularly stock purchases -- are the responsibility of  Ch'iu Ch'uang-huan's wife, Bai Ling-yu [4101 6875 3768]. Except  for the buying of land, Ch'iu Ch'uang-huan seldom asks about any  other investments.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ranking of Billionaire Government Officials                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ranking     |Official Po-|Name        |NT$ Value o-|NT$ Value o-|Total NT$ V-|  |            |sition      |            |f Real Esta-|f Movable P-|alue        |  |            |            |            |te          |roperty     |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1           |Prime Minis-|Lien Chan   |More than 70|More than 1.|1.82 billion|  |            |ter         |            |0 million   |12 billion  |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2           |Minister of |Wu Po-hsiung|256 million |284 million |540 million |  |            |Interior    |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |3           |Control Yua-|K'o Ming-mou|330 million |21.4 million|More than 35|  |            |n member    |            |            |            |0 million   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |4           |Deputy Chai-|Yeh Chin-fe-|210 million |9 million   |219 million |  |            |rman, Mainl-|ng          |            |            |            |  |            |and Affairs |            |            |            |            |  |            |Council     |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |5           |Judicial Yu-|Lin Yang-ka-|170 million |47.3 million|217.3 milli-|  |            |an president|ng          |            |            |on yuan     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |6           |Minister Wi-|Kuo Yuan-ju-|150 million |22.5 million|172.5 milli-|  |            |thout Portf-|ng          |            |            |on          |  |            |olio        |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |7           |President   |Li Teng-hui |80 million  |72.4 million|152.4 milli-|  |            |            |            |            |            |on          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |8           |President's |Chiang Yen--|78 million  |42.7 million|120.7 milli-|  |            |Office secr-|shih        |            |            |on          |  |            |etary       |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |9           |Control Yua-|Li Shen-i   |120 million |570,000     |120.57 mill-|  |            |n member    |            |            |            |ion         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |10          |Judicial Yu-|Li Chih-p'e-|105 million |-800,000    |104.2 milli-|  |            |an Grand Ju-|ng          |            |            |on          |  |            |stice       |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |11          |Minister Wi-|Huang Shih--|104 million |-1.45 milli-|102.55 mill-|  |            |thout Portf-|cheng       |            |on          |ion         |  |            |olio        |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |12          |Director, P-|Ch'in Hsiao-|96 million  |6 million   |102 million |  |            |alace Museum|i           |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Huang Shih-ch'eng, who is from Changhua, also feels his  wealth is overestimated. His wife, Ch'en Chao-o [7115 2507  1230], who is a National Assembly member, said that all their  land has been inherited, and that it is located in remote areas  that even buses do not reach. One tract she visited only once,  and her grandparents are buried on another plot. They are worth  hardly anything at all. Before becoming magistrate of Changhua  County, Huang Shih-ch'eng was a lawyer. He also ran a trading  corporation located on Jenai Road in Taipei. Today, however, he  neither practices law nor runs the corporation. He depends  entirely on his salary.    Chiang Yen-shih's billion still comes mostly from land. He  gets more than NT$1 million a year from two houses, one on Anho  Road, and the other on Ihsien Road. When another more than NT$24  million in savings, more than NT$2 million in stocks, and more  than 1 million in gold bars are added in, to call him the  "Diamond Secretary" is no exaggeration.    Lin Yang-kang, who has designs on the president's seat, has  no less wealth than Li Teng-hui even though he has yet to gain  that seat. Although his NT$20 million in savings is only half  that of Li, he owns a large tract of land, and he holds NT$5  million worth of bonds. His wife, Ch'en Ho-ping [7115 0678  1629], has more than NT$21 million invested in two corporations.    Most curious is Lin Yang-hsiang's and his wife's leasing of  16 hectares of government forest land at Shuili Village in  Yuch'ih Township, Nantou County. This matter has raised a lot of  eyebrows. The after-the-fact explanation that Lin Yang-hsiang  has provided is that he leased this land 40 years ago while  still a student at Taiwan University. At that time everyone was  very enthusiastic about afforestation, and his father was also  an afforestation enthusiast. He positively has not used his  position as president of the Judicial Yuan to lease the land.    The return from this forest land is difficult to estimate.  Maybe the young Lin Yang-hsiang developed the habit of "mountain  climbing" because of his frequent inspections of forest land.  This habit may be unexpectedly helpful to him in moving up to  the office of president. Nevertheless, one thing is certain and  that is that should the grasslands Yuan president want to become  a grasslands president, he will certainly not have to worry  about not having enough money to get elected.    Control Yuan member, Li Shen-i, who frequently describes  himself as the son of a peasant family in Tainan, was also  ranked a millionaire in this communique on wealth, but he said  with some pain, "This is really an overestimate!" Li Shen-i, who  has been a lawyer for more than 20 years, did not deny his  penchant for investing in real estate, but he describes this as  land he holds with others.    Maybe so, but the land that Li Shen-i holds with others is  scattered everywhere. In 1978, he and some friends bought  farmland on the Kuantu Plain, himself investing NT$2.5 million  to buy 360 ping. In 1984, he and friends bought more than 3,100  ping of grassland located along Hsiukuluan Creek in Yuli Town,  Hualien in which he has a one-sixth interest. He also spent NT$1  million for it. In 1990, he and a Rotary Club friend bought 80  chia of mountain land in Juifang, only 5 percent of which is  his. He spent NT$2 million for it, but an appraisal company  estimates the value of this land to be NT$200 million.    In this connection, not only did Li Shen-i write a letter  demanding a retraction from the media, but he also countered  with the question as to who would be willing to buy the land  were it to sell for 20 million? Subsequently, he also joked with  reporters asking, "Would you buy it for 5 million?" Li Shen-i  said that the land he bought is not suitable for building  houses. As for the 300 ping of land for which he paid NT$210  million to the "Academic Community Preparatory Committee of the  Central Research Academy," so far he has done nothing with it.  In addition, Li Shen-i bought a membership in the Tonghua Golf  Club. He explained that he bought it only because he had helped  the club solve some legal problems in return for which the club  permitted him to buy the membership in installments. His  membership has a value of NT$2.5 million.    As for the four dwellings bought in Li Shen-i's name, namely  the ones he received following the renovation with friends of a  13-story building on 30 ping of land that his family had earlier  purchased on Hoping Road East opposite the Science and  Technology Building, one is his residence. The three others have  been rented out, the proceeds providing retirement income for  his father.    However, in 1977, Li Shen-i bought more than 50 ping of land  at the low price of several thousand New Taiwan dollars a ping  in what is now the Hsini Planning Zone. This showed uncanny  foresight. In 1993, he began selling off this land in order to  clear up some personal debts, and to pay for his daughter's  education expenses abroad. However, his asking price is  NT$700,000 a ping, so because of the present depressed economic  conditions, there have been no takers. This has irritated him  somewhat. Li Shen-i said that estimates that he is worth NT$300  million are really far off the mark, but NT$100 million is a  completely reasonable estimate.    Minister Without Portfolio Kuo Yuan-jung's land holdings are  also very substantial. However, Kuo Yuan-jung explains that her  land in Taichung City was inherited, and that the land she owns  in Neihu and Tamsui was bought during the 1960's. Originally,  houses could be built on that land, but later it was zoned a  protected forest area on which construction is prohibited. It is  not worth very much money now.    However, Kuo Yuan-jung and her husband, Ni Wen-ya [0242 2429  0068], have more than NT$20 million in savings and short term  securities. Their appearance on the Control Yuan's list  attracted particular attention. Kuo Yuan-jung said that inasmuch  as she has always worked in a government agency, her financial  management method is fairly "simple and clear."    People from Taichung say that the land that Kuo Yuan-jung  holds in the Liming section of Taichung is located in the  seventh rezoned area and close to the center of the city. It is  worth no small amount of money. Therefore, it is no surprise  that Kuo Yuan-jung is listed as a billionaire level government  official.    Not only did Kuo Yuan-jung buy some mountain land, but Grand  Judge Li Chih-p'eng also purchased between five and six chia of  mountain land in Wanli Township 15 years ago. At that time, the  price was a little more than NT$200,000 per chia. Li Chih-p'eng  says that he bought that piece of land purely with retirement in  mind, but the trees growing on that land today are between two  and three stories high. The land was not bought with the idea of  building houses on it.    Commenting on being listed in the billionaire class, Li  Chih-p'eng explained that houses like the one he is living in  today at Neihu were bought for NT$500,000 20-odd years ago, but  now the market price has risen to more than NT$20 million. "It's  not my doing!"    Palace Museum Director Ch'in Hsiao-i's declaration of  calligraphic scrolls and antiques worth nearly NT$5 million also  attracted some attention. However, his large free-standing home  located in Lane 136 in Section 1 of Chihshan Road is also  estimated to be worth more than NT$100 million. In order for him  to be able to bury his head all day long in the study of  historical relics, Ch'in Hsiao-i has been cloaked in a golden  robe. Giving "a private matter" as a reason, he is unwilling to  discuss this. However, members of the Ch'in family said that  this is too preposterous. They have lived in this house for more  than 20 years. How can a more than 20 year old house be worth  NT$100 million?    People in the market say, however, that Chihshan Road is a  red hot section of the city today. The land for the tall  building built opposite the Palace Museum cost nearly NT$500,000  a ping some time ago. An asking price of NT$100 million for the  160 ping of land and the buildings on which Ch'in Hsiao-i's  house sits would not be an exaggeration. However, the Ch'in  family notes that this house is only theirs to live in; they  cannot sell it. Thus, it is really not very fair to say that  they are billionaires.    K'o Ming-mou, a member of the Control Yuan who is one of the  champions whose assets have been published by the Control Yuan,  was not listed in the Control Yuan's previous glittering  listing. Today things are different. Of the 29 members of the  Control Yuan, probably only Lin Meng-kui [2651 1322 6311] and  Hsieh K'un-shan [6200 1507 1472] are richer than he.    Current reporting on K'o Ming-mou and his wife shows more  than 59 parcels of land alone, and all are located in either  Changhua or Taichung cities. The K'o family's businesses --  Yusan Engineering and Yuisheng Construction Company -- also  operate in these two areas.    The land area that K'o Ming-mu has declared is also small,  and his holdings are not great. Only three houses are under his  name, but many people in Changhua believe K'o Ming-mou owns more  houses than this. Nevertheless, a leader of Changhua's white  faction, K'o Ming-mou has always adopted a political posture of  being more interested in politics than business. His coterie and  his money interests in Changhua have always been substantial, so  it is no wonder that Li Teng-hui has called upon him repeatedly  to run for county magistrate there. Furthermore, the election of  Kuomintang candidates also depends on the degree to which they  obtain K'o Ming-mou's endorsement. The present estimate of his  assets at between NT$300 million and NT$400 million only  includes the assets held in his name. The resources at K'o  Ming-mou's command are surely greater than this.    Finally, a person that must be specially introduced is the  richest woman government official today, Yeh Chin-feng, the  deputy chairman of the Planning Commission for Recovery of the  Mainland who has been highly touted for election as the next  secretary of the Haichi Hui [3189 1015 2585].    Yeh Chin-feng said that the reason she and her medical  doctor  husband have so much land is that virtually all of it was  inherited by her husband, Lin Yao-tung [2651 5069 2639]. For  example, the land in Fuhsing Township in Changhua County is all  farmland that has not yet been divided up for inheritance, so  she herself does not know where the land is located.    Yeh Chin-feng also said that their four houses in Changhua  City are dilapidated houses made of earth or galvanized sheet  steel. The only building they have that is worth any money is  the hospital on Minsheng Road that covers an area of nearly 400  ping, and this land was also purchased 20 years ago for about  NT$10,000 yuan a ping. She also said that since her husband is  very conservative about money management, the money he has is  invested in houses and real estate. The two 30 ping of land  houses they own in Taichung are located in the suburbs and not  worth much money. Moreover, since she works in Taipei, she  purchased a small house on 10 ping of land on Hsini Road, which  is purely for convenience.    Nevertheless, Yeh Chin-feng also admits that although most  of  the houses under their name are not worth much money, if they  are renovated, they will be worth quite a bit. As for the  estimate of her personal wealth at NT$200 million, she said,  "How can you compare the price of land in Changhua with Taipei."  Since Yeh Chin-feng actually did marry a medical doctor who has  money and can buy property, becoming rich through her husband, a  personal wealth of more than NT$100 million for Yeh Chin-feng is  no exaggeration. It is just that her husband earned it. She  herself is just a daughter who was married off, whose sole  income is her salary. [passage omitted]</p>

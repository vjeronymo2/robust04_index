			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Societies hang on to homely image - Alison Smith finds that the traditional mortgage lenders have retained the public's affection The recent rise in mortgage interest rates has created some unwelcome publicity for lenders about the rates they will soon be charging their customers. Not for the first time commentators have highlighted the way the new rates tend to be passed on more quickly to borrowers than to savers. For the most part, however, the building societies that dominate the UK mortgage market have a markedly better public reputation than the high street banks, even though the financial services they offer increasingly overlap. Earlier this year, a survey by polling organisation BMRB for the Building Societies Association suggested that societies were regarded more positively than banks or insurance companies, scoring more strongly on fair dealing, communicating with customers, taking complaints seriously and being more understanding of those with financial problems. It is perhaps striking, therefore, that more societies do not exploit this apparent affection more vigorously in their advertising. Only the Nationwide  -with its slogan 'The 'Building' Society', and its use of staff to devise and appear in advertisements - has wholeheartedly cultivated this traditional image. 'We want to put across that we are an honest, open, decent type of organisation to do business with,' says Dennis Brockwell, Nationwide marketing director. 'Using real people has given us credibility compared with some of our competitors. Customers have asked local staff why they have not appeared in the campaign.' By contrast, the line in the Halifax campaign - 'The building society you can bank on' - looks like an attempt to combine the warmth felt for societies with a claim for competence in delivering services which may not be so immediately associated with the sector. Other recent campaigns - such as the one promoting the Alliance &amp; Leicester's new Alliance current account - have concentrated on particular products or services and made no feature of the type of organisation offering them. This lack of emphasis is particularly notable given the lengths to which Abbey National, the former society turned bank, has gone to retain the affection people apparently feel for societies. The group decided not to include the word 'bank' in its name within the UK to distance itself from the four largest clearing banks. It also kept its logo - two people walking along with the roof of a house as an umbrella - which has been used since 1944. Whatever their differences there is a general consensus among societies that seeking to differentiate themselves explicitly from banks is not the answer. A&amp;L has a particular complication, as John Day, director of marketing, admits. One of its subsidiaries is Girobank, which it bought from the Post Office in 1990. Day is wary of contrasting banks and societies in A&amp;L's marketing, though he emphasises that the society does not want to be seen as 'bank-like' in terms of the standards of services which customers expect. 'We feel you have to be careful how you take that stance - after all we are moving more into banking products,' he says. The Halifax is aware that the perceived virtues of societies can be seen as weaknesses too. However 'nice' societies are thought to be, they are not necessarily viewed as efficient, particularly in delivering services, where the premium is on speed and accuracy rather than the personal touch. Mike Lavender, marketing assistant general manager, says 'The building society you can bank on' slogan, which suggests the best of both worlds, is being used specifically to promote banking products such as current accounts and motor insurance. At the same time the Halifax aims to retain what Lavender calls the 'warm and cuddly' image through its more general television advertising, which is based on the idea of people coming together to build structures. This theme was developed three years ago to prevent the erosion of support for the society as it diversified into new activities which were further away from societies' roots. 'You can't go into bank accounts or estate agency without perhaps some drag on the brand,' Lavender says. He believes that as societies take more advantage of the opportunities to diversify, other large societies will try to 'get back to that warm feeling'.</p>

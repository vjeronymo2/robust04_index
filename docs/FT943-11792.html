			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / People: Wyatt gets bullish on sales At weekends, Carol Wyatt helps her husband rebuild their house near Slough. But for the next two years or so, Groupe Bull's newly appointed director of sales will spend her weekdays in Paris, building the group's international open systems and software sales team. No technologist - 'I'm personal computer literate - just,' she says - Wyatt has deployed her management and organisational skills to good effect since joining Bull, then Honeywell Bull, in 1983. Her sales triumphs include leading teams responsible for winning major central government orders for computer systems for the prison service and the Inland Revenue. What does it take for success in these bids? Wyatt says: 'The secret is to pick the right people with the right skills for the sales team - especially when there is little difference between manufacturers' hardware'. Most recently Wyatt has been director of customer care and communications at Bull UK. In her new job she will be responsible for managing the resources to drive sales of open - or industry standard - systems in all the 100 or so countries where Bull is represented. She will ensure the appropriate skills from whatever part of Bull's worldwide operations will be available to support sales bids - especially those aimed at medium sized projects. It is a critically important task at Bull, still losing money heavily and seeking a new role in the world data processing business. 'Tense' is how she describes the mood inside the company. Her Paris location, however, will enable her to dust off and exploit an earlier skill. After leaving college, she worked as a bilingual secretary, with special fluency in French.</p>

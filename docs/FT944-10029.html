			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Redland up Building materials group Redland moved against the market downtrend following a trading buy note from James Capel which recommended clients to switch out of RMC. Dealers also said that UBS had been supporting the stock. Redland gained 4 to 465p in turnover of 2.1m as investors moved to scoop up a dividend yield of 6.7 per cent, three percentage points in excess of the Footsie average and some four points ahead of the return on RMC which closed 8 lower at 1000p. A number of engineering shares stood out against the stock market's seemingly inexorable commitment to red ink. British Steel gained a penny to 158 1/2 p ahead of Monday's widely expected bumper interim results. And Rolls-Royce and GKN both added 4 to 179p and 619p respectively. The market's ideas about British Steel's interim figures revolve around profits of between Pounds 125m and Pounds 140m, up from Pounds 27m last time. Rolls was the best performing Footsie stock but the reasons for the spurt were less easy to pinpoint, although there was talk yesterday that the group was about to announce a big Chinese aero-engine order. Motor industry based stocks were among the more resilient in the sector with Lucas Industries up a penny at 199p and T&amp;N holding at 369p in turnover of 4m. Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group Unilever retreated on profit-taking and disappointment in some quarters at the group's third quarter figures. The shares fell 11 to 1118p, after trade of 2.7m. However, Mr Carl Short at Strauss Turnbull remains a fan of the stock and said the figures not only met his expectations but said Strauss was a 'buyer of the shares for accelerated growth in 1995'. Shares in North West Water relinquished 8 to 536p, following a city presentation at which the company indicated plans to become more consumer friendly. Mr Douglas Falconer at Yamaichi was among those unhappy with the plan and said simply: 'This move is shareholder unfriendly.' Dividend prospects boosted Welsh Water and the shares ended the session 8 ahead at 656p. High street retailer Kingfisher relinquished 7 to 467p, as speculation that the company was to make an offer for Matalan, a private fashion and household goods retailer, returned to the market. However, one analyst indicated such a move may receive a cool reception from the market as, 'investors would rather see Kingfisher turn its existing businesses around first, although the cost of such an acquisition would be of little concern.' Sentiment in the stock was further dampened by reports that consumer electronics company Amstrad may open its own stores. Amstrad edged a 1/2 forward to 29p. Ladbroke, which published a trading statement on Thursday, added another 3 to 157p, following a NatWest Securities recommendation. However, UBS remains negative on the stock and analyst Mr Paul Heath at the securities house said 'there was nothing in the statement on the trading front to make us change our current recommendation'. Supermarket group J Sainsbury lost 8 to 411p, as several brokers advised switching into Tesco 2 better at 247p. BAT Industries held firm at 448p. Dealers cited support from Smith New Court. Clothing group SR Gent jumped 8 to 78p after announcing at the annual meeting a leap in sales for the first 18 weeks since the end of the financial year. Cashmere group Dawson International firmed 2 to 133p ahead of figures next week. Shares in hotels group Forte closed 2 ahead at 233p, in strong business of 11m shares as dealings started in the new shares offered to the vendors of the Meridien Hotels chain it recently acquired.</p>

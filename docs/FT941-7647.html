			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Singapore at turning point, says finance minister Mr Richard Hu, Singapore's finance minister, yesterday unveiled a 1994 budget with modest tax relief and rebates for the country's 2.8m people together with a range of incentives designed to improve competitiveness. 'We are at a turning point,' said Mr Hu. 'We have become a newly industrialised eco-nomy. . . but Singaporeans must not be lulled into thinking we have arrived and start relaxing and taking progress and prosperity for granted.' While Mr Hu said income tax rates would not be reduced, the unexpectedly high 9.9 per cent economic growth figure for 1993 meant the government could grant an across-the-board one-off rebate of 5 per cent. Rebates on housing and rental charges were among a series of measures designed to offset the impact of a 3 per cent general sales tax, to be introduced on April 1. A 3 percentage point cut in corporation tax to 27 per cent was announced in last year's budget. 'As the economy is expected to grow at a rate well above the target range of 4-6 per cent, there is no need to adjust our tax rate this year further to stimulate the economy.' However, property tax rates would be progressively cut, with a 1 percentage point reduction to 15 per cent this year, to reduce business costs and increase Singapore's competitiveness in attracting foreign investments. Tax incentives were also announced to encourage Singaporean business to invest overseas. But business costs within Singapore are likely to rise, with a 1.5 percentage point increase to 20 per cent in employers' contributions to the central provident fund, the compulsory savings scheme. Mr Hu said revenues were likely to exceed expenditure by SDollars 2.2bn (Pounds 948m) in 1994. But he emphasised the need to increase economic competitiveness and warned against any relaxation of the country's strict spending policies. 'Government expenditure will continue to focus on areas that support and promote economic growth for Singapore,' he added. 'We must avoid the pitfalls of welfarism which, as the experience of socialist and western democratic governments has shown, sooner or later leads to dependency and destruction of the work ethic.'</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Ireland (12): A skilful pragmatist - Bertie Ahern, finance minister IN a country in which not every politician possesses both personality and probity, Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, has achieved the happy state of harmoniously possessing both. He is the 'Mr Nice Guy' of Irish politics. At 40 years of age, he is one of the youngest of the present cabinet, and has managed to work his way to the top without indulging in the backstabbing or steamrollering of opponents that characterises the building of many political careers. It has been this ability to combine frankness with charm, to lead a complex discussion accompanied by a joke and an impish lop-sided grin, that disarms his opponents and allows him to then begin convincing them of his own arguments. A left-of-centre liberal, and a one-time trade union activist, he describes himself as a pragmatist free of strong ideological constraints. Born into a family of staunch Fianna Fail supporters, he joined the party in 1967. An accountant by training, he has studied at University College in Dublin and the London School of Economics, but politics has dominated his working life. At 25 he was elected to the Dail at his first attempt, representing a central Dublin constituency, and he has consistently had one of the highest first preference votes in the country of any parliamentary member. He was elected Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1986 and in 1987 was appointed labour minister in Charles Haughey's government. His ability to deal with the unions and their often cantankerous leaders has been the key to achieving five years of relative peace on the industrial relations front. The tripartite pact of government, business and trade unions known as the Programme of Economic and Social Progress, which currently underpins the government's fiscal and monetary policy, owes much to the diligent negotiating skills of Mr Ahern. The only time he came close to making enemies within the party was during the efforts to oust Mr Haughey from the leadership last November. Mr Albert Reynolds, the then finance minister, led the rebellion, only to find himself sacked and Mr Ahern stepping into his shoes at the Finance Ministry. For a while Mr Ahern was dubbed 'the rat in the anorak.' He later made amends by supporting Mr Reynolds' candidacy for the leadership in February. As Ireland's 21st finance minister, he has now positioned himself for the final step to the leadership of the party, and if the party's fortunes hold, the position of prime minister. 'When I came to finance from the labour portfolio, where I was known as the 'good guy', people wondered whether I had what it needed to make the tough decisions at finance. Well, within six months I have upset just about everybody,' he says. Those decisions have included closing a wide range of tax shelters and loopholes, cracking down on tax evasion, holding steady on public sector pay targets, and keeping the public sector finances firmly in line with Ireland's commitment to European union and Emu, despite their short-term recessionary effects and rising unemployment.</p>

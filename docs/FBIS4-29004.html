			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nhi Le: "The Problem and Reality of `Hot Spots' </F> in Thanh Hoa"]    [Text] The concept of "hot spots" has appeared here in  recent years. But what are "hot spots?" Looking at many  different events in many places, many people think that a "hot  spot" is a place where a major or even fierce struggle is going  on among the people over some issue in a particular sphere (from  a hamlet or village on up). The matter cannot be resolved on the  spot and requires intervention on the part of the party  committee echelons, the authorities, and judicial organizations  from the primary level on up.    Thanh Hoa is one province where a rather large number of  "hot  spots" have appeared since the end of 1988. The first was the  land dispute that arose between the Thanh Son Cooperative and  the Sao Vang State Farm (subordinate to Xuan Son Village in Tho  Xuan District) on 22 November 1988. Other disputes arose at the  end of 1989. Most of the "hot spots" are in rural areas, and  they are concentrated in places where the population density is  high and where order and security have always been a problem.  The "hot spots" are mainly at the level of the hamlet and  village, with a few at the city level. From 22 November 1988 to  30 December 1992, there have been eight hot spots in Hau Loc  District, six in Tho Xuan District, six in Cam Thuy District,  five in Ngoc Lac District, five in Trieu Son District, nine in  Thanh Hoa City, and two each in the cities of Bim Son and Sam  Son. The thing to note is that "hot spots" have a tendency to  "expand" rather rapidly, and they are concentrated in a short  time period. For example, in 1992 alone, there were five hot  spots in Ngoc Lac, four in Trieu Son, six in Hau Loc, and three  in Thieu Yen. By 12 November 1993, a total of 120 "hot spots"  had appeared in Thanh Hoa. Analyzing those 120 hot spots shows  the following:    Scale: Sixty-five percent of the disputes were confined to a  single village, almost 18 percent of the disputes were confined  to villages within a single district, more than 5 percent  involved villages in different districts, and other types  accounted for more than 7 percent.    Form: Fifty-four percent of the disputes concerned arable  land, 19 percent had to do with a loss of solidarity between the  people and the cadres at the primary level, 19.5 percent  concerned loss of solidarity among the people, and 7.5 percent  were disputes within state organizations.    Nature: Conflicts concerning land (which accounted for most  of the disputes), conflicts between the people and civil service  organizations, conflicts involving a struggle for power and  material rights, and conflicts that broke out suddenly.    Degree: Eleven percent of the conflicts have been very  fierce, 49 percent have been tense, and 40 percent have been  "smoldering."  <H5>  The Reasons for the "Hot Spots" </H5>   There are three main reasons:    1. There are hot spots that have arisen because some of the  leading and managerial cadres at the primary level are corrupt  and have violated the ownership rights of the people. The  majority of the party members and people detest these people and  have denounced them and filed complaints against them, but their  violations have not been investigated or dealt with promptly and  resolutely, with the result that the masses do not understand  things and lack confidence. In some places, the masses suspect  that the district is covering up the mistakes of the  primary-level cadres, which has made the situation even more  complex and tense.    Making use of this situation, a number of evil elements,  including dissatisfied and opportunistic cadres and party  members have incited a number of people whose vigilance is poor  to go to extremes in waging struggles, which has led to people  violating the principles of the party and the laws of the state.  Widely used forms include organizing suits in many places,  making excessive demands, insulting the cadres and party members  who have made mistakes based on "self-judgment," and taking  people hostage. This has led to conflicts between a number of  people and the primary- and district-level leadership  organizations and the internal affairs, public security,  control, and inspection sectors.    Looking at the "hot spots" of Nam Giang in Tho Xuan  District,  Tho Ngoc in Trieu Son District, Tien Loc in Hau Loc District,  and Quang Loc in Quang Xuong District, it can be seen that they  arose for the reasons mentioned above and exhibit the above  manifestations. These are complex "hot spots" that all have  "leaders" and "instigators." The "leader" may be a single  individual or a group of people. These people have organized  themselves, there are "leaders," there is a division of labor,  and they have established illegal organizations using the words  "open and democratic," "anti-corruption front," and  "anti-negative association" in order to trick party members and  the masses into following them. On the other hand, they also use  people with police records and hoodlums to put pressure on the  authorities and internal affairs sectors, terrorize and threaten  those who are waging an honest struggle, spread false  information, look for ways to neutralize the party and  administrative apparatus, and force the districts and provinces  to do what they want.    2. There are hot spots that have arisen because of disputes  about administrative boundaries, land, markets, and so on  between different hamlets and villages and, in some cases  between two villages in different districts. Those disputes that  have not been resolved promptly by the echelons and sectors with  jurisdiction have resulted in spontaneous clashes between large  numbers of people. At the same time, the authorities and bases  have been put in a passive position and have not been able to  control the situation. Or because they are biased, they have  "followed" the masses. There have even been cases in which the  militia and self-defense forces have been mobilized to attack  people, which has had serious consequences and had a bad effect  on hamlet and village order and security and internal security  among the people. The problems between Quang Phuc and Quang Vong  in Quang Xuong District, between Dong Quang and Dong Van in Dong  Son District, between Quy Loc and Yen Tho in Thieu Yen District,  and between Vinh Quang in Vinh Loc District and Cam Van in Cam  Thuy District are all of this type. This type of "hot spot"  usually arises in a relatively short period of time, but the  consequences are immeasurable and this has caused many  difficulties and problems in handling things using  administrative and judicial measures. Furthermore, there are  usually a large number of people participating at these "hot  spots" and so it is difficult to determine the causes. Because  of this, it is easy to forget about taking legal action against  the criminals. As of 17 June 1992, Thanh Hoa had four such "hot  spots." Even though the situation had been stabilized, the  criminals had not been prosecuted.    3. Finally, there are hot spots that have arisen  spontaneously for a variety of reasons. For example, some people  have blocked and opposed those who are carrying out their public  functions, and evil elements have "made a mountain out of a  molehill" of this. This type of "hot spot" usually arises in  places where order and security is a problem. At the same time,  the local authorities and internal affairs organizations are  weak and unable to handle specific situations, with the result  that "hot spots" can arise and expand. Studying the hot spots:  there was a fight between members of Unit 3 and Unit 9 in Tan  Tuong Village, Tinh Gia District; there was a clash between  Thanh Hoa City public security forces and the railroad station  defense forces; there were two disturbances at the provincial  people's court; and there was the case of people falsely  accusing public security forces of beating someone to death and  then stealing a public security vehicle and taking the body to  the provincial CPV organization to jeer and incite people. All  of these have a similar form.  <H5>  Handling the "Hot Spots"--Initial lessons </H5>   Looking at the 120 hot spots in the past 5 years, as of 12  November 1993, Thanh Hoa had basically resolved more than 97  percent of the cases. Of these, almost 24 percent of the cases  had been fully resolved, and almost 40 percent of the hot spots  had been basically stabilized. The remaining cases are in the  process of being concluded. To gain experience and preliminarily  summarize the process of handling the hot spots, Thanh Hoa will  organize a special symposium. But based on the successes and  failures in dealing with a number of broad, complex, and serious  hot spots, we can learn a number of lessons:    1. Discovering things early, finding the real reasons, and  advancing ideological work:    The successes in handling the hot spots in Thanh Hoa show  that there must be an attitude of fairness. Also, the situation  must be evaluated carefully and objectively, and the true causes  and nature of the matter must be found in order to have suitable  means to deal with the matter. Whenever there are signs that a  "hot spot" is arising or that a new hot spot has recently  arisen, the organizations responsible must find out what the  real reasons are and analyze the nature of the conflict. At the  same time, they must organize work teams consisting of capable  cadres who have great prestige, who are experienced in party  work and mass mobilization, and who are skilled in dealing with  various situations and skillfully insert them into the "hot  spots." Through the highly trusted people on the spot, they must  clarify the problems and, together with the people, discuss and  resolve the issues and problems on the spot, including those of  relatives of the targets, in order to "gradually reduce the  temperature," "ease the situation," and "defuse the situation."  In particular, in places where the masses can easily be incited  and already have problems with the leaders, ideological work  must be carried on resolutely and skillfully in order to create  good public opinion. The more good pressure is applied by the  people, the better the results will be. The hot spots in Vinh  Ninh in Vinh Loc District, Tan Lap in Ba Thuoc District, and  Dong Hung in Thanh Hoa City were dealt with mainly in this way.  And based on this method, almost 25 percent of the hot spots in  Thanh Hoa have been basically "defused."    2. Using economic measures in conjunction with improving the  apparatus and cadre work:    Handling the "hot spots" will take time. This cannot be  rushed. Things cannot be done in a subjective manner, and stages  cannot be skipped. At the same time, things cannot be delayed,  which would allow the situation to dray on. Reality shows that  if such situations are allowed to drag on, efforts to resolve  matters will encounter many complex difficulties. Thus, there  are things that must be carried on tensely, especially tasks  related to stabilizing life at the primary level, particularly  economic life. For example, the "hot spots" that have  difficulties concerning work formulas can be guided and given  help in building a number of infrastructural and public welfare  projects in order to involve the people in production and reduce  their concerns.    On the other hand, tasks related to organizing and  solidifying the apparatus and strengthening the cadres must be  handled promptly, and those who have committed violations,  particularly cadres and party members who have clearly committed  violations and who no longer have the confidence of the people,  must be dealt with, which includes taking legal action against  them, recovering things and paying material damages (if any),  and doing things openly before the people.    The experiences in handling the hot spots in Tho Ngoc in  Trieu Son District, Nam Giang in Tho Xuan District, Quang Loc in  Quang Xuong District, Nga Thach in Nga Son District, and a  number of other complex spots in Tho Xuan and Cam Thuy show that  this is a very important measure that is in accord with the  legitimate demands of the cadres, party members, and masses and  that manifests the strictness of the law. If these problems are  solved well, there will no longer be any reasons that  dissatisfied and extremist elements can use to complicate the  situation.    3. Dealing with things promptly and resolutely from within:    Taking resolute action against cadres and party members who  participate in the "hot spots" is both urgent and necessary in  order to "set an example" for the people. This is very important  for blocking and handling the "hot spots." The experiences in  dealing with typical hot spots such as Tho Ngoc, Quang Loc, Nam  Giang, and Nga Thach show this very clearly. For example, in the  Tho Ngoc case, one person was disciplined and expelled from the  party, three were given warnings, and the chairman of the  village people's committee, the head of the village public  security force, and the secretary of the village CPV committee  were dismissed from office. In particular, Le Hong Bao, the  cooperative director, was tried and sentenced to 5 years in  prison. As a result, the problems there were basically solved,  the situation at Tho Ngoc stabilized, and the village has  continued to advance. When handling the hot spots in Quang Loc,  Nam Giang, and Nga Thach, 29 party members there were  disciplined. Following this, other hot spots declined in  intensity, and this created a good tendency for handling other  spots on a provincial scale.    Something that should be noted is that with respect to the  "leaders," in general, an open attitude and flexible measures  for dealing with them are required. There must be a dialogue.  People must listen to their ideas, analyze things, and persuade  them. At the same time, we must adhere to the principles and  resolutely criticize their extremist actions that violate the  law. The die-hard instigators and leaders must be differentiated  from those who have been misled or used, with appropriate  methods used to deal with each type of target.    Along with dealing with things promptly and resolutely from  within, troublemakers and hoodlums and those who "grope for fish  in muddy waters" must be resolutely suppressed in accord with  the law. The sympathy and support of the people must be  obtained, and spontaneous actions that cause trouble must  definitely be avoided. This is a very important guideline for  handling things. The five prison sentences meted out to the  above targets at four "hot spots" (with the stiffest sentence  being 12 years in prison and the lightest being 2 years) clearly  affirms that "being strict both within and among the masses" has  a great effect in dealing with the hot spots.    4. The independence of the bases must be strengthened, but  the close leadership and guidance of higher echelons must be  maintained.    In order to deal with the hot spots, the party committee  echelons and authorities, from the primary to the district  level, must do things actively and speedily under the close  leadership and guidance of the provincial CPV committee and  provincial people's committee. In particular, there must be a  high degree of unanimity from top to bottom in determining the  reasons for the rise of "hot spots" and formulating solutions.  Simple, subjective, and quick methods and a desire to deal with  things immediately using rigid methods must be opposed. On the  other hand, rightist thinking and not daring to deal with things  must be opposed, and the concept of relying on others must be  opposed: the primary level waiting on the district, the  districts waiting on the province, and the functional sectors  shifting responsibility to each other. The methods used to deal  with the hot spots must be synchronized. Educating,  propagandizing, and mobilizing the masses must go hand in hand  with solidifying the party and administrative organizations and  dealing with things using administrative and judicial measures.    As for the complex "hot spots," particularly the burning and  very tense hot spots, work groups or teams headed by a key  leader must be formed and sent to the hot spots. They must have  full power to deal with the situation, and they will be  responsible to higher echelons for their actions. What must be  emphasized is that enforcing the laws at the hot spots must be  based above all on having accurate and timely information,  serving as the staff for the leaders, and dealing effectively  with situations on the spot swiftly and safely.    As for hot spots in the hamlets, the villages must handle  things on their own, with the district monitoring things and  providing help. When the hot spots are in the villages, the  district must personally handle things, with the province  monitoring things and providing help. Based on their functions  and tasks, the committees and sectors at the provincial level  must help the districts. The province must not do things in  place of the districts, but it must not be lax in providing  leadership and guidance or slight its responsibilities.  <H5>  Proposals Based on Realities </H5>   From the realities in Thanh Hoa, in order to actively  prevent  hot spots from arising and to continue dealing effectively with  those hot spots that have arisen with the aim of maintaining  stability and promoting development from the primary level, I  would like to propose the the following:    First, the central echelon should soon review the work of  building and solidifying the bases and improving the quality of  the ranks of cadres and party members. It should strengthen  propaganda activities, give the cadres and people at the primary  level an all-round education, particularly concerning legal  matters, overcome the "illiteracy" concerning judicial  knowledge, and standardize judicial knowledge for the key  leaders and managers at the primary level. At the same time, the  central echelon should soon review and learn the lessons in  building models of organizations subordinate to the  primary-level authorities (hamlet and village) and in regulating  the activities of the hamlet and village heads so that these can  be used on a nationwide scale.    Second, the central echelon should soon revise the laws and  documents under the law to concretize dealing with the petitions  and complaints of citizens. It must provide guidance in  formulating concrete solutions based on the functions and powers  of each echelon and sector with respect to the above tasks in  order to ensure that the complaints of the people are dealt with  effectively, promptly, and in accord with the law and in order  to overcome the situation in which people simply try to shift  the responsibility to someone else, which weakens the confidence  of the masses.    Third, the central echelon should soon promulgate  regulations  in order to put an end to the confusion. These should deal with  such things as, How should the internal affairs forces be used  to deal with the hot spots? What should the contents of "martial  law" orders be? And how should the mass means of information  convey information to the hot spots in order to ensure accuracy  and to prevent the enemy from making use of this and distorting  the situation?</p>

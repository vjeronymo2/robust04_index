			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ilva seeks buyer for steel tubes business Ilva, the Italian state-owned steel group which is being liquidated as part of a large restructuring, is to sell its 86.4 per cent stake in Dalmine, the world's third-biggest manufacturer of seamless steel tubes. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities arm of Barclays Bank, has been given the mandate to find a buyer as part of the urgent need to raise cash for Ilva and privatise its operations. Demonstrating that meaningful parts of the Ilva group are being privatised will be a significant boost to the arguments being used by Italian negotiators in their battle of wills with the European Commission in Brussels over state aid and capacity cuts. Dalmine, which is based near the north Italian city of Bergamo, is listed on the stock market and profitable. Net group earnings last year amounted to L5.6bn (Dollars 3.4m) on sales of L1,016bn. The company, which trails Mannesmann of Germany and Sumitomo of Japan in seamless tubes, last year delivered 748,000 tonnes of steel. In recent months, Ilva has been buying out some of the minority partners in Dalmine, ostensibly to prepare for the sale of a large stake. Bankers have hesitated to put a value to the holding in view of the current crisis in the European steel industry. Ilva, which is formally in liquidation, is being split into two companies. The first, specialising in flat products, will comprise the group's big Taranto integrated steelworks and the Novi Ligure plant, while the second will be based on the Terni special steels unit. Ilva lost L2,309bn last year on group sales of L10,087bn. The company, which is planning to shed about 11,600 jobs, had net debts of L7,500bn at the end of June.</p>

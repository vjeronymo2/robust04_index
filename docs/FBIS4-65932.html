			<p>BFN     [Text] Cologne (DDP/ADN) --The SPD [Social Democratic Party  of Germany] and its candidate for chancellor, Rudolf Scharping,  have lost their lead in popularity over Chancellor Helmut Kohl  and the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Socialist  Union] five months before the Bundestag elections. This is the  result of a survey carried out by the Forsa Institute for the  "RTL- Kanzlerbarometer" program which the RTL TV channel  published today. According to the survey, Scharping and Kohl are  neck and neck in popularity among the voters, both at 32  percent. Thirty-nine percent of Germans would vote CDU/CSU [if  there were an election] this week, 40 percent would vote SPD, 8  percent Alliance 90/Greens, 6 percent FDP [Free Democratic  Party] and 3 percent for both the PDS [Party of Democratic  Socialism] and the Republicans.    Twenty percent of Germans believe that the Union [CDU/CSU]  is  the best suited to solve the country's problems. Only 14  percent have confidence in the SPD in this respect. The  majority of Germans (62 percent), however, believe that no party  is in a position to do so.</p>

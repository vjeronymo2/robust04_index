			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / People: Barclays - speedy moves to and from Tokyo Barclays Bank, which has been more severely hit than most of the clearing banks by bad loans, is for the first time apppointing a director of group credit policy. At short notice, it is bringing back one of its top men in Japan, Alan Brown, to fill the job and sending out a UK corporate finance specialist to fill his slot. Brown, who went to Tokyo three years ago, will report straight to Peter Wood, Barclays' finance director. Brown joined the bank from Oxford in 1968, and progressed up the clearing side before becoming a director of Barclays Merchant Bank in 1981. Before Japan he was deputy head of the corporate division. A Barclays spokeswoman said Brown would be looking at credit policy from a strategic point of view, 'not authorising individual loans, but looking at the mix and balance of the portfolio. No one individual did that before'. Before Christmas the bank confounded the City with the news that it had lent Pounds 440m to a single property developer, Imry, against which it was providing Pounds 240m, more than any UK bank had ever previously had to set aside against a loan to a single company. BZW acknowledged that Brown's return from Barclays in Japan, which under the new structure reports to BZW rather than to Barclays, was not ideal. 'The timing is not what we would have decided for ourselves. We had to find someone to pick up the reins,' a spokeswoman said. Hence Callum McCarthy, who only last month had been appointed chairman of BZW UK corporate finance, goes out to replace Brown, who was in charge of corporate and structured finance, foreign exchange, money markets, swaps and options and what remains of the corporate lending business in Japan. This is curious in so far as McCarthy, who was headhunted in 1989 together with Graham Pimlott from Kleinwort Benson, came in to beef up the UK corporate finance client list, a task in which the two have had limited success. McCarthy had previously been an under-secretary at the DTI. Meanwhile, BZW's securities business in Tokyo remains under the wing of Ben Grigsby, who assumes country manager responsibility from Brown.</p>

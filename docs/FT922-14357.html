			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / World Trade News: GEC-Alsthom group wins Pounds 550m China power deal A consortium led by GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French power company, yesterday won a Pounds 550m contract to build a power station in southern China, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. The order - for two 655MW coal-fired units - was placed by a joint venture company owned by Guangdong General Power Company and Hopewell Energy, a subsidiary of Mr Gordon Wu's Hopewell Holdings. The units, to be known as Shajiao C, will be built in the Pearl River delta, 60 miles south of Guangzhou. In keeping with Mr Wu's reputation for speedy construction, the first unit is due for completion within 33 months and the second just three months later. GEC-Alsthom is responsible for the design and engineering of that power station and for the supply and commissioning of the steam turbines and balance of the plant. A subsidiary of Hopewell, Slipform Engineering, will carry out the civil engineering work and ABB Combustion Engineering will supply the boiler islands. About Pounds 300m of the work will be carried out in Europe, the vast bulk in the UK. Guangdong is the fastest growing region in China. Feature: Guangdong province, Page 19</p>

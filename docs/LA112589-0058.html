			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZMAN MOODY ENJOYS AN UPBEAT RIFF, BOTH IN CAREER AND AT HOME;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY  </P> <P> Searching for a sour note in the life of jazzman James Moody, circa 1989, is  about as fruitful as listening for a clinker in his playing.  </P> <P> "Sweet and Lovely," his new album, is riding high, recently entering  Billboard's jazz chart at No. 15 while resting at No. 1 in The Gavin Report and  No. 2 in Radio &amp; Records.  </P> <P> Moody the newlywed seems blissful. The album is dedicated to his wife, Linda,  the reason behind his move from Jersey City to San Diego earlier this year.  </P> <P> Promoters all over the world are after the masterful sax and flute player. He  chalked up impressive flight time this fall, playing Morocco, Egypt, Turkey,  France, Italy and Germany. During his travels, he sends his wife a dozen roses  every Monday, along with frequent Faxes, like one with "I Love You" written in  longhand 100 times.  </P> <P> The only thing remotely bothering the man is the attire required in the Philip  Morris Super Band he's been touring with, joining jazz heavies like Ray Brown,  Herb Ellis and Harry (Sweets) Edison with the backing of the tobacco company.  </P> <P> Moody prefers the loose-fitting designer threads he buys in New York or Beverly  Hills, and the thought of being buttoned into the mandatory tuxedo makes him  cringe.  </P> <P> In town recently during a break between the European and Far Eastern legs of  the Philip Morris tour, San Diego's newest resident jazz master talked about  his life and music.  </P> <P> That he is happier than ever is readily apparent to fellow musicians, such  longtime friends as trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, who gave Moody his first job in  1947, in Gillespie's big band.  </P> <P> "They say I sound better and look better. It's all because of you honey," Moody  said, smiling at his wife in the living room of the townhouse they share. A  graceful glass sculpture of Moody and Gillespie playing together rests on the  coffee table. Otherwise, there aren't much memorabilia: sculptures given to him  and Gillespie in Lagos and Nigeria for their contribution to jazz, and an album  of photos from the Moodys' honeymoon, including a pose with friends Bill Cosby  and Sidney Poitier.  </P> <P> Over the years, Moody and Gillespie have become close friends, playing together  occasionally, calling or writing each other often.  </P> <P> "When I think of Dizzy in the early times, I think about how much I loved his  playing, even though I didn't know what he was doing," Moody said. "I dug him,  but I had no relationship with him like now. We've been on the road, done  things together. I feel close to him.  </P> <P> "Diz said things years ago, and now, a light goes on, and I realize, that's  what he meant!"  </P> <P> Gillespie was the best man at the Moodys' wedding, and he plays on two of his  own tunes on Moody's new album: "Con Alma" and "Get the Booty" as well as  lending a raspy voice with Moody on "Get the Booty," a light-hearted scat duo.  </P> <P> Unlike peers who also cut their chops on be-bop, Moody doesn't believe  electronics are inherently evil. On his last two albums, synthesizers have  provided subtle backup.  </P> <P> "I constantly want to grow in music and spirit," Moody said, adding that people  who readily embrace the newest technologies, should also accept "the musician  who doesn't want to stay in the same groove as when he came up."  </P> <P> Despite the nod to technology, the synthesized sounds don't dilute Moody's  forceful work. He still blows a be-bop storm on alto and tenor saxes and flute,  stretches for high register squeals and squeaks on the horns or lays back with  the smooth, breathy sound he applies so well to ballads.  </P> <P> After more than 40 years in jazz, Moody still practices daily. Mornings, he  plays flute while Linda gets ready for her job as a real estate agent.  Afternoons, he works out on the saxes.  </P> <P> In the never-ending search for new sounds, Moody is about to experiment with  his horns for the first time in years.  </P> <P> "I'm looking for a new mouthpiece. I want a bigger sound. This happened because  I'm playing with younger guys in the Philip Morris band, and I hear their  sound, guys like Ralph Moore on tenor and Gary Smylan on baritone. I need a  different reed, too."  </P> <P> Other young musicians have impressed him, like the vocal sextet Take Six.  </P> <P> "They knocked me out. I must have bought nine or 10 copies of their album just  to give to people."  </P> <P> Among his favorite younger sax players are Harold Land, Michael Brecker and Joe  Henderson.  </P> <P> Moody's history has by now been documented in countless articles: his many  projects with Gillespie, albums as a leader beginning in 1948 ("James Moody and  His Bop Men" on Blue Note), his successful late-'50s battle with alcohol,  working with Las Vegas casino bands in the '70s and his return to full-time  serious jazz in the '80s.  </P> <P> Some of his older work has been reissued on CDs, but Moody isn't too  enthusiastic.  </P> <P> "That's not me any more. It has the old sound. First, you know your alphabet,  but not how to spell. Later, you know the alphabet and how to spell, and you  want to make as many hip words as you can."  </P> <P> Moody is best known to many fans for his 1949 solo on "I'm in the Mood for  Love," recorded in Stockholm. The improvisation became the tune called "Moody's  Mood for Love," with lyrics by singer Eddie Jefferson. Sung by King Pleasure,  the song was a hit in 1952, and has been recorded several times since,  including versions by Aretha Franklin and George Benson. Moody usually sings it  himself in club dates.  </P> <P> Jazz fans who hope Moody's move to San Diego might mean more local appearances  will be disappointed.  </P> <P> "I don't like playing at home," he said.  </P> <P> "He gets called constantly for favors," said his wife, who handles some of his  business affairs. "But he gets his two weeks in at Elario's, and that's it."  </P> <P> Moody won't play Elario's until next year, but you might see him in the  audience when he's in town. He stopped in recently to catch old friends Cedar  Walton and Billy Higgins, and he planned to hear local flutist Holly Hofmann at  the Horton Grand Hotel downtown.  </P> <P> Every so often, someone asks Moody, 64, about telling his story for a book.  "I'm not interested," he said. "I think we all have interesting lives."  </P></p>

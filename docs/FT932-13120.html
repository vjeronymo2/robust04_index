			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: News in Brief A SPATE OF new fixed-rate mortgage offers came on the market this week, and Abbey National is offering two of them. One is 6.99 per cent (8.2 apr) until October 31 1994; the other is 8.99 per cent (8.9 apr) until the end of January 2000. Both are offered on all types of mortgage and are portable. There is a Pounds 250 non-refundable booking charge. Early redemption penalties are 60 days' interest for the former and 210 days' interest on the latter. Nationwide has extended its two-year, fixed-rate mortgage to apply to all borrowers instead of only first-time buyers. The rate is fixed at 5.75 per cent in the first year and 6.75 per cent in the second (8.2 apr). The maximum advance is 90 per cent of the property's value but borrowers must take out the society's mortgage payment cover policy. The rate is available on endowment, pension and repayment loans and the arrangement fee is Pounds 195, with a a penalty of six months' interest if the loan is redeemed in the first year and four months' in the second. A three-year rate of 7.69 per cent (8.3 apr), fixed until June 30 1996, has been launched by Bradford &amp; Bingley. It is available on all types of mortgage but customers will have to take out two insurance-related products from the society. The booking fee on loans up to Pounds 100,000 is Pounds 295, and 0.3 per cent on higher amounts. The early redemption penalty is three months. A survey by the Alliance &amp; Leicester building society shows that nearly 7m home-owners would like to move house. The results, released this week, follow research carried out before the Budget. A quarter of those questioned - or 1.7m - believe they are likely to move within the next year; this compares with 1.3m who moved in 1992. More than one-third said they could not afford to move but over half over-estimated present mortgage rates. 'This is like a dam waiting to burst,' said Peter White, group chief executive. 'Factors holding people back include the effects of the economy, lack of job security and, surprisingly, the fact that many don't realise how cheap mortgages have become.' A new edition of the Pep Performance Guide has been issued by Chase de Vere. The charts, which are published quarterly, cover the period to April 1 1993. Around 600 unit and investment trust Peps are listed, together with those single company Peps where the underlying share is quoted on the FT-SE 100. The leading unit trust Pep over three years is the Pep Progressive Accummulation managed by St James's Place. It is followed by Perpetual's High Income Pep, Schroder's Enterprise Pep, Newton's General Pep, and Perpetual's Pep Growth &amp; Income. In the investment trust sector, the five top performers were Ivory &amp; Sime with its Personal Assets Pep, followed by River &amp; Mercantile's Stepped Preference Pep, Moorgate's General Consolidated Stepped Preference Pep, Law Debenture's Pep and TR City of London Pep. Chase de Vere singled out Perpetual's performance as standing out for its consistency throughout the charts.

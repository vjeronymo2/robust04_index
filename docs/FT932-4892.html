			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Fingerprint system tenders sought THE HOME OFFICE is within weeks of seeking tenders for the UK's first comprehensive national automated fingerprint recognition system. It has chosen Computer Management Group, the privately held computing services company, to help translate the requirements of the 43 police forces in England and Wales that will use the system into a technical specification and to provide quality assurance. Mr Jonathan Duke-Evans, who is responsible for the project at the Home Office, said he hoped the specification would be complete by the end of the summer. A number of police forces are already making use of an automated fingerprint recognition service provided by International Business Machines. But the intention is that the new system, known as Nafis, will for the first time combine both scene-of-crime matching, which means identifying fingerprints discovered at the scene of a crime, and personal identification - comparing a suspect's prints with those held on the database. Nafis is expected to cost up to Pounds 45m by the time it is ready to go into service in 1996-97. Mr Duke-Evans said the Home Office had an open mind on the technology to be employed. It could involve large mainframes or supercomputers, or a new and advanced technology called neural networking, based on what scientists know of the working of the human mind. Nafis is expected to become part of a nationwide criminal identification system that will include the National Criminal Record System, the Fingerprint Image System and the Police National Network. The Home Office has been working with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to develop technology for fingerprint recognition. CMG is one of the largest private computer services companies in Europe, making pre-tax profits last year of Pounds 9.5m on sales of Pounds 116m.</p>

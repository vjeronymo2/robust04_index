			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Rauf Denktas has said that the  nondocument on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] has been  further damaged as a result of the violation of the map during  the last round of the talks. Replying to a question by a  Turkish Cypriot News Agency correspondent on whether any results  were achieved during his visit to Maras [Varosha] yesterday,  Denktas said that he did not go to Maras to achieve results but  to see what the two maps submitted by the United Nations were  about and to determine whether the sections requested in the  second map were actually within the barbed wire region. He  added that the sections requested in the second map were not  remotely connected with the barbed wire region.    Commenting on the Greek Cypriot shots fired at Turkish  Cypriot positions on the border, Denktas noted that it is clear  that provocations are increasing in all fields. He stressed  that the side that is wrong and knows it to be so is escalating  the provocations. Pointing out that it is the duty of the just  to be patient and coolheaded, Denktas added: I, therefore,  sincerely congratulate our soldiers and their commanders who  have maintained their patience, discipline, and their cool in  the face of these provocations.

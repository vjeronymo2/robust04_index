			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Greg Arde] </F>   [Text] Durban May 1 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  was leading the election race in Natal on Sunday [1 May] evening  but the rival African National Congress was optimistic that its  support would reflect well when counting ended in the province,  conservatively estimated to be late Monday.    IFP spokesman Peter Smith said his party was tentatively  optimistic at 8 PM Sunday, when he said 20 percent of the Natal  vote had been counted. On Sunday afternoon the IFP had at least  60 percent support.    By 7 PM the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said that  while the IFP had only gained just under four percent of the  national vote counted at that time, the party led in Natal. In  KwaZulu/Natal the IFP had 81,459 votes (54.6 per cent) and ANC  32,976 (22.1), the IEC said.    At 7 PM Sunday over 1,000 counting officials were queuing at  Durban's Expo Centre in preparation for their 12-hour shift. A  third of Natal's votes are expected to be counted there.    Earlier reconciliation of ballot boxes there was delayed  because of a dispute over pirate voting stations, which were  allegedly operated in Natal. The IEC said it was investigating  the issue, and reports had been submitted for consideration by  the commission in its assessment of whether the elections were  free and fair.    By noon on Sunday the IEC said counting was on track at most  stations in the province, but the results were only expected in  36 hours -- if there were not any major hitches in the process.    Meanwhile, the ANC's election co-ordinator in southern  Natal,  Mr Nhlanhla Ngidi conceded that early indications did not give  his party a good showing. "As of now we are not doing very  well, the IFP lead is about 50 percent. But I think we are  steadily going to rise. We expect a lot of votes in mainly  urban areas and in southern Natal," he said. "Voting appears to  have generally gone along racial lines and we are planning to  get a majority among Africans," Mr Ngidi said, adding that the  National Party and the IFP appeared to have won the support of  minorities. But, he noted, only 100,000 votes had been counted  in Natal, of an ANC estimated 4.5 to 6 million voters.    The IFP's Mr Smith said: "Until you start reaching a far  higher percentage it's difficult to draw conclusions, but it  looks like we're on a winning streak." He said the IFP would  probably be "neck and neck" with the ANC in urban townships of  Natal.    The IEC reports that counting in certain smaller rural  stations in Natal like Babanango and Pongola was completed on  Sunday. Counting at the bigger stations was on Sunday night  still continuing at a steady rate. It's acknowledged that the  outcome in these areas could dramatically affect the final Natal  result.</p>

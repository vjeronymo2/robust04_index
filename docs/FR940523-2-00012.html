The review covers 15 Chinese producers/exporters and 32 third-country resellers for the period January 1, 1990, through December 31, 1990. Based on our analysis of the comments received, we determine the country-wide dumping margin for the People's Republic of China to be 128.94 percent. Since none of the third-country resellers have demonstrated entitlement to a separate rate for sales made during this period or review, they will receive the same rate as their suppliers in the People's Republic of China. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> May 23, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Paul Stolz or Thomas Futtner, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;4474 or 482&hyph;3814 respectively. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 30, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results (58 FR 69330) of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on potassium permanganate from the People's Republic of China (PRC) (49 FR 3898, January 31, 1984). The Department has now completed this administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of the Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Imports covered by this review are shipments of potassium permanganate, an inorganic chemical produced in free-flowing, technical, and pharmaceutical grades. During the review period, potassium permanganate was classifiable under item 2841.60.0010 of the harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review covers 15 producers/ exporters and 32 third-country resellers for the period January 1, 1990, through December 31, 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Comments Received <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results. At the request of the following respondents, Zunyi Chemical Factory (Zunyi), Yue Pak Co. Ltd. (Yue Pak), He-Ro Chemicals, Ltd. (He-Ro), ICD (HK) Ltd, (ICD (HK)) and an interested party, Novachem, Inc. (Novahem), we held a public hearing on February 10, 1994. We received timely comments from the above-named respondents, the above-named interested party, and the petitioner, Carus Chemical Company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Methodology: Zunyi and Novachem assert that, in this review, the Department should have provided them with an opportunity to respond to a separate rates questionnaire specifically based on the test announced in Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the People's Republic of China (Sparklers) on May 6, 1991 rather than that based on the separate rates criteria set forth in Iron Construction Casting from the People's Republic of China; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review (Castings) on January 24, 1991. Zunyi and Novachem assert that in Castings, the Department stated ``Our determination that the PRC is a state-controlled economy in which all entities are presumed to export under the control of the state leads us to question the application of multiple rates, absent a clear showing of legal, financial and economic independence. Thus, we conclude that a single country-wide rate is application for this case.'' Zunyi and Novachem contrast that with Sparklers, where the Department adopted the following position: ``We have determined that exporters in non-market economy countries are entitled to separate, company-specific margins when they can demonstrate an absence of control by the central government, both in law and in fact, with respect to exports. Evidence supporting, though not requiring, a finding of de jure absence of central control includes: (1) An absence of restrictive stipulation associated with an individual exporter's business and export licenses; (2) any legislative enactments decentralizing control of companies; or (3) any other formal measures by the government decentralizing control of companies. De facto absence of central government control with respect to exports is based on two prerequisites: (1) Whether each exporter sets its own export prices independently of the government and other exporters; and (2) whether each exporter can keep the proceeds from its sales.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Veba suffers from 'marked loss' in chemical operations NET profits at Veba, the Dusseldorf-based conglomerate, fell by 20 per cent last year to DM900m (Dollars 570.7m), down from DM1.02bn in 1991. Sales climbed by 12 per cent to DM67bn, reflecting the inclusion of the forwarding company Schenker for the first time. The profits drop was due to a 'marked loss' in the company's chemicals operations, combined with a substantial deterioration in earnings in the oil division. Profits increased in trading, transportation and services as well as the core electricity generating business. A fall of this magnitude was expected after the company warned last month of the impact of extraordinary charges to cover the costs of redundancies and other rationalisation measures, mainly in the chemicals sector. These were likely to amount to DM337m for 1992, the company warned at the time. Mr Klaus Piltz, chief executive, said in early December that the group planned to cut 7,000 jobs by the end of 1993, 5,000 of them in 1992. Over last year as a whole, the number of employees rose by 13,000 to 130,000, an increase of around 11 per cent, reflecting the acquisition of Schenker. Other factors affecting profits were extraordinary provisions in the nuclear energy field and start-up costs for new plants in the chemicals and oils businesses. Veba intends to hold its 1992 dividend at DM12 per share, the same level as in 1991.</p>

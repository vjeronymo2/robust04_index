			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> DPC Ends Hostile Bid for Dataproducts: DPC Acquisition Corp., citing "disarray  in the financial markets," ended its yearlong hostile effort to buy  Dataproducts Corp. by scrapping a $190-million tender offer for the Woodland  Hills maker of computer printers. The New York investor group, which already  owns 7.5% of Dataproducts' stock, had offered $10 cash for each of the  remaining shares. But since launching the offer in October, DPC's investment  bankers had been unable to raise the cash.  </P></p>

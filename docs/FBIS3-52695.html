			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Ilyas al-Hirawi at a traditional annual </F> reception for the members of the Arab and foreign diplomatic  corps held at Ba'bda Palace in Beirut on 6 January--recorded]    [Excerpts] Your Excellency, dean of the diplomatic corps:  On behalf of all Lebanese people we thank you for the noble  sentiments you expressed on your behalf and on behalf of the  diplomatic corps for Lebanon and me. We thank you for the  appreciation you expressed for the achievements of this country,  which is striving to regain its health and sovereignty. This  country will always remember your support for progress in the  march to liberation, reconstruction, and peace. [passage  omitted]    You are witnessing this country's determination to rebuild  itself, despite the inherited burdens and the stormy political  changes taking place around us and in the world. Convey to your  countries and peoples that Lebanon has overcome the inherited  ordeal, and is moving toward the future with self-confidence and  faith in its rights.    The most significant achievements of the peace process were  the triumph of the will of the Lebanese people in the struggle  for coexistence, the development of a plan for salvation, and  the return to a normal life. You have witnessed the unity of  the comprehensive and firm national position in the face of the  shocks to which we were subjected this year, beginning with our  collective rejection of the Palestinian deportees, our unity in  one rank in repulsing the Israeli aggression against the south  and western al-Biqa' last July, and ending with [words  indistinct] recommendation issued by the UN General Assembly  last month regarding UN Security Council Resolution 425. These  shocks, which came [words indistinct] were dwarfed by the will  of the Lebanese. They confirmed that Lebanon has become  stronger than all the storms, and that it deserves the backing  of your countries to regain its rights. [passage indistinct]    We have participated in the Madrid Conference within the  framework of the implementation of Resolution 425 to achieve  just and comprehensive peace and not any partial or unjust  peace. The assurances contained in all the letters we received  from the U.S. Administration since 1991 leave no doubt that  efforts will be made to implement this resolution.    We participated out of solidarity with our Arab brothers in  the Madrid Conference, which also involved the implementation of  the other UN resolutions, particularly resolutions 242 and 338.  We are interested in the establishment of a just and  comprehensive peace. Whoever talks about a comprehensive and  just peace means peace in the whole area, and not a separate  peace, but how meaningful peace would be if it is achieved with  Lebanon and Syria.    We extend our thanks to the UN forces--commanders, officers,  and soldiers--and to their countries. The sacrifices they are  making to safeguard Lebanese legitimacy in the south in  implementation of the provisions of Resolution 425 deserve our  thanks and gratitude.    Your Excellencies, the most precious treasure which the  Lebanese possess is the will to constantly move forward. We  have three priorities today: Reinforcing national  reconciliation, launching socioeconomic reconstruction, and  strengthening Lebanon's position in the area and the world.  What we have accomplished in a short period confirms that  Lebanon is a living country. We have moved from an economic  crisis, social division, and political and military conflict to  the people rallying around the state and the success of the  state and personal initiative in checking economic  deterioration. A big improvement has been achieved in the  balance of payments this year. We were also able to absorb the  deficit in the balance of trade, and saw an increase in bank  deposits and an increase in the development rate to about seven  percent.    Despite the burdens, Lebanon has not defaulted on payment of  its foreign debts. In this regard, we extend our thanks to the  World Bank, to the countries that granted us long-term loans,  and to the Arab funds which provided assistance to projects in  Lebanon. [passage omitted]    Your excellencies, less than two months ago our country  celebrated the 50th anniversary of its national independence,  looking to the year 1994 with much hope for positive  accomplishments. During this year we will complete the building  of the state, launch the workshop of reconstruction in Beirut  and the regions; and we anticipate decisive progress in the  efforts for comprehensive and just peace. What reinforces our  confidence is the positive international response to our  efforts, led by the decision of His Holiness Pope John Paul II  to visit Lebanon in response to invitations by all Lebanese  officials as a confirmation of the unity of our country and  reconciliation of its people.    Your excellencies, a country that offers coexistence as a  model to the world and carries the banner of democracy, freedom,  development, and reconstruction is a country that deserves  peace. Long live peace, long live Lebanon.</p>

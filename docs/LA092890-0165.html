			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> NEW LIFE PROJECT BUILDS SELF-ESTEEM  </P> <P> Carlos Lemus was living on the streets just 11 months ago, so he knows how much  the backpacks loaded with pens, pencils, paper and glue will mean when they are  given out to poor and homeless children at the Orange County Rescue Mission.  </P> <P> "This area is drug-infested and many people have children living below the  poverty level," said Lemus, a member of the mission's New Life rehabilitation  program.  </P> <P> "It will give the children something to look forward to."  </P> <P> About 10 New Life participants stuffed 150 backpacks donated by local  businesses in preparation for a giveaway scheduled Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1  p.m. at the mission. The children will also be given inflatable "water wings."  </P> <P> New Life members, who live at the mission for one year before taking a  full-time job or entering school, help out with projects to gain self-esteem  before re-entering mainstream life, said Jim Palmer, project coordinator.  </P> <P> "These people have gone through a lot and helping someone else kind of puts  things in perspective. Since many of them have recently come off the streets  themselves, they're more understanding and sensitive to the people who come for  help," Palmer said.  </P> <P> Lemus, who will graduate from the New Life program next month, said he felt  good about the project because as a former homeless man, he has rarely had a  chance to help others.  </P> <P> "If I could give someone $100 for a worthy purpose, I'd feel good," he said.  "But I'm not in a position to do that. I'm still trying to get my life back  together." CHERYLANNE BEALER  </P></p>

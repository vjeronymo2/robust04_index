			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Bass finds running hotels is no holiday: British steps to improve the quality of a US product The problems of running a predominantly franchised hotel chain through a US recession, with falling property values and a credit crunch, are proving less than a holiday for Bass, the UK hotel, brewer and leisure group. Since it acquired the Holiday Inn brand in the US in a complex deal in August 1989, Bass has seen a dip in operating profits from its hotel division, become embroiled in a law suit, faced a ferocious competitive environment and struggled to persuade some franchisees to upgrade properties. Nevertheless, the British owners, who have taken some firm steps in an attempt to cure Holiday Inn's problems, remain remarkably bullish. And, although it is probably too soon to judge whether such optimism is well-placed, the recent surge in the Bass share price, ahead of next week's interims, suggests certain followers are optimistic. When Bass, which already owned Holiday Inns outside the US, acquired the brand in the US, it was displayed on almost 1,400 properties, mostly run by franchisees. The consideration was almost Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn), largely comprising the assumption of Holiday debt. Holiday's sister chain, Hampton Inn, along with the Harrah casinos and some other assets, were spun off to the group's former management, creating a new company called Promus. Bass's total operating profits from the hotel division slipped to Pounds 103m in the 12 months to mid-1991, of which the US properties were reckoned to contribute between two-thirds and three-quarters - a paltry return, given the outlay. In London the Bass share price remained in the 460p-520p range throughout 1991. Even in the current year, with the US economy improving, it has not been plain sailing. A share price rally was temporarily reversed following news of a lawsuit by Bass against Promus in February. This alleged misrepresentations by Promus at the time of the Holiday deal; breached warranties; and failure to adhere to a tax-sharing contract. The US suit is thin on detail and both parties have declined to comment  - although Bass tends to downplay the action, suggesting it is designed to keep all options open. However, the complaints which can be gleaned from the documents are scarcely encouraging. They include Promus's alleged failure to notify Bass about a Federal Trade Commission investigation into a now-discontinued Holiday subsidiary; the supposed refusal to execute an agreement which would have 'cured' a default on a San Francisco Holiday Inn; Holiday's compliance with federal regulations covering underground fuel storage tanks; and Promus's alleged failure to make adequate provision for bad debts on a Dollars 50m loan by Holiday to VMS, owner of 24 hotels operated under the Holiday name. So what has been going on with the world's largest hotel brand, during around two years of British ownership? Holiday Inn was created 40 years ago by Mr Kemmons Wilson, a Memphis-based property man. Infuriated by the service he received at motels, he devised a formula designed to meet the requirements of travellers better. The first Holiday Inn opened outside Memphis in 1952. By the 1970s, the chain had expanded, and the company began to concentrate on overseas growth. But management changed and the focus shifted to activities such as gaming. Then, in the credit-easy 1980s, a wave of hotel building splintered the market, with growth focused on luxury hotels at one end and economy motels at the other. Holiday's management built up the Hampton Inn chain in response and introduced the up-market Crowne Plaza line, but its core middle-market Holiday Inns seemed to languish. When ownership changed, Holiday Inn was not the best nurtured of brands. The UK owner has taken action on two fronts. The first centres on costs, and a streamlining of activities. Bass has sliced off some non-core businesses, for example, such as the manufacturing section of the Holiday Services division. It has also overhauled the service facilities for franchisees, replacing regional staff with a head office service department; rewritten the bulky franchise manual; and closed down the Holiday Inn 'university' in favour of training instructors who visit the properties. When Bass acquired the US brand 2,400 people were employed at its headquarters in Memphis. Bass shifted Holiday Inn's headquarters to Atlanta where just over 1,000 are now employed. But this still leaves the toughest area, and one which worries investors most: quality standards. Bass says when it took over Holiday Inn's properties '80 per cent were in very reasonable condition', meaning several hundred were sub-standard. A fairly tough battle seems to have ensued to persuade franchisees to upgrade their properties. More than 90 properties have dropped out of the Holiday Inn system since March 1990, although new franchisee signings, notably for a replacement downmarket chain under the 'Holiday Express' title, have also taken place. Meanwhile, the competitive environment has been ferocious. The US recession coupled with the Gulf war left the country's lodging market awash with rooms. For example, Ramada, another middle-market hotel chain, launched a tough advertising campaign under the 'Ramada's in, Holiday's out' theme, earlier this year. 'Laughable', retorts Holiday, noting that some of its less prestigious properties are now run under the Ramada banner. Nevertheless, the British owners are optimistic. They claim the quality problem is slowly righting itself. 'It's an ongoing problem but it is being solved,' says Mr Bryan Langton, chairman of Holiday Inn Worldwide. Holiday, which has traditionally enjoyed higher-than-average room rates and occupancy levels, also claims it increased this premium against middle-market competitors in 1991, in spite of the soft underlying market and competitive conditions. Some franchisees are supportive: 'Bass is raising the standard and there's good open communication,' says one. 'If there's a negative, it's that a lot of people have left who knew the brand.' But competition in the US lodging market is still intense and even Bass admits it may take longer to change US consumers' perceptions of the chain. Perhaps the most encouraging sign is that Holiday is ploughing ahead with plans to raise franchise fees. Traditionally, Holiday Inn franchisees have paid more than 4 per cent of room revenues to the brand owner. Since February, Holiday has insisted on 5 per cent for all new franchisees. It has also begun to offer existing franchisees, whose contracts come up for renewal, another two years at the 4 per cent rate, and then a switch on to 5 per cent. The advantage for Holiday, says Mr Langton, is that about 40 per cent of franchisee contracts fall due during the next five years.</p>

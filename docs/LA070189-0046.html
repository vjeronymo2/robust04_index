			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SUICIDAL MAN SURVIVES GANG LIFE TO FINISH SCHOOL AND HELP OTHERS  </P> <P> After years of gang violence, during which he was shot in the leg and one of  his best friends was shot to death, Frank Bennett got drunk, put a rifle to his  chest and pulled the trigger.  </P> <P> The suicide attempt 10 years ago left Bennett paralyzed from the waist down and  confined to a wheelchair, but his gang activities continued.  </P> <P> "The only thing I couldn't do was walk," Bennett, 28, said recently. "I was  into partying, hanging out, taking drugs, marijuana, coke, anything that I  could get."  </P> <P> Bennett abandoned his gang life style more than a year ago. He became a  Christian and returned to school full time. Recently, he received a high school  diploma from an adult school.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Received Commendation  </P> <P> He also received a congressional commendation in recognition of his academic  achievement. He was awarded a $200 scholarship and plans to enroll at Cerritos  College in the fall.  </P> <P> "After I accepted Christ, I had the desire to go back and finish school," said  Bennett, who dropped out during his junior year at Gahr High in Cerritos in  1978 after being shot by rival gang members.  </P> <P> Bennett had been a gang member in an Artesia area known as Chivas. For years,  his gang has fought with the rival Varrio gang in nearby Norwalk and with gangs  from other areas.  </P> <P> "They would drive by and shoot into the house," Bennett said. "My mom's car was  set on fire and burned. Once, a young lady sitting on the sofa was wounded in  the neck by a bullet.  </P> <P> "We retaliated. I won't be specific but we always retaliated. It was an eye for  an eye."  </P> <P> A high school friend was shot and killed by a rival gang. And when he was a  high school junior, Bennett was shot in the leg, forcing him off the track  team.  </P> <P> He said he dropped out of school after officials demanded that he switch to  continuation school.  </P> <P> Bennett now goes into the neighborhoods in his wheelchair, preaching  Christianity and pleading with gang members to quit gang life.  </P> <P> Gangs are "a waste of life, especially for young people," he said. "I wasted my  early years. I now urge youths not to do the same. I tell them to finish school  and make a better life for themselves."  </P> <P> When Bennett tells them that it is never too late, he can point to himself as  an example.  </P> <P> During graduation ceremonies, Bennett was presented with a U. S. Congressional  Recognition Award from the office of Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove),  whose 38th District includes the ABC Unified School District.  </P> <P> "This was a significant achievement given for great personal effort. I feel  really good about the accomplishment of this young man from Artesia," said Jim  Weisenberg, ABC school board member who presented the award.  </P> <P> A mediocre student during his regular high school days, Bennett said he  received mostly A's and B's his last year of adult school.  </P> <P> "Frank was one of our oldest graduates. He was also a good student," said  Marilyn Ghysels, who has taught at the adult school for 11 years. "Frank had  been coming to adult school off and on since 1985. But the past year, he was  motivated. Something happened. He turned the corner."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Thought About Suicide  </P> <P> Bennett said he started going to church about four years ago, but still was  taking drugs. About 1 1/2 years ago, he contemplated another suicide attempt.  "I put a loaded rifle to my head but something told me no," he said.  </P> <P> Bennett said he was helped by a support group that included Larry Rodriguez,  29, a former gang member and minister in the New Heart Street Ministry, a  program that attempts to persuade youths to give up gangs and drugs.  </P> <P> Bennett, Rodriguez and another former gang member, Ralph Teran, 33, grew up in  the Southeast area and are friends.  </P> <P> "We walk the streets and tell the gang members, especially the young ones,  about the dangers of gang activities and drugs," said Rodriguez, a Cerritos  College graduate who is an electrician for the Los Angeles County Sanitation  Districts.  </P> <P> They also invite gang members to Bible study sessions at various locations in  Artesia, Hawaiian Gardens and Burbank, Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> Bennett said: "We know it is difficult for them to quit but we tell them it can  be done."  </P> <P> Bennett said he hopes eventually to find a job in the computer field.  </P></p>

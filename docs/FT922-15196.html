			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / The transformation of a regional bank: Problems remain at the IADB, but much has been achieved LIKE the region it was formed to serve 33 years ago, the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) languished throughout the 1980s. Now, optimism is high over prospects for the economies of Latin America and over the role which the bank has carved out for itself in the 1990s. Four years ago, the relevance of the institution to Latin America's deep economic problems was being questioned. In 1988, its lending fell below Dollars 2bn: a drop in the ocean compared to the billions of dollars being transferred out of the region. The bank's management and its largest shareholder, the US of the Reagan years, were consistently at loggerheads. It was used by Latin American governments as a way of rewarding faithful servants with sinecures. As a result, it was inefficient and ineffective. The bank, which is preparing for its annual meeting next week in the Dominican Republic, has not solved all these problems. But it has come a long way. The change dates back three years, to the laboriously negotiated capital increase settled amid much acrimony. This widened the bank's role beyond that of a traditional project-lender, helping the bank's lending nearly to triple. The bank was put at the centre of President Bush's Enterprise for the Americas initiative, which foresaw increased economic and trade co-operation between North and South America. The initiative was seized upon with enthusiasm by many Latin American governments, which saw the end of superpower rivalry as necessitating new relationships within the hemisphere. The man who helped to transform the image of the bank is its president, Mr Enrique Iglesias, a well-connected, outgoing Uruguayan diplomat and architect of the current Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. Mr Iglesias was not, however, the man to reform the internal administration of the bank, whose staff now totals 1,700. That task fell to his deputy, Mr James Conrow. He was seen initially as Washington's 'hard man,' but this bluff, bearded American cut a more sympathetic figure, while still being effective in restructuring the bank. Much of the restructuring is done. Some departments are under review - the public relations, legal and secretariat sections - and the auditing and control functions are also to be examined. The bank is again beginning to talk about raising more capital. The increase agreed in 1989 expanded capital from Dollars 15.7bn to Dollars 26.5bn and allowed for a Dollars 22.5bn lending programme in the four years 1990-1993. This has put the IADB on a par with the World Bank in terms of new loans made to the region and may lead the IADB soon surpass it: despite the new ability of some countries to attract private capital, the region's investment needs are huge. Although not on the formal agenda at next week's meeting, a central element of the discussions over a capital increase will be the question of whether the bank should break with the past and lend directly and without government guarantee to the private sector. Some governments, such as Mexico's, have opposed this in the past, in part because they say that the bank is not equipped to assess commercial risk. On the other hand, governments such as Chile's worry that, if they hand over large parts of infrastructure development to the private sector, they lose access to IADB capital for infrastructure development. The meeting will assess, however, whether to expand the bank's capacity to make balance of payments, as opposed to project, loans. The bank has been able to make such sector-loans - meant to encourage reforms in specified sectors of the economy - since the last capital increase. The idea was that about 25 per cent of its lending should be in sectoral loans over 1990-93. The 1991 figure was 37 per cent of total lending (without significant lending to either Brazil or Argentina), and the bank wants to formalise an increased share for sector lending. It wants this in part to encourage reform in its smaller member countries, in which the World Bank has less involvement but to which the IADB must make 35 per cent of its loans. It has also been asked to contribute finance to Brady-style bank debt restructurings, from its sector-lending programme. The bank also sees itself as increasing its role in the alleviation of poverty and in the social-investment sectors such as health and education that have been badly neglected in many countries through the austerity of the 1980s.</p>

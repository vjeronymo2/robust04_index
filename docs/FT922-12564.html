			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Harrow abandons national pay talks THE LONDON borough of Harrow is to abandon national pay-bargaining arrangements for all workers except teachers, highlighting a likely acceleration of the trend towards local pay determination in the public sector. Local pay bargaining by councils, Civil Service departments and hospital trusts has been given fresh impetus by the Conservative general election victory. The government is keen to encourage the erosion of national negotiating machinery which it considers is often too inflexible to deal with local needs. About 25 of the UK's 450 local authorities have withdrawn from national pay talks in the past two years, but Harrow is the first London borough to do so. Mr John Coe, chief personnel officer at Conservative-controlled Harrow, said he knew of two other London authorities that were considering pulling out of national negotiations. A small number of larger authorities outside London were also looking at local pay arrangements and not all were Conservative controlled. Harrow councillors have agreed in principle to negotiate locally from next year for 4,000 white and blue-collar workers. Most councils with local bargaining have opted out of the national framework only for white-collar workers. Mr Coe warned councillors that they should not regard local bargaining as a means of keeping pay down. Rises would depend on the council's ability to pay but it was also important to have rates which enabled the borough to recruit and keep staff. He said local bargaining would give the council increased flexibility.</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INITIATIVE WOULD LET DOGS RUN UNLEASHED  </P> <P> Dogs will be able to run without leashes on Hermosa Beach's greenbelt if a  petition submitted last week qualifies for the November ballot and is approved  by the voters. The petition, circulated by a group of pet owners called  Watchdog, carried 2,108 signatures, about 800 more than needed to qualify as an  initiative. The city must verify the signatures.  </P> <P> The initiative would exempt dogs from the city's leash law as long as they  remained under the "confident control" of their handlers on the Santa Fe  Railroad right of way, a strip of land running through Hermosa Beach between  Valley Drive and Ardmore Avenue.  </P> <P> The measure also would eliminate the city's right under current open space  zoning to use 10% of the open space for development. Some City Council members  have proposed construction of gazebos, shelters, public toilets and visitor  parking.  </P> <P> The council voted in February to apply the leash law to the strip after its  purchase of the land is finalized Jan. 1, 1990. That decision aroused pet  owners who have exercised their unleashed dogs for years on the right of way  without interference from the railroad company.  </P></p>

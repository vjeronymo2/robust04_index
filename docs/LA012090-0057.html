			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'AS IS' CAPTURES DELICATE BALANCE OF AIDS' HORRORS  </P> <P> When they write the definitive history of the '80s, William Hoffman's "As Is"  will have to be considered one of the cultural milestones -- not because the  play is the best of the decade or the most innovative or even the most  eloquent, but because it captures both the beginning and end of an era,  freezing the moment in time when the horror of AIDS set in as a social reality.  </P> <P> And it does so with such deft skill that it has the compelling urgency of a  living document, while always maintaining a buoyancy that keeps us entertained.  Without ever devaluing the suffering or the rage that AIDS inevitably brings in  its wake, the play transmutes despair into gallows humor, and dread into  pathos. Hoffman's considerable wit as a writer has been to achieve a delicate  three-way balance between comedy, tragedy and -- for lack of a better term --  explanation.  </P> <P> In 90 swift minutes at the Forum Theatre here, this production by the South  Orange County Community Theatre sketches in the lives of Rich (Dan Millington)  and Saul (Mike Moon), a gay New York couple who have recently broken up. Rich,  a writer who has just published a collection of short stories, has gone off to  live with a new lover named Chet. Saul, a photographer, is still living at the  old apartment and still in love with Rich.  </P> <P> After watching them bicker over a division of their possessions -- the cat,  Aunt Billie's hooked rug, the collectibles, the Barcelona chair and "the  world's largest collection of Magic Marker hustler portraits" -- we soon learn  in a quick collage of scenes with a chorus of doctors, relatives and friends  that Rich has been diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> Saul is shocked. One of their friends recently died in San Francisco. Another,  whom he has just visited in the hospital, is in the terminal throes of the  disease. "The good news," Rich says "is that I have only swollen glands." The  bad news, of course, is that he is experiencing denial. The next is fear and  bitter anger, then self-pity -- "Why me?" -- and finally, with Saul's  comforting acceptance of him "as is," the inevitable descent toward death.  </P> <P> What makes the play so affecting is that while the characters are caught on the  brink of disaster, they never descend into sentimentality. Hoffman goes out of  his way in the writing to deflate any special plea for sympathy. And both leads  give sterling performances. Millington brings a taut clarity to the role of  Rich, while Moon infuses the role of Saul with vivid warmth.  </P> <P> Two scenes alone are worth the price of admission. One, in a hustler bar,  satirizes the homosexual mating dance of a pair of leather-clad clones named  Chuck and Chad. "Thought you were this guy Chip I met here on Jockstrap Night,"  Chad says. "Haven't been here since the Slave Auction," Chuck says. The other  scene, at an AIDS hot line office, is also brilliantly funny. (Jon Taylor  Carter is a scream.)  </P> <P> Other members of the cast who lend support in multiple roles are Bart Story,  John David and David Napier. Particularly good are B.J. Scott, whose monologues  as a hospice worker tuck the play into context, and Ardis Faith, who is  gorgeous as the leggy knockout, Lilly. Sandy Silver's direction keeps the pace  of the action flowing nicely.  </P> <P> A final note: "As Is," the winner of a 1985 Drama Desk Award and three Tony  nominations, earned the distinction last May of being banned in Garden Grove,  where another community theater dropped plans to produce it under pressure from  a member of the City Council who objected to its content. We ought to be  grateful. Without Garden Grove's craven censorship, this fine amateur  production might never have been mounted.  </P> <P> 'AS IS'  </P> <P> A South Orange County Community Theatre production of "As Is."

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities futures and options trading Stock index futures gained ground in thin volumes, with much of the day's activity generated by the looming expiry of the FT-SE 100 December contract, writes Jeffrey Brown. At the close of pit trading the December contract was at 3,016, up 9 points. The premium to the cash market was 4 points, or 2 points above fair value. Activity was again minimal. Lots dealt totalled 18,672, but this included close to 10,000 contracts of spread trading as dealers rolled over into the March contract. One point of interest was the widening in the premium at which the March contract sells above December - from 13 points on Wednesday to 15 at the outset yesterday, and almost to 18 at the close. Dealers interpreted this as a clear sign of investor optimism as takeover fever gripped the City's securities houses following news of SG Warburg's merger discussions. Traded option volume fell to 24,586 lots, from 33,407 on Wednesday, with FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business accounting for 19,000. Retailer Argyll was the most active stock option, having 761 contracts dealt. BZW issued a novel Pounds 9bn warrants basket linked to smaller companies, which the investment bank claimed is the first of its kind. The 50 companies have an average market capitalisation of Pounds 200m.</p>

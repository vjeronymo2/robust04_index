This and other details will be discussed in the  following report by Mario Espinoza:    [Begin recording] In a few seconds I will give you the name  of the new National Police commander who will be installed on 4  February. But let us review the issues one at a time.    I am here in the Senate, where this afternoon there will be  a  secret session during which at least four police colonels will  be promoted to general. The promotion of at least two of them  is absolutely certain, that of the current Police Department  chief, Colonel Luis Rocha; and Colonel Willy Arriaza.    The new National Police chief will be installed on 4  February  during a ceremony to be held at Government House that will be  headed by the president.    The current National Police chief, General Einar Lopez, has  fulfilled his years in service and, therefore, will retire. He  will be replaced by newly appointed General Luis Rocha.  Moreover, Col. Willy Arriaza, who will certainly be promoted to  general, will be appointed National Police deputy chief. At any  rate, well-informed Government House and Senate sources have  confirmed this report. Therefore, new National Police Chief Luis  Rocha will be installed on 4 February.    But this is not an isolated report, at least not within the  police force. There are problems within the police force. On 1  February, we were told by well-informed sources that Minister of  Government German Quiroga asked for Police Commander Einar  Lopez's resignation. Einar Lopez has refused to resign and said  that when he assumed the post a few months ago, he thought it  was a long-term important post, that he was not an acting police  commander.    Everything seems to have resulted from a letter Gen. Einar  Lopez submitted to Government Minister German Quiroga, which  states there are unusual promotion procedures regarding the  background reviews of those proposed for promotion to general.    According to the Police Commander's Office, the following  police colonels have been proposed for promotion to police  general: Willy Arriaza, Walter Romero, German Pomier, and Jaime  Escobar.    According to information obtained by this television  station,  there is great disorder in the National Police force. [end  recording]</p>

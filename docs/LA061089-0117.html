			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIBSON SHOUTS, BUT DODGERS ARE NO MATCH FOR REDS' RIJO, 4-0  </P> <P> Batting .229 for the season and having hit .201 on the recent trip, the Dodgers  were heard from only verbally Friday night.  </P> <P> Kirk Gibson, reacting to a called strikeout in the first inning of his team's  home-stand opener against the Cincinnati Reds, was ejected by plate umpire Joe  West for disparaging remarks after returning to the dugout.  </P> <P> Otherwise, there were only sounds of silence again from the Dodgers' attack.  </P> <P> Jose Rijo, pitching the first complete-game shutout of his career, allowed only  five singles as the Reds won for the eighth time in their last 10 games, 4-0.  </P> <P> A solo home run by 39-year-old veteran Ken Griffey in the fourth, his third  homer of the season, and a three-run home run by reserve second baseman Lenny  Harris, the first homer of his career, in the sixth left Orel Hershiser with  his fifth loss in 12 decisions.  </P> <P> Pitching for the first time since he went seven innings in relief in the  22-inning marathon at Houston Saturday night/Sunday morning, Hershiser allowed  nine hits and four runs in six innings.  </P> <P> Rijo was better, but then he was pitching against the National League's weakest  offense.  </P> <P> A Dodger Stadium crowd of 46,912 saw the Reds' 24-year-old right-hander strike  out five and walk only one in improving his record to 6-2.  </P> <P> The first-place Reds have now won 11 of his 13 starts, and this one put them 10  games over .500 with a six-game lead over the Dodgers in the West.  </P> <P> Manager Pete Rose, his own future in doubt because of Commissioner Bart  Giamatti's investigation into his alleged gambling activities, is making no  predictions about his team's future.  </P> <P> "I can't see anyone running off with it," he said of the race in the West. "I'd  like for us to, but it's a tall order because we're talking about the strongest  and most well-balanced division in baseball.  </P> <P> "I mean, we could have lost tonight and dropped to third, and that's the way  it's going to be.  </P> <P> "Right now, we're on a pace to win 93 games. I'd rather win 98, but I'll take  the 93."  </P> <P> Of victory No. 34, Rose reflected on the ejection of Gibson and the early  departure of Hershiser and said, "We got rid of about $4 million in salaries in  six innings and that helped."  </P> <P> Gibson objected to both the called second and called third strikes and drew a  $100 fine from West when he flung his bat leaving the plate.  </P> <P> He wasn't ejected until he reached the dugout, when West claimed that Gibson  yelled an obscenity.  </P> <P> "It's my job to stay in the game," Gibson said. "It wasn't good that I got  ejected, I realize that. But in my judgement, what was said didn't merit  ejection. But then my judgement doesn't count, of course."  </P> <P> Manager Tom Lasorda suggested that West was looking to eject Gibson by  continuing to eye him as he walked into the dugout.  </P> <P> "The umpire followed him all the way," Lasorda said. "I thought the object was  to keep players in the game. The fans pay to see them. He deserved to be fined,  but to be thrown out..."  </P> <P> Lasorda didn't finish his thought, nor did Hershiser finish what he started,  his earned-run average rising from 2.38 to 2.61.  </P> <P> "I threw two bad fastballs," he said of the home run pitches. "Otherwise I  thought I pitched well."  </P> <P> The Reds left two runners on base in the first inning and three more in the  third. Griffey homered to open the fourth.  </P> <P> "Griff has been hitting good," Rose said. "Throw it down and in and he can  still hit it out anywhere."  </P> <P> There were two on and two out in the sixth when Harris connected on the first  pitch. Did he consider walking the No. 2 hitter with Rijo on deck?  </P> <P> "I was trying to throw a sinker away," Hershiser said. "I knew Rijo was behind  him, but I made a bad pitch mechanically, a human mistake."  </P> <P> Harris, batting .222, drilled it into the right field pavilion above the 370  foot sign.  </P> <P> "Lenny has strength," Rose said of his backup second baseman. "Throw it in his  wheelhouse and you can see what happens."  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Mike Marshall, placed on the 21-day disabled list during the Dodgers' recent  trip, said he is still having good days and bad days in a therapy process  designed to strengthen his stomach and back muscles, relieving the chronic  soreness in his lower back. "I really haven't been in form or able to help the  club since I hurt it again in the World Series," Marshall said, adding there is  no timetable for his return. . . . "I feel I had no alternative but to give an  honest shot at getting healthy," he said. "Taking three weeks now was worth the  investment. I'll still have 80 or 90 games left. I'll still be looking to make  an impact. I consider myself an impact player who can carry a club for three or  four weeks at a time, but the way I was swinging and playing, I just couldn't  do that. I mean, there comes a time when you lose your mechanics, you lose your  confidence and you're hurting the team. I didn't want to let it go until August  and still be mediocre." . . . Marshall went on the disabled list with four home  runs and 13 runs batted in.  </P> <P> John Tudor said a terse "OK" when asked how his arm felt in the wake of his  first rehabilitation appearance since his October elbow surgery. Tudor gave up  one hit and walked none in pitching five innings for Vero Beach against Winter  Haven of the Florida State League Wednesday night at Vero Beach. Pitching  instructor Sandy Koufax told Florida Today, "He threw as well as I've seen him  throw since he's been with us." Tudor is likely to make his next appearance at  Bakersfield, but no date has been set, Executive Vice President Fred Claire  said. . . . Ray Searage, on the 15-day disabled list for back spasms, played  catch for the first time Friday and said he would have a better idea about his  status when he sees how the back responds to the added activity. . . . Mickey  Hatcher, on the 15-day disabled list for a groin strain, said he has curtailed  his therapy since receiving a cortisone injection but was hopeful of coming off  the DL as soon as eligible.  </P></p>

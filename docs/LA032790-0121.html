			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> COMMITTEE TO REVIEW RV PARKING LAWS  </P> <P> The city has formed a task force to study whether parking ordinances for  recreational vehicles need to be revised.  </P> <P> About a month ago, hundreds of recreational-vehicle owners protested a proposed  ordinance restricting where such vehicles could park on private property.  </P> <P> The task force will study current city and state laws regulating where RVs and  utility vehicles can park and make recommendations on the storage and use of  the vehicles in residential areas.  </P> <P> The task force will be made up of five owners or users of the vehicles, five  non-owners, a City Council member, a planning commissioner, a member of the  city's Transportation and Circulation Commission and city advisory staff  members.  </P> <P> Recommendations drafted by the task force are expected to be forwarded to the  City Council in about seven months for possible action.  </P> <P> In February, the council considered prohibiting recreational vehicles from  being parked on almost all residential property in the city. City  code-enforcement officer Karen Atkinson said she had received nine complaints  about the vehicles in January and February and 56 complaints last year. Most  people calling said the vehicles were an eyesore, she said. TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Islamic Jihad says it bombed Israeli embassy ISLAMIC JIHAD, an underground Shia Moslem Lebanese group close to Iran, yesterday claimed responsibility for bombing the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires in which at least 20 people died and 240 were injured. Yesterday rescue workers continued to comb the wreckage for two Israeli embassy officials and up to eight other victims believed still buried under the rubble. The group said in Beirut Tuesday's attack was carried out by a suicide bomber, named Abu Yasser, an Argentine convert to Islam, in reprisal for the Israeli assassination last month of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, the Hizbollah leader. Islamic Jihad is an off-shoot of the Lebanese Hizbollah, loyal to Iranian hardliner Hojatolislam Ali Akbar Mohtashemi. The claim, resonant with terms used over the past nine years in other Islamic Jihad claims of responsibility for bombings and kidnappings, demonstrated for the first time the ability of the fundamentalist cell to strike far outside the Middle East. The Iranian embassy in Buenos Aires yesterday denied that Tehran played any part in Tuesday's attack. It issued a statement 'categorically' denying any type of relation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and that event.' It said Iran 'lamented' the bombing and expressed its 'condolences' to the government and people of Argentina. Mr Jose Luis Manzano, Argentina's interior min-ister, blamed the attack on 'extremists from abroad who received logistical support' from local groups. Argentina has Latin America's biggest Jewish community, numbering about 300,000-400,000, as well as a large Arab community, whose most prominent member is President Carlos Menem, the son of Syrian immigrants. Argentine officials confirmed that a car bomb loaded with 100kg of explosives was used to virtually demolish the embassy. The attack is likely to prompt swift Israeli retaliation against targets in Lebanon. Even before the Islamic Jihad claim, senior Israeli officials said they would inflict 'painful punishment' on those who carried out the attack and those who sent them. Officials said the bombing would not cause Israel to withdraw from the Middle East peace talks. Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, said a 'Damascus-Tehran axis' supported acts like the embassy bombing and the killing earlier this month in a car bomb explosion in Ankara of an Israeli embassy security officer. In Damascus, President Hafez al-Assad denied Syria had been involved in either this bombing or any such acts and said he did not know who was responsible for the explosion.</p>

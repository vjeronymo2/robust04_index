			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Tucek: "The Army Is Gradually Becoming </F> Obsolete"]    [Text] The Army has decided to withdraw 10 world-renowned  Russian MiG-29 fighter aircraft from its armory. It will,  however, keep the somewhat older MiG-21 aircraft, which it wants  to modernize at least a little. This merely confirms factually  that the military is becoming obsolete and that no decisive  change is on the horizon.    Few modern weapons can be purchased from the current  military  budget. We should not be surprised by this--after all, the  state has more pressing concerns at the moment than extensive  rearmament. Of course, the fact that the Army is withdrawing its  state-of-the-art MiG-29's is rather surprising. The reason  given, that it is too expensive to operate them, is also not the  most convincing. It is usually preferable for a modern army to  have just a couple of state-of-the-art aircraft than a dozen  obsolete ones. So, the old ground-attack aircraft, in which the  pilots will learn what it is like to be in the air and wait  until the Army can afford really modern ground-attack aircraft,  will remain in Czech skies.    The troops in the ground forces are also choosing the same  path. Instead of purchasing too expensive new tanks, it is  envisaged that the current T-72-type will be modernized. It  should be equipped with a better engine and transmission, a  night-sight system, better reconnaissance, and improved armor,  and it should be capable of using more effective munition.  However, it will certainly not become the state-of-the art.    The modernization of older weapons and their continued use  is  an acceptable stopgap until the state has more money left to  thoroughly improve the Army's ordnance. This, however, begs the  question more and more whether it would not be better for the  country's defense to concentrate on building up an army in which  the main strike force would be made up of a few but select and  well-armed professionals. Of the current Army, the  rapid-deployment forces would come closest to this. However,  there is also a hitch in forming them. For instance, the Army  cannot pay adequately or guarantee apartments for those  interested in serving.</p>

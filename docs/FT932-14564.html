			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Books: Deep in the soul of the American male - Fiction WOLF by Jim Harrison Flamingo Pounds 4.99, 225 pages A GOOD DAY TO DIE by Jim Harrison Flamingo Pounds 4.99, 176 pages FARMER by Jim Harrison Flamingo Pounds 4.99, 160 pages WARLOCK by Jim Harrison Flamingo Pounds 4.99, 262 pages IN A time where courageous publishing decisions are thin on the ground, Flamingo's publication for the first time in the UK of four early novels by the grossly undervalued Jim Harrison deserves a standing ovation. Harrison is among the most accomplished American novelists of his generation, a raucous yet urbane storyteller whose books provide a useful map to the personal and national midlife crises that grip his country. Wolf (1971), Harrison's first novel, tells the story of the frazzled and mercurial Swanson, a failed romantic of 33 years who returns to the wilds of his native Michigan after abortive attempts to find meaning in 1960s America. For five miserable, booze-free days, he fruitlessly tries to get a glimpse of the vanishing timberwolf before it becomes extinct. As he searches, he reflects on his own tenuous existence: drinking, wandering and engaging in a series of disastrous love affairs, all the while tortured by the notion that 'I don't want to live on earth but I want to live.' Though thin on plot, the book is full of humour and anger. Swanson is the sort of left-handed rebel whose excesses and screw-ups stand more as a condemnation of his diseased culture than any personal shortcoming. He is a man in the throes of a spiritual hangover, blinking awake after a decade-long binge, gasping for a glimpse of something primitive and pure to make the pain go away. This anger becomes increasingly focused in Harrison's second novel, A Good Day to Die (1973). Again, the hero is a dispossessed young man whose attempts at marriage and career have fizzled out. Lacking anything better to do, he teams up with a speed-addicted Vietnam vet and his redneck girlfriend in a crazed plot to blow up one of the many dams clotting America's west. 'It occurred to me I should question my motives but found that I had none,' the narrator confesses at one point. It is a taut, compelling story about people at war with themselves and their era, a howl of environmental outrage clothed in a fast-paced adventure story. Finely poised between farce and tragedy, it conveys the moral vacuity of Nixon's America with a rare fervour. A different, quieter sort of energy fuels Farmer (1976), the story of a 42-year-old schoolteacher who has reached a Frostian crossroads in his life and has to choose which path to take. Joseph has just lost his job and must decide whether to begin working his ancestral farm or flee it to live near the ocean he loves without ever having seen. To complicate matters, he is engaged in two love affairs - one with a flighty student, the other with his widowed childhood sweetheart. Harrison establishes these conflicts with a steady and subtle hand, evoking the sense of quiet dread that grips many men when they reach the middle point of their life. This crisis is examined more riotously in Warlock (1981), arguably Harrison's best book and undoubtedly his funniest. It tells the story of Johnny Lundgren, also 42, who loses his cushy job and sinks into morose self-absorption, jeopardising his marriage and waistline in the process. He snaps out of it when a local millionaire hires him to straighten out his Byzantine personal and financial affairs. Lundgren turns into a cod private eye, travelling from the wilds of Northern Michigan to the equally dangerous mansions of Palm Beach in a series of increasingly hilarious adventures. It is as wildly raunchy as Farmer is understated, a book of high farce and low humour. These four books, taken together, provide a fulsome portrait of the American male's soul every bit as incisive as Updike or Roth. Harrison is a writer whose ribald humour is balanced by a tight-lipped sensitivity, whose love of the rugged outdoors fails to mask the connoisseur of gourmet food and fine art. But, in the end, what makes Harrison such a pleasure to read is the sheer inventiveness and grace of his prose. As he states in Wolf, 'An obtuse paragraph is always toxic.' Well, in these remarkable books the writing remains as toxin-free as Harrison's beloved Upper Peninsula must have been when the wolves were more common than that troublesome creature, modern man.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Aznar Calls On People's Party for </F> Effort To Present New Proposals"]    [Text] Madrid -- People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar  yesterday called on his party's leaders for an effort to draw up  new proposals for the coming elections in the course of his  speech before the People's Party Executive Committee. The  People's Party leadership yesterday began to prepare its  strategy for the state of the nation debate, scheduled for two  weeks hence, after reviewing the political developments of the  past few days, especially the atmosphere of corruption, the  so-called democratic impetus talks, and the coming election  campaigns.    At its first meeting since Easter Week, the Executive  Committee heard a report from Mariano Rajoy on the European and  Andalusian elections, scheduled for June, before giving the  People's Party chairman the floor.  <H5>  Satisfaction </H5>   Jose Maria Aznar discussed with his party's leaders the  latest opinion polls published, expressing his satisfaction at  the favorable prospects for the People's Party. Despite this,  he called on the party for a greater effort, especially in its  capacity of presenting new proposals, warning that the election  campaigns, in which the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party]  will be bound to start to recover, will be beginning soon.    The People's Party leadership then discussed the atmosphere  of corruption existing in Spain, but without entering into  specific cases. Sources in the main opposition party expressed  with concern the idea that, despite the latest cases which have  appeared in the press, the government is taking no steps to  tackle the phenomenon.    Bearing in mind that corruption is persisting, some People's  Party leaders called for the resubmission of the package of  ethical regeneration measures which the People's Party group  brought before the house in the previous legislative term and  which was rejected by the PSOE. This option could be readopted  within the next few weeks.    The state of the talks on the so-called democratic impetus  was also examined. The People's Party says that it is prepared  to reach an agreement, but maintains its stance that  regeneration requires revitalizing the institutions; that is,  something more than simply changing personnel or merely sharing  out power among the parties. It also insists that the vacancies  -- from the ombudsman to the Spanish Radio and Television  Company board -- must be filled jointly, since all laws are  equal and all must be obeyed.    With respect to the Congress [of Deputies] standing orders,  the People's Party reaffirms its opposition to the PSOE's latest  proposal, deeming it "standpat."    Last, the National Executive Committee began to prepare the  People's Party's strategy for the coming state of the nation  debate. The first proposals were made, and Aznar outlined what  could be his speech at that parliamentary session. However, no  details have been made known, on the grounds that "it would not  be advisable to reveal strategies."</p>

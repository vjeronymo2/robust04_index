Litvinova, Scientific  Research Institute of Public Hygiene and Public Health  Management at the Ukrainian Public Health Ministry, Kiev; UDC  614.73:616/618(477)]    [Abstract] The morbidity patterns among more than 96  thousand Ukrainian residents exposed to radionuclide  contamination and relocated from the town of Pripyat and  Chernobyl and from over 90 rural settlements in Kiev and  Zhitomir oblasts after the Chernobyl nuclear power plant  accident are investigated. An analysis of the data from the  Ukrainian National Registry on 61,066 persons, including 44,724  adults and adolescents, is presented, and the relocated  population morbidity dynamics are summarized for 1987-1991. The  findings shows that the proportion of healthy vs. examined  patients reveals a steady declining trend: 56.68, 51.58, 44.09,  35.3, and 28.8%, respectively. It is noted that to date,  the  relocation program has not been fully implemented although the  doses received by the residents of Pripyat average 3-5 cSv,  reaching 12 cSv for some individuals, vs. 20-50 cSv for the  approximately 1,000 persons living within the 30-km zone. An  analysis indicates that due to the combined effect of radiation  exposure and stress, morbidity has increased annually from 265.0  thousand cases in 1986 to 1,037.8 thousand in 1991. The  morbidity structure changed too: in 1986, circulatory  (34.1%),  digestive (21%), skeletomuscular (9.6%),  respiratory (8.9%),  and nervous and sensory (7.9%) diseases were the leading  causes  of illness whereas in 1991, the nervous and sensory system  (18.4%), respiratory (17.6%), circulatory  (16.7%), digestive  (14.8%), and skeletomuscular and connective tissue  (9.17%)  diseases became the leading causes of illness. The findings  indicate an annual rise in morbidity for all classes of disease,  especially the endocrinic system and neoplasms and show that  morbidity among women is higher than that among men in all age  groups, especially for the endocrinic, nervous, and  hematopoietic systems.

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Asea Brown withdraws offer to sell unit ASEA BROWN Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, is taking its UK-based global instrumentation business off the market after a four-month search for buyers failed to produce a deal. ABB yesterday said that after having reviewed several offers it would keep the business, which has annual sales of nearly Dollars 450m, employs 4,500 people and produces water meters, instruments and control valves. The move is a temporary setback for ABB's strategy of concentrating on its core activities in electrical engineering. Zurich-based ABB had put the business up for sale in March, with Morgan Stanley International retained as financial adviser. ABB said then that a business that was more than 50 per cent related to water meters was not closely related to its core. ABB yesterday put a brave face on the decision to keep the business. 'It does not speed up our streamlining process, but it's not so very odd a business for ABB to keep, and it has no negative impact on ABB as a whole,' said the company. It added that other ABB businesses might come up for sale instead. The possible sale of the business produced several offers from a number of countries. However, in current market conditions it was not easy to sell businesses of such a size, ABB said. It indicated that price was one reason why a deal could not be reached, but not the only reason. 'The company has a good market potential, and a good standing in the water meter business, especially in the UK. It was not necessary to dump it, and we don't sell at the wrong price.' RWE, the diversified German energy group, has not yet made a final decision on a possible capital increase, Reuter reports. RWE, subject of intense rights issue speculation, said the final decision would be made in October.</p>

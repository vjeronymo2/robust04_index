The meeting begins Monday and ends Friday.    BOFT Deputy Director-General Lin Yi-fu is accompanying  Huang.    The meeting is the first ever of APEC senior officials, and  is also the first in a series of APEC meeting to be hosted by  Indonesia this year, Huang said at the airport. The other  meetings will be held in May, September and November. The  November meeting will probably be a ministerial or even  presidential meeting, Huang said.    Among the discussion topics at next week's meeting will be a  joint proposal by Taiwan and the United States that APEC develop  guidelines on small- and medium-business development  cooperation, Huang said.    The APEC Investment and Trade Committee, established at the  November APEC meeting in Seattle, will also convene for the  first time in Jakarta, he added.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Kodak furthers disposal plan with diagnostics sale Eastman Kodak, the US photographic products group, took a further step in its disposal programme yesterday selling its clinical diagnostics business to the US healthcare company Johnson &amp; Johnson for Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m). With the sale of its drugs businesses to Sanofi of France and SmithKline Beecham of the UK, the deal brings Kodak's total disposals since June to more than Dollars 5.6bn. The sale to Johnson &amp; Johnson includes Kodak's chemistry-based and immunoassay diagnostics products, which had sales last year of Dollars 535m. Kodak's retention of its X-ray film-based diagnostic business, in which it claims world leadership, is in line with the strategy announced in May by new chairman, Mr George Fisher, of concentrating on its traditional strengths. Johnson &amp; Johnson, which two weeks ago announced the Dollars 924m acquisition of the Neutrogena skin and hair care company, said the deal would make it the world's third biggest diagnostics company after Abbott Laboratories of the US and Boehringer Mannheim of Germany. Its existing sales of diagnostics are just over Dollars 700m. The Kodak business, which includes the diagnostics business of the UK company Amersham acquired in 1990, would continue to be run as a separate company, Johnson &amp; Johnson said. Mr Ralph Larsen, Johnson &amp; Johnson's chairman, said 'the acquisition will add important positions in clinical chemistry and immunodiagnostics to our existing diagnostics business and significantly broaden our customer base in the hospital central diagnostic laboratories'. The company said the deal would leapfrog it into third position worldwide ahead of Bayer of Germany. The sale nearly completes Kodak's ambitious disposal programme. The final business to be sold is L &amp; F Products, consisting of household goods, such as disinfectants, and DIY products such as wood finishers. Kodak announced last month it would sell the two parts of L &amp; F separately, having been unable to reach its target price - estimated at around Dollars 2bn - for the business as a whole. The latest deal also brings Kodak close to its target of eliminating debt. Group borrowings at the mid-year stood at Dollars 6.4bn, compared with the Dollars 5.6bn of disposals announced or concluded since then. Kodak spent Dollars 150m last month buying out its equal partnership in Qualex, the photofinishing company. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>BFN     [Summary] Peasants have so far reclaimed more than 300,000  hectares of land to grow floating rice. Peasants rely totally  on tractors to till these areas, which are located mostly in the  provinces around Tonle Sap Lake.    According to Mr. Liang Sam-hat, head of the agricultural  machine tool directorate, "by mid-June, only 85,000 hectares, or  35 percent of the plan, had been tilled. It is expected that by  the end of the season, that is, at the end of June, only about  50 percent of the total acreage will be tilled. This is a cause  of great concern for it might lead shortages in the food supply  for next year."    Due to insecurity, tractors could not carry out their  operations. "In some provinces where there are vast areas for  planting floating rice, such as Banteay Meanchey, the Khmer  Rouge have forced the tractor owners and landlords to pay them  taxes. This is why the tractor-operators in this province could  till only 45 percent of the planned 70,000 hectares. In  Battambang Province, only over 20,000 out of the planned 55,000  hectares were tilled so far. Kompong Thom Province could till  only 4,000 out of the 24,000 hectares."    Presently over 2,000 imported tractors, of which 90 percent  belong to the private sector while the remaining 10 percent were  imported through various international organizations, are  distributed to various state agricultural services. The farmers  like to use the much cheaper tractors made in the Soviet Union  and China, which are as good as those made in Great Britain and  the United States.    At the recent National Assembly meeting, Prince Krompreah  Norodom Ranariddh said that the Royal Government plans to build  a tractor factory with loans from foreign countries. Tractors  to be produced by this factory will be sold to farmers at the  cheapest price with an aim to promote rice production,  particularly in the floating-rice zone.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (7): 'Time to let the people know we're big' / Profile of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society For the first 20 years in the life of what is now Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, founded in 1850, the directors met monthly in a Cheltenham hotel, paying Pounds 6 a year for the room. Today, the directors meet in C&amp;G's chief office at Barnwood, near Gloucester, a 185,000 sq ft building completed in 1989 at a cost of Pounds 30m. In between times, the society has grown to be Britain's sixth biggest, with assets of Pounds 16.5bn. Mindful of its original prudent directors, it stresses that it is the most cost-efficient of the big UK banks and building societies. This year, it launched a television advertising campaign with the slogan 'We're run to make you richer.' Mr Roger Burden, operations director, says: 'We thought it was time to let people know C&amp;G was big. That is the theme of the campaign - name awareness. We were concerned that we didn't have the awareness that some other societies have.' C&amp;G likes to be different - this month it stopped selling mortgage endowment policies - and the campaign's slogan tries to reinforce this. 'Many of our accounts have quite high minimum balances if you want to invest in them,' says Mr Burden. 'We do tend to think of ourselves as being slightly upmarket as a building society. I think Gloucestershire helps us in that.' Within the county, no one can be unaware of C&amp;G. Mr Burden says: 'We know we're very strong in the county - on the investment side we have over 100,000 accounts. We have over 30,000 mortgages in the county. In terms of investors, we're probably in every other home on average, and in borrowing probably have 20 to 25 per cent of the market.' (Nationally, the society has more than 330,000 borrowers.) People in Gloucestershire, Mr Burden says, tend to borrow a lower proportion of their house-purchase cost than elsewhere, and mortgage arrears are lower. 'The county has not escaped this recession but it has been quite stable. It is a solid foundation for us.' To reinforce its position, C&amp;G concentrates sponsorship locally - especially on sport - rather than nationally. The society's half-year results to June 30 showed a 71 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 75.3m, after an improvement in provisions for bad debts. In 1992 the provisions were Pounds 217.8m. The half-year results were described by Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive, as 'a solid performance in a sombre market.' Mr Burden says the fact that house prices have now stabilised 'has done marvels for people's confidence. They say maybe the house is worth keeping.' C&amp;G was one of the first building societies to computerise, for which Mr Longhurst was responsible when he joined the society in 1967. 'Technology is a very important part of controlling our costs, but it is only one part,' says Mr Burden. 'We rely on good staff, on training, and we also have a simple and focused approach to our business. 'We've decided not to go for the high transaction banking type-customer, so we don't have cheque-books, we don't have cash dispensers - probably the only building society in the top 10 that doesn't. We don't try to be everything to everyone. We try to stick to the knitting and do what we do best.' The society has 235 branches, many fewer than Leeds Permanent, the fifth largest society, which has over 400. Although the relatively small number helps to contain costs, C&amp;G continues to increase the number. 'We think it is important to be quite large,' Mr Burden says. 'Size is important in the way we control our costs - you cannot control the costs if you start shrinking the business. We think it's a sign of strength to see the business growing.' Last month, C&amp;G merged with Heart of England, based in Warwick, the 25th largest society; in 1992 it took over Mid Sussex; and the year before, Portsmouth building society. Mr Burden says the mergers worked out the way the society had expected, with the exception of Portsmouth. 'With Portsmouth, we were disappointed with the quality of their mortgage book - it wasn't as good as we thought it was. That accounted for a large part of last year's loss provisions. But it will come good.' Today, C&amp;G employs 3,000 staff, of whom 900 are in the Barnwood headquarters, which was built on a greenfield site. C&amp;G moved to Barnwood after failing to reach terms with Cheltenham borough council on a council-owned site. 'We couldn't agree a sensible price. We got fed up in the end. We were growing the business - the whole idea of the new building was to be bigger - so we just ran out of time.' The Barnwood staff is now double the number that were at Cheltenham. And work has started on an extension capable of housing another 500.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Export hopes ease industrial gloom THE GLOOM in west German industry eased marginally in March, thanks to hopes of higher export orders, although both production and order books continue to shrink. That is the main conclusion of the monthly report on the German business mood published by the Munich-based Ifo institute. In contrast, the more optimistic mood of those manufacturers still in business in east Germany has worsened, with both the current business situation, and the outlook for the next six months, seen to be growing less favourable. The average level of order books in west German industry has dropped from 2.6 to 2.5 months' production since last December, while capacity utilisation has slipped from 80.5 to 78.5 per cent, the institute reports. Production plans for the coming three months in the west are being sharply reduced, but the expectation is for a continuing slowdown in price rises too. In primary product industries, such as chemicals, paper and cellulose manufacturers, the decline in pessimism was also reported, although not directly related to exports. Investment goods producers are more sanguine about export opportunities later in the year, although the overall mood remains extremely pessimistic. Orders remained at the same level as February. As for consumer durables, there was a stabilisation in orders for electrical goods, but a continuing decline in car orders, according to survey participants.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Cars study sees shift in market NEW car sales worldwide are forecast to grow by an average 2.4 per cent a year to the end of the decade, increasing to 40m in 2000 from 33.1m in 1992, according to a study by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Much of the growth will come from regions outside the main markets of west Europe, North America and Japan, which will expand only slowly and at times go into decline, says the report. Growth in new car demand will be particularly slow over the next few years in west Europe and Japan, which are both expected to suffer from shrinking sales in 1993. The EIU study forecasts that the highest growth rates will be achieved in China, with sales rising at nearly 22 per cent a year, in south-east Asia, where sales will virtually double by the end of the decade, in India and in South America. The study is pessimistic about the development of new car demand in east Europe, where sales are forecast to come under pressure from the erosion of people's savings and the continuing fall in incomes. New car demand in east Europe is forecast to continue declining until 1995, with Hungary and the Czech Republic proving the only exceptions. The report forecasts that Japanese carmakers will continue to increase their share of the world market, despite a comparatively poor performance in the US in 1992. Their share in the US is expected to grow to 32 per cent by 1996 and to 14 per cent in west Europe in the same period. The Japanese combined share of the two markets is forecast to have grown to 21.6 per cent in 1996 from 16.3 per cent a decade ago.

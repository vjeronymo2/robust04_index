			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Arts: The Country Wife - Theatre When the musical Lust opened at the Haymarket in London last month I thought it was great fun. Others scorned it because they thought it was a travesty of the Restoration Comedy on which it was based. Now, we have something very close to the original in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of The Country Wife at the Swan Theatre in Stratford. It is quite possible to like both. William Wycherley's play is not exactly a masterpiece. It lacks the style and situations of the best of Congreve and Sheridan. One of its best scenes  -the dictating of a letter to an errant wife - is pinched straight from Moliere. Under Max Stafford-Clark's direction, it is not hilariously funny. Yet it has enough good parts to make it a joy to watch. Stafford-Clark plays up the darker side, and who is to say he is wrong when the piece contains so many cruelties and deceptions? The foppish Mr Sparkish, played by Simon Dormandy, spits viciously on Alithea when he realises she is not going to marry him. Robin Soans's Pinchwife not only locks up his wife in her room, he inflicts physical torture by twisting her arm behind her back. To dwell on those aspects alone, however, would be to under-estimate the production. There are moments when both Sparkish and Pinchwife demand sympathy. Sparkish seems genuinely hurt at the end and there are times when one can understand Pinchwife's feelings of jealousy. He may be a hypocrite and a bully but that does not mean he is wholly insensitive. He can just about cry with sorrow as well as rage. The performances by Dormandy and Soans are first-rate. Comedy, of course, is there as well; it comes primarily from Debra Gillett, as Margery Pinchwife. Ms Gillett is a real country girl, just as she is intended to be. She speaks slowly and slightly liltingly. Quite often you can see a thought coming into her head before she can find words to express it. When she has an idea she sticks to it. As a country wife, she has no sense of inferiority but rather of opportunities opening up and it is an interesting reflection on the play that no-one laughs at her for being rustic. Even her primitive hair-style goes unremarked. By the second act, Ms Gillett is in full command of the show: she does, after all, play the title role. Where the production is on weaker ground is in the performances of most of the other women. This is not the fault of the actresses but must be a deliberate part of the direction. The Fidget ladies and Mrs Squeamish do not look like women whom anyone would want to seduce. Perhaps that is the point: it is the women who throw themselves at the men. But it would be fairer to allow them to be a bit little more attractive and distinctive. Towards the end, three of them speak almost in chorus like a parody of the witches in Macbeth. They also drink heavily. The brilliance of the musical Lust was to elevate Horner, the man who pretends to have lost his virility in order to gain more access to other men's wives. Horner is the star part. In The Country Wife he is merely one character among many. That may be strictly as it should be but it plays down a very good joke. Jeremy Northam, who plays Horner, must cast his eyes longingly on what is going on at the Haymarket. The same goes for Daniel York, as the quack doctor, which in Stratford is not quite the part that it could be. The most dashing man is Jonathan Phillips as Mr Harcourt, hardly the central character. Maybe he should switch to Horner. The production introduces a few songs of its own, which do not materially affect the play either way, though it's always good to hear the musicians up in the Swan balcony. In repertory at The Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon</p>

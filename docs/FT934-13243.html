			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Invergordon loses independence WHYTE &amp; MACKAY, the UK drinks subsidiary of American Brands, has won its two-year battle to gain control of Invergordon, the independent Scotch whisky producer. Invergordon's fate was sealed by the decision of Fleming Investment Management (FIM) - after two weeks of haggling - to sell its 13.5 per cent stake for 300p a share. Analysts had expected FIM to hold out for more, but SG Warburg, FIM's financial adviser, considered 300p 'a good price', according to Whyte &amp; Mackay. The deal, which values Invergordon at Pounds 382.4m, lifted Whyte &amp; Mackay's holding to 54.7 per cent from the 41.2 per cent amassed during its unsuccessful 1991 bid. The sale of the FIM stake triggered an unconditional final cash offer of 300p for the rest of the shares. Invergordon's board, which is advised by Robert Fleming, part of the same group as FIM, said it was seeking discussions on certain issues - believed to include the future of the company's management and employees. It urged shareholders to take no action, and said: 'This price fails to recognise the strategic value to Whyte &amp; Mackay of Invergordon's business.' Mr Chris Greig, Invergordon's managing director, said the loss of independence was 'a great disappointment'. 'I believe that Whyte &amp; Mackay should have put a formal offer to the board so that the interests of all our shareholders could be taken into account. 'But one has to face the reality of City situations. FIM was perfectly entitled to sell its shares.' Mr Greig, who led the group through a Pounds 93m management buy-out from Hawker Siddeley in 1988 to a Pounds 172m market flotation two years later, has a 3.3 per cent stake in the company, now worth about Pounds 12.6m. Other directors and employees hold a further 7.5 per cent of the equity. Mr Michael Lunn, Whyte &amp; Mackay's chairman and chief executive, said: 'I would like an early meeting with Invergordon to see how we can work together to develop the complementary nature of the two businesses. 'We have different skills which would create a strong combined force in the Scotch whisky industry. That is what our attempt to gain control of Invergordon has been about. It is not a cost-cutting exercise.' The combined companies would form the third largest Scotch producer. Invergordon would contribute its strength in own-label Scotch, a rapidly growing sector which is expected to account for 30 per cent of UK whisky sales this year, as well as brands such as Cluny and Glayva liqueur. These would be complemented by Whyte &amp; Mackay's Scotch whiskies, as well as Vladivar vodka, and its bourbon and rum brands. Lex, Page 20</p>

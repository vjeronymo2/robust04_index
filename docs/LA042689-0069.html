			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Palm Springs mayor, restaurateur, former pop star and ex-husband of Cher, Sonny  Bono has announced plans for what he said will immediately become the  pre-eminent film festival in the United States and will eventually rival  Cannes. The inaugural Palm Springs International Film Festival, tentatively  scheduled to take place over five days in January, will be city-operated but  privately funded, Bono said, with a format about equally split between glitz  and competition. Speaking to a group of local business leaders at Maxim's Hotel  in downtown Palm Springs, Bono said he has raised more than a quarter of the  first year's $800,000 budget. He said the theme of the first festival, which  will be a scaled-down model of the spectacles to come, will be comedy with  about 35 international films being shown, plus major studio premieres, gala  public events and a retrospective tribute to a major comedy star. Jennette  Paulson, the director of the Hawaii International Film Festival, will serve as  director of the Palm Springs festival as well. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

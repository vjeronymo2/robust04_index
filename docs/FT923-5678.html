			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Fairfax earnings beat forecast JOHN Fairfax Holdings, the Australian newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black, yesterday unveiled pre-tax profits for the year to June which exceeded forecasts in its pre-flotation prospectus. Profits before interest and tax increased by 9.8 per cent to ADollars 129.8m (USDollars 93.3m), on turnover up 2.8 per cent to ADollars 729.1m. In March the group said pre-tax profits would increase to ADollars 123m on turnover of ADollars 723m. Fairfax was also entitled to ADollars 650m in tax credits, up from ADollars 323m in the prospectus, which suggests the group is unlikely to pay income tax for at least five years. Sir Zelman Cowen, chairman, said the result was 'extremely good' in 'a very difficult economic environment' caused by Australia's slow recovery from recession. Second-half earnings before tax and interest were 11 per cent higher at ADollars 60.1m, on revenue of ADollars 357.4m, up 1.6 per cent on the prospectus forecast. Operating costs fell 0.4 per cent to ADollars 285.8m. Net profit was 29 per cent higher than expected at ADollars 15.5m, after net interest expenses of ADollars 33.1m and income tax of ADollars 11.5m. No dividend was declared.</p>

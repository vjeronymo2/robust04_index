			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] On 22 May, ROK vernacular newspapers  carry editorials and an article on the ongoing sausage dispute  between the ROK and the United States.    On page 3, HANGYORE SINMUN carries an 800-word editorial  entitled, "Customs Clearance of Deficient Sausages Cannot by Any  Means Be Allowed--Rather Than Dissolving the Trade Friction,  National Health Must Be Thought About First." The editorial  starts off by explaining how the ROK and the United States are  in discord because of the sausages. It criticizes the United  States for continuing to pressure the ROK to import deficient  sausages that are detrimental to people's health. Noting that  the United States may suspend the extension of the economic  cooperation dialogue between the two countries; apply the Super  301 Section; and present the sausage dispute issue to the GATT,  it stresses that the ROK must take resolute measures regarding  this issue. It continues to emphasize that the people must not  be allowed to eat such deficient sausages, urging that such a  situation must be appealed to international organizations and  the world's public opinion. The editorial concludes by saying  that the government must never forget the fact that the  settlement of the trade friction is important, but protecting  the national health is more important.    On page 7, HANGYORE SINMUN carries an 800-word article by  reporter An Chae-sung entitled, "The U.S. Trade Strategy as  Revealed in the Sausage Dispute." The article starts off by  saying that a U.S. Government document, obtained by HANGYORE  SINMUN regarding the ROK-U.S. sausage dispute, notes that the  U.S. State Department, the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative, the Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Embassy  in the ROK, and ROK sausage manufacturers importing sausages are  making all kinds of efforts to resolve the sausage issue. It  says that since no result has been achieved, the U.S. side is  actively examining the possibility of using the Super 301  Section as a weapon to resolve the sausage dispute. The article  continues to criticize the U.S. rationale on why it is  inevitable to apply the Super 301 Section if the sausage dispute  is not resolved. This editorial also says that the trade  dispute between the ROK and the United States is not only  limited to the sausage dispute but to the overall U.S.  agricultural products and foodstuffs.    On page 3, CHUNGANG ILBO carried a 700-word editorial  entitled, "Is the Super 301 Section Everything?" The editorial  begins to express concern by saying that the strong measures the  United States is planning to take against the ROK regarding the  sausage dispute not only establishes a bad precedent in the  ROK-U.S. trade, but it will also arouse the people's sentiment.  It notes the one-sided theory of a big power saying that it  will apply the Super 301 Section if the ROK does not abide by  the U.S. demand. The editorial continues to note that the  sausage dispute is an issue related to the safety of foodstuffs.  It concludes by saying that foodstuffs officials from the two  countries must exchange opinions on the safety of foodstuffs,  and not carry out trade retaliations.    On page 3, KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries an 800-word editorial  entitled, "Codfish Heads and the Super 301 Section." The  editorial starts off by expressing disappointment over the  government's decision to import U.S. codfish heads. Notes that  such a decision was made because of the U.S. retaliation threat  to apply the Super 301 Section if the codfish heads are not  imported. Citing that such a threat also exists on the ongoing  sausage dispute, the editorial urges the government to discuss  this matter with related ministries and take resolute measures.  The editorial concludes by saying that a resolution can be  achieved in the sausage dispute and the codfish import issue  only when a consistent trade strategy and tactic are established.</p>

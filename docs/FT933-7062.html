			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: Investments boost Hibernian to IPounds 8.9m HIBERNIAN Group, the Dublin-based insurance and financial services company, reported a 2.3 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profits from IPounds 8.65m to IPounds 8.85m (Pounds 8.23m). Increased underwriting losses of IPounds 8.46m (IPounds 6.35m) were more than offset by a rise in investment income to IPounds 17.3m, up from IPounds 14.7m. Mr Cecil Hayes, general manager finance, described the result as 'very satisfactory,' pointing out that in the 1990 and 1991 first halves underwriting losses were IPounds 13.5m and IPounds 11.1m respectively. Last year's first half had been exceptionally good with no weather-related claims, whereas the 1993 first half had suffered an increase in the number and cost of claims. The increase in investment income was attributed to strong cash flows and the high levels of interest in Ireland in the early part of the year before devaluation, and the rise in the equity and bond markets since. Life profits were IPounds 53,000 (IPounds 313,000), reflecting the development costs of an acquisition. General insurance premium income rose 8.7 per cent to IPounds 89.6m (IPounds 82.4m) and life premium income rose to IPounds 49.3m (IPounds 21.1m). Earnings per share increased to 11.3p (11p) and the interim dividend is raised to 2.3p (2.1p).</p>

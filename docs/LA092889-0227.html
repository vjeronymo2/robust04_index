			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> WIDER USE OKD FOR AIDS VIRUS DRUG  </P> <P> The government today announced a plan for expanded distribution of a drug that  appears to be effective in stopping replication of the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> The plan for wider distribution of dideoxyinosine, or ddI, marks the first time  the Food and Drug Administration has agreed to make such an experimental drug  so widely available so early in testing, the FDA said.  </P> <P> Under the plan, ddI will be available to about 2,600 people with AIDS or  AIDS-related complex in controlled clinical trials to test the effectiveness of  the drug against zidovudine, known as AZT.  </P> <P> The plan also will make ddI available to people with AIDS or advanced  AIDS-related complex who cannot take AZT, the only FDA-approved drug that  directly combats the AIDS virus, and those for whom the disease is progressing  despite AZT and who have no other treatment options.  </P> <P> Bristol-Meyers, which holds the license to manufacture ddI, has said it will  distribute the drug at no cost.  </P></p>

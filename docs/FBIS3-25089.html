			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Thousands of people have been trooping into  Buchanan, Grand Bassa County, over the last couple of days to  escape the fighting between the NPFL [National Patriotic Front  of Liberia] and an armed group calling itself the Liberian Peace  Council. Our reporter, Hassan Kia, who just returned from  Buchanan, said he saw hundreds of returnees and escapees  including women with their malnourished babies on their backs.  Our reporter said most of those who spoke to him looked weary  and hungry because of the many days of walking in the bushes to  get to Buchanan from [name indistinct] and its surrounding  villages. They told our reporter that for nights, they came  under heavy firing from the two warring sides.    Meanwhile, the Catholic Relief Service [CRS] has begun  distributing emergency food ration to both the returnees and the  escapees that are arriving in Buchanan and nearby towns. The  employee of CRS catering for the influx said since yesterday,  100 bags of rice, vegetable oil, and beans have been  distributed. Each family, he said, received 20 cups of rice for  new arrival ration, while efforts were being made to absorb them  into other areas for regular relief supplies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Deputy Defence Minister, Cl.-General  Grigoriy Kondratyev, has said he hopes that on Tuesday the  Federation Council will ratify the presidential decree on  conducting a peace-keeping operation in the Georgian-Abkhaz  conflict area.    According to him, if the upper chamber of Russia's  parliament  resolves this issue positively, military aircraft will start  lifting Russian peace-keepers to the conflict area on Wednesday.    There are plans to despatch 5 Russian battalions to the  conflict zone. The number of "blue helmets" is to total 25 to  30 hundred men.    This week General Kondratyev visited Abkhazia and inspected  the locality, where the disengagement of the conflicting sides  is to take place along the River Inguri. "The military have  already done all they could to ensure success for the proposed  peace-keeping operation," he told Interfax on Saturday.</p>

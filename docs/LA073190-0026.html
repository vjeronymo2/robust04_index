			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> WIND BECOMES A DIRTY WORD FOR HIGH DESERT HOMEOWNERS;  </P> <P> ANTELOPE VALLEY: DRY CONDITIONS, FEWER CROPS AND THE CLEARING OF LAND FOR  CONSTRUCTION HAVE KICKED UP CLOUDS OF DUST ALONG WITH RESIDENTS' IRE.  </P> <P> Carolyn Kott and many of her neighbors on the east side of Palmdale feel like  they're fighting a losing battle. The enemy is dirt, and they say they can't  seem to keep it out of their homes, off their cars or from muddying their  pools.  </P> <P> Ever since developers several months ago stripped the vegetation from several  large lots nearby, residents in the Antelope Valley neighborhood say they have  had to live with clouds of dirt blown by the high desert's winds. Housecleaning  has become virtually futile.  </P> <P> "I've just gotten so disgusted," said Kott, standing with her husband on their  dirt-covered back-yard patio. "It doesn't do any good. I'll clean this up, and  it will be like this again in a few days. You just can't seem to keep ahead of  it."  </P> <P> Although severe, the problems in Kott's Palmdale neighborhood are hardly  unique. Few places or people in the high desert this year have escaped being  blanketed by the onslaught of dirt and sand that residents say is the worst  they have seen in decades.  </P> <P> Blustery winds are nothing new to the high desert, but this year they have  combined with a record fourth year of drought, a decline in the amount of  acreage devoted to crops and the clearing of land for development to strip the  soil from the valley.  </P> <P> This past week, the South Coast Air Quality Management District conducted a  public hearing about the desert's dust problems and decided to extend for  another 18 months its monitoring of air quality in the area. AQMD officials  said, however, that the amount of dust in the Antelope Valley's air does not  exceed federal standards.  </P> <P> Several of the 40 valley residents who attended the meeting disagreed with that  sanguine assessment and said the experts' monitoring techniques have failed to  detect the seriousness of the problem.  </P> <P> In developed parts of the valley, where other structures or landscaping offer  some protection from the wind and dirt, residents still have been forced to  cover their pools and cars, and weatherproof their houses. Contact lens wearers  have suffered from irritated and watery eyes.  </P> <P> In areas exposed to the open desert or near construction sites, the problems  have been more severe, forcing people indoors and covering their houses,  furniture and floors with a layer of fine-grained dust and sand. For some, it  has caused health problems to worsen. And for almost everyone, it's meant a lot  of cleaning up.  </P> <P> "The dirt gets on the sidewalks and the entrance way, and all over the house,"  said George Greene, a retired Lancaster aerospace engineer who blames  developers for the severity of the dust problems and officials in Lancaster and  Palmdale for failing to respond.  </P> <P> The worst conditions have arisen near the rapidly growing area's many  construction sites, where the ground cover has been removed and loose dirt is  piled next to excavations. Residents say their complaints, however, aren't  bringing any action.  </P> <P> The Antelope Valley's two largest cities, Lancaster and Palmdale, have  ordinances requiring construction sites to be dampened with water to control  dirt and dust. But residents say the cities are slow to respond to complaints,  and watering is, at best, a temporary solution.  </P> <P> City officials say they and developers do what they can but admit it's  difficult. "Out here, trying to keep dust down in heavy winds is impossible.  It's a fact of life unless you stop all of the construction" or plant grass  everywhere, said Roy Stilson, a Palmdale public works inspector.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, some city and construction industry officials complain that another  cause of the sandstorms has been animals that destroy vegetation by overgrazing  vast areas of rangeland in the far west Antelope Valley. Occasionally powerful  westerly winds then sweep up the dirt and deposit it miles away on city  streets.  </P> <P> The drought also has been a major factor, leaving the region bone-dry and  choking off desert vegetation that might otherwise have kept the topsoil in  place. As a result, large sections of the valley have become virtual sand  dunes.  </P> <P> The same phenomena also have occurred this year in other Southern California  desert areas. Because of unusually strong winds and dry conditions, heaps of  blowing sand have closed roads and frustrated residents in the Riverside County  communities of Palm Desert, Cathedral City and Rancho Mirage.  </P> <P> Already this year in the Antelope Valley, at least half a dozen windstorms with  gusts up to 60 m.p.h. have raised towering clouds of sand and dirt and reduced  visibility in some places to near zero, causing dozens of traffic collisions.  </P> <P> The conditions have also alarmed officials at Palmdale's commercial airport and  the area's two military airports, Plant 42 in Palmdale and Edwards Air Force  Base to the north. Officials there fear the blowing dirt could interfere with  flight and testing activities.  </P> <P> Large sandstorms have swept over the entire valley sporadically this year. But  localized dust problems have occurred far more frequently near construction  sites where even average-strength winds can pick up dirt exposed by  excavations. Although smaller in scale, the dirt problems near construction  sites can be intense, with mini-sand dunes piling up almost over night on front  lawns.  </P> <P> Marie Wells said she knew nothing about such phenomena when she and her husband  moved from the South Bay to buy their first home in Lancaster about 1 1/2 years  ago. The young couple picked a house built across from a vacant lot and soon  discovered open spaces aren't always an amenity.  </P> <P> Dirt kicked up by a house builder on that property enveloped the neighborhood  and forced the family to spend thousands of dollars to seal windows, replace  carpeting and drapes and even repaint their new home's sandblasted exterior.  </P> <P> Last month, the Wellses and 10 other families were each awarded $1,850 in what  Lancaster officials said was the first criminal case in the region in which a  developer had been ordered to pay homeowners for damages caused by blowing  dirt.  </P> <P> Dana Harold Smith of the Costa Mesa-based Rialto Development Co. pleaded no  contest to one misdemeanor count under the city's ordinance and was ordered to  begin paying each of the families in $100-a-month installments. But Wells said  the families have yet to receive any of the money.  </P> <P> In Kott's neighborhood in Palmdale, meanwhile, some residents are talking about  gathering signatures on a petition spelling out their complaints that they  would then present to city officials.  </P> <P> Kott said the blowing dirt and sand have worsened her husband's emphysema.  Nearby resident Sylvia Williams said her family soon is going to have their  pool redone for the second time in two years because sand has damaged the  surface. Their plants seem to be suffering from the dirt as well.  </P> <P> And neighbor Mary Massarella, a 26-year resident of the area, said she's almost  given up on cleaning her house, which is downwind of several construction  sites. "It's gotten to the point where I'm tired of fighting it," she said. "I  don't even walk barefoot in the house anymore."  </P></p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (14): A new breed of communications - Multimedia / The convergence of media, communications and computer technologies promises to create a revolution in communications which will be as profound as the building of the railways in the last century THE telecommunications industry is likely to be the first to feel the full impact of multimedia - technology that combines communications with animated, high-resolution computer graphics and video, hi-fi sound, computer data and - most important of all - interaction between the system and the user. Now, a new breed of communications services, which have the power and capacity to carry video images alongside traditional audio, have made video-conferencing and desktop digital video possible. Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN), which can carry all forms of multimedia data, are now widely available, high-speed local area networks which can handle the large data volumes are becoming available and terminal equipment is falling in price. At the same time, telecommunications suppliers are adopting international standards which will make it feasible to introduce full multimedia communications in the next few years. These developments in the telecommunications infrastructure will open the door to many new exciting applications - particularly those that involve remote co-operative working. Current electronic mail and workgroup applications, for example, will receive a boost from full multimedia communications and allow people to work together in new ways. The market research group, Ovum, forecasts significant growth for multimedia communications in the next five years. From a base of zero in 1991, Ovum estimates that revenues from multimedia communications software in the US and Europe will be over Dollars 1.6bn by 1997. 'All the technology building blocks are in place - we just need to find a way to integrate them so they work together seamlessly,' says Mr Claude L'Eglise, video brand director at Intel. Mr L'Eglise believes that the desktop computer is most likely candidate as the primary platform for multimedia terminals. Although telecommunications suppliers - such as British Telecom in the UK - have introduced stand-alone videophone systems, it seems unlikely that people are going to want yet another TV screen on their desks. If they are to have video, they want it integrated into their desktop computer. Intel is working with a number of partners to take the next step and make it possible to deliver multimedia communications to the desktop. In addition to its work at the microprocessor level with the Indeo technology to speed up digital video processing, Intel is working with Microsoft to develop away to control telephone systems digitally. Intel is also working with Siemens Nixdorf and Ericsson to develop deliverable multimedia services across networks. But the cost of terminal equipment is key - 'the price of a multimedia-equipped PC must be low enough to attract the market and it must be easy to install and use. We are getting nearer to this everyday,' Mr L'Eglise explains. 'The PC and the Macintosh are powerful enough to act as terminal devices and the public networks are fast enough to carry the signals,' he says. Mr L'Eglise sees a big market for multimedia telecommunications - especially for remote and co-operative working - 'people want to exchange documents and work on them together. We see multimedia communications offering the ability to do this over a network,' he says. Some users may be closer to multimedia communications than they know. For example, users of the 2100 Premier telephone service, supplied by UK telecommunications company Mercury, only require minor hardware additions to plug their PCs into the network now. 'Most of our customers do not realise yet that they can use multimedia communications by plugging their PCs into our network through an IST 'FeaturePhone.' We hope to raise awareness of this service this year,' says Mr Robert Ralphs, application manager at Mercury. 'Terminal equipment is coming down to a price which people can afford and they already use electronic mail systems. It is not too much to expect that they will take the next step and move to multimedia,' explains Mr Ralphs. The first products to exploit the new communications infrastructure have already begun to emerge. Northern Telecom, for example, announced its 'Visit' system and demonstrated it at the Multimedia Show at London's Earls Court, earlier this year. Olivetti has been working for some time on digital video on the desktop at its research laboratories in Cambridge. The Pandora project - which brought multimedia communications to desktop workstations a couple of years ago - has produced what Olivetti calls the Personal Communication Computer (PCC). The PCC, which is based on a standard Windows PC, not only brings video communications to the desktop - it also enables two users to work on the same information over an ISDN link. Pilot systems are already being tested in the UK and in Italy. Olivetti has used similar technology to create a multimedia banking 'kiosk' which lets customers access their accounts and call up a human financial 'counsellor' who appears in a digital video window in the corner of the screen to give advice. Both the customer and the adviser can look at the same account data simultaneously. Pilot systems are installed at three branches of the San Paulo Institute, one of Italy's largest retail banks. Mr Mark Churchward, a divisional manager at Olivetti UK, sees these systems as only the beginning of what can be done with multimedia communications. 'We see multimedia as a technology - not a market. So we are coming with new ideas based on what our customers are telling us. 'Multimedia gives us different ways to tackle old problems,' he says. One key area of development is in remote diagnosis. Multimedia networks provide experts with the ability to examine problems in detail without being present at the site of the problem. This applies as much to, say, a medical problem where a surgeon can monitor an operation remotely, as it does to technical problem with an aircraft where an engineer diagnose a fault remotely. Mr Churchward notes, for example, that the paper documentation for a Boeing 747 jumbo jet weighs more than the aircraft. He says that Boeing is working on ways not only to record documentation electronically, but also to structure in such a way that data can be accessed remotely and used for diagnosing problems. Similarly, the 'Superjanet' network which links research institutions across the UK, provides multimedia communications for researchers and medical practitioners to work remotely. In both cases the need is for a rich level of communications which can only be provided by full multimedia technology. The convergence of media, communications and computer technologies promises to create a revolution in communications which will be as profound as the building of the railways in the last century. Businesses which recognise this early will be the leaders of the next century.</p>

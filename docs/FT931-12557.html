			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Moi suspends parliament after clashes PRESIDENT Daniel arap Moi yesterday suspended Kenya's first multi-party parliament in 26 years. The announcement, in a news flash on state-run radio, came after rowdy scenes inside and outside the House on Tuesday marred the new parliament's first sitting since flawed elections last month. Diplomats said the president, reported to be extremely upset by the anti-government demonstration, was showing the opposition he still has considerable executive power. Opposition politicians immediately condemned the move, which they said proved the president was incapable of making the adjustment from a one-party state to a multi-party parliamentary democracy and would continue to misuse his constitutional powers. Officials said Mr Moi alone would announce a date for the official opening of parliament; meanwhile, he wanted newly-elected members to return to their constituencies to listen to the needs of the electorate. A western diplomat said Mr Moi had been shaken by the protests, when anti-riot police on horseback dispersed pro-opposition crowds who stoned the cars of several ministers and blocked the road ahead of the president's motorcade. Inside the House, Mr Moi had his first taste of the cut-and-thrust of parliamentary democracy as opposition MPs heckled members of the ruling party Kanu and shouted down Mr Nicholas Biwott, the former cabinet minister and presidential confidant. 'Mr Moi wants time to consider how he is going to deal with what is clearly a difficult, new and unpleasant political situation for him,' the diplomat said. Last month's elections returned 88 opposition MPs. Kanu won 95 seats, with five still disputed. President Moi has powers to appoint a further 12 members.</p>

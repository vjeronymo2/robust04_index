			<p>CSO     [Text] On 10 June, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications  Higasa submitted and received approval of the 1994 edition of  the "Report on the Current Status of Telecommunications"  (Telecommunications White Paper). The white paper positions this  year as the "First Year for Multimedia" in which work on the  next-generation telecommunication network is undertaken in  earnest and predicts that the new age will stimulate the birth  of new industries and contribute to the improvement in working  conditions. It also provides the assessment that the multimedia  age will be effective in resolving the issues of the aging of  society and over-concentration of the population in the Tokyo  area. Further, the report indicates the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications [MPT] will provide support for such programs  by preparing a multimedia construction program and conducting  leading-edge research.    The MPT will publish the white paper in printed form as well  as in CD-ROM (compact disk, read-only memory) format. Release of  the white paper will be on a nonprofit basis and in the form of  loans to interested parties beginning in July.    The most recent version of the white paper is characterized  by the fact that all of Chapter 3 is devoted to the review of  multimedia. The paper introduces multimedia systems already in  use or being developed and refers to television broadcasting  enabling the selective reception of images and accompanying  audio data, use of interactive cable television (CATV) to  reserve tickets and on-line shopping and technological  experimentation using virtual reality techniques to engage in  four-party remote design of aircraft through computer terminals.    The paper identifies four issues which must be addressed in  the commercialization of these services: 1) nationwide  construction of an optical fiber network; 2) development and  standardization of data communication technology and formats; 3)  development of application software; and 4) revision of social  systems and customs such as intellectual property ownership  systems and protection of privacy. The MPT stresses  implementation of policies aimed at the realization of such  services.    It also summarizes the status of construction and usage of  data communication infrastructure and equipment as of 1992. It  mentions that contracts for cellular telephones increased by  18.8 percent over the prior year and conspicuous growth in use  of paging systems and household use of facsimile machines. The  paper also mentions that class-1 telecommunications operators  that operate independent communications facilities and offer  telecommunications services total 80 companies and have  experienced an increase in revenues of 4.7 percent, which was  better than other industries.</p>

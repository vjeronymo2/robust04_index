			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Judy Siegel] </F>   [Excerpt] Peace could promote the spread of AIDS here, as  open borders and casual sex with foreigners are liable to  increase the risk of infection, Health Minister Hayim Ramon said  yesterday. He was speaking to reporters in advance of World  AIDS Day, which will be observed tomorrow here and abroad.    Ramon said his ministry, which this year allocated NIS [new  Israeli shekels] 900,000 for AIDS information campaigns and an  additional NIS 4 million for testing of carriers and screening  the entire blood supply, will have to increase its publicity  programs when peace comes.    He was pleased to report that only 145 HIV carriers were  discovered during the first 10 months of the year; if this  relatively slow pace continues, there will be 174 newly  discovered HIV carriers in all of 1993, compared with 201 last  year. The decrease, however, could be attributed by fewer  individuals voluntarily going for testing. The ministry  estimates that there are one or two undiscovered carriers for  each known carrier, and some voluntary groups claim this figure  is too conservative.    A worrisome statistic that demands intensification of the  ministry's information campaign is that half of those infected  with HIV this year are between 15 and 24. The share of women  among the carriers is climbing; for every two men who are  infected, three women become carriers. By the year 2000, HIV  infection is expected to be nearly equal between the sexes.  Carriers can expect to live no more than five to 10 years after  initial infection by the virus.    Since women can infect their babies (in the womb or via the  birth canal), the number of infants with HIV is expected to  increase around the world. A total of 43 Israeli children have  been infected by their mothers; six of them developed AIDS  (three of them died) and the rest are carriers. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Policy differences over  tax reform and Japan's response to North Korea's suspected  nuclear development program threatened Thursday [21 April] to  split the ruling coalition again, coalition officials said.  Following the deepening rift among the coalition parties, the  House of Representatives Steering Committee agreed Thursday not  to convene a plenary session on Friday to pick a successor to  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation  on April 8.    Political sources said the inauguration of a new cabinet may  be carried over into next week.    All the coalition parties other than the Social Democratic  Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] spurned the SDP's demands to play  down the wording on tax reform and the North Korean nuclear  issue in a policy document for a new cabinet, the officials said.    At a meeting of secretaries general-level representatives of  coalition partners Thursday, the majority of parties led by  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] told the SDP, the largest party  in the eight-month alliance, that they will not accept SDP  demands. The SDP demands that the term "national consensus" be  inserted into the policy document as a prerequisite for a hike  in indirect taxes, while other parties call for inserting an  indication of their readiness to hike the consumption tax from  the current 3 percent.    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is Shinseito head and  regarded as the most probable successor to Hosokawa, told  reporters that a raise in the indirect tax is necessary.    Earlier in the day, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told  party  executives, "Please be aware that we may have to pull out of the  coalition."    The SDP earlier told its partners it would never drop its  demands for abolition of the consumption tax and security policy  coordination with China in the event of a military conflict on  the Korean peninsula over the nuclear inspection row.    At a news briefing following the afternoon bargaining  session, Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Secretary General  Takashi Yonezawa said the non-SDP parties "will have to accept  the possible withdrawal of the SDP from our coalition."    Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa also ruled out a  compromise with the SDP, but hinted at efforts to bring together  all forces ready to endorse the coalition's proposed policy  document.    Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, the main coalition  strategist, told Shinseito executives, "If we play our ace  (Foreign Minister Hata) while leaving our policies ambiguous, we  will definitely fall into confusion in two to three months."    "We are now at a turning point where we have to decide  whether to put up the hardest fight now or at that time," Ozawa  declared.    The standoff has revolved around two key policy fields.    The non-SDP camp called for inserting into the policy  document an indication of its readiness to hike the consumption  tax from the current 3 percent, while the SDP demanded that a  term of "public acceptance" be inserted as a prerequisite for  the hike.    The non-SDP camp rejected this condition, saying it would  make it virtually impossible to hike the rate and secure  revenues to fund increasing welfare outlays for the elderly.    The SDP also demanded the insertion of wording calling for  China's consent to any Japanese compliance with a possible U.N.  Security Council resolution on economic sanctions on North Korea.    Ozawa and Ichikawa told the coalition meeting that if China  vetoed the resolution and expressed dissatisfaction over  Japanese cooperation with U.S. forces, such wording could deter  Japan from taking defensive military action in the event of  fighting on the Korean peninsula.    Ozawa earlier urged coalition partners to recognize the need  for legislative preparations to empower the Japanese  Self-Defense Forces to provide logistical support if U.S.  warships conducted a naval blockade of North Korea.    In the face of rejection, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo  has asked for time to persuade other SDP leaders to rethink the  issue.    The secretaries general of the non-SDP camp agreed to  reconvene their meeting at 8 P.M. [1100 GMT] after letting Kubo  make another effort at reconciliation, coalition sources said.    Kubo and SDP executives were scheduled to meet at 6 P.M. to  decide whether to accept the stance of their coalition partners,  the sources said. If they can reconcile their differences, the  coalition allies will call a meeting of party heads to endorse  the policy tenets and select Hata as their candidate to succeed  outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.</p>

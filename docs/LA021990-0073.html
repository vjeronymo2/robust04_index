			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USD SWEEPS SINGLES CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> TENNIS: LED BY ACE JOSE LUIS NORIEGA, THE TOREROS WON ALL THREE SINGLES  MATCHES. DOUBLES FINALS TAKE PLACE TODAY.  </P> <P> The Frenchman crumbled, a former San Diegan tumbled and friends and teammates  rumbled. All in all, an interesting day at USD Sunday.  </P> <P> The final rounds of the 18th San Diego Intercollegiate Men's Tennis Tournament  began under threatening skies, but the weather cooperated long enough to  complete the 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 singles finals. Winning all the divisions were  the sweep-happy Toreros: sophomore Jose Luis Noriega (1-2), senior Dan Mattera  (3-4) and freshman Kevin Bradley (5-6).  </P> <P> Although players and coaches agreed that, overall, this tournament field was  not as strong as in previous years, there were some colorful matchups, starting  with Peru vs. Paris.  </P> <P> Lima's Noriega, the No. 2-ranked college player in the country, met UC Santa  Barbara's David Decret, the 200th-ranked player in the world in 1988. The  international set barely managed to produce a full set. Decret, a sophomore,  wore a bandage on his left thigh and moved gingerly through his 6-2 first-set  loss, then suddenly retired trailing, 3-1, in the second.  </P> <P> UC Santa Barbara Coach Don Lowry explained that Decret aggravated a muscle  Friday and tore it during his semifinal victory against USD's J.R. Edwards  Saturday.  </P> <P> "He probably should have retired earlier," Lowry said of Decret. "It kept  tightening up on him today. He couldn't put weight on it to set up his points."  </P> <P> Lowry said he feels Decret is capable of a top-10 collegiate ranking. One  reason he entered this event was the chance to play Noriega in hopes of a high  national ranking come Feb. 26, when the rankings are to be released.  </P> <P> "He (Decret) is very experienced," Lowry said. "But you shouldn't ever walk out  on the court against a player like Noriega without being 100%."  </P> <P> Last year, Noriega broke his ankle in the semifinals here and was out six  weeks.  </P> <P> "I was happy because of what happened last year," said Noriega, playing in  front of his family, which is here on a two-week vacation from Lima.  </P> <P> The day before Mattera met Chris Toomey in their 3-4 final, Mattera said that  the opponent less affected by playing a teammate would have the edge.  </P> <P> "Physically, we're pretty even," Mattera said. "It will come down to who can  concentrate better.. . . Playing a teammate is tough."  </P> <P> Sunday, Mattera was seven games (6-2, 6-3) better at it than Toomey.  </P> <P> Both prefer to stick to the baseline, and they went furiously about proving  that early on, slapping the ball back and forth until Toomey made some costly  mental errors from which he couldn't recover.  </P> <P> Las Vegas' Bradley, on the other hand, played like a proud gambler. He is  aggressive, powerful, and not afraid to take chances. USD Coach Ed Collins said  Bradley is the one player who gives Noriega absolute fits in challenge matches.  </P> <P> But Sunday he gave plenty of fits to UC Irvine's Bill Tontz, overpowering the  San Diegan, 6-0, 6-1, in 45 minutes.  </P> <P> The three doubles finals (1, 2 and 3) were suspended because of rain. Play will  resume today.  </P></p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Property: Trials and errors - Has the sector learnt from its mistakes, asks Vanessa Houlder At the mid-summer point four years ago, the cracks in the property industry were only just emerging. New developments were still being launched, rents were rising and, despite the tightening of interest rates, many optimists believed the economy would make a 'soft landing'. But when the Gulf crisis broke out in the first week of August - the week I began to write about property for the FT - the cracks began to widen. Deals went on ice, investors lost heart and the huge overhang of bank debt threatened to bury the industry. The years that followed were some of the most nerve-wracking seen in the industry. The downturn - the most damaging since the second world war - proved more severe than anyone had expected, crushing companies, ruining careers and costing banks and shareholders billions of pounds. The upturn, when it finally came last year, was frenetic. The fall-out from the crash went beyond the property companies and the banks which lent to them. Company balance sheets were also weakened, towns were blighted by empty, boarded-up property and the construction, architectural and surveying industries lost thousands of jobs. Even the Church of England cut stipends as a result of its investment managers' ill-fated forays into property development. It is no wonder the industry has a tarnished image. But its fundamental importance - of providing commerce and industry with adequate premises - has been obscured by its errors, chiefly the squandering of billions of pounds in unwanted developments. The rigidity of the UK lease structure has also blighted many businesses, particularly small companies which discovered they were liable for the unpaid rent of companies to which they had assigned their leases. The tradition of lengthy leases, with upwards-only rent reviews, means that landlords are often seen as passive rent collectors rather than companies servicing their customers' needs. The government is examining the possibility of reforming the structure of leases. As an industry that hinges on deal-making, the property market revolves around its leading personalities. As a result the blame for the instability and short-sightedness of the industry rests largely with the way its foremost figures operate. A steely ambition and self-belief that is the essential characteristic of most property entrepreneurs resulted in too many speculative buildings in the 1980s. Developers, blinded by an overweening belief in their projects, would see no obstacles: indeed the ability constantly to look beyond immediate hurdles and risks is an essential attribute of developers, who often spend years piecing together sites, winning over investors and overcoming planning problems. One of the inherent risks in the industry is the long lead times involved between the conception and completion of a building. As long as the government fails to smooth the cyclical nature of the economy, property developers will continue to be prone to the disrupting effect of economic booms and busts. The UK's planning regime is also widely seen as a contributory factor behind the industry's problems. The laisser-faire planning policies of the Thatcher years are widely blamed for the surplus of space - particularly in places such as the London docklands, where some 4m square feet of office space remain empty. Moreover, the lax planning regime generated a glut of out-of-town developments that have - the government now concedes - had a damaging effect on town centres. Banks, too, are culpable. Driven by deregulation, the globalisation of the banking industry and the loss of corporate customers to the commercial paper and bond markets, banks poured money into property with an insufficient understanding of the risks. Nor have mainstream property investors acquitted themselves with glory - with a few notable exceptions. While the UK institutions did well to shun property at the start of the downturn, they failed to appreciate the opportunities at the bottom of the market, leaving the best deals to some astute German investors. After property values began to increase on the back of rising bond values last year, UK institutions re-entered the market, fuelling a sharp increase in prices. Despite its recent uplift, the property market lacks much of its old ebullience. The absence of rental growth is a worry. Banks are still wary of lending to developers. Property dealers are keeping a close watch on bond markets, which could yet cause a nasty setback to parts of the market. While the unease in the market pales in comparison with the nervousness of 1990, the experience of the past four years has taught people that the sector can be unexpectedly volatile. But how long before they forget? This is Vanessa Houlder's last property column</p>

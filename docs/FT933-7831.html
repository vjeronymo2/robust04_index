			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Arts: Mark Morris; Love Song Waltzes - Alastair Macaulay explains why Morris is the most musical of choreographers / The Edinburgh Festival So what if Edinburgh's Playhouse Theatre had a fire that has stopped the Mark Morris Dance Group appearing there this year? The company has simply transferred to the Meadowbank Stadium. The stage is large, the audience shows a certain Dunkirk spirit in overcoming the auditorium's inconveniences, and the final ovation is warmly enthusiastic. (Seating is unreserved, so arrive 30 minutes early, and avoid the poor sightlines of rows 3-10 of the front stalls.) This is Morris's second Edinburgh Festival, and there are plans next year to show his greatest work of all, the Handel L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato, when the Empire Theatre reopens. There are several reasons why he is a perfect Festival artist, and the most important reason why he is perfect for a festival as musical as Brian McMaster's Edinburgh is that his dances are supported by some of our most world-class musicians. Morris is the most musical choreographer alive, and he is like Balanchine, the greatest of all choreographers, in that he puts on shows where, if you don't enjoy what you see, you can just close your eyes and listen to the music. For his two danced sets of Brahms love-song waltzes, the excellent company pianist Linda Dowdell is joined by Malcolm Martineau, and by a vocal quartet all the more interesting (and Mark-Morris-like) because made up of four dissimilar personalities: Amanda Roocroft's creamy, under-enouncing, warm soprano; Felicity Palmer's urgent, cutting mezzo; John Mark Ainsley's fastidiously elegant, youthful tenor; Thomas Allen's clouded, moving, experienced baritone. But watching helps you hear. Brahms's liebeslieder waltzer are so easy on the ear that it is easy to miss the pictures of love's mixed pains and joys they tell - but Morris's dances plunge you right back into the billows of sexual desire, confusion, tenderness, fulfilment. His vision is modern, barefoot, and bisexual; and, in the New Love Song Waltzes (Brahms's op. 65, chor. 1982), he deconstructs it to the extent of having no waltzes and and no duets. This is post-1960s love, and yet the dances are classical in that they link back the 'democratic' un-virtuosic dance style of the 1960s experimentalists, by way of Isadora Duncan's natural movement, through to the chain dances of the Greeks. New Love Song Waltzes is among the most loveable dances Morris has ever made, and the way it catches sexual love passing around a whole community makes it a classic. Love Song Waltzes (op. 52, chor. 1989) has less sex and less emotional abandon, but it is an even more lucid response to its music - and a remarkably serious portrait of a community dealing with love in our time. There are fleeting portraits of despair, consolation, ardour amid a group, but Morris's vision here is remarkably clear-eyed and controlled. By the time he made this set of love-song waltzes, Aids has cast its shadow over the world. Love Song Waltzes' is not about Aids, but it shows love and community under that shadow. Morris's gift for helping you hear music is most obvious, and wonderful, in his 1993 realisations of two string quartets by Henry Cowell, Mosaic and United. This is the kind of musical modernism that, though very eloquently expounded here by the Emperor Quartet, might well bother a large audience - but Morris's choreography draws you deep into its structures and its mysteries. London saw this work finely danced a few months ago by the White Oak group (including Baryshnikov); Morris's five dancers, however, are greater masters of phrasing and contrasting dynamics, and so they reveal their music in greater depth. The choreography of Mosaic and United is highly economical, composed (like the two Brahms sets, and so much of Morris's work) mainly of a few motifs. How in this case Morris chose motifs so different and so satisfying is his secret. The most memorable is a huge, slow arc that each dancer traces with one arm, in which the whole upper body opens and expands; and this is contrasted with a sharp lift of the heels while the dancers close their flexed arms before their faces. Either move is in the modernist, abstract spirit of the music; but the contrast is more musical yet, and helps to open up atmospheres in the score. This first Morris programme also has a world premiere, A Spell, set to four Shakespeare songs by the Jacobean composer John Wilson (sung, rather faintly, by Christopher Robson, with beautiful lute playing bu Tom Finucane). It is a daffy, camp joke in which Morris transcends camp and finally wipes the laughter off his audience's faces. He himself, dressed as Cupid (with wings), unites and blesses two lovers (Ruth Davidson and Guillermo Resto). It is deliberately ridiculous, and yet, even in his opening dance, Morris marvellously contrasts his own broad scale of motion with voluptuous delicacy of detail; he is the least embarrassed man you ever saw onstage. And the lovers' story moves through cartoon mime to become serious, and poignant. You watch Morris's dances, and finally - though everything about his work is accessible - you are encompassed by mystery. How does he makes his modern visions so musically satisfying? How does he make his men and women, with their different builds and colours and hairstyles, into an utterly harmonious view of the world? How does he catch an audience so frequently between laughter and seriousness, between bright and dark emotion? The mystery, and the pleasure, grows with every performance of his work I see. At the Meadowbank Stadium; Programme One until Thursday 19. Programme Two August 21-23</p>

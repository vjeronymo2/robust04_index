			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Bowthorpe declines 11% despite German growth BOWTHORPE Holdings, the electrical and electronic components maker, yesterday announced an 11 per cent fall in profits as the impact from recession outweighed a strong performance in Germany. Pre-tax profits in 1991 fell from Pounds 45.5m to Pounds 40.3m - below market expectations. Taking out discontinued businesses, the fall was 8 per cent. Mr John Westhead, chief executive, said any profit rise this year was likely to be modest. 'But we have maintained our margins and are building for recovery,' he said. Turnover fell 9 per cent to Pounds 220.5m. In the UK, where its main customers include the construction and motor industries, conditions were tough. The UK accounted for 20 per cent of total sales, down from 28 per cent last year. But sales in Germany remained buoyant, especially in the construction sector. Operating profits in mainland Europe increased from 37 per cent to 40 per cent of total profits. Operating profits in the US improved, despite the recession, partly due to strong sales to the medical sector from Thermometrics, which made a full year's contribution for the first time. Earnings fell to 14.04p (16.01p) per share. The company is recommending an increased final dividend of 4.34p (4.13p) for a total 5 per cent ahead to 6.04p (5.75p). There was a Pounds 180,000 currency loss and losses of about Pounds 1m on restructuring costs. In the UK there were 150 redundancies. COMMENT Bowthorpe's long practised strategy of developing niche markets internationally, and adding to growth through small acquisitions, is set for a little bit of a shake up. The company said it now intended to aim for bigger takeover targets, although the concentration on niche products would remain. This should not present a problem, since the company held net cash of Pounds 18.6m at the year end and has strong positive cash flow. Meanwhile, Bowthorpe's leading position in its key markets will underpin profits should the re-cession continue. Forecast profits for this year of Pounds 41m to Pounds 42m put the shares on 15 times earnings. But until the previous growth track is recovered, the shares are fully valued.</p>

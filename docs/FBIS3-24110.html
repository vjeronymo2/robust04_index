According to  the premier, this year became the most difficult period for the  national economy. Because of the permanent blockade, the volume  of used resources fell at least by a factor of four, and the  level of production of electric power also decreased. Last year  Armenia, contrary to its desire, did not end up in the ruble  zone, which also had an extremely negative effect on all aspects  of life. The continuing confrontation in Karabakh and  Azerbaijan's continuous efforts to draw Armenia into the  conflict also had a serious effect on the economy. In this  connection, the prime minister noted that today Baku is trying  in fact to initiate a so-called war of resources, and this is  compelling Armenia to devote increased attention to the  formation and reinforcement of defense structures and to take  the path of intensive building of the army, bringing its armed  forces to the level permitted by international agreements;  moreover, both in the sense of numbers and from the aspect of  material-technical equipping. "If we were spending as much on  defense today as at the beginning of 1992," declared the  premier, "the standard of living in the republic would grow by  75 percent immediately."    Despite these extremely unfavorable factors and regularly  arising circumstances of force majeure (explosions in gas  pipelines, and sabotage in various other infrastructures  connecting Armenia with the outside world), the republic was in  principle able to maintain the gross national product  practically at the former level. While having less resources in  1993 by a factor of four and producing less electric power by a  factor of three, Armenian enterprises were able to provide more  than 90 percent of the production of the 1992 level. In  addition, in Bagratyan's opinion, it is a positive fact that a  steady growth trend was observed in the course of the whole  year--production seemed to be adjusting itself more and more to  the conditions that were developing. This also became the reason  for a phenomenon that was rather unexpected for many: According  to the year's results, Armenia looks even better than the  average for the CIS. In the words of the premier, galloping  inflation was successfully reined in, and this slowed down  somewhat what started to be a rapid drop in the standard of  living of the people, as well as in the exchange rate of the  national currency. Bagratyan is convinced that it was necessary  from the very beginning to introduce not a fixed and firm rate  of exchange of the dram, but a "floating" dram, which would have  prevented the emergence of negative tendencies and would not  have permitted the development of a shadow economy. In the words  of the premier, it was precisely the correction of this error  recently that made it possible to noticeably stabilize the dram,  which today looks almost like a "super-hard currency,"  especially in comparison with the Georgian coupon or the  Azerbaijani manat. The premier also assessed as positive the  fact that Armenia had finally become a member of the  international community of developing countries. In addition, he  emphasized that in this regard it is not necessary to experience  any negative emotions and that there should be no psychological  bias against the term "developing states," since it was only  recently that Israel and Singapore, whose economic potential  needs no comment, were removed from the group of developing  states. The most important problems that the premier mentioned  as requiring resolution this year are the formation of the  budget, perfection of tax policy, and stiffening of control over  exports. As before, the situation is being influenced by the  so-called Georgian problem, specifically, the delivery of  commodities on the territory of the neighboring country. Just  today, 5,000 tonnes of butter and 25,000 tonnes of rice  belonging to Armenia were held up on the territory of Georgia.  The usual difficulties with the delivery of grain arose, and the  government is expending enormous forces and energy to ensure  that purchased and already paid for foodstuffs are finally  delivered to consumers. Moreover, Armenia today is forced to  apply enormous efforts to ensure Georgia regularly receives its  quota of gas. It is only this that makes it possible to hope  that something will also get to Yerevan. There is no doubt that  the war in Karabakh will continue to have a negative influence.  "It is hoped," noted Grant Bagratyan, "that the complete failure  of the winter campaign will be proof for Azerbaijan that it is  impossible to solve the Karabakh problem through force."  However, whatever is decided in Baku, whether to finally sit  down at the negotiating table or to continue the war  nevertheless, while at the same time counting on a war of  resources--we are prepared for both variants in the development  of events.    To the question of how the premier assesses the fact that  the  present government may soon break the record for remaining in  power, Bagratyan noted that there is still a full month before a  record is achieved, and that hasty statements should not be  made. The ministries were permitted to work for a relatively  long period, but it is not worth envying them, inasmuch as the  members of the government have exhausted themselves mentally and  physically. "If it were up to me, I would send all of them on a  vacation of about six months. The people have earned this,"  declared the premier. Responding to a question concerning the  prospects for a renewal of the work of the Armenian AES [nuclear  power station], Grant Bagratyan emphasized that the negotiations  conducted on this score in Moscow were quite beneficial. And  today the Armenian side does not see any obstacles now to  signing an agreement on converting the AES into a joint  Armenian-Russian enterprise. The signing of such an agreement  can be expected in the very near future. Moreover, Armenia hopes  that the decision being prepared by European structures  regarding the problem of nuclear power engineering in the CIS  countries will also be positive, and in such an event it will be  possible to hope for the extension of credits on the part of  West European states.</p>

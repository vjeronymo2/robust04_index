			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The following items on developments in  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were drawn from recent Serb  and Montenegrin periodicals.  <H5>  Banks Having Liquidity Problems </H5>   The 5 May issue of the Belgrade daily POLITIKA reported that  13 banks had negative balances in their "giro" (non-savings)  accounts during the first few days of May. That banks are having  problems with liquidity is nothing new, POLITIKA said, but up to  now "only" five to seven banks operated in the red on any given  day. Bankers are not concealing their lack of liquidity, the  paper observed, adding that the National Bank of Yugoslavia  [NBJ] had threatened to block Investbanka's giro account  completely because of Investbanka's shortage of dinars if it did  not sell the NBJ foreign currency. Investbanka settled its debt  with the central bank and continued to work undisturbed,  POLITIKA noted.    The daily reported liquidity problems of the following  banks:    -- At Beobanka, the largest Serbian bank, deposits decreased  by 20,000 dinars, and the bank did not have enough money on 4  May to conduct all of its transactions. A Beobanka official  explained to POLITIKA that the money shortage is most likely due  to the fact that salaries paid out by enterprises just before  the l May holiday "had not yet returned to the money channels."    -- Jugobanka also had problems with liquidity but covered  its  negative balance by selling foreign currency to the National  Bank.    -- The JIK bank had a negative balance for only one day. The  bank's spokesperson said that the bank had enough cash to make  all the payments to its customers but does not have enough money  in the giro account for all its credit activities.    -- "One of the most stable banks," the Vojvodjanska Bank,  had  a negative balance on 4 May. POLITIKA learned that this was due  to the bank's payment of pensions. This resulted in the bank's  halting the issuance of credits to businesses.    -- The vice governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia  maintained that the situation is not as bleak as it looks and  that, of the 13 banks which had a negative balance on 4 May,  three banks--Vojvodjanska, Panonska, and Novosadska--"accounted  for 95 percent of the shortage."  <H5>  Belgrade Construction Firm Operating in Russia </H5>   Miroslav Subotic, president of the Belgrade construction  company Komgrap, said in an interview in the 20 April Belgrade  daily VECERNJE NOVOSTI that his firm continues to work on  building sites in Russia, where 600 of its engineers,  technicians, and laborers are employed. He noted that one  advantage of a construction company is that it can work under  "someone else's name." Subotic revealed plans to sign such a  contract under "someone else's name" for an additional 1,000  Yugoslav workers, pointing out that the firm enjoys a  competitive advantage by already having construction sites and  equipment worth "tens of thousands of dollars" in Russia.    Subotic noted that as a result of the UN-imposed sanctions  on  Serbia and Montenegro more than $10 million due the firm for  projects it had completed in England, Austria, Libya, Angola,  and Russia have been frozen abroad. "We were able to recover  some of the money with the help of Centrokop, which was given  permission by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] to import  foodstuffs."  <H5>  Irregularities in Podgorica Aluminum Combine </H5>   A "Commission for Monitoring the Work Process," established  by the workers' council of the Podgorica Aluminum Combine, has  issued a report alleging "numerous irregularities" in one of the  largest collectives in Montenegro. The 20 May issue of the  Podgorica weekly MONITOR reported that the commission has  established that about 10,000 metric tons of aluminum worth over  $12 million are unaccounted for. The commission obtained this  figure, MONITOR said, by comparing the total annual production  of 38,000 tons claimed by the combine's management with data in  the combine's annual balance sheet. The commission also  determined that large quantitites of equipment and other  inventory are missing.    According to MONITOR "sources," the Aluminum Combine's  general director, Danilo Vuksanovic, is awaiting appointment to  another position, and "it is intended to conceal the entire  issue from the public." The commission has turned over its  findings to "relevant state authorities" for further  investigation, MONITOR stated, adding that the commission had  also found irregularities in the Podgorica firm's foreign  currency business transactions and in the declared value of  aluminum in the Zetatrans, Mosor, and Port of Bar warehouses.  Based on the firm's business operations report, the warehoused  aluminum is worth $1 per ton, while the world price of one ton  of aluminum is about $1,100, MONITOR reported.  <H5>  Polemic Between Patriarch Pavle, Bishop Artemije </H5>   The 21-22 May issue of the Belgrade daily BORBA reports that  a polemic largely unnoticed by the popular media has broken out  in the pages of SVETI LAZAR, the journal of the Raska-Prizren  eparchy, between the bishop of that region, Artemije, and  Patriarch Pavle. The polemic was started, said BORBA, by Bishop  Artemije's criticism of a sermon by Patriarch Pavle, in which  the patriarch reportedly declared that Serbs, Croats, and  Muslims had been suffering equally in Bosnia-Herzegovina and all  needed peace because "we are all God's children." Bishop  Artemije categorized the patriarch's position as "untenable from  the Orthodox point of view." In response, Patriarch Pavle  declared that he would "leave to people of goodwill and to  all-knowing and all-seeing God to judge whatever I do."    According to the BORBA account, Bishop Artemije, "who is  viewed as one of the most radical people in the Orthodox Church,  answered without hesitation" in the next issue of SVETI LAZAR  that similar statements could increasingly be heard from  religious figures whose only intent was to give the impression  of being "broadminded" and "democratic." In defense of his  position, Artemije cited an 11 February 1950 letter written by  Bishop Nikolaj Velimirovic "in response to similar positions  which existed after World War II." In that letter, Bishop  Nikolaj wrote that he often had to "correct my priests when they  said to the people--God is the father of all the people. This is  not so. God is the creator of all the people, but God is the  father only of those people who believe in the Son of God and  the concept of sonship.... This difference between Christians  and non-Christians should especially be emphasized in the  present era of vulgar propaganda that all religions are the  same...." It was in this context, Bishop Artemije concluded,  that Patriarch Pavle's statement that "we are all God's  children" was untenable from the Orthodox perspective.    Patriarch Pavle, answering Bishop Artemije in a subsequent  issue of SVETI LAZAR, cited passages from the Old and New  Testaments to support his view that all people are "sons of God  and brothers." Stating that it would be up to the people and God  to judge the reasons for his empathy with the suffering of the  peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina--"especially those who are the  most powerless and most innocent, not only among the Serbs, but  also among the Croats and Muslims"--he added that he was trying  to make his believers understand that in the end "God will judge  us by how we behaved and acted toward our weaker brothers."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine's debt to Western creditors and former  Soviet republics stands at $6 billion, Ukrainian Deputy Finance  Minister Boris Sobolev told INTERFAX-Ukraine.    He said that this sum includes credits received and already  used, as well as "the difference between Ukrainian exports to  these countries and imports from them." The debt to the CIS  countries slightly exceeds $4.3 billion, including $2.7 billion  to Russia, $693 million to Turkmenistan, $28 million to Moldova,  and $1.3 million to Kazakhstan.    The debt to Western countries mostly consists of the  commitments against the export credits extended to Ukraine by  the U.S., Germany, and the European Union.    Sobolev announced that the total amount of Western credits,  used by Ukraine stood at about $1 billion. In addition to this,  Kiev concluded agreements on $2.5 billion worth of loans.    Sobolev said that Ukraine was not delaying repayment of  debts  to Western creditors. He admitted, however, that Ukraine's  debts to the CIS countries, including Russia, were not being  paid back regularly. He said that the debt problem was closely  connected with that of dividing the former Soviet Union's assets  and liabilities which is still to be solved.    A foreign debt department is to be set up at the Ukrainian  Finance Ministry to monitor the servicing of the debts, he said.</p>

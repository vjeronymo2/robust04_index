			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Massimo d'Alema, deputy secretary of the </F> Italian Democratic Party of the Left, by Francesco Verderami in  Gallipoli; date not given: "d'Alema: Ciampi for  Reconstruction"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Verderami] What about all the  rumors on constituent or institutional governments? What about  the hypotheses concerning [Budget Minister] Spaventa, and the  murmurings about [the chairman of the Institute for Industrial  Reconstruction, IRI] Prodi?    [d'Alema] So much empty talk. Our job is not to study  farfetched formulas, but to give precise indications as to what  we are prepared to do if we win the elections.    [Verderami] Without first reaching an agreement with the  center?    [d'Alema] We must not announce an alliance with the center,  but rather, with the citizens. In fact, the center might be  irrelevant in the next parliament. The real problem is a  different one: The electoral campaign is beginning now, and the  opinion polls indicate an essentially balanced situation between  the progressives and the right, with the center losing votes.  Now, there is a considerable proportion of undecided voters.  We are now in the run-up. Within the next few days the balance  may turn in favor of one of the two alignments. So, although it  may be premature to think in terms of a coalition after the  elections, it is not premature, however, to think in terms of  the government. The government constitutes the fundamental  issue distinguishing the two alignments, and it is also the  issue on which the progressive alliance has an advantage.    [Verderami] Well, on the right there is [Forza Italia  leader]  Berlusconi running for the premiership....    [d'Alema] Berlusconi's electoral campaign is similar to  Craxi's in 1992. If, like Craxi, he does not win, his plans  will collapse, and after a while he will move abroad. In any  case, his leadership has been called into question by [League  Secretary] Bossi. This means that a right-wing victory might  open up the prospect of ungovernability. The progressives, on  the other hand, are showing greater cohesiveness. The more  guarantees we are capable of offering in terms of governability,  the greater our chances of prevailing.    [Verderami] Have you explained this to [Communist Renewal  Secretary] Bertinotti?    [d'Alema] Communist Renewal is excessively preoccupied with  the need to establish its own identity, and in doing so it has  not always made the right move. In fact, it would be well  advised not to force matters just for propaganda purposes.  However, I think Communist Renewal's case is receiving too much  attention. In the final analysis, it is only a limited radical  component within a much broader alignment. Communist Renewal is  welcome to adopt any platform that it wishes, but, of course, it  cannot possibly expect some of its proposals to be included in  the platform of a government supported by the progressives. If  Communist Renewal should propose taxing treasury bills and  leaving NATO, this would be a reason for not forming a  government together.    [Verderami] Do you draw a distinction between the  progressives and Communist Renewal?    [d'Alema] If the progressives win a majority, they will  guarantee a national reconstruction government for the country,  not a left-wing government: a government committed to economic  recovery and improving the employment situation; a government  which will make the welfare system more efficient and uphold the  principle of solidarity; a government which will propose a more  authoritative and, at the same time, a less invasive, meddling  type of state. I am speaking of the invasiveness of political  power...    [Verderami] ...and of judiciary power?    [d`Alema] Yes. I believe, for example, that the electoral  campaign must today consist of a political debate on the  country's problems rather than being conducted on the basis of  information leaked from the courts of justice... These are the  objectives of a national reconstruction government, within a  framework conditioned by the need to pursue a financial recovery  policy. This perspective could be expressed through a new  cabinet headed by Ciampi. I repeat: a new cabinet. When I  refer to the current prime minister I am not referring to the  current ministerial make-up.    [Verderami] Is Ciampi therefore the progressive's candidate  for the premiership?    [d'Alema] Let us be clear. I am not saying that Ciampi is  the head of the progressives. We do not have a presidential  system in Italy, and we have no need to nominate a head of state  in order to get people to vote for us.    [Verderami] However, Ciampi is saying that he would rather  see a member of parliament at Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's  office] in the near future.    [d'Alema] In my view, if at present the progressives are  prepared to support this sort of government -- leaving aside the  prerogatives of the head of state, and Ciampi's intentions --  this would be the wisest solution. This solution is necessary  by the current stage of events, but it is not a concession that  we owe anybody. In any case, the new government should mark a  change in relation to the past. I am thinking, for example, of  the Interior Ministry...    [Verderami] With d'Alema replacing [current Interior  Minister] Mancino?    [d'Alema] It is not one of d'Alema's prerogatives to name  ministers. However, it would not be with d'Alema in The  Viminale [Interior Ministry], if this is what you are suggesting.    [Verderami] What about the possibility of Spaventa heading a  progressive government?    [d'Alema] Spaventa is a statesman who, being young, can  still  make a contribution to the country for a long time to come.  However, I believe that, after 28 March, in order to get out of  the "bottleneck" and recover international credibility, we must  give signs of stability.    [Verderami] Do you believe that your allies will agree with  you?    [d'Alema] Actually, my intention is to address a proposal to  the progressive candidates: As from today, we should be  committed to having a consistent attitude after the elections,  we must work with a view to maintaining cooperation in  parliament beyond the electoral alliance. I am thinking in  terms of a single parliamentary group or, at least, a federative  pact. During this last stage of the electoral campaign, it  would be important for us to tell voters: We are together  today, we will be together tomorrow. This would be like  offering them an investment geared to the future.    [Verderami] Are you thinking in terms of a future Democratic  Party?    [d'Alema] I believe that by acting in this way we would  establish the foundations for a future progressive democratic  force, within a bipolar, European-type framework, which is what  Italy should be aiming at.    [Verderami] Do you think that everybody will agree on this  proposal?    [d'Alema] The single group will include forces prepared to  take part in such a project. Of course, there are those who are  aiming to preserve their own identity. However, what position  will those candidates adopt who are an expression of civil  society? And what will be the fate of Democratic Alliance, that  was set up precisely in order to promote this kind of  aggregation process? What will happen to the Socialist forces  that have decided to join the progressives? Should we not be  thinking in terms of common prospects? In the final analysis,  we are all part of a single European Socialist party, and I do  not think that the existence of two different reference points  in our country will make sense for much longer.</p>

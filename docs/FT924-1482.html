			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / 'Time is running out for refugees' TIME is running out for the people of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, warned yesterday. 'It will be an uphill battle for humanitarian organisations as winter sets in, the infrastructure deteriorates and hostilities continue,' she told foreign ministers attending a one-day meeting in Geneva on the Bosnian crisis. Mrs Ogata said new waves of refugees had been created in recent weeks by the fighting, and predicted more population movements in the coming weeks as the military situation worsened. Ethnic cleansing and terror tactics, including rape and sexual abuse of girls and women, were continuing despite greater international condemnation. Meanwhile, continued fighting, harassment and threats suffered by aid workers, looting and other obstacles continued to handicap the relief effort. UNHCR now had the capacity to meet the aid needs in Bosnia but was delivering only about 80 per cent of food needs and half the supplies for winter protection. The quantity of relief reaching Sarajevo and eastern Bosnia remained far below requirements, 'putting at serious risk some 800,000 persons'. A UNHCR official said yesterday continued fighting in Sarajevo had forced the agency to postpone resumption of the humanitarian airlift, suspended a fortnight ago, until the weekend. The governments involved have asked the UN protection force in Sarajevo to institute further security measures around the airport, including perimeter patrols, before they agree to further flights. The UNHCR is assisting some 1.7m people in Bosnia and almost 1.3m refugees and displaced people elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia. About 600,000 refugees have fled to other European countries. Just over a year ago the number of displaced was around 300,000. Mrs Ogata urged 'decisive political action,' but cautioned against military intervention. 'Any debate on enforcement action should take into account the security of our highly exposed and unarmed staff and the humanitarian implications for the victims of the conflict,' she said, adding her voice to those of Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international mediators for ex-Yugoslavia.</p>

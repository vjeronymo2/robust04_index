			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: PosGold bids for rest of Mt Leyshon POSEIDON Gold has made a takeover offer worth ADollars 187.95m (USDollars 144.5m) for the 55.5 per cent stake it does not already own in gold miner Mt Leyshon Gold Mines, Reuter reports. PosGold, 67 per cent owned by Normandy Poseidon, said it would offer nine PosGold shares, five PosGold options and ADollars 1.00 cash for every five shares held in Mt Leyshon, valuing Mt Leyshon at about ADollars 2.38 per share, based on PosGold's Monday price of ADollars 1.12 and 1994 options of 17 cents. The takeover follows a failed merger arrangement deal made by PosGold for Mt Leyshon, when it offered nine shares, ADollars 1.50 in cash and five 1994 options for every five Mt Leyshon shares.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 4/5/1994 -- Radu Campeanu has  been acknowledged as legitimate president of the National  Liberal Party (PNL) by virtue of a court sentence passed  yesterday, 3 May, by the Bucharest Municipal Court, which ruled  against a similar claim by the group led by Mircea  Ionescu-Quintus.    The conflict between the two factions of the PNL, generated  by the wish to reign supreme in the liberal movement, opposes  Radu Campeanu, liberal member in the 1940's, repatriated in 1990  after years of residence in France, who held the PNL  chairmanship over 1990-1993, and ran for the presidency of  Romania in 1990, to Mircea Ionescu-Quintus, lawyer and writer,  liberal minister of justice in Mr. Theodor Stolojan's cabinet,  1991-1992.    The conflict and tensions between these two factions and  between them and other liberal splinter groups have inflicted,  commentators observe, a negative image on Romania's main liberal  party, which the 1990 elections had earned an important number  of seats in the Parliament that functioned until the next  elections of 1992 when it failed to gain the minimal share of  votes for parliamentary representation. At that time, liberal  leaders blamed the failure on Radu Campeanu's strong ego, who on  the one hand decided to withdraw from the principal opposition  bloc known as the Democratic Convention of Romania (CDR) and on  the other blundered tragically proposing the former sovereign of  Romania, Mihai I, who abdicated in 1947, as candidate for  presidency, both moves meeting popular disagreement.    Starting from February 1994, PNL has had a bi-cephalous  leadership, one being Mircea Ionescu-Quintus, elected PNL  president in 1993, and the other Radu Campeanu, whom the  "Campeanu" grouping designated as president of the National  Liberal Party at an extraordinary congress. After this the  story started of what the press called "the fight for the  party's stamp" and the fight for the Bucharest central seat of  the party, until the sides turned to the law for a verdict.    The resolution made yesterday by the Bucharest Municipal  Court is practically the rejection of a contention lodged by the  Quintus wing against a previous resolution. Mr. Quintus's group  announced last evening that they would not abandon legal actions  until the situation of the PNL was clarified and intimated that  many PNL branches had extended them their support.</p>

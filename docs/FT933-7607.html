			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Putting the case for self-interest Sir, First we were told that tax cuts would benefit the poor through 'trickle-down'. Now it is 'improved incentives for entrepreneurs'. However, in his article 'The case for redistribution' (August 16) Michael Prowse unwittingly confirms the suspicions of those who think such arguments are simply a cloak for naked self-interest on the part of the journalists and other professionals who advocate them As an example of a wealth-creating entrepreneur, whose taxes must speedily be cut in order that he may be stimulated to create new jobs, Mr Prowse cites . . . a freelance journalist.

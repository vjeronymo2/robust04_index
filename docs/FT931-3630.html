			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Arts: Squirrels - Theatre David Mamet's short comedy at the King's Head in Islington is a gloriously superficial play on words and meanings, here magnificently performed by the cast of three. Whether it would stand up to acting and direction any less good must be open to doubt, for I am beginning to think that the best of modern American theatre depends on style and playing rather than writing and substance. John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation comes to mind. Squirrels is about writer's block, or at least that is the ostensible subject. It could be equally about anyone losing their grip on words, memory and associations and picking them up from other people, except that it is pitched at quite a high intellectual level. It is like Harold Pinter, with more wit and less menace, and played faster. The writer with the block is called Arthur. Was this a dig at Arthur Miller before his Indian summer? There must be some association here. Anyway, this Arthur is a short story writer. Played by Edward Petherbridge (no less), he is in search of a symbolic story involving squirrels (or perhaps just one) in New York's Central Park. The pursuit has been going on for some 15 years. 'The squirrel,' says Arthur's young assistant (Steven O'Shea), 'is a potentially non-representational animal.' The real question, however, is whether a squirrel has guts, and the question behind the question is whether Arthur can put guts into his story. They try it on the drawing board. They try the opening sentences over and over again, the assistant gaining an increasingly assertive role. There is also the influence of the cleaning woman (Sara Kestelman) who has writing aspirations of her own. In the end, squirrels get nowhere: Arthur turns to geese, but not without diversions along the way. There is a marvellous line about a lady walking in Central Park who has forgotten to feed her Doberman for three weeks. In the meantime, we have been through quite a lot of literary theory. 'What is a metaphysical restaurant?' 'Oh, it's just an idea really.' 'What does it mean?' 'To me, or in general?' And so it goes on, gently, lightly, amusingly. The cast is terrific. The key to Petherbridge's Arthur is not that he has given way to drugs, cosmic boredom or anything like that: he has genuine writer's block. The blank sheet of foolscap can begin to fill him with fright. As his assistant, O'Shea has no special hang-ups either. He is a literature graduate who just wants to write: at the start he even wears his college tie, (Arthur being in a base ball cap). Ms Kestelman does a lot of her playing by looks: sometimes quizzical, sometimes inviting, always captivating, permanently sure of herself. This is not the kind of part that would come from a British writer. She appears utterly classless, and no one comments. Mamet's new play Oreanna, about academic sexual harassment, will be presented at the Royal Court in June directed by Harold Pinter. The mouth waters. King's Head Islington, London for six weeks.

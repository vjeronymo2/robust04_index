			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Shake-up urged for cathedrals The Church of England's cathedrals should be more professional in attracting visitors and selling themselves, the Archbishops' Commission of Cathedrals said yesterday. The commission said better financial planning and management was crucial to the running of the 42 cathedrals, which were failing to make best use of resources. It urged the abolition of the freehold for future cathedral clergy posts, ending the 'job-for-life' policy. But it warned against 'slavish adoption of business techniques' and said decisions on entry charges must be left to individual cathedrals. The commission, chaired by Lady Howe, recommended wide-ranging reform of cathedral government in order to help achieve greater openness and accountability. The report, Heritage and Renewal, rejected suggestions that cathedrals were in crisis. It endorsed their role as 'the seat of the bishop and a centre of worship and mission'. The compilers of the document admitted that long-standing organisational arrangements failed to meet contemporary needs - and suggested a simple framework for future governance. Under the proposals each cathedral would be governed by a council with members drawn from people with different interests in the institution. The diocesan bishop would chair the council and an outside administrator would head a four-person administrative team which would include lay people. The study also called for better training for cathedral clergy, lay staff and volunteers - and urged the creation of a commission to offer advice on best practice. Lady Howe said yesterday the commission had found that cathedrals were 'in good heart, but in need of significant change'. The review, the first of its kind for 70 years, 'did not propose a break or discontinuity with the past, but rather organic change and development'. The Church of England's cathedrals were among the 'spiritual and architectural glories' of the nation, she added. But while worship and music were 'generally superb', the picture was 'less satisfactory' elsewhere and the governance of cathedrals was 'complex and confusing'. Lady Howe said: 'Overall, the finances of cathedrals, while not in jeopardy, are less than comfortable. There is scope, too, for improved financial planning and management. There is also considerable variation between cathedrals in the performance of their trading and visitor activities.' The commission wanted to see a cut in legal red tape and clearer, more precise management arrangements.</p>

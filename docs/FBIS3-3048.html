It has successfully achieved  saturated oscillation [bao he zhen dang 7394 0735 2182 5616] and  passed a technological appraisal conducted by academics Wang  Ganchang, Wang Daheng, and Chen Nengkuan today in Beijing.    The free electronic laser device is a sophisticated  technology developed in recent decades in the world's  high-technology field. It is acclaimed by scientists as a "new  gold mine" in the scientific and technological circles and is a  strategic research topic for the next century. It can produce  coherent electromagnetic radiation from infrared to the X  spectral regions, can continuously readjust and change  wavelengths, and possesses a huge crest value and an extremely  large power potential. It will have very broad prospects for  application in such areas as condensed state physics, material  sciences [cai liao ke xue 2624 2436 4430 1331], photochemistry,  bioengineering, military science, controlled thermonuclear  fusion, and telecommunications and is particularly attractive in  forming the X-ray holographs [guan xi cheng xiang 0356 1873 2052  0288] of large biological molecules.    At present, the most widely used of free electronic laser  devices in the high-technology field is the infrared free  electronic laser device and this is exactly what the High-Energy  Physics Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  has successfully developed. Of the 10 similar devices being  developed in Asia, it was the first to actually lase (on 26 May  1993) and it achieved saturated oscillation the other day, thus  enabling China to achieve infrared free electronic laser after  the United States and Western Europe.    Beijing's free electronic laser device project was first  established and initiated in March 1986 and is one of the first  research topics in the State 863 high-technology field. The  project was successfully developed by 50 scientific research  personnel headed by Xie Jialin, academic and research fellow of  the High- Energy Physics Research Institute of the Chinese  Academy of Sciences, after eight years of arduos efforts. The  appraisal members unanimously held that Beijing's free  electronic laser device has successfully achieved saturation and  oscillation and confirmed, once again, that China is one of the  leaders in this high-tech field.    It has been learned that the State 863 laser field has  decided to set up key laboratories for free electronic laser  devices with Beijing's free electronic laser device as the  mainstay, offering a good foundation for China to develop in  that field.</p>

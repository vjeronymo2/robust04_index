			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Goldsmiths back in black with Pounds 48,000 Goldsmiths Group, the specialist jewellery and watch retailer, returned to profit over the 12 months to February 27 with a modest Pounds 48,000 pre-tax. The outcome compared with losses last time of Pounds 1.29m. Profits at the trading level, however, expanded 92 per cent to Pounds 1.91m (Pounds 992,000). Interest charges were slightly reduced at Pounds 1.86m (Pounds 1.97m). Gearing was maintained at 108 per cent. The group has capped Pounds 12m of its debt at 6.5 per cent for two years. 'This will allow us to concentrate on maximising trading profit' said Mr Jurek Piasecki, chairman. Turnover edged up 6 per cent to Pounds 42.9m helped by a stable market over Christmas; the year saw eight branches closed and seven new outlets, including two relocations, opened. Mr Piasecki said there had been a 'distinct improvement' in sales since late last year. Sales in March and April were up 10 per cent overall and 8 per cent on a comparable basis. A proposed single dividend of 0.3p is uncovered by earnings per share of 0.12p (losses of 6.09p). Last year's distribution totalled 1.8p, including a final of 0.3p.</p>

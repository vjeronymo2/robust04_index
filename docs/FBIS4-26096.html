			<p>BFN     [Text] Haikou, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- China's courts have  brought their judicial role into full play and scored notable  achievements in conducting foreign affairs and promoting  judicial exchanges with foreign countries.    According to information released by the national conference  on the foreign affairs of courts now being held in Haikou, from  1983 to 1993, the supreme court sent a total of 125 delegations  (groups) of 429 people abroad for visits; received 113 foreign  delegations of 554 members; established ties with courts in  nearly 100 countries and regions; and conducted exchanges with  the International Court and other international organizations.  Beijing's successful hosting of the 14th World Law Congress in  1990 gave a strong impetus to promoting China's judicial  exchanges with foreign countries and won the international  community's understanding and support.    In a written speech to the conference, Ren Jianxin, member  of  the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and president of the  Supreme People's Court, emphasized: Courts' foreign affairs are  an important component of the government's overall diplomacy.  People's courts should learn from the useful experiences of  other countries' courts in continuing to improve and perfect a  socialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics so as to  better fulfill the judicial tasks laid on them by the  constitution and to better serve the socialist modernization  drive. Courts' foreign affairs work should play a more active  role and make greater contributions in this area.</p>

The government's personnel department stated that from  January 17 to 20 Illarionov did not report to work and that he  refused to give any explanations. It turned out that during  that time he was giving lectures in Britain without informing  the government about this.    Illarionov's statement that he resigned because he did not  support the government's policies was an attempt to conceal the  real cause of his dismissal, said the government's spokesman.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Passages contained within quotation marks are recorded from </F> the "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] Announcer: Yelena Bonner today demanded  that Vil Mirzoyanov, the chemical expert, should have an open  trial. Bonner's view is that the legal proceedings violate the  legal rules, which means that human rights continue to be a  hollow concept in Russia.    The problem raised by Mirzoyanov is becoming public  knowledge  and more details are now emerging. Aleksey Kondulukov reports:    Kondulukov: The chemical scandal in Russia is  assuming ever broader dimensions. Vil Mirzoyanov, the chemical  expert who disclosed to the public that new types of chemical  weapons are under development and undergoing testing is already  under lock and key in the Matrosskaya Tishina prison. The  Moscow City Court has already held its first session devoted to  this case. There have already been first appeals and first  public petitions to the president.    Now yet another letter to Yeltsin has emerged, this time  from  Uglev, another chemical expert who is also threatened with  arrest. Uglev says that Russia is not currently equipped to  destroy the stockpiles of chemical weapons in our country, and  this is the reason why these weapons are being destroyed by the  most primitive of means, without any regard to observing  ecological norms. Uglev says that chemical weapons are being  destroyed at the Shikhany range in Saratov Oblast as though they  are ordinary ammunition.    Uglev: "In individual cases it is poured directly  into the ground. That is all, that is what it is all about. Or  they explode shells filled with... [pauses] with chemical  substances."    Announcer: The soil, the subsoil and the  atmosphere are becoming contaminated. The incidence of cancer  among the population living nearby has increased. Uglev's view  is that this is a direct consequence of ecological  infringements, and he should know, because he himself  participated in the development of chemical weapons, and his  knowledge of their disabling factors is second to none.    In his letter to the president, Uglev stated that if the  country's leadership fails to focus attention on these problems,  he will, on 4 February, make public the formula of a new type of  chemical weapon. The ultimatum was effective, and Uglev  recently met with Baturin, the president's national security  aide. Uglev says that the authorities have at long last become  interested in this subject matter.    Uglev: "It seems there will be no sensation on 4  February, because there is a definite accord with the  presidential aide and, when all is said and done, I think that  the main aim has been reached. I am satisfied, to a  considerable extent, although the Mirzoyanov case has so far  remained deadlocked, generally speaking.    I said to Mr. Baturin literally what follows: If the  president issued orders to fire on the White House, there is no  need to fire on the Moscow City Court -- it is sufficient, as it  were, to articulate your point of view to the judges."    Announcer: Whatever happens, the court's next  session in the Mirzoyanov's case is tomorrow, and tomorrow we  will know for sure how events have unfolded.

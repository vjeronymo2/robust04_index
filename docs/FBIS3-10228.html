The successful bidding company will also have to  invest $1 billion, within a five-year period, to install more  than 1 million telephone lines in our country.    [Begin unidentified official recording, in progress]  ...whose  bid totals $2,002,179,198. [end recording]    In what represents an amazing world record for  telecommunications privatization, the Telephone Company of Peru  [Telefonica del Peru] consortium, headed by the Telephone  Company of Spain [Telefonica de Espana], bid $2,002,179,198 for  35 percent of CPT shares and 35 percent of Entelperu shares,  thus quadrupling the base price, estimated at $535 million.    The bid greatly surpassed the two bids presented by other  two  consortia: Peruvian Telecommunications Company  [Telecomunicaciones del Peru], headed by the U.S. company GTE,  which offered to pay $803 million; and Peruvian  Telecommunications Holding Limited, which offered to pay  $857,142,857.    [Begin recording] [Telephone Company of Spain representative  Jorge Santillana] The first variable that we have introduced is  to bet on Peru as a country with a telecommunications  development potential that is part of Peru's economic  development. This was one of the basic variables. According to  these basic variables, we belong to an international group that  nowadays has established itself in Venezuela, Argentina, Chile,  Puerto Rico, and Colombia.    For us, our investment in Peru, to a certain extent,  complements a market that we have. We have bet on the  development potential.    [CPT President Antonio Paucar] We never dreamed of such a  quantity of money entering. I believe Peru never dreamed...  [pauses] Never before in Peruvian history has such a quantity of  money been received for investment in private companies.    [Unidentified reporter] When will the successful bidding  company be finally paying the quantity...?    [Paucar, interrupting] It should be paying in about 30 days.  [end recording]    During the five-year period during which it will hold a  monopoly on the (?Sifa) telephone system and the long distance  service, the Spanish consortium, along with the Peruvian  companies Brewery Backus and Johnston, Inc., Wiese Bank, and  Granda y Montero, will install 1 million telephone lines,  involving an investment of $1.5 billion [as heard].    [Begin Santillana recording] We will fulfill our promise.  We will meet the terms established in the bidding conditions.  [end recording]    CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] President Jaime  Yoshiyama, who attended the ceremony, emphasized the  transaction's amount.    [Begin Yoshiyama recording] In addition to this amount, the  $2 billion that the company will pay, $1 billion will be  invested to install the new telephones. This represents about  $3 billion that are entering Peru. I believe this represents a  success for which the public must be grateful to the  Privatizations Committee. [end recording]    For his part, after expressing his total satisfaction over  the success of the Telecommunications Company's auction,  President Alberto Fujimori pointed out that, with this amount,  the (?balance) will be guaranteed. He said about $1.4 billion  from CPT's and Entelperu's sale will be allocated for the  enhancement of social programs.    [Begin Fujimori recording] This is good news because it is  not merely a circumstantial investment, a so-called speculative  capital. It actually is a long-term investment, based on our  country's established legal stability for foreign investors.    Now then, in a nutshell, in order to... [pauses] [words  indistinct]. This represents a very clear sign that the  privatization process, our economy's modernization, is working.  Therefore, their telephone company will arrive in Peru. It is  clearly specified on the contract: 1,453 towns that did not have  telephone lines will have one in the period established by the  contract.    In this regard, I am satisfied with the fact that this  privatization has been such an overwhelming success. In fact,  this will guarantee our balance. Of this amount, $610 million  will be invested in the purchase of new [word indistinct] for  (?microwaves) and the total purchase amount, namely $1.391  billion [as heard], will go directly to the treasury. This  obviously will allow us to enhance all our social programs.  [end recording]</p>

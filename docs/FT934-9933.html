			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (7): Santa Claus image slips - Portugal and the EC THE PORTUGUESE love the EC logos on their new car number plates, and one of Lisbon's newest office blocks is named after Jean Monnet in recognition of the European ideal. Beyond the symbols, however, a sense of uncertainty about the realities of Europe is disturbing a country that has spent most of its history struggling with an inferiority complex. From his office in the Monnet building, the EC's representative in Lisbon, Mr Francisco Sarsfield Cabral, is disarmingly frank about the collective mood. Mr Sarsfield Cabral who is a former adviser to the prime minister comments: 'When we joined in 1986, the EC was seen very favourably . . . it was an insurance against communism, it meant living better, democracy, joining the club of civilised people. Europe was a state of mind. Now I'm afraid that the EC, having once been seen as Santa Claus, is becoming an escape valve for every evil. More and and more people are complaining ..' Complaints stem from the mixed economic fortunes which continuing membership of the EC under the umbrella of Maastricht are bringing to Portugal. As the poorest member state of the EC when it joined, Portugal has found itself in the last seven years as the recipient of massive amounts of EC aid. Between 1986 and 1990, Portugal received Ecu 2.9bn, representing 1.6 per cent of its GDP, in structural funds alone. Recently, the EC agreed to a doubling of its total economic aid to Portugal to Ecus 18bn between 1994 and 1999. Portuguese officials pride themselves on their country's reasonably honest record in using the funds, although allegations persist about the misuse of training subsidies by companies and some trade union officials. The total funds have had a dramatic impact on the country's infrastructure - improvements have ranged from irrigation systems to motorways and airports - on training, and on living standards generally. But they have also contributed to a false sense of security. Over the last year, the majority of Portuguese have found themselves unpleasantly surprised by the harsher realities of EC membership, not least the difficulties of meeting the Maastrich convergence rules. Portuguese officials, who 18 months ago were proudly proclaiming their country's joining of the ERM as a sign of their commitment to the Maastricht rules and to joining EMU at its inception, are having to take a more pragmatic view about the pace of political and economic integration. They take some comfort in the fact that Maastricht itself allows a measure of flexibility. Mr Vitor Martins, Portugal's secretary of state for European affairs said in a recent interview with the FT: 'Next year will be crucial for a re-evaluation of the convergence criteria. If the European economy begins to recover I think we can live with the present criteria. But if the situation does not stabilise, we will push for a rewriting of Maastricht.' That the Portuguese economy was far from on course to meet the convergence criteria was made plain in October when the finance ministry had to admit publicly that the budget deficit had doubled from the original forecast of 4.7 per cent of GDP, to 8 per cent. The target date for cutting the deficit to three per cent of GDP was put off until 1999. Subsequently Portugal's finance minister Jorge Braga de Macedo has tried to put on a brave face, insisting that his country remains, 'at the forefront of those which want to be integrated in economic and monetary union.' What is unresolved is precisely on what terms. The present government has declared its opposition to the idea of a twin-track Europe, with different countries moving at different speeds towards EMU, but its own domestic economic mismanagement has effectively ensured that Portugal will go through the door later rather than sooner, and limping. Former socialist finance minister, Vitor Constancio, believes that policy should be allowed to reflect changing circumstances more clearly. He believes that the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo are irrevocably linked. 'If Spain wants to be in the forefront, it is difficult for us not to fall behind her,' he says. At the same time, he thinks that European union is best served politically by two speeds. 'It is clearly not possible to go back to the old European monetary system. If we really want to move ahead to EMU, let the others go ahead first. We may not be ready but we will get there in the end.' he says. The broad thrust of official thinking, however, appears to be essentially cautious and conservative: that present EC structures should be consolidated rather than subjected to any major upheaval. Portugal's membership is still in its gestation and has no wish to be orphaned. Mr Martins is in favour of enlargement, and believes that the Efta states will make the community economically stronger, and better equipped to deal with Eastern Europe. He wants the present 'balance within the EC' to be maintained. 'I am not in favour of constitutional change,' he insists. As for Portugal's most politically active Eurosceptic, the orthodox Communist Party, it does not have enough votes to push for a referendum, but its union arm is flexing its industrial muscle in a way that could make the government's efforts to achieve nominal and real convergence that much more difficult.</p>

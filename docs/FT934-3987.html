			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Canberra seeks to cool Malaysia row Mr Gareth Evans, the Australian foreign minister, yesterday urged a 'cooling off period' in the diplomatic row between his country and Malaysia before it develops into a full-blown trade dispute. 'It's in nobody's interest that the present problem with Malaysia escalates any further,' said Mr Evans. 'I hope very much the Malaysian cabinet may be prepared to accept a cooling-off period, a pause for reflection before taking further punitive or retaliatory measures of the kind that have been foreshadowed.' The Malaysian cabinet is due to discuss the issue tomorrow and there is apprehension in Australia that diplomatic relations between the two countries may be downgraded with Malaysia imposing sanctions on Australian goods and services. The row between the two countries broke after Mr Keating, Australia's prime minister, described Dr Mahathir Mohamad, his Malaysian counterpart, as a recalcitrant for not attending last month's Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Seattle. Malaysia says a letter sent by Mr Keating to Dr Mahathir stops short of an apology and various Malaysian government departments have been directed to curtail contacts with Australia. Yesterday a scheduled meeting in Kuala Lumpur between Mr Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Malaysia's foreign minister, and Mr Peter Cook, the visiting Australian trade minister, was cancelled by Malaysian officials.</p>

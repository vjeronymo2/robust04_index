			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Discounters at bay J Sainsbury has seen off the immediate threat from the discount supermarkets. The victory has been achieved at the price of a painful reduction in gross margins, the group conceded yesterday. But fears of a profits implosion, which have lingered on since the traumatic fall in Sainsbury's share price early this year, now look overdone. The discounters themselves are not in a fit state to launch a fresh assault on prices, as Kwik Save's figures are expected to demonstrate today. Against this background, gross margins at Sainsbury should stabilise from here on. The group's rigour in holding down costs in its core UK food retailing business was impressive. Equally so, from a strategic as well as a financial point of view, was the contribution made by Sainsbury's other retailing activities. Operating profits here grew by more than a quarter, lifting the total growth in group operating profits to 10 per cent - well ahead of the 7.7 per cent increase achieved by Sainsbury's UK supermarkets alone. The group's diversification strategy, which took a further stride forward last month with the acquisition of a 50 per cent voting stake in Giant Food of the US, has proved successful in insulating profits from the full ravages of competition in UK food retailing. One gripe is that the dividend grew by only 6.7 per cent, in line with pre-tax profits which were held back by a high interest charge. Sainsbury should consider moving to a progressive dividend policy. So robust is its cash flow that it could clearly afford to do so. But Sainsbury is probably husbanding its cash for further diversification in the US.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Frustrating time for Galliford A PERIOD of frustration and disappointment for Galliford saw interim pre-tax profits of the construction and contracting group fall 43 per cent from Pounds 3.61m to Pounds 2.06m. Turnover for the six months ended December 31 dipped 9 per cent to Pounds 105.9m. Mr Peter Galliford, chairman, said that judging market conditions had been particularly difficult in the period. Each group operating company had sought to trim its cost structures to reflect the volume of work available. First-half earnings per share fell to 1.56p (2.72p), while the interim dividend is held at 0.95p.</p>

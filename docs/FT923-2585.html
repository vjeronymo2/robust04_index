			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Swedish marginal lending rate hits 500% THE RIKSBANK, Sweden's central bank, raised its marginal lending rate to a staggering 500 per cent yesterday, the highest level ever, in an effort to crush rumours of a devaluation in the Swedish krona and reverse the huge outflow of capital seen earlier this week. Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister who heads a minority centre-right government, summoned leaders of all the main political parties to a meeting yesterday evening in an attempt to win support for proposed cuts in government spending and restore some calm to the markets. The government said it was supporting the Riksbank's measures to defend the krona, (which is linked to the Ecu), and said a devaluation of the currency was out of the question, given Sweden's commitment to a fixed exchange rate. Following Britain's decision last night to suspend sterling's membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, economists in Sweden warned that the krona would probably continue to come under pressure today. Dealers estimated that 'tens of billions of kronor' flooded out of Sweden on Tuesday and yesterday morning. At 8.30am, the Riksbank raised its marginal rate from 20 per cent to 75 per cent, but this was insufficient to reverse the outflow and it was forced to raise the rate again at 3.30pm, to 500 per cent. Mr Bengt Dennis, Riksbank governor, said the move had the desired effect of drawing back capital in the last half-hour of trading. He said that the marginal rate would remain at a high level for 'days rather than weeks' in order to support the krona. The Riksbank's marginal rate applies to only the top tranche of the banking system's borrowings from the central bank. The marginal rate of 500 per cent affects just the top SKr2.2bn (Pounds 214m) slice of total bank borrowings, which currently amount to SKr68.2bn. As a result, the average borrowing cost for the Swedish banking system has risen to 38 per cent, compared with about 24 per cent when the marginal rate was 75 per cent last Wednesday. Swedish interest rates have see-sawed over the last week. as domestic political worries coincided with turmoil in the international markets. The Riksbank raised its marginal interest rate to 75 per cent from 24 per cent on September 9 in order to defend the krona after Finland's decision to stop linking the markka to the Ecu. Sweden lowered the rate on Monday to 20 per cent, after the Bundesbank's decision to cut German interest rates. Swedish short-term interest rates shot up yesterday, with the yield on three-month treasury bills closing at 35 per cent, compared with 25 per cent at the previous day's close. Yields on six-month bills climbed from 22 per cent to 30 per cent. Longer-dated government paper underwent a slight fall in yields with five-year bonds ending at 12.30 per cent, compared with 12.58 per cent the previous day. Mortgage rates have risen in response, putting pressure on some households, although many homeowners in Sweden have fixed-rate mortgages.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- North Korea, facing  imminent international sanctions for its suspected program to  build nuclear arms, has intensified agitation and propaganda  operations to stir up South Korean society, the National  Unification Board [NUB] said Tuesday.    Radio Pyongyang reported Saturday that the South Korean  government would carry out currency reform in June or July,  citing a bulletin on "the civilian government's currency reform"  from a ghost organization named "Hanminjon," [South Korean  National Democratic Front] or the National Unification Front of  Korea, NUB officials said.    The currency reform will devalue the won by a ratio of 100  to  1 and affect not only cash in circulation but also bank deposits  and securities denominated in won, and informed Chongwadae  [presidential offices] sources have already confirmed the  bulletin, the report said.    Asserting that forged 10,000-won bills found in South Korea  last month were the harbinger of a currency reform, North Korea  is spreading the bulletin on currency reform in South Korea  through its electronic media, the officials said.    The NODONG SINMUN, the official newspaper of the North  Korean  Workers' (Communist) Party, urged Southern workers, in a  commentary carried in a recent issue, to launch a full-scale  struggle for higher wages, reinstatement of dismissed workers  and guaranteed labor participation in company management in  June, while criticizing the Kim Yong-sam government's call for  burden-sharing.    The North Korean propaganda machine's agitation pieces  targeting South Korean students, workers and farmers increased  from 32 in April to 73 in May, the officials said.    Pyongyang's increased anti-Seoul propaganda operations are  aimed at disturbing South Korean society by fanning the flames  of the "theory of June crisis" postulated by some political  circles in the South.    An official from NUB said the North Korean radio report on  currency reform in South Korea is totally groundless, calling it  just part of the psychological warfare designed to disrupt the  unity of the South Korean people and Government in dealing with  the North Korean nuclear problem.    North Korea will make use of collective bargaining on wage  hikes in June and July and a pan-national unification meeting it  will hold at Panmunjom in August to create an anti-government  climate and social confusion in South Korea, he said.</p>

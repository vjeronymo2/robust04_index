			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Salomon forces directors to share pain as well as gains: A controversial bonds market pay move Is Salomon Brothers turning into Goldman Sachs? Thirteen years after Salomon went public, the Wall Street bond trading firm appears to be metamorphosing back into a private partnership. Just like its celebrated rival Goldman, Salomon has come to the conclusion that the best way to motivate its top executives - the ones who generate the bulk of the firm's earnings - is to tie their pay directly to performance. This way, the interests of the employees are closer to the interests of the whole firm. However, Salomon is not going to mimic Goldman exactly. Salomon is owned by its shareholders, and there are no plans for a management-led buy-out. Nor are there plans to use senior executives' money as risk-taking capital, as happens at true private partnerships such as Goldman. Instead, Salomon's ruling triumvirate - chairman Mr Robert Denham, chief executive Mr Deryck Maughan, and chief shareholder Mr Warren Buffett - are seeking to create a hybrid, what Mr Maughan likes to call a 'synthesis of public capital and private partnership'. Ten days ago, Salomon took the first step towards that goal when it unveiled a new system for compensating the 140 or so managing directors in its client-related businesses - the top bankers, salesmen, traders and analysts who serve the broking and investment banking needs of Salomon's institutional clients. Under the new pay plan, which will be introduced in January, the managing directors will be paid a guaranteed minimum annual salary totalling just 35 per cent of their 1994 compensation. They will not begin to earn any bonuses (which traditionally make up the bulk of their earnings) until the entire client-driven business earns at least a 7 per cent return on equity capital. Once that threshold has been exceeded, the managing directors will receive 40 per cent of any additional profits. At the same time, a new pay plan is being introduced in Salomon's proprietary trading operations, where the firm trades its own money in the financial markets. From next year, managing directors in proprietary trading will be paid from multi-year deferred accounts. These accounts will pool traders' bonuses over a period of several years, but if proprietary trading loses money at any time during the period, some of the bonuses from profitable years will be retrieved from the pool. The aim of the new compensation plan at Salomon is to introduce a notion that is truly radical by the standards of Wall Street's public firms - downward mobility in managing directors' pay. Salomon's management believes the lack of pay flexibility is the problem with the current system. At the moment, when the firm prospers, so do the highest-paid employees, in the form of big bonuses. The shareholders also benefit, in the form of a higher Salomon share price and dividends. When Salomon suffers, the shareholders bear the brunt of the poor performance through a lower share price and dividends, while the managing directors are cushioned by compensation packages that are generous enough to ensure Salomon's pay remains competitive. This divergence between pay and performance is exactly what Salomon is experiencing this year. Barring a spectacular recovery in the fourth quarter, the firm will lose money in 1994, while employee compensation will decline only slightly (currently, pay costs are down only 7 per cent compared to a year ago). While the new pay system may help Salomon control its costs better in coming years, it will do nothing to address the underlying problems that have left the firm nursing losses on both its client-driven and proprietary trading businesses this year. Salomon remains relatively sanguine about the poor performance of its trading unit, which has lost Dollars 21m (Pounds 12.8m) so far this year. The firm points out that its proprietary trading strategies are designed to be profitable over the long-term, and says that the results of the business should not be judged over any period shorter than four quarters (over the last 12 months, proprietary trading has made a profit of Dollars 487m). Salomon has had a harder time explaining why its client-driven business has performed so badly. Salomon has lost Dollars 526m on its client-driven business so far this year, compared to profits of Dollars 805m in the same period of 1993. This dramatic deterioration was attributed to mismanagement of derivative-like securities known as collateralised mortgage obligations (CMOs). The value of CMOs plunged earlier this year when the mortgage-backed bond market slumped. Since then, Salomon says it has cleaned up the mortgage-backed mess, bringing in new management to the department, selling off a large part of its inventory of CMOs, and introducing strict new position limits for its traders. The rest of its client-driven business, the firm insists, is healthy. Salomon's managing directors must hope so, because from January, their meagre salaries will only be supplemented if the client-driven business generates substantial profits. The firm says that the changes to compensation have the support of most of its managing directors, but admits there is some unhappiness. To reassure them that the changes are for the good, Mr Maughan has already begun to talk of the role of 'partners' at the firm. As a former Goldman Sachs investment banker, Salomon's chief executive knows only too well about the risks and rewards of partnerships. His managing directors can only hope that in the coming years, the rewards will compensate for the risks.</p>

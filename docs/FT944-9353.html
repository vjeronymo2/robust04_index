			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Obituary of Humphrey Berkeley: MP and Conservative rebel Humphrey Berkeley, who died yesterday aged 68, was mainly responsible for democratising the election of the Conservative party leader. He was Conservative MP for Lancaster when in 1963 the sudden resignation of Harold Macmillan, the prime minister, plunged the party into crisis. At the time the Tory whips controlled the machinations, known as the 'processes of consultation' which - in theory at any rate - determined the preferences of backbench MPs for various candidates for the succession. The process was discredited when it became known that the Earl of Home, still a peer, had emerged with more support than such leading rivals as RA Butler and Reginald Maudling. Iain Macleod, party chairman and leader of the Commons when Mr Macmillan resigned, refused to serve under the new prime minister, protesting that his emergence owed more to the 'magic circle' than any consultative process. Mr Berkeley, a supporter of Mr Macleod, led demands for the introduction of voting procedures which operated for the first time when Sir Edward Heath succeeded Sir Alec Douglas-Home (as he became on disclaiming his hereditary peerage) in July 1965. Mr Berkeley attributed his defeat at Lancaster in 1966 to the unfavourable publicity which resulted from his sponsorship of a private member's bill legalising homosexual acts between consenting adults. Ironically, he found the Conservative party under Sir Edward increasingly unattractive and resigned from it in 1970, switching to Labour. He tried to return to the Commons as Labour MP for North Fylde (Lancashire) in October 1974, and also failed to secure election in 1987 for the Social Democratic party at Southend East. He rejoined the Labour party in 1988. Mr Berkeley, an outspoken opponent of racial discrimination, was a vice-president of the Anti-Apartheid Movement for many years.</p>

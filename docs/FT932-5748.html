			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Windsor Pounds 1.19m in the red WINDSOR, the Lloyd's broker specialising in sports, leisure and contingency insurance, is proposing a reduction in capital to remedy the deficit on its distributable reserves. The move follows a property write-down of Pounds 1.7m, taken as an exceptional charge in its interim results announced yesterday. For the six months to March 31 pre-tax losses amounted to Pounds 1.91m (Pounds 102,000 profits) on turnover slightly ahead at Pounds 3.79m against Pounds 3.63m. Interest charges took Pounds 106,000 (Pounds 155,000). Mr Michael Eagles, chief executive, said the loss arose primarily because of the increased provision on its investment property in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. That property was likely to be sold. He said the new management, established in 1991, continued to concentrate successfully on core insurance activities. Underlying brokerage increased by 9 per cent in the half year. The directors hope that the proposed capital reduction will lead to a resumption in dividend payments should trading conditions permit. Losses per share for the period amounted to 5.64p (0.21p earnings). Mr Stanley Cohen, who was chairman for more than two years, has retired from the board. A new chairman will be announced shortly.</p>

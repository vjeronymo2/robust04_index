Winding up his first two-day agenda in the U.S. capital, Han  told reporters that he came to understand that the chances of  North Korea and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  reaching an agreement over nuclear inspections were slim but not  entirely hopeless as reported by foreign press in discussing the  matter with U.S. senior officials. He said he found the  concern for a possible war in the Korean peninsula was very  seriously spread among the U.S. press.    "I explained that the security situation in the Korean  peninsula was not that serious as pictured in the U.S. press  through interviews. I think the press views here have become  more calm now," he said.    The foreign minister said Seoul and Washington agreed not to  discuss the matter of deploying U.S. Patriot missiles in South  Korea any more before the IAEA board meeting on Feb. 21 as not  to provoke North Korea.    Noting a North Korean Foreign Ministry statement on Saturday  urging Washington to be clear about the next round of bilateral  talks, Han said he got the impression that Pyongyang's attitude  has turned a bit softer, considering the statement highlighted  that the United States wanted to continue talks with North Korea  and the IAEA board meeting hinted at nuclear inspections to  guarantee continuity of nuclear safety.    Han embarks on his four-day schedule in Canada on Sunday,  stops by New York for talks with United Nations  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on Feb. 16, and visits  Washington the following day for the second time.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bias to fee-based advisers who are weak on specifics Sir, Your excellent series on fee-based financial advisers (Weekend: Finance and the Family) by Joanna Slaughter was perhaps too heavily biased in their favour. Commission earners may be over-anxious for clients to deal or buy a product but fee-earners are primarily motivated by a desire to get 'funds under management'. What happens to those funds is as often a matter of luck as judgment. Ms Slaughter may or may not have noticed that fee-earners tend to be strong on generalities but weak on specifics. Commission earners seem to be more market-oriented and this may give their clients the edge when it comes to bottom line performance. John Donovan, 17a La Pleta, Ordino, Principality of Andorra</p>

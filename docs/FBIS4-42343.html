			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tolga Sardan: "Iran Supports Turkey's Military </F> Operations"]    [Text] Ankara--It has been ascertained that four Iranian  battalions have for some time been supporting Turkish military  operations against the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK]  militants on the Agri and Tendurek Mountains.    A MILLIYET correspondent has been informed that the security  forces know that several PKK militants crossed into Iran after  being pressured by the military operations carried out in the  Agri and Tendurek Mountains over the past four months. Acting  on that information, the Internal Affairs Ministry officials  asked their Iranian counterparts to establish a "control line"  [kontrol hatti] in the region. Earlier, the Iranian  Administration promised to support Turkey's struggle against the  PKK. This promise was made during the joint security committee  meetings between the two countries. Considering Turkey's  request, 10 days ago Iran transferred four battalions to an area  in the vicinity of the Agri and Tendurek Mountains in order to  maintain security along the border between the two countries.    Officials disclosed that the measures taken by the Iranian  military forces along the border have prevented the PKK groups,  which have sustained severe blows in the mountainous region,  from crossing into Iran. A high-ranking official said Iran's  support was very important for the "mop up" operations. He  asserted: "Iran's transfer of troops to the operations zone was  a second gesture by that country. That is an indication that  relations between the two countries are improving on security  matters."    It should be recalled that Iran arrested a group of PKK  militants and handed them over to Turkey some time ago.</p>

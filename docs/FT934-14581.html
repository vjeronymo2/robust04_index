			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Bonds: EC launches long-awaited DM1bn Eurobond issue THE European Community launched its long-awaited DM1bn Eurobond offering yesterday, capitalising on Wednesday's favourable reception to its Ecu1bn Eurobond issue. The EC decided to launch the five-year D-Mark bonds quickly so as not to clash with the World Bank's planned DM3bn global offering. The World Bank's deal is expected to come early next week, ahead of the Bundesbank's meeting. The market was surprised that the EC only borrowed DM1bn, half the amount which had been rumoured. The EC is currently funding the second Ecu2bn tranche of its Ecu8bn lending programme to Italy. Mr Paul Goldschmidt, director at the EC's credit and investment division reporting to EC economics commissioner Mr Henning Christophersen, said Italy had not wanted to borrow more than DM1bn at this time. The other DM900m would be raised at a later date, he said. The pricing of the bonds, to yield eight basis points over the series 107 of German government medium-term notes, came within expectations. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread narrowed slightly. The other large deal of the day was a Dollars 1bn FRN offering from LKB Baden Wurttemberg. The pricing of the five-year notes, which yielded 11 basis points below the six-month London interbank offered rate (Libor), was seen by some to be on the tight side. However, lead manager CSFB said the pricing reflected the issuer's triple-A rating and its close links with the state of Baden Wurttemberg. The deal, which provided fresh liquidity to the market, attracted investors who were looking for defensive instruments. The notes traded around their fixed re-offer price of 99.95 in the afternoon. Instituto Nacional de Industria (Ini), the Spanish state industrial holding company, today signs its Dollars 1bn Euro medium-term note programme. It plans to make its first Eurobond offering, of Dollars 500m, under this programme towards the end of November. Urban Mortgage Bank of Sweden plans to raise Dollars 500m in the Euromarket next week. Nomura is thought to be arranging the deal. Elsewhere, ABN Amro, the largest bank in the Netherlands, opened up the 100-year maturity in the US domestic bond market to European borrowers with its Dollars 150m offering of subordinated deposit notes due 2093. Lead manager Morgan Stanley said the bonds were priced to yield 110 basis points over the 7 1/8 per cent US Treasury due 2023. This compared with yield spreads of 75 basis points and 67 basis points on similar deals launched by Walt Disney and Coca-Cola, respectively, earlier this year. ABN's 100-year bonds, which yielded 25 basis points over its its 30-year bonds, were bought by about 20 US institutional investors.</p>

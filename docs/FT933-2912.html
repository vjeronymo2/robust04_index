			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Nomura lures banking sector team from Smith New Court INDICATIONS of a revival in employment prospects in the London stock market were emphasised yesterday by confirmation that Nomura's European division has successfully lured the highly valued banking sector research team away from Smith New Court. Mr Michael Lever, former head of the Smith New Court team, is joining Nomura on terms reported to be worth around Pounds 300,000 a year. Mr Lever would not discuss his overall package yesterday, commenting that many elements, including mortgages, and cars can be involved. Also signing for Nomura yesterday was Mr David Raye, Mr Lever's second in command at Smith New Court. Earlier this year, Nomura had similar success in recruiting Smith's oils team. Both moves have been seen as evidence of renewed confidence towards its London operation by Nomura which had previously cut back on its UK operation. The Nomura appointments provide further indication of a strong recovery in recruitment policies in the City of London, at least for provenly able staff. Mr Lever was rated second in this year's Extel survey of City analysts, and first by the banks themselves. He spent nine years with the Bank of England, and thus joins several other ex-Bank specialists to have joined stock market firms. Among them are Mr Ian Harnett, chief economist at Strauss Turnbull, UK arm of Societe Generale, and Mr Albert Edwards, global strategist at Kleinwort Benson. There were also reports yesterday of attempts to preserve the stock market existence of Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, the UK stockbroking firm which was largely closed down last week by its French parent, Banque Indosuez.</p>

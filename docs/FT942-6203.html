			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Hualon faces MPs' inquiry The Commons public accounts committee is likely to review the funding for a Belfast textiles plant to be built by a Taiwanese group, two of whose top managers have been charged in connection with an alleged share fraud. According to a member of the committee there is concern that a non-elected body - the province's Industrial Development Board - lobbied for a project which may not have been justified economically. Political leaders in Northern Ireland yesterday called on the IDB to ensure adequate safeguards were put in place before final approval was given to a Pounds 61m grant to the Taiwanese textile company Hualon for a Pounds 157m weaving, dyeing and finishing plant. Mr Mark Durkan, chairman of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said the project should only go ahead 'once it has been fully tested and examined', following a report in yesterday's Financial Times that the European Commission had approved grant-aiding the project only after intense lobbying by the UK and against the advice of its own officials. All three MEPs from Northern Ireland had been drafted in by the IDB to lobby on behalf of the project once it transpired serious objections were being raised to it in Brussels. Mr Jim Nicholson, the Ulster Unionist MEP, said he was asked to lobby on behalf of the project 'so that the EU bureaucracy would not block it'. He said they had been told by the IDB that Spain and several other EU countries had objected to the project, 'and even a few companies in the UK' on competitions grounds, but he had been given no briefing on alleged financial improprieties. Both he and Mr John Hume, the SDLP MEP, met Mr Karel van Miert, competition commissioner, in Strasbourg shortly before May 4, when the project was approved. Mr Sammy Wilson, spokesman for the Democratic Unionist party, whose MEP the Rev Ian Paisley also lobbied on behalf of the project, said 'The IDB should make sure there are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure we don't get bitten again.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In today's open Majles session, which was  presided over by Deputy Speaker Movahhedi-Kermani, the bill for  the amendment of Article 17 of the courts' appeal law, approved  in Mordad 1372 [month beginning 23 July 1993], was approved  after a second reading.    According to a report, in a letter read out in today's open  session, over 150 Majles deputies conveyed their condolences to  the families and friends of the victims of the downing of an  Iranian C- 130 aircraft in the Karabakh region, and described  the Armenian Army as the main cause of the incident and voiced  their protest over the silence of international organizations in  response to this incident.    In the letter, the Majles deputies called on the Armenian  Government to give an explicit response on this issue and also  called on our country's Foreign Ministry to pursue the matter in  earnest.

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Bush plans freeze on new regulations US PRESIDENT George Bush plans a three-month freeze on new federal regulations and a review of existing rules as part of an economic recovery programme to be unveiled in his State of the Union address next week. The proposed moratorium, a policy U-turn for Mr Bush, follows business complaints at the growth of federal regulation during his presidency. The freeze would cover most government agencies, including those responsible for food, transport, the environment and communications. During his three years in office, Mr Bush has presided over the broadest extension of the federal government's regulatory reach since the second Nixon administration of the early 1970s. Working with the Democratic majority in Congress, Mr Bush signed the 800-page Clean Air Act in 1990, imposing a regulatory burden with an estimated cost of up to Dollars 30bn (Pounds 16.7bn) a year for business. The Americans with Disabilities Act, estimated to cost business up to Dollars 2bn a year, also passed in 1990. Mr Bush, who vowed in the 1988 presidential campaign to become the 'Environmental President', often promotes this domestic legislation to counter criticism that he has spent too much energy on foreign policy. But in recent months, as the US economy has failed to pull out of recession, business leaders have lobbied the White House to scrap unnecessary rules and lift the burden on business. This has encouraged Vice-President Dan Quayle, who chairs the Council on Competitiveness, to become more active in scrutinising regulations. In addition, existing regulations - including those developed by the present administration - would be looked at with a view to avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy. However, major legislation such as the Clean Air Act was not expected to be attacked, one administration official said yesterday. Tussle on economy, Page 4</p>

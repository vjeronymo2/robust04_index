			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lord Finsberg, rapporteur for the Cyprus problem at  the Political Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe  Parliamentary Assembly, has begun his contacts in the Turkish  Republic of Northern Cyprus.    President Rauf Denktas received Lord Finsberg this morning  and conferred with him for some time. In a statement after the  meeting, Denktas said that he discussed with Lord Finsberg, who  is assessing the Cyprus situation, the problems created by the  lack of Turkish Cypriot representation at the Council of Europe  and their possible solutions. Denktas noted that he told Lord  Finsberg how the obstacles created by the recognition of the  Greek Cypriot administration as the legitimate government can be  eliminated, adding that Lord Finsberg expressed the hope that  these problems will be averted if progress is made on the  confidence-building measures. Denktas said that the UN  secretary general should send letters to both sides for the  talks on the confidence-building measures to begin. He  concluded by describing the recent positive statements made by  the Greek Cypriot side as an optimistic development.</p>

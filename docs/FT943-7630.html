			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Upbeat forecasts for chemicals giants - Hoechst/Bayer Hoechst and Bayer, the German chemicals giants, report their half-year results this week, after BASF's figures last Thursday. Brokers expect Hoechst's pre-tax profits, due on Wednesday, to be about DM1bn (Pounds 420m) for the half, compared with DM781m for the same period last year. The first-quarter figure was up 16 per cent. For Bayer, which reports on Thursday, estimates are around DM1.7bn pre-tax, compared with DM1.41bn. The first-quarter rise was 18 per cent. Analysts expect the two companies to be helped by good volume gains, particularly from overseas. Hoechst, which is more exposed to the cyclical plastics market, should also benefit from the start of the turnround in petrochemicals. Bayer has little plastics manufacturing, but should post an upturn in intermediates volumes and prices. Both companies will continue to suffer from the healthcare reforms announced in Europe during the past week, although the German market is beginning to recover, albeit from a low base. Analysts will also be watching the results of the agrochemicals operations, which have suffered in the past two years from the impact of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.</p>

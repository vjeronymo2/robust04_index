			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Singh defends role over scandal: MPs walk out during emotional address by Indian finance minister Mr Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, yesterday staunchly defended his role in dealing with the Bombay financial scandal and warned against taking precipitate action against foreign banks. Mr Singh addressed parliament at the end of a two-day debate on a report by a joint parliamentary committee which strongly criticised the Finance Ministry as well as virtually every other party involved in the scandal. He has tendered his resignation to Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister. Although Mr Rao has not indicated whether he will accept it, the prime minister told parliament he agreed with what Mr Singh had said and added action would be taken 'wherever it is called for'. Mr Singh acknowledged 'full constitutional responsibility' for decisions taken by his ministry. But he denied he had failed to detect weaknesses in the financial and banking system, and said financial sector reform was under way. His voice choked with emotion, Mr Singh denied he had been 'indifferent or unconcerned' and that his ministry had ignored an overheated stock exchange. He said he had ordered raids on brokers in February 1992 to find out the source of money fuelling the stock market boom. He had told the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, to investigate whether state-run banks were funnelling money illegally to the brokers. 'It found out that the State Bank of India was giving away funds to some of these brokers. That was the beginning of (the revelation of) the scam,' Mr Singh said. He disputed the committee's contention that foreign banks were the originators of the scandal. 'The root of the stock market scam was that the boom took place and the nationalised banks were not allowed to lend to brokers through the front door, so they found a back door.' Mr Singh said the government had stopped the repatriation of profits for the financial year to March 1992 of the four banks accused in the scandal - Standard Chartered, ANZ Grindlay's, BankAmerica and Citicorp. But he suggested the government would not accept the committee's suggestion that it remove their licences. 'We must caution ourselves that we live in a civilised world and therefore any action that we take against them has to be fair and square,' Mr Singh said. 'The government will see to it that the foreign banks function within the four corners of the country's laws and proper action will be taken if any of them breach the law.' Opposition MPs demanded that Mr Singh's resignation be accepted, and members from the ruling Congress party pleaded his case. The finance minister addressed a half-empty house after opposition members walked out, insisting that the prime minister, and not Mr Singh, conclude the debate. Mr Shivraj Patil, the speaker, overruled them. The Janata Dal (A) party, a splinter group of 10 opposition MPs led by Mr Ajit Singh, yesterday joined Congress, giving an absolute majority to the ruling party in the lower house of parliament with 266 of the 544 seats.</p>

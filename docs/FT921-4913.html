			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / World Trade News: New strains between US and Canada THE unsettled trading relationship between the US and Canada will be further strained today after an expected ruling by the US Commerce Department that Canadian provinces are subsidising exports of softwood lumber, reports Bernard Simon in Toronto. The finding, which would strike one of Canada's biggest exports to the US, is expected to bring a barrage of protest, not only from Canadian lumber producers, but also from the government in Ottawa. The lumber ruling, coming on the heels of a controversial US Customs Service decision earlier this week to deny duty-free access to Honda cars assembled in Ontario, is bound to intensify political pressure on Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to retaliate against US exports. Mr Mulroney's government has made liberalised trade with the US one of the planks of its economic policies, but is increasingly concerned at what it perceives as aggressive protectionism in Washington. Two-way trade between the US and Canada totalled CDollars 175bn (Pounds 84.5bn) in the first 11 months of last year. Canadian sawmills sell about CDollars 3bn of lumber a year in the US, accounting for a quarter of the market.</p>

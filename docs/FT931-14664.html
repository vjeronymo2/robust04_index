			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Wine: California's double whammy - Viruses which poses a new threat to US west coast vines BY this time of year, nurseryman Rich Kunde of Sonoma Grapevines would usually have grafted more than half a million vines for sale to California's grape growers. This year, he has not grafted a single one. This is despite the fact that demand for young vine cuttings in California has never been greater. Because of the predations of a new strain of phylloxera, the plant louse which devastated the vineyards of Europe and beyond a century ago, Californians are engaged in a big vineyard replanting programme. The only known deterrent to the insect is to graft vines on to phylloxera-resistant rootstocks. The AxR-1 rootstocks, on which the California wine industry is dependent, have been productive but not resistant enough. Some forecasts say the majority of vineyards in Napa and Sonoma, California's most famous wine regions, will have to be completely replanted over the next decade. But Kunde knows something so serious that, as he puts it, it could be 'a tidal wave that will make the phylloxera thing look like a little ripple'. For decades, Davis, the University of California wine research centre, has prided itself as the world's prime source of virus-free vine cuttings from its solid-sounding Foundation Plant Materials Service. Virus diseases have throughout history wreaked almost as much damage as phylloxera on the world's vineyards. Fanleaf is bad but the worst is leafroll virus, probably caused by a group of viruses, which can halve yields but also slows ripening so that the resultant wines are thin and tart. Leafroll's chief symptom is visible only on some varieties and only during the autumn, when leaves of certain red wine vines may turn over on themselves and take on deceptively beautiful autumnal colours. It is particularly difficult to detect because on some varieties, and all rootstocks (essential for California's phylloxera-resistant replanting programme), there are no visible symptoms at all. For years, it has been taught, and believed, that leafroll can be spread only by using cuttings from infected plants. But last summer, the FPMS at Davis began testing the all-important 'mother vines' for leafroll, using the sophisticated ELISA technique developed in the early 1980s. This was to ensure that the millions of cuttings released to vine growers all over the world each year really are virus-free. The plant pathologist found to his horror that about 20 per cent of some batches tested positive, even though they had been selected from apparently virus-free plants. The situation progressed from sleepless nights to shared knowledge to task forces to decisions and, on December 16, the FPMS issued a letter explaining why they had stopped issuing plant material, admitting that the virus seems to be spreading through their supposedly virus-free Foundation Vineyard and they have not a clue how. This rather elliptical communication, however, may still be languishing at the bottom of various holiday in-trays. The real showdown will take place this Tuesday at a meeting with California nurserymen and grape growers. They are confused enough already by what they call the latent virus phenomenon, whereby cuttings taken from vines that performed superbly when grafted on to AxR-1 rootstocks, show horrible virus symptoms now that they are being grafted on to phylloxera-resistant rootstocks. Not to mention the nasty Pierce's disease for which there is no known cure and which is a particular problem in southern California and in some Napa vineyards. Not that leafroll spread has come out of the blue. Some observers had noticed leafroll in the Davis vineyards some time ago, but it was not taken seriously. Leafroll had also appeared in New Zealand's National Foundation Vineyard, made up of cuttings imported from Davis, some years back. But again, it was ignored because everyone believed leafroll could only be spread from infected vines and these were vines guaranteed by Davis to be virus-free. In Taiwan, another FPMS client had noticed strange patterns of virus spread too, as had some growers in Europe and South Africa, it now emerges. Although no one knows how the virus is spreading, and a definitive answer within less than a few years seems unlikely, a vector, an insect perhaps, is implicated. Mealy bug is currently the prime suspect. Leafroll is not only difficult to spot, it is impossible to cure. Californians who have just replanted a vineyard after the predations of phylloxera now cannot be sure that they have not, in fact, planted virused vines and/or virused rootstocks which will have to pulled up again when, after a further three years or so, they can monitor the vines' performance. International viticultural consultant Dr Richard Smart has already advised clients in Australia as well as California to pull out any vines showing signs of leafroll, especially if mealy bug is present - unwelcome advice when vines are expected to produce for up to 30 years but take three years to establish in the vineyard. What a blow to an industry that so recently looked so rosy. For the moment, growers may be paralysed and nurseryman such as Kunde can do little other than hope that it was ELISA at fault all along. Instead of grafting new cuttings for sale, he is currently instituting painstaking tracking systems whereby every cutting he has sold can be traced right back to its source. Warren Winiarski of Stag's Leap, one of Napa's most viticulturally aware wine producers, said: 'There is now a great deal of uncertainty about how rapidly we can go forward with this replanting programme. We may move out of the phylloxera frying pan into the fire of these viruses, Pierce's disease and so on.'</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Temporary rescue for French group VEV, the struggling French textiles group, yesterday agreed to the terms of a temporary financial lifeboat worked out by the French government with VEV's bank creditors in a bid to save the company from outright bankruptcy. The government and banks will together finance VEV's immediate cash needs for one month - FFr100m (Dollars 17.1m) to FFr250m - while the banks have agreed to concessions on a portion of their loans to the debt-ridden group. At the same time, Mr Christian Derveloy, VEV's chairman, is to resign, and an audit will be undertaken to see if the textiles group can survive. The government has been anxious to avert the collapse of a group which employs 11,000 people, many of them in areas of northern France which already suffer high unemployment. The Interministerial Committee for Industrial Reconstruction (CIRI), a unit of the Finance Ministry, has supervised negotiations between VEV and its banks. An agreement hammered out over the weekend provides for the bank creditors to abandon an estimated FFr250m of short-term debt and to convert some FFr500m of medium-term debt into participating loans. The banks have also been asked to give up their claim on the shares of a number of VEV's subsidiaries pledged as security for their loans. This should facilitate the break-up of the group, if this proves necessary, as most Paris bankers now fear. VEV has already sold several of its most profitable subsidiaries, such as Jalla, Pennel &amp; Flipo and Gravograph, in a bid to reduce its debt burden, which totalled FFr3.3bn at the end of 1989. Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank, is the most heavily exposed creditor, with loans understood to total more than FFr1.2bn. Other creditors include Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), Societe Generale, Credit Commercial de France (CCF), Credit du Nord and Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur (BFCE). The banks had earlier flatly refused to accept much broader concessions proposed by the CIRI. VEV emerged in 1987 out of the ashes of the Prouvost group, which Mr Derveloy then managed. Using VEV as his vehicle, Mr Derveloy not only beat off a stock market assault on Prouvost by the Chargeurs group, but also won control of the group away from the Prouvost family which had hired him. Although he succeeded in this battle, Mr Derveloy is generally thought to have got the worse of a peace deal with Chargeurs signed the following year, through which he gave up Prouvost's profitable wool trading and carding operations to Chargeurs, keeping its textiles and clothing divisions. Mr Regis Bello, formerly chief executive of the A. Dewavrin Fils group, was expected yesterday to replace Mr Derveloy at the head of the group. Mr Derveloy was expected to offer to sell his 5.4 per cent VEV stake for a symbolic FFr1. VEV's board was due yesterday to finalise 1990's accounts, which are expected to show a loss of over FFr500m. By yesterday evening, however, the results had not yet been published.</p>

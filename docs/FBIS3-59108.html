			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jean-Pierre Stroobants: "True and False </F> Lessons Drawn From the `Affair'"]    [Text] Guy Coeme who, two weeks ago, produced a defense  statement stressing the difficulties of applying the measures  for the referral of a minister to the Court of Appeal, at noon  on Tuesday 25 January asked for the referral to be made to this  same court. This will be the final episode in a strange defense  action which, when all is said and done, will have had the  effect of confirming suspicions. The former deputy prime  minister repeated yesterday, in every possible way, his  innocence and his desire to defend himself. We have already  heard this from him many times, at least where the method of  allocating the Agusta contract is concerned. Now, however,  attention has been focused on a specific point -- the  commissions that are supposed to have been paid to the Socialist  Party [PS] (or should we say the Socialist Parties, the national  and Liege groups?) that the ex-minister claims he never saw,  thus contradicting the members of his own "family."    Now all we can hope for is that the rules applied will  enable  Guy Coeme to explain his case once and for all, on every point,  and then leave Justice to finish what it started.    Nothing would be worse than if this dossier were to be  "buried," stifled in the procedural maze or the tangle of party  politics.    The dangers of this affair have been underlined, with its  possible link with the murder of a minister of state. It could  still undermine the government or strengthen the rejection of  politics by the public as it stands today. The triggering of a  governmental crisis moreover would make it possible to check "in  vivo" the depth of this feeling, fed by the outpourings from the  PS.    These are real dangers. However, there is something even  more important which will prove only too well the crucial nature  of current events. The real risk for the political sphere will  be if it fails to learn the lessons, the many lessons, to be  drawn from the current situation.    A number of officials, including Coeme, are aiming their  criticisms today toward the media which, if we are to believe  them, is collectively responsible for deviations, false  disclosures, and errors. We do not deny that certain elements  have been responsible for damaging exaggerations. However,  without playing the role of judge and jury, we would ask those  assigned the mission of government not to draw from the Agusta  affair the sole conclusion that the press should be regulated.  Now there are many other things that need to be considered by  all those who, in the PS and elsewhere, are truly convinced of  the need to reconcile morality with public life.</p>

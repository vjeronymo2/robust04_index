			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 15 Apr (XINHUA) -- Tian Qiyu, vice minister  of public security, met with Li Junxia, head of the Hong Kong  branch of the International Criminal Police Organization [ICPO]  and commissioner of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force, and his  party in Beijing the other day. At the invitation of Zhu Entao,  director of the ICPO National Control Bureau of China, Li Junxia  and his party arrived in Beijing on 9 April for the 19th working  meeting between the ICPO National Control Bureau of China and  the ICPO Hong Kong branch.    Zhu Entao held working-level talks with Li Junxia during the  latter's stay in Beijing. The two sides briefed each other on  public security in the hinterland and in Hong Kong and exchanged  views on further cracking down on across-the-border crimes and  conducting exchanges in work. Tian Qiyu, vice minister of  public security, met with Li Junxia and his party.    During the meeting, Vice Minister Tian Qiyu extended a  welcome to Li Junxia and his party. He also expressed  appreciation for the Hong Kong police's efforts to maintain  public order in the region and highly appraised police  cooperation between the interior of the country and Hong Kong.    Tian Qiyu said: Since Mr. Li Junxia took over the office of  Hong Kong Police Force commissioner, marked achievements have  been scored by the interior of the country and Hong Kong in  strengthening their cooperation and making concerted efforts to  crack down on criminal offenses through the ICPO channel. Hong  Kong's criminal offenses have continuously dropped since 1992,  and its public order as a whole has taken a noticeable turn for  the better. Mr. Li Junxia and the Hong Kong Police Force have  contributed to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.    Tian Qiyu said: The year 1997 is drawing near. The Chinese  Government is fully confident of the smooth handing-over of Hong  Kong sovereignty in 1997. It is hoped that, in the last  transitional period, the Hong Kong Police Force will play its  due role in effecting a smooth transition. When the  sovereignity of Hong Kong is returned to China in 1997, the  Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will  be responsible for its public order and organize its police  force. Hong Kong police who love the motherland and Hong Kong  are welcome to continue their service in the force in order to  contribute their intelligence and wisdom to the region's  prosperity and stability. Hong Kong police personnel are also  welcome to visit and tour the interior of the country more often  to enhance their understanding of the hinterland and to  strengthen their cooperation with us so that we all can make a  due contribution to cracking down on criminal offenses and  maintaining social prosperity and stability.</p>

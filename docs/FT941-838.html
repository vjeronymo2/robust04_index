			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (3): Call for an integrated approach - Environment Over the past five years, environmental liability has gained importance in risk management circles throughout the world. A barrage of laws and regulations on everything from pesticides to packaging waste has turned what was once regarded as routine spillage or emission into actionable nuisances or even criminal offences. Anyone doubting the momentum of this trend should look at a snapshot of activity worldwide: The European Union is debating new liability rules under its Green Paper on Remedying Environmental Damage; The Strasbourg-based Council of Europe has agreed a convention on liability for damage resulting from activities dangerous to the environment; The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is developing a liability protocol under the Basel Convention on cross-border movements of hazardous waste; The UK government has just published its preliminary thoughts on liability for contaminated land; The French environment ministry has circulated all departments and regions with instructions to begin preparation of inventories of contaminated sites; The governments of Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland, as well as regional governments in Spain and Italy, are promoting tougher liability and clean-up proposals; In the US, Congress is examining proposals to update both the Superfund hazardous substance clean-up law, CERCLA, and the Clean Water Act; In Canada and Australia, individual states and provinces are developing new strict liability regimes; Even in Japan, the recently passed Basic Environmental Law and some local city ordinances are opening the way for new liability provisions. At the same time, the environmental enforcement agencies and powers at national and international level are being strengthened, with a third biannual international enforcement conference to be held in Oaxaca, Mexico, next month. The uncomfortable paradox is that, just as environmental regulations proliferate and liability increases, the insurance market has been restricting or removing cover for environmental risks. Courts in the US have been upholding hundreds of high value claims for Superfund and other clean-up costs, under general liability policies that were either silent on pollution or attempted to limit cover to 'sudden and accidental', as opposed to gradual, incidents. As a result, insurers have been re-wording their general policies to narrow the range of pollution incidents covered. Conversely, a small number of insurers, including insurance market pools in certain European countries, now offer specialist environmental insurance policies to cover a variety of risks, including environmental impairment (third party) liability (EIL), own-site clean-up, and contractors' risks, directors' and officers' risks (D&amp;O), and professional indemnity (PI) risks. These new policies are generally based on 'claims made' (as opposed to 'occurrence') policy wordings, require intensive site surveys before cover is offered, have modest policy limits (typically Pounds 1-Pounds 10m) and involve substantial deductibles (the amount paid by the policy holder in any loss). They require payment of premiums which many potential policy holders consider high, particularly when they have had environmental cover free in the past. In addition, they offer little cover for damage caused in the past, to the extent that such cover simply will not be available to many existing industrial facilities. As Richard Turrin, of AIG Europe (UK) Ltd, one of the providers of such insurance, puts it: 'You can't insure a car after it has crashed.' On the other hand, he points out, sites subject to a properly documented clean-up may become insurable again and, in another context, companies inviting contractors or consultants on to their sites may well want to ensure that these intruders are adequately covered for any environmental damage they do in the course of their work. Caught in this pincer movement of tightening regulation and narrowing insurance cover, risk managers are developing more sophisticated packages of measures to handle environmental risks. Nick Chipman, managing director of Sedgwick Environmental Services in London, believes that EIL policies are too limited to be of much use to many clients. He hopes to see more 'customer-friendly' insurance products emerge from discussions with interested insurers. At the same time, he is keen to encourage clients to get their own operations into a condition that will make them more insurable. Some companies, he says, publicise corporate environmental policies without doing enough to implement them. He also sees a complacency in countries such as the UK where 'sudden and accidental' pollution cover can still be obtained free under public liability policies. Mr Chipman argues that buying specialist environmental policies can increase the inherent value of a business by acting as a kind of certificate of assurance on its commitment to good environmental management. Beyond that, Mr Chipman recommends that all clients at risk dig out their old liability policies, often written on an 'occurrence' basis (ie with cover remaining open indefinitely for incidents occurring during the period of the policy), which he sees as an asset against which potential liabilities can be offset. Where there is no insurance to rely upon, he points to a range of alternative risk financing mechanisms, which allow companies to put money aside on a regular basis towards possible future liabilities. The key, he says, is to have an integrated approach to all the options available. Editor of the newsletter, Financial Times Environmental Liability Report</p>

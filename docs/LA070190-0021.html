			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE DISILLUSIONMENT OVER POLITICIANS' ANTICS  </P> <P> After reading about Sen. Dennis DeConcini's battle against the National Rifle  Assn. ("Not Outgunned Yet," June 20), I found myself wondering how many times  is it possible to be disillusioned about the way the American government works.  </P> <P> I had hoped there were still politicians who lobbied or voted for a bill  because they believed it was a good issue or important to their constituents.  Instead, it seems the main factor is whether someone will vote for your bills  if you've voted for one of theirs or gone to enough social events with them.  </P> <P> DeConcini wasn't sure what he could do for Sen. John Warner that would persuade  him to vote for his bill and seemed happily surprised that despite the fact  that there was "nothing there" (how about a very necessary piece of  legislation?), Sen. Lloyd Bentsen stood by him thanks to his "guts."  </P> <P> Is Washington nothing but millionaire personalities back-scratching each other?  </P> <P> NORMA EDWARDS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

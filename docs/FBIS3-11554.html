Explaining the recent confrontations in Chapare between coca  producers and antidrug forces to the Senate Antinarcotic  Struggle Committee, the minister flatly maintained that actions  by the Mobile Police Units for Rural Areas (Umopar) in the  tropical region seek to control traffickers, not coca producers.    Quiroga stated that the actions in Chapare will continue  despite opposition by coca producers.    Regarding demands by coca producers leaders to sit down and  talk with the government, Quiroga said he agreed to suspend the  forced eradication of coca because "at this time no leader is  under arrest."    "Wherever we find a maceration pit or a cocaine laboratory  we  will destroy it," he said.    He indicated that the government is awaiting a call from the  Bolivian Labor Federation, which is mediating in the  negotiations, to proceed with a meeting between the coca  producers and government that is scheduled for today.    He stated that the government wants to reach agreement with  the producers, without implying any loss for the campesinos, and  wants to stop the supply of precursors to the traffickers.    He noted that the results of the fight against trafficking  is  reflected in the price paid for a drum of coca leaf: On 1  February 1994 a drum cost 270 bolivianos, today it costs just 90  bolivianos.</p>

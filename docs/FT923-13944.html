			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Grundig turns in DM19m loss as demand weakens GRUNDIG, Germany's leading home electronics group, lost DM19m (Dollars 13m) in the year to March 1992 because of continuing weak demand for television sets, video recorders and radios. Announcing the fall into loss, after a DM190m net profit in 1990-1991, Pieter Harmsen, chairman, warned yesterday that sales and production of home entertainment products would fall further in the current year. Last year, sales were DM4.24bn, down from DM4.55bn in 1990-1991. Overall sales were badly hit by a 9 per cent fall in the home entertainment division, which contributed DM3.76bn of the total. Sales in the industrial electronics division fell from DM161m to DM154m, while the office equipment business picked up from DM97m to DM110m. Grundig, which is managed by a team from minority shareholder Philips of the Netherlands, is currently looking for partners prepared to join strategic alliances in technology and other projects. Meanwhile, it is busy rationalising its existing operations, and earlier this week announced that it is to cut its workforce by 3,000 over the next 18 months. The video recorder business is being merged with that of Philips, and production currently carried out in Grundig's Nuremberg plant is to be switched to its Dutch partner's works in Vienna. The companies are also collaborating closely on development and manufacture of cordless telephones. Hit by cheap imports, slack demand in a saturated and depressed domestic market, and rising wage costs, Grundig - like many other German companies - is attempting to stay competitive by transferring production overseas. Around 40 per cent of its 21,000 workforce is employed in low-cost countries such as Portugal and Malaysia. Bauknecht, the former Philips domestic appliance subsidiary, now controlled by Whirlpool of the US, yesterday forecast a 5 per cent sales increase during 1992, after a similar rise last year to DM1.2bn. Profits fell in 1991 from DM12.8m to DM8.5m, a company official said.</p>

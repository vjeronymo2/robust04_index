			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Having Revolutionary Outlook on the Leader Is Firm </F> Guarantee for Cherishing Loyalty as One's Faith and Obligation"  -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Since the revolutionary  cause is the cause of the leader, the revolutionaries can remain  unfailingly loyal to the leader and struggle undauntedly on the  revolutionary road only when they have an unshakable  revolutionary outlook on the leader, stresses NODONG SINMUN in a  signed article today.    The article says:    The revolutionary outlook on the leader is the foundation on  which the revolutionaries cherish loyalty to the leader as their  revolutionary faith and the ideological and moral basis on which  they regard loyalty as their revolutionary sense of obligation.    Revolutionary faith is a noble ideological sentiments  combining faith in the justness of the revolutionary cause led  by the leader and the inevitability of its victory and a firm  determination and will to fight it out for the victory of the  revolution.    Only when loyalty is cherished as the revolutionary faith  can  it be true loyalty without pretence or inconstancy.    The revolutionary outlook on the leader is the most correct  view and outlook on the position and role of the leader in the  revolutionary struggle, an attitude and stand of holding the  leader in high esteem with sincerity.    When the revolutionaries deeply grasp from theoretical and  practical points of view that the leader holds an absolute  position and plays a decisive role in the revolutionary struggle  and the development of history, they can revere the leader  unconditionally and devote their all to the leader and the  revolutionary cause led by him, cherishing loyalty as their  faith.    Only when the loyalty to the leader is cherished as a  revolutionary faith and, at the same time, as moral obligation,  can it remain true and long.    For the revolutionaries, the leader is a tender-hearted  teacher and father who gives the most precious political  integrity to them, brings them up and looks after them with deep  loving care and trust and leads them along the revolutionary  road. Accordingly, the relationship between the leader and his  revolutionary soldiers is not that between right and duty,  between domination and obedience, but that between loving care  and obligation to repay it.    Every one must grasp the truth that the leader is the centre  of socio-political organism and feel grateful to the leader's  loving care and trust in practical life. Only then, can he or  she deem loyalty to the leader as the rule of conduct and  mission of a revolutionary, not mere sense of duty, and remain  faithful to the leader to the last.    The Korean people are filled with a singlehearted desire to  firmly believe only in the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and  follow his leadership with loyalty no matter which way the wind  may blow and how many times the world may change, the article  declares.</p>

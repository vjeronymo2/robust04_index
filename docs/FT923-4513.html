			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / House prices fall by 0.7 percent HOUSE PRICES fell last month according to figures published yesterday by Halifax, the country's largest building society, Andrew Taylor writes. The society said prices fell on average by 0.7 per cent last month compared with July, when there was a 0.4 per cent fall. 'There are still no signsof any recovery in the housing market,' Halifax said. 'If interest rates remain at around current levels thereis little likelihood of house prices recovering before next year.' The society warned that any rise in the market would be muted next year unless the national economy started to recover. Halifax said that prices in real terms, after allowing for seasonal variations, fell only 0.3 per cent last month. Nonetheless prices had been 5.4 per cent lower than in August last year. The society's figures also showed a sharp fall last month in the price of new homes which were 1.1 per cent lower than in July. That followed increases of 0.8 per cent and 1.1 per cent in the previous two months. The latest round of reductions may reflect the renewed concern of builders to generate sales in a difficult market although Halifax warned against reading too much into a single month's figures.</p>

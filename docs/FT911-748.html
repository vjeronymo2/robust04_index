			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Box contains a sanguine idea High-tech weaponry stole the limelight in the recent Gulf war, but a glorified cardboard box also played its part. It was used to transport frozen blood for the US Air Force without the need for mechanical refrigeration or the need for dry ice (which gives off carbon dioxide as it evaporates). The re-usable container stored the blood at below -40 deg C for 48 hours - important because blood has to be thawed according to specific guidelines, and if allowed to warm to above -40 deg C can easily spoil. The cardboard box is lined with polyurethane foam and the packs of blood - chilled to -80 deg C - are wedged between canisters containing a mixture of frozen ethylene glycol and water. Developers of the containers, Battelle, of Columbus, Ohio, and Insulated Shipping Containers, of Phoenix, believe they could be used in future to transport organs, medicine, or even food.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "Regional News </F> Hookup" program]    [Text] At the first Tibet regional forum on intellectuals  work on the afternnon of 27 April, Guo Jinlong, deputy secretary  of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, pointed out  that, in the new situation, party committees and governments at  all levels should further improve intellectuals work and bring  their role into full play.    The forum will sum up the work of Tibet's intellectuals in  the preceding period, exchange experience in intellectuals'  work, discuss the building of an intellectual work force in  Tibet, and define the future tasks of Tibet's intellectuals  work. Guo Jinlong said: Social practice and Tibet's natural  environment have endowed Tibet's intellectuals with a special  ability to combat, work hard, be patient, and dedicate  themselves. Over the years, Tibet's intellectuals, undaunted by  hardships and not seeking personal fame and interests, have  quietly dedicated their youth and talents to Tibet's socialist  construction and reform and opening up. They have made  indelible historical contributions to Tibet's economic  development and development and progress in science.    Guo Jinlong pointed out: The 14th CPC National Congress set  accelerating scientific and technological progress, forcefully  developing education, and bringing intellectuals' role into full  play as one of the 10 major tasks that will decide China's  socialist modernization work in the 1990's. This fully  indicates that the party attaches great importance to  intellectuals work. The work of the party's intellectuals is a  regular and long-term task. Leading cadres at all levels and  comrades engaging in intellectual work should have an in-depth  understanding of the party's policy toward intellectuals; adhere  to the party's basic appraisal of and basic policy toward  intellectuals; and faithfully carry out the party's policy that  intellectuals should be treated equally politically, be made use  of freely, and that the party should show concern for  intellectuals' daily life.    We should list the work on intellectuals as an important  agendum of party committees and governments at various levels,  and truly trust and rely on the broad masses of intellectuals.  It is necessary to continually explore new ways and methods of  handling Tibet's intellectual work under new circumstances. We  should resolve one or two specific problems for intellectuals  annually in an effort to create conditions and an environment in  which talented people will show themselves.    Deputy Secretary Guo Jinlong stressed: Party committees and  governments at various levels should pay attention to, respect,  show concern for, and cherish talented people. We should  intensify the development of and the education about  intellectuals in accordance with the policy of making them more  revolutionary, younger in their average age, better educated,  and professionally more competent. We should boldly promote  outstanding intellectuals who are politically reliable and  professionally competent and who possess a certain level of  organizational management skills, and place them in appropriate  leading or management positions. Furthermore, we should  continually improve the special technical and vocational  employment system, strengthen the assessment of special  technicians, and create a competitive mechanism that is  stimulating and progressive. In addition, we should strengthen  the building of a professional work force, expand undertakings  for selecting and appointing personnel, and cultivate a good  social practice across the whole society under which knowledge  and talented people are respected so that Tibet's contingent of  professionals will develop more healthily.    Also speaking at the meeting were (Lu Huiming), member of  the  autonomous regional party committee Standing Committee and  organization department director, and (Cideng Pingcuo), deputy  director of the autonomous regional party committee's  organization department.</p>

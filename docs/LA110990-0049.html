			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW INCHES UP 2.97, ENDING TWO-DAY SLIDE  </P> <P> After a jittery day of Mideast war rumors and worries over a huge Treasury bond  auction, stocks eked out small gains Thursday, ending a two-day losing streak.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials edged up 2.97 to 2,443.81 after falling  44.31 points Wednesday. In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered  declines in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with  834 up, 654 down and 510 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume came to 155.57 million shares, up from 149.13 million  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Continued hopes for a new wave of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve  lured some buyers, as did a decent reception for the 30-year Treasury bond  auction -- which underscored the hopes for lower rates. A late rally in the  rumor-roiled oil market failed to rout stock traders.  </P> <P> But concern over the economy and the Mideast crisis continued to weigh on the  market, while the repeated delay of a news conference by President Bush further  ate into confidence.  </P> <P> "There were concerns about and rumors of a war in the Mideast," said Kenneth  Spence, technical analyst at Salomon Bros.  </P> <P> Shortly before the close, defense officials denied a rumor that a U.S. plane  had been shot down in the Persian Gulf region. However, Bush, who finally spoke  to reporters after the close of trading, said more troops would be sent to the  Middle East to ensure the nation's offensive capability.  </P> <P> Among the market highlights:  </P> <P> * NCR jumped 5 7/8 to 53 7/8 on speculation that it and AT&amp;T may be  exploring the possibility of merging their computer businesses. AT&amp;T fell  1/2 to 33 1/8, but other tech stocks were buoyed, including IBM, up 1 to 107  1/2, and Compaq, up 1 3/8 to 47 3/4.  </P> <P> * SmithKline Beecham tumbled 4 1/2 to 53 3/8 after it reported third-quarter  results. Analysts said investors were disappointed with the 4% growth in sales.  Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. removed its recommendation from the stock.  </P> <P> * Two waste-disposal companies that fell sharply during the past two days  rebounded. Browning-Ferris rose 5/8 to 22 3/8 and Waste Management gained 3/4  to 32 1/4. The stocks had been hammered on a weak Browning earnings report.  </P> <P> * Shearson Lehman downgraded ratings and cut estimates on Alcoa and Reynolds  Metals. Alcoa dropped 1 1/4 to 50 1/2 and Reynolds fell 2 1/4 to 49.  </P> <P> * Cisco Systems rose 3 7/8 to 33 7/8 after the computer networking firm  reported better-than-expected earnings.  </P> <P> * Among Southland stocks, good earnings reports lifted Vons supermarkets 1/4 to  18 1/4 and Jacobs Engineering 1/4 to 21. But computer maker Teradata slumped  3/4 to 7 1/4 after announcing new cutbacks to deal with falling orders.  Elsewhere, Telecredit gained 1 1/2 to 36 1/2 on word that it is renegotiating  merger terms with Equifax. Western Digital lost 5/8 to 4 5/8, but there was no  news.  </P> <P> Tokyo stocks were knocked down in volatile trading on expectations of war in  the Mideast after bellicose comments by British Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher. The key 225-share Nikkei index closed down 530.44, or 2.3%, to  22,969.81. The decline continued today, as the Nikkei fell another 346.23 by  midday.  </P> <P> Share prices closed lower on London's Stock Exchange, as investors found little  inspiration from Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major's autumn statement on  public spending. The Financial Times 100-share index closed down 23 points, or  1.1%, at 2,036.2.  </P> <P> German share prices recovered to close only slightly below the previous close,  after dropping sharply in early trading. The DAX index rose 1.71 points to  1,369.44.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT: Auction a Success, but Bond Prices Dip  </P> <P> Government bond prices slipped slightly despite a successful conclusion to the  Treasury's quarterly refunding auction. Observers blamed the slump on President  Bush's harsher words about the Persian Gulf stalemate.  </P> <P> The price of the government's bellwether 30-year bond fell 3/16 point, or about  $1.88 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield advanced to 8.7% from 8.69% late  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The $10.75 billion in new 30-year bonds sold yielded an average 8.71%, down  from 8.87% at the last auction Aug. 9. James Marshall, a bond trader with  Clayton Brown &amp; Associates, said the yield was "pretty much as advertised,"  indicating demand for the bonds was adequate.  </P> <P> Wednesday, the government sold 10-year notes at an average yield of 8.52%.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded  at 7.625%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY: Dollar Up Sharply Against Yen, Mark  </P> <P> The dollar ended sharply higher against most other major currencies as worries  about war in the Persian Gulf shook the market.  </P> <P> "Rumors were flying around about conflict in the Gulf. The unrest does nothing  but help support the dollar," said Jack Griffin, a dealer at Banque Indosuez.  </P> <P> In New York, the dollar finished at 130.35 Japanese yen, against Wednesday's  128.73. The dollar rose to 1.493 German marks, up from 1.487.  </P> <P> The Japanese yen suffers most from concerns about war, Griffin said, because  Japan is seen as being most vulnerable to a cutoff of oil.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES: Growth in Soybean Crop Shocks Traders  </P> <P> Analysts predicted a sharp drop in soybean futures prices after the government  shocked the experts Thursday with an unprecedented 4.4% increase in its 1990  U.S. soybean crop estimate.  </P> <P> "It's a killer," said analyst Doug Jackson of Farmers Commodities Corp. in Des  Moines, Iowa. He said soybean prices probably would open 10 cents a bushel  lower Friday in reaction to the report. The November contract closed at $5.83 a  bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  </P> <P> The new soybean estimate represented the largest October-to-November increase  ever in the USDA's harvest projections.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil settled  50 cents to $1.28 higher in a late rally sparked by rumors of imminent U.S.  action in the Gulf. The December contract gained 22 cents to $35.53 a barrel.  </P> <P> In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze joined a growing number  of world leaders in proclaiming military force may be necessary to oust Iraq  from Kuwait.  </P> <P> On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled 70 cents to $1 higher,  with November at $387.30 an ounce; silver was 0.9 cent to 1 cent lower, with  December at $4.27 an ounce.  </P></p>

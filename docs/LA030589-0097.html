			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD, A BIOGRAPHICAL NOVEL BY RUTHANNE  LUM MCCUNN (BEACON PRESS, BOSTON: $8.95)  </P> <P> Ruthanne Lum McCunn has woven an enthralling work of fiction from the true life  story of Lalu Nathoy (known later as Polly Bemis), a Chinese pioneer who  settled the American Northwest.  </P> <P> Lalu was her father's favorite, his qianjin, or "thousand pieces of gold." But,  after his crop of winter wheat fails because of drought in 1871, he sells the  teen-age Lalu to a band of raiding bandits for two sacks of soybeans.  </P> <P> The bandit chief subsequently sells her to a brothel in Shanghai for 30,000 in  taels. "Normally, I would not be able to buy a scrawny, dark-skinned girl with  feet like dragon boats," the madam tells Lalu, "but today I have a special  buyer who does not care about such things, someone who will take you to  America."  </P> <P> Traveling from San Francisco to Portland, Lalu is then brought by mule to the  mining community of Warrens: Hong King, an aging Chinese saloon-keeper, has  bought her to draw business, and renames her Polly.  </P> <P> Later the white saloon-keeper next door, Charlie Bemis ("no one dares mess with  him, he can keep a tin can dancing in the air with his six-shooter"), becomes  her protector and eventually wins her from Hong King in a poker game -- and  gives her her freedom.  </P></p>

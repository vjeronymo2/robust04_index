			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Beirut, Damascus, Washington, AL-HAYAH -- U.S.  officials have shown some satisfaction with Lebanese  developments particularly after the main parties concerned  assured President Clinton's administration that they wished to  avoid military escalation after the Israeli blows to Hizballah  and the latter's retaliation. Officials have not ruled out the  possibility of a lightning tour of the region, especially Syria  and Israel, by Secretary of State Warren Christopher after the  NATO meetings in Istanbul next week. [passage omitted]    Lebanese Ambassador Dr. Riyad Tabbarah met last Friday with  Robert Pelletreau, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near  Eastern Affairs and his deputy Dan Kirtzer [as published]. It  has been learned from informed sources that the U.S. side told  the Lebanese side that "New York is not the right place" to  discuss the escalation of violence and "the Israeli war" against  Hizballah, an indication that Washington was not prepared to  support Beirut's complaint against Israel at the Security  Council. It repeated that the appropriate place was "the  negotiating table." [passage omitted]    Sources have described the contacts between Ambassador  Tabbarah and Pelletreau and Kirtzer as being "a frank dialogue"  particularly in connection with the negative U.S. position on  Hizballah, portraying it as a threat not only to Israel but also  to Lebanon, and as a tool in Iran's hand. [passage omitted]    Yesterday Damascus denied the existence of an agreement with  Israel providing for the cessation of national and Islamic  resistance operations against the Israeli occupation in southern  Lebanon or that "it made a deal behind the backs of the  Lebanese."    Informed Syrian sources have told AL-HAYAH that "Syria has  not agreed with the Israelis to stop the firing of Katyushas on  northern Israel, and denied the existence of any deal under  which the resistance would only fire Katyushas on the occupied  strip." They emphasized that Syria "has made no agreements  behind the back of the Islamic resistance or the Lebanese  Government, and it cannot possibly become the protector of  Israeli security," but they pointed out that "the resistance  does not shell Galilee unless the Israelis attack civilians, as  happened last July."    In Beirut, Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi held  consultations with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad on the  political dimensions of the Israeli aggression launched by the  Israeli Air Force last Thursday on a Hizballah base in the area  of 'Ayn Kawkab in the Ba'labakk hills. AL-HAYAH has learned  that the unannounced contacts between the two presidents took  place last Friday evening and included a general assessment of  the situation in Lebanon and the region in the light of the  frozen peace negotiations and the need for cooperation to  consolidate the internal situation in the face of Israeli  aggression and not to allow its results to be used as a way of  undermining national unity. The Lebanese-Syrian contacts  occurred as Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati was on  an unscheduled visit to Damascus, prompted by the latest  developments in Lebanon.    As regards reactions to the Israeli raid, the position taken  by the state in embracing the resistance and declaring a day of  general mourning for the victims of the aggression to stress  internal solidarity and control of the situation and prevent any  negative effects, was welcomed by most Islamic and Christian  spiritual authorities, and Hizballah was also responsive to it.    AL-HAYAH has learned that Hizballah's leadership showed  appreciation of the delicate situation and did not break the  official and political consensus. In fact, it has been eager to  reaffirm its willingness to draw a distinction between its  position regarding the Israeli raid and response to all the  efforts aimed at keeping the situation under control.    It is noteworthy that, from the first moment of the  aggression targeting it, Hizballah's leadership acted  responsibly and overlooked its tense relations with the  government and its opposition to the government's policy, as  though it was seeking a new truce on the grounds that the  priorities at this stage dictated that it should not open old  files because it felt that that would undermine efforts to close  ranks in the face of Israeli threats in the absence of any  international stand and, particularly, of any U.S. stand that  would deter Israel. This was emphasized by Hizballah's deputies  at the meeting of the executive and legislative committees of  the Higher Islamic Shiite Council chaired by its chairman,  Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams al-Din.    The party's leadership has even responded to the efforts  made  by Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri from his home in  Musaylih-al-Nabatiyah, and it quickly tackled the problems which  occurred between its fighters and some members of the Fijian UN  contingent in the south, and also stopped firing Katyushas to  spare the south further hot eruptions.

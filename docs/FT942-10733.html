			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Congress to call for wide extension of regulation - Risk and Reward If the US Congress needed another excuse to interfere in the derivatives business, then it will get it next week. The General Accounting Office is due to add its own report to the growing mound of reviews of the derivatives markets and it will be the most damning yet. The GAO - Congress's investigative arm - seems set to call for a sweeping extension of regulation. Companies using derivatives and unregulated dealers involved in the markets should be brought under the remit of the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a draft of the report shown to some interest groups in the financial industry. Its tone is 'unremittingly negative,' said one person who has seen it. The industry has been bracing itself for some time for an adverse report but may be surprised by its stridency. If US legislators wanted to interfere in the derivatives industry, they have been given plenty of ammunition in recent months. Trading losses by some banks and hedge funds, and the recent revelation that some big companies have taken hits on instruments supposedly bought for hedging, are taken by critics as a clear sign that the financial system is going off the rails. The industry, and some policy makers, are against hasty legislation. On Friday, Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said risk management systems for derivatives have stood up 'reasonably well' during this year's upheaval in financial markets. More evidence is needed before any conclusions can be drawn about how well the damage-control systems coped with the market turmoil, he said. Meanwhile, there is already considerable momentum for a quick response. The House Banking Committee, for one, seems close to publishing a compromise bill that will impose tighter controls on the derivatives activities of banks. The committee is hoping to codify guidelines already being worked on by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees federally chartered banks in the US. The agency stepped up its own assault at the end of May, when Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said he was considering imposing limits on the risks banks could take on through their proprietary trading activities. The GAO report seems set to provoke legislators whose remit extends beyond the banking industry into action. 'It's an invitation to Dingell and Markey to get involved,' says one industry figure - a reference to the House Energy and Commerce Committee chaired by John Dingell and its sub-committee on telecommunications and finance chaired by Edward Markey. It was Mr Markey who prompted the GAO review, in June 1992. Now, he is set to mark its publication with hearings which could prompt a legislative initiative from his committee. Tomorrow, the sub-committee will take evidence from Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of J. P. Morgan, and two former top regulators - Gerald Corrigan and Richard Breeden, former heads of the New York Fed and the SEC respectively. The sound of Washington's wheels grinding into motion does not mean legislation is imminent. Even if the House Banking Committee gets a bill out in the coming weeks, there is no telling whether or not it will get to the floor of the House. Also, Mr Markey and Mr Dingell have yet to show their hand, not to mention the Senate Banking Committee. However, the pressure is certainly mounting on the derivatives industry to make a better case for its activities, and to come up with new disclosure and other initiatives of its own to meet the concerns.</p>

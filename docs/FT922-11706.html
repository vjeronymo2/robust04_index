			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Appointments: Rhodes resigns from BET Phillip Rhodes, a director of BET since 1989, resigned yesterday from the business services group. He had been in charge of strategic planning until a year ago, when institutions installed American John Clark as the new chief executive in a management overhaul designed to counter the company's dismal performance. On his arrival, Clark, who had been chief executive of San Francisco-based Core-Mark International, put a Core-Mark colleague, Keith Payne, in charge of strategic planning. Rhodes, 45, who was still in his office yesterday, refused to comment on the reasons for or timing of his resignation, or to say whether he had found alternative employment. For the past year he has been in charge of environmental, catering and contract services. Before joining BET, he had worked for Guinness.</p>

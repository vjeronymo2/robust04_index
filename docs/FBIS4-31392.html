			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National </F> Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary, by Lajos Pogonyi; place  and date not given: "I Hope That There Will Be a Coalition! --  MSZOSZ Chairman Sandor Nagy Says"]    [Text] I have grown used to the fact that the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is very short-tempered with  me. I more or less have an idea on the reason for this. I have  mentioned it a number of times that I see Gyula Horn as suitable  for the post of prime minister. Bekesi would be needed in the  government, Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National Federation of  Trade Unions in Hungary [MSZOSZ] and second person on the  national list of the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party], said in  his interview with NEPSZABADSAG.    [Pogonyi] What is your view on the fact that, at a  Democratic Charter event, Gyorgy Konrad mentioned Bekesi as an  acceptable politician to lead a coalition government?    [Nagy] Obviously, everyone has his own view on who the prime  minister should be. In my view, who the MSZP nominates to head  the government is an internal matter.    [Pogonyi] Whom would you like to see as prime minister?    [Nagy] I have said it many times that, considering all  factors, I see Gyula Horn as the suitable person for this  position.    [Pogonyi] What are your views on the opinion of certain  political analysts who believe that the MSZP should make heroic  gestures when the coalition is being formed because the  Socialists have won more than their true share [tulnyertek  magukat]?    [Nagy] I do not know why the MSZP should make such gestures.  In my view, the Socialists have simply won the confidence of the  electors at a level that is indicated by the number of their  mandates in the new Parliament. We must only start from this.  I do not see why we should start from any other reason that is  unknown to me. In fact, I believe that this election result  actually provides an opportunity for the MSZP to form a  government on a broader basis, not only considering a single  party.    [Pogonyi] Ivan Vitanyi, chairman of the MSZP's national  committee, told the "168 Ora" that he considered your latest  statement in which you had saucily said that if the SZDSZ is not  willing then there will be another partner to be very bad.    [Nagy] I have not said anything like this.    [Pogonyi] Perhaps in one of the "NAP-Kelte" programs last  week....    [Nagy] My words might have been misunderstood. I said that  I considered a more than 50 percent mandate for the MSZP  desirable because the issue of the coalition would not be  decided on the basis of a constraint, the issue would not depend  on whether another party wishes to form a coalition. This way,  we can also address others.    [Pogonyi] It seems that a number of people might have  misunderstood what you said....    [Nagy] It is possible.    [Pogonyi] The other day, Bekesi confirmed that he would not  accept a ministerial role if the MSZP is forced to form a  government on its own.    [Nagy] I find this statement unfortunate. Bekesi would be  very much needed in the government. If he rejects this because  of the aforementioned circumstances then this is definitely a  loss.    [Pogonyi] When did you last meet each other?    [Nagy] I can remember two important discussions in the past  six to eight weeks. During one of them we only spoke about  economic issues with the IMF's representative in Hungary. On  the other occasion, I had asked to meet Bekesi before an  election debate. This time, we reviewed the area of balance  problems, foreign and domestic financial processes, and budget  and asset issues. More precisely, I asked him to help Europe  become familiar with some macroeconomic facts and  interconnections.    [Pogonyi] According to many people, you are the MSZP's  bogey-man for the SZDSZ.    [Nagy] I have already grown to the fact that the SZDSZ is  very short-tempered with me. I more or less know the reason,  too.    [Pogonyi] Tell me!    [Nagy] I would not like to embark on a long story.  Presumably, the point is that I am not one of those who always  and under all circumstances accepts everything the Free  Democrats say. Namely that they know everything best. In my  view, other parties also have capable people, experts, and  honest politicians. I do not believe that a party has the right  to attribute the ability always to fulfill the best roles solely  to itself. I always express this view and I believe that this  is one of the reasons I am not popular with them.    [Pogonyi] Would you be able to support a liberal economic  policy?    [Nagy] I can support the economic policy that is in the  MSZP's program. This is pragmatic, has many liberal elements,  and one can also find the values of a social democratic party in  it. We have lined up in support of this economic policy and not  in support of something else.    [Pogonyi] Horn recently said that, according to some  economic observers, the MSZP's economic policy might have more  liberal elements than that of the SZDSZ. What is your view on  this?    [Nagy] I think that we would need to clarify the terms. I  do not know how Horn meant this remark, it was presumably part  of a longer sentence. The MSZP's economic policy is a factual  and pragmatic package that does not lack sensitivity toward  social problems.    [Pogonyi] Finally: Will there be a coalition?    [Nagy] The decision is not up to me. However, believe me, I  most sincerely hope that there will be.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Washington seeks tougher line on mergers overseas US anti-trust enforcement agencies have issued new international guidelines asserting their right to act against a broad range of anti-competitive mergers or corporate behaviour overseas. The guidelines were issued jointly by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission for a 60-day comment period and replace rules issued in 1988, under President Ronald Reagan, which shielded most foreign companies and joint ventures between US and foreign companies from US anti-trust enforcement, unless they affected US consumers. In the draft, the Clinton administration confirms a 1992 policy reversal under which action may be taken against foreign anti-competitive behaviour that affects US exporters as well as consumers. The Justice Department earlier this year launched its first case under the new policy against Pilkington, the UK glass company, and anti-trust lawyers say the department is investigating allegations of pressure applied to buyers by the Japanese plate glass industry. This investigation could bolster the US trade representative's efforts to get Japan to open up its glass market, but could also provoke an international battle over the extension of US jurisdiction beyond its borders. The guidelines also 'take a broader view of anti-trust jurisdiction involving imports than the 1988 guidelines', the Justice Department said. Reflecting a 1993 Supreme Court decision in a case between Hartford Fire Insurance and California, the guidelines say that the US may act against a foreign cartel that colludes to raise prices, if the cartel members make substantial sales to the US. US efforts to assert its anti-trust jurisdiction overseas caused considerable friction in the 1970s. Countries such as Canada, France and the UK even passed laws prohibiting companies from supplying documents to the US in retaliation for US action against a uranium cartel. The guidelines say that there may be less conflict between US and foreign anti-trust interests as 'more countries adopt anti-trust or competition laws that are compatible with those of the US'. In pursuing a foreign cartel, they say, the Justice Department and the FTC 'would ordinarily notify the anti-trust authority in the cartel's home country.' 'If that authority were in a better position to address the competitive problem, and were prepared to take effective action to address the adverse effects on US commerce, the agencies would consider working co-operatively with the foreign authority or staying their own remedy pending enforcement efforts by the foreign country,' according to the guidelines. The guidelines say the Justice Department and FTC will follow the principle of comity, under which countries respect one another's legal acts, but insist that the administration's determination on the application of comity cannot be challenged in the courts.</p>

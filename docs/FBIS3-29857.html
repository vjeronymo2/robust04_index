			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Health and Welfare Minister  Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP),  said Tuesday [22 February] he is opposed to a cabinet reshuffle  aimed at dumping Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.    A cabinet reshuffle specifically designed to remove certain  cabinet ministers would shake the foundation of Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet, Ouchi told a news conference.    He was alluding to the campaign by Hosokawa, Shinseito  co-leader Ichiro Ozawa and others in the ruling coalition to get  rid of Takemura, the government's top spokesman.    The premier and the others have differed with Takemura over  Hosokawa's plan to introduce a so-called "national welfare tax"  to replace the consumption tax, the future of Japanese politics  and other key issues, political sources say.    The Social Democratic Party, the largest force in the  seven-party coalition government, has also expressed  reservations about an early reshuffling of the cabinet, which  Hosokawa and his backers say may come later this month.</p>

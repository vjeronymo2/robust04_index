			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> First Executive Corp. Sued: Two shareholders filed suit against First Executive  Corp. seeking to stop the Los Angeles-based insurance company's previously  announced stock rights offering, contending that it is an anti-takeover device.  Separately, ICH Corp., a Louisville, Ky.-based insurance holding company that  may sell its 20% stake in First Executive, said it exchanged rights issued to  it by First Executive for warrants to purchase additional common stock. ICH,  barred from a hostile takeover of First Executive, is expected to sell the  warrants, one analyst said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The people of (Katango) Ward, in the city of Luena,  the capital of Moxico Province, are mourning their dead.  Reliable sources have reported that Riot Police forces invaded  that ward last night and carried out a real massacre. A total  of 13 (?people) who were attending a funeral were executed in  cold blood. That source also reports that a number of other  people were wounded.    The attackers tried to disguise [words indistinct] as though  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola armed  forces had been responsible for the incident. The Armed Forces  for the Liberation of Angola Military Command for the Eastern  Front has already denied responsibility.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / EU and US look eastward together The US and the European Union agreed in Berlin yesterday to set up a new working group to co-ordinate their approaches towards the integration of the countries of central and eastern Europe into western security and economic institutions. Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, said it would 'give a more practical and operational content to relations between the US and the EU, without creating a new bureaucracy'. President Bill Clinton said the group would 'put some meat on the bones of our declarations. . . We believe our best partner for the 21st century as we look for prosperity and peace is a Europe united', Mr Clinton added. Another working group will address co-operation on organised crime, drug trafficking and money laundering. European officials said that lines of communication between the US and the European Union had often proved inadequate. In addition, a European official said, the US-EU dialogue had tended to be more direct when the European presidency was held by one of the larger member countries. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose country currently holds the Union presidency, said the new procedures would be set up by the next US-EU summit, when France would have taken over the presidency. President Clinton enjoyed some statesmanlike moments during his visit to Berlin yesterday. Standing in the shadow of the Brandenburg Gate, where the Berlin Wall once divided East from West, he shuffled into the shoes of President John F Kennedy. 'Nichts wird uns aufhalten. Alles ist moglich. Berlin ist frei,' Mr Clinton proclaimed. 'Nothing can stop us. Everything is possible. Berlin is free.' In a gesture that self-consciously echoed Mr Kennedy's last-minute addition of the famous 'Ich bin ein Berliner' phrase to his speech 31 years ago, Mr Clinton wrote the words into the text by hand on his way to the Brandenburg Gate. Mr Clinton's sally into German - his sixth foreign language in a week-long trip - achieved a higher level of grammar than his boyhood hero, whose addition of 'ein' changed him from a Berliner to a jelly doughnut. But it failed to pierce Berlin's relative indifference to his visit. 'Er ist kein Kennedy,' retorted an unimpressed Berlin taxi driver. 'He is no Kennedy.' While Mr Kennedy and, later, President Ronald Reagan brought a promise of support in difficult times, the only concrete promise that Mr Clinton could bring was more modest: the construction of a new American embassy in Berlin. This was scarcely a surprise. In fact, a plaque on Pariserplatz, just to Mr Clinton's right, already marks the spot where the embassy is to be built, close to the remains of the pre-war British embassy. Perhaps of more significance, Mr Clinton promised that US backing for Germany would not end with the demolition of the Wall. 'America stands on your side, now and for ever,' replied Mr Clinton, venturing once again into German.</p>

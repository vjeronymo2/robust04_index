			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Japan angered by US sanctions threat Japanese officials yesterday reacted with dismay to the US decision to start a process which could lead to sanctions, as trade friction upset foreign exchange markets and led to a sharp fall in the value of the dollar against the yen. The US and Canada, meanwhile, stepped back from a trade war over wheat. Their negotiators agreed last night that Canada would limit wheat exports to the US for a year while a commission looks into the grain trade. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, recognised that if Washington did impose sanctions against Japan, the dollar could be hurt. 'Sometimes you get an emotional impact that's temporary, but underlying economic fundamentals take hold,' Mr Bentsen said. Mr Kozo Igarashi, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, yesterday criticised the US move as contrary to the spirit of dialogue which should be at the basis of bilateral negotiations. 'The US action contradicts the US-Japan framework talks which calls for addressing bilateral disputes through dialogue,' Mr Igarashi said. While Japan was still prepared to negotiate and would make strenuous efforts to reach an agreement, in the event that sanctions are announced 'we have no intention of continuing negotiations under threat of sanctions', he emphasised. The dollar fell more than Y1 1/2 in Tokyo yesterday to a low of Y98.38 before recovering to Y98.85 in London and to Y99.445 in New York. Early today, it opened in Tokyo at Y99.325. Until recently, a strong yen has been seen by markets as a possible means of reducing Japan's bilateral trade surplus, and the dollar had weakened in response to the belief that the US administration would not support it. However, Mr Bentsen's comments yesterday underlined more recent signs that the administration is not prepared to let the dollar slip further. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minister, was hopeful yesterday that the two countries would resolve their dispute over public procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications before a US-imposed September 30 deadline for announcing sanctions. 'The talks have not completely broken down, so we must persevere with the negotiations,' Mr Murayama said. The Japanese stance reflects a widespread feeling in Tokyo that an agreement is possible. Officials are also aware that the US has rarely imposed sanctions under its trade laws. The stumbling block is over US insistence on language promising 'significant progress' in opening Japanese markets. Japan unmoved, Page 5 Editorial Comment, Page 15 Lex, Page 16</p>

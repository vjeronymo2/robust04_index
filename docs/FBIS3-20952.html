In 1992 the French aeronautics manufacturer recorded a net  loss of 2380 billion francs. Gallois estimated that "balance  should be achieved in 1995 at the latest." The turnover figure  for 1993 should be five percent lower and reach about 49.3  billion francs, plus or minus one hundred million francs,  compared to 51.9 in 1992.    According to the Aerospatiale president, the group hit  "bottom" in 1993, "even if recovery cannot be expected for 1994;  the situation will not improve before 1996-97. In 1993, the  markets were awful for the civilian sector (planes,  helicopters), stable for the military sector, and rather good in  the space sector."    Gallois reaffirmed that the anticipated privatization of the  group will not take place in 1994 nor in 1995, but he still did  not rule out minority shareholding in the enterprise's capital  during that period. The French groups Matra and Alcatel have  already expressed interest in Aerospatiale, and so has DASA  (Germany), an already very large partner in the French group.    Total orders (planes, helicopters, and military and civilian  space) have dropped--to 29 billion francs in 1993 compared to 39  billion in 1992--"despite increases in military orders for  export, and in space orders." At the end of the year, orders  amounted to 130 billion francs, representing two and a half  years of activity according to Gallois.    Concerning orders for planes with over 100 seats, 1993 was a  "blank year" and this was also true for competitors Boeing and  McDonnell Douglas: "cancellations slightly exceeded orders."  Gallois did not give specific figures for order cancellations at  Airbus for last year. However, indications from aeronautics  sources are that these amounted to 59, compared to 38 orders.  But the number of firm orders is uncertain since some aircraft  sold in Indonesia are excluded, as are Cathay Pacific and Air  Canada planes, orders for which were announced in December.  Referring indirectly to Mirage sales in Taiwan, Gallois noted  "the emergence" of Boeing on the Chinese market against Airbus  "whose activity there is in slow-motion."    ATR (the Alenia-Aerospatiale consortium) recorded 31 firm  orders in 1994. In this field of regional aircraft, Gallois  confirmed that there are discussions with other manufacturers,  Fokker, Dornier, BAE, CASA, Saab, but also Embraer (Brazil), or  De Havilland (Canada), and he mentioned that several Asian  countries are definitely interested in the construction of  planes of this type. According to him, the ATR-82 (which will  likely be an 80-passenger turbo-prop) could be the key to this  future field.    In the military field, Mr Gallois found that 1993 showed  "export recovery" and was a particularly "good year for  missiles." Lastly, Eurocopter, the joint subsidiary of DASA and  Aerospatiale, felt the collapse of the civilian market but still  managed to increase its market share. In 1993, orders for mass  produced helicopters totaled more than in 1992. Eurocopter  regained its 20 percent share of the world military market,  which it had abandoned since the Gulf War, thanks to the Turkish  and Netherlands contracts announced at the end of the year.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures traded in a tight range as dealers waited for the outcome of discussions at yesterday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Confirmation of a rise in US interest rates came well after the market close, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,155 and languished in the first hour. The lower than expected PSBR figure cheered the market, sending the contract ahead to reach a peak of 3,169. However, a combination of profit-taking together with concerns that the FMOC would raise interest rates saw the contract give up the early gains. Following a bout of sideways trading over the lunchtime period, September again moved forward, this time encouraged by the firm opening on Wall Street. But the worries on interest rates remained, which brought another setback and September finished just ahead of the day's low at 3,153, a point ahead of its previous close and at a 5-point premium to cash. Volume at 6,766 lots remained low. Traded options stayed dull and total turnover was 22,268 lots. Two big trades in Hanson puts were the only outstanding feature in the stock options. They were said to have been carried out by Kleinwort Benson and Monument. Hanson volume was 3,481, making it the busiest stock option.</p>

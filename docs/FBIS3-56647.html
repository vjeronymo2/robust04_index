			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Correspondent Vladimir  Perfilyev] The press is starting to say that this chamber [the  Federation Council] may become tame and end up in the  president's pocket. Are you not apprehensive about that  possibility?    [Valeryan Viktorov, Federation Council deputy chairman] Oh  no, I am not apprehensive. You must have noticed that we have  very independently-minded people sitting in this hall, and I  believe it would be difficult to put them in someone's pocket.  For instance, the head of our chamber is Vladimir Filippovich  Shumeyko, who is also a very independent person. He will not  blindly follow instructions, be it from the president or from  the head of our government, but on the other hand I am  absolutely convinced that he will not enter into unnecessary  confrontation between the president and the government.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Russian minister warns on debt interest payment The minister in charge of debt negotiations with Russia's sovereign and commercial creditors said yesterday he believed he would conclude deals with the Paris and London Clubs. However, interest repayments on the Dollars 80bn-plus debt could be no more than Dollars 4bn this year. Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy premier for the economy, said Russia had asked for a delay in meeting the Paris Club in order to work out 'a new draft on repayments' for the present year. The talks are due to begin in Paris on June 2, and Mr Shokhin said 'we would like to solve the issue before the (Group of Seven) Naples summit' in July. His optimism stems from the agreement in March between the Russian government and the International Monetary Fund on the second tranche of a Dollars 3bn loan - a move which has increased international confidence in the government's policies. However, the Dollars 4bn which Mr Shokhin said would be the limit the budget could stand represents only a fraction of the total debt service obligations for the present year. According to the US investment bank J P Morgan, Russia owes around Dollars 21bn this year, of which Dollars 6.7bn is interest and Dollars 14.6bn is principal. Mr Shokhin's forecast came amid further dire warnings about Russia's economic plight. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, who resigned yesterday as a deputy premier, said the government would not survive a continued crisis on non-payment of wages. Mr Arkady Volsky, head of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, said the civic accord on political behaviour signed recently by most parties and associations would be valueless without a turn upwards in the economy. Production in the first quarter had fallen by a third in Moscow alone compared with a year ago. Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of the Russia's Choice party and former first deputy premier, said in Izvestiya that Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party, was a 'great threat' to Russia's fragile democracy. In the same newspaper, Mr Boris Fyodorov, head of the December 12 party and former deputy premier for finance, said 'the very statehood of Russia is under deadly threat'.</p>

Jonan Denki Co., a  Tokyo-based electric appliance discount store chain, put some 12  tons of domestically grown rice on sale at its store in Nishi  Eifuku and sold out all of it in three hours.    The Food Agency repeatedly warned the firm to call off the  rice sale, saying that doing so without a government license is  a violation of the Food Control Law.    A queue began forming Saturday midnight and more than 2,000  people lined up over a kilometer before the store opened at 10  A.M. While selling the rice despite the agency's warning,  Toshio Miyaji, president of Jonan Denki, told customers through  a loudspeaker, "we must break the bad law."    The customers, mostly housewives, were attracted to the rice  because it was from Akita Prefecture, northern Japan, one of the  nation's leading rice producing regions, and because it was sold  at a discount price of 3,000 yen per five-kilogram package.    Jonan Denki limited purchases to one bag per customer.    The government has imported foreign rice to make up for  shortages from last year's poor rice harvest, but since  February, consumers have queued up at shops selling domestically  grown rice, despite higher prices.    A senior Food Agency official said earlier the agency will  take "proper action" if Jonan Denki failed to comply with its  order not to sell the rice. But no agency officials showed up  at the store Sunday to block the sales.    The discount store said it procured 29 tons of rice from the  village of Ogata in Akita Prefecture and plans to sell remaining  rice at another store in Tokyo in the near future.</p>

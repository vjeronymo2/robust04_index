			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Management: Why partnerships can pall - Adrian Michaels finds companies sceptical about the value of collaborating After decades as a minority practice pioneered by the likes of Marks &amp; Spencer and International Business Machines, 'supply-chain partnerships' between companies and their customer organisations are becoming commonplace. About 40 per cent of companies in a new survey* already had customer or supplier partnerships, and more than 90 per cent thought they were relevant to them. The study, by AT Kearney, a management consultancy, in collaboration with the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, appears to reinforce a picture created by many academics and even some consultants: that harmony and companionship in supply chains and shared product development are today's route to competitive advantage. But most of the respondents to the survey are sceptical, and on several counts. The researchers found no clear indication that companies in partnerships acted significantly differently from those acting alone. One pharmaceutical manufacturer in the survey said: 'They've got to give us a lower price . . . That's the only reason we're doing it. It's not that we want to be in partnership, we want to get the cost down.' An appliance manufacturer observed: 'Getting your suppliers to share your market risk is just a clever way of reducing your capital expenditure.', while another judged: 'There is no such thing as a really nice customer.' Partnerships in this sense seem more akin to those formed by Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach in spaghetti westerns - sleep with one eye open, or preferably both. The researchers found it was not easy for organisations to work together in harmony on a long-term basis. The study showed that partnerships suffer from an atmosphere of suspicion, based on previous relationships where contracts have frequently been broken. The result is an overwhelming reluctance to share vital financial information. More than 50 per cent of respondents 'strongly disagreed' that they exchanged detailed cost information with customers in the supply chain. Especially infuriating to some companies in the consumer goods industry were attempts by retailers to charge them for demand forecasts or sales data: 'If customers are saying 'We want partnership', how can they charge for a forecast . . . to actually make the business work between you?' Although the exercise of power is clearly a sore point in partnerships, examples cited by AT Kearney from other research show that there are gains to be made for both sides from partnerships. According to the consultancy, Motorola says it has worked closely with suppliers in design and manufacturing to reduce material costs by 6 per cent, while Fiat claims to have cut delivery cycle times. The report cites the case of a manufacturer and retailer doubling sales of consumer products in five years, almost eliminating inventory and cutting supply-chain costs by 25 per cent. On the other side of the relationship, a supplier of fastenings to, among others, IBM claims substantial business gains from forging much closer partnerships with its customers and offering much-improved field service. One fundamental problem with partnerships is the lack of perceived shared interests, according to Steve Young, an AT Kearney executive. Suppliers are not usually exclusive, and may therefore be reluctant to share information. Nor does either side tend to encourage exclusive relationships - the more powerful wishes to avoid obligation, the less powerful is wary of dependence. The answer, Young says, is 'earn trust, don't ask for it'. *Partnership or Power Play? AT Kearney, Stockley House, 130 Wilton Road, London SW1V 1LQ</p>

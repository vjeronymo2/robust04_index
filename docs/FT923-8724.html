			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / People: Dare creams off the top job at MMB One of the Milk Marketing Board's more vocal critics is to take over as its chief executive to prepare the 60-year old milk monopoly for privatisation in the next two years. As a former president of the Dairy Trade Federation, which represents dairies and producers, and with nearly 20 years at Unigate, 50-year-old Andrew Dare has been well immersed in the milk business. A farmer's son, he became managing director of St Ivel in 1979, joined the main Unigate board in 1988 and became head of its British food interests. Apparently disappointed at not securing the top job at Unigate, he resigned in March of last year shortly after the new boss Ross Buckland arrived from Kellogg's. Dare then set up his own consultancy; by the end of the year MMB was a principal client. 'They wanted to change fundamentally and I suppose they thought a critic had more to offer,' he says of his appointment as special adviser to the board. 'Later they suggested I had better come and implement my proposals.' His aim is the creation of 'a totally free market in milk'. Dairy Crest, a subsidiary of the Milk Marketing Board, will be floated on the stock exchange 'in roughly two years' time'. Meanwhile the board itself will be replaced by a single voluntary co-operative - 'a market-oriented and slick organisation' which Dare says should be a viable competitor to the giant continental European dairy co-operatives. Charles Runge, MMB boss until the end of last year, resigned shortly before Dare arrived as a consultant. Finance director George Wright was promoted into his position, and retires at the end of this month aged 60. But Dare's move does nothing to quiet the critics who have seen the MMB and DTF as an established, cosy cartel whose differences were not as great as they were sometimes made to seem. Dare now has to prove he is not replacing a statutory monopoly with a voluntary monopoly - the very danger he warned incessantly of from his seat at the DTF. ***** KEMBREY, the Slough-based electrical components manufacturer beset by boardroom rows last year, has parted with its finance director Philip MacDermott, who is leaving after two years at the company. Chief executive Michael Cleary says he had worked with MacDermott, who is now 46, at Allders Department Stores, when they were respectively finance director and financial controller there in the early 1980s. 'After the hiatus at Kembrey,' during which Cleary was ousted in a boardroom coup, but then clambered back into the chief executive seat at the beginning of this year, 'we decided we wanted to restructure, which means an increased emphasis on financial control. The day-to-day nuts and bolts of financial control are not (MacDermott's) strong suit, and we both agreed he would be better seeking his career elsewhere.' His replacement, Justin Whitehorn, 43, was finance director of a private company, British Hartford Fairmont, which is involved in refractory materials, one of Kembrey's key businesses. ***** Howard MacDonald (above right), who resigned as chief executive of County NatWest in April 1991, has resurfaced in the City. He has been made an adviser to The Phoenix Development Capital Fund, a new venture capital operation. MacDonald, who made his name in the oil industry with Shell, is one of three non-executive directors of the new fund's advisory board. Sir Eric Parker, chief executive of Trafalgar House, and Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director of W H Smith, have also been appointed to the advisory board. Phoenix Development Capital is managed by Phoenix Fund Managers and has already committed Pounds 7m in four investments which range from VCH, Germany's second largest scientific publisher, to the recently privatised Medway Ports. It has raised Pounds 35.5m from investors and hopes to raise another Pounds 40m by the autumn. Mitsubishi Corporation, one of Japan's biggest companies, has a substantial stake in the fund and has a representative, H Nonomiya, on its advisory board. Michael Lay of the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board is also an adviser. ***** Allan Alpin, of MARSTON, THOMPSON &amp; EVERSHED who was promoted from head brewer to production director and became a non-executive director on his retirement in 1991, died on July 31. ***** Brian Brooks is appointed director of human resources and senior vice-president of WPP, and will be based in New York; he joins from Towers Perrin where he specialised in career development and compensation. ***** Terry Best is appointed finance director of TRAVIS PERKINS on the retirement of John Wilson. ***** Brian Thompson has been appointed executive chairman of the DOMINICK HUNTER GROUP in succession to Robin Hodgson who remains on the board as a non-executive. ***** Marie Bukowski has been appointed medical director of Duphar Laboratories, the pharmaceutical division of SOLVAY, in the UK. She was formerly director of medical operations at Boehringer Ingelhiem.</p>

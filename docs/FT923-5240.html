			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Baiting the Beeb IT IS WELL known that broadcasters spend an above average portion of their time honing their skills in malicious gossip. Once a year, they do this in public at the Edinburgh Television Festival, which has just ended. The prime time slot in this year's event was occupied by Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, who attacked the BBC for its 'political appeasement' of the government in pursuit of a new charter based upon continued funding by the television licence fee. He went on to brand the management style of the corporation as 'pseudo-Leninist'. It was probably this remark which inspired Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the BBC board of governors, to dismiss Mr Grade as a 'Bourbon in red braces'. It was left to one of Mr Hussey's fellow governors to acknowledge that much is wrong with the BBC, not least its system of governance, where there is a serious confusion between regulatory and management functions. This is an inauspicious beginning to the BBC charter debate, which is to be officially inaugurated shortly by a government green paper. Lenin versus King Louis is hardly a billing for the turn of the 20th century. The weakness of Mr Grade's position is that he denies the need for change in an era of multi-channel television. Logically, he must be even more committed than current BBC management to the licence fee and hence to the corporation's longstanding supplicant relationship with government. It it not possible to identify with similar clarity the weakness of Mr Hussey's position, since in six years of office, he has failed to enunciate one. The BBC, after a laborious exercise in self-examination, has declined to set out an official view about its own future before the green paper. This may be in some circumstances be judged tactically shrewd, but its prime cause is the fact that the BBC has for the past 15 months had a cautious director-general, Sir Michael Checkland, and a director-general designate, Mr John Birt, who thinks the BBC should be moving upmarket and who takes a more robustly interventionist view about the role of senior management. The predictable result has been confusion. Since the choice of director-general is easily the most important direct task of the governors, it may well be asked in the light of this botched indecision what this oddest of public sector boards is capable of doing well. It all underscores the case for moving towards a single regulatory body for British broadcasting, taking in ITV, the BBC and the largely unregulated satellite broadcasters too. That at least was a point well made in Edinburgh.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Time runs out for BES deals WOULD-BE tax-shelterers have reached the last chance saloon. Record sums have flowed into the business expansion scheme this year on the back of now-outlawed, loan-backed schemes; thus, the end of the tax year is quieter than usual. Total investment in the scheme so far this year is almost Pounds 900m, compared with around Pounds 370m during 1991-92. But there will still be many people who want to dive into a tax shelter at the last moment. All the big sponsors, plus the most important intermediaries such as the Allenbridge Group (071-409 1111) and BESt Investment (071-936 2037) will be open during the weekend for those who have left it late. Anthony Yadgaroff, of Allenbridge, estimates that the very last moment for investing will be 5.55 pm on Monday when it would still be possible to fax applications to a sponsor, or deliver them to a locally-designated solicitor. Deals over five years are now more generous than they were while loan-backs were on offer, and there is plenty of interest in schemes which underwrite a certain uplift and then allow the possibility of extra 'upside' if the residential housing market performs better than expected. But the best advice at the end of the tax year, as ever, is to play safe and, if in doubt, do nothing at all. It is still possible to invest another Pounds 40,000 by the end of December, and those who do not use up their BES allowance this year can carry back some relief from the next tax year. Enterprise zone trusts have operated over the past few years as a twin market to the BES. This year, however, they are more like poor cousins. Very little property is on the market, and this appears not to be selling quickly. EZ investment is as tax-efficient as the BES, with the added virtues that there is no maximum annual limit and tax relief is available on loans taken out to fund EZ investment. But the underlying investment, commercial property, is much less flexible because it, too, is afflicted by terrible market conditions. Ian Pugh, of Allenbridge, points out that the yields available on EZ trusts are running at around 7 per cent while commercial yields outside zones are around 10. Given that enterprise zones are unlikely to be in desirable areas, the premium paid for tax relief is hard to justify. So, for the moment, there is little case for a hasty EZ investment,</p>

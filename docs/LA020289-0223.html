			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COACH DENIES DRUG-TEST CHEATING  </P> <P> Canadian national weightlifting coach Andrzej Kulesza denied today that he  supplied urine to four Canadian weightlifters in a bid to cheat in drug tests  before last year's Seoul Olympics.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, former team member Jacques Demers told a federal inquiry into  drugs in amateur sport that he was told Kulesza and former assistant coach  Raphael Zuffellato had provided "clean" urine to athletes in danger of testing  positive for anabolic steroids.  </P> <P> "There are two sides of the story," said Kulesza, interviewed during a break in  inquiry proceedings today. "(Wednesday) was Jacques' story. When it's my  chance, I will tell my story."  </P> <P> The attempt to mask the fact that the athletes were taking steroids was  unsuccessful and the four were caught. Demers' testimony was admitted despite  objections by lawyers that it was based on hearsay.  </P> <P> Kulesza's lawyer, Joel Silcoff, who cross-examined Demers today, said his  client will appear before the inquiry next week and will deny Demers' charges.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban May 16 SAPA -- At least 13 people were  murdered in KwaZulu/Natal at the weekend, bringing to at least  425 the number killed since a state of emergency was declared in  the province at the end of March. The Human Rights Committee  said on Monday it had asked the government to lift the state of  emergency because violence had declined and there had been no  change in the number of detainees, 63. Spokesman Ms Linda  Mclean said violence last week was at its lowest ebb since June.  She said more than 1,000 people had been murdered in the first  four months of the year, an average of 55 a week. [passage  omitted] Besides the 13 murders, police reported the suicide of  a policeman at Umlazi, south of Durban, and the discovery of a  decomposed body at KwaMakutha on the south coast.</p>

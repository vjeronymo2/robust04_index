			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / World Commodities Prices: London silver market bounces - Market Report SILVER prices bounced yesterday, moving past the technical target of 530 US cents an ounce for spot metal. But the market floundered as it approached its recent highs above 540 cents and closed at 532.50 cents a lb, up 7 cents on the day. At the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex), however, the March futures price sustained an early fall to 522 cents an ounce before rallying in late trading to 528 cents, down 6.7 cents on the day. The New York silver market has been very volatile of late, with the March position registering a 23-cent swing on Wednesday. 'Silver is fairly thin on Comex and just a few people can move the market,' a London dealer explained. The London GOLD price moved up cautiously early on but with physical interest scarce the gain was pared back to 90 cents at Dollars 392.30 an ounce. 'It is swamped by the paper side. Physical demand may indicate support areas but it cannot give the market a significant push,' one dealer said. At the London Commodity Exchange the COCOA futures market steadied in the afternoon after sustaining sharp losses before lunch. The May quotation closed Pounds 15 down at Pounds 908 a tonne after reaching Pounds 899 at one time. Traders read little into the move, saying the market was still holding its recent wide range. 'Until we break Pounds 900 or Pounds 948, then it's not a break into new territory,' one commented. London Metal Exchange contracts were generally lower, the exception being LEAD, which saw the three months position reach Dollars 524 a tonne before running into resistance. At the close it was quoted at Dollars 520.75 a tonne, up Dollars 10.25 on the day. ZINC ended easier but underlying support towards Dollars 1,020 a tonne stemmed the fall.

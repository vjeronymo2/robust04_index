			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Hard choices for defence THE STRUGGLE between the Ministry of Defence and the Treasury over the size of the British defence budget has become one of the predictable issues in this autumn's public expenditure round. Whatever the short-term outcome of this struggle, the absence of any prospect of war, and the pressure of Britain's public spending problems combine to ensure that the defence budget is bound to seem a tempting source of savings. Under current plans the UK will spend around 3 per cent of gross domestic product on defence in the late 1990s. This is less than the 5.3 per cent of the mid-1980s, but more than most of Britain's European allies. But the right level cannot be determined simply by this criterion or by comparison with other public spending priorities. Britain has a relatively impressive military capability and a military record of which it can be proud. But it must now adapt to new circumstances. Armed services have to plan, no longer against a known enemy, but against the unpredictable. Nobody knows what or where the next 'threat' will be, its size or direction, or its order of battle. This means the government has more difficult choices than before about the kinds of forces it needs to provide, and where. National security Clamorous warnings about the damage further cuts would cause are largely unhelpful. The House of Commons defence committee has warned that military capabilities could fall below the minimum level necessary for national security and that, already, the navy could not protect the nation's sea-lanes. But there is no conceivable direct outside threat to the UK that would not involve its allies, and few tasks it would want to take on overseas on its own. What is needed is a clear foreign policy framework within which Britain's defence commitments can be set. The Ministry of Defence, in its last white paper in July, laid out 50 distinct tasks which the armed forces carried out. The message it wanted to send to the Treasury was, first of all, that the military often fulfils two or more tasks for the price of one and, second, that there is no room for further cuts unless the government is ready to drop some defence commitments. The argument was disingenuous. In many cases, such as Britain's contribution to Nato reaction forces, the actual requirement in terms of men and equipment is not subject to any fixed measure. It is as much as you want to make it. More selective Although the forces have undergone substantial cuts and reorganisation under the 1990 Options for Change review, there has been no sacrifice in the range of military capabilities provided. The challenge for military planners is that they will have to more selective. While it may be possible to absorb some short-term financial cuts through improved efficiency and cheeseparing, there are hard choices that must be faced. If Britain wants to keep its Royal Marines, for instance, there is little point unless it provides the ships and helicopters they need. But that might have to be at the cost of anti-submarine frigates. Modern attack helicopters might be regarded as a higher priority for the army than tanks. But reducing Britain's armoured presence in Germany could call into question its leadership of Nato's new rapid-reaction corps. With defence budgets being squeezed throughout the Nato region, the trend must be towards a sharing of responsibilities between European allies. In so far as this makes European defence efforts more effective, it could help to encourage a con-tinued US commitment to the alliance. In the very short term, the room for manoeuvre is limited. On new equipment projects due for service in the next few years, much of the money has already been spent or committed. The armed forces also have some justification in asking for a breathing space after the upheaval of the reductions which followed Options for Change. But it is not too early for the government to provide a sense of direction, putting defence in the context of a shared European discussion rather than a narrow domestic public expenditure argument.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Diplomatic sources in Beijing reported on 2 May that  North Korea recently drastically strengthened vigilance at the  border area with China to prevent North Korean people from  escaping, and that it instructed the military and police that if  escapees are discovered, they are to be immediately shot to  death.    The North Korean authorities moved the agents of the  (?Security Department) and Ministry of Public Security, who were  serving in the rear, toward the border area of North Hamgyong  Province and Chagang Province. They are intensely watching over  the moves of the residents and soldiers. It was learned that  because of such vigilance, the number of North Koreans escaping  to China has decreased drastically.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Wren Group compulsorily wound up WREN GROUP, of Sutton, Surrey, was compulsorily wound up in the High Court yesterday on a petition by the provisional liquidators of Payroll Services, a group subsidiary that is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. The unopposed petition was based on an inter-company loan of Pounds 20m between Payroll Services and Wren Group and was supported by the Inland Revenue, which is a creditor for Pounds 710,000. The SFO is investigating how Payroll Services, which serves more than 500 banks and financial institutions around London, allegedly diverted more than Pounds 24m PAYE and National Insurance payments from the Inland Revenue. Touche Ross, the accountancy firm acting as provisional liquidator to Payroll Services, says the SFO is also investigating the Wren Group and the directors of the companies. The Inland Revenue has extended an informal moratorium on the payment of the missing taxes. However, it has told clients of Payroll Services that they will have to make a second payment if the missing funds are not recovered.</p>

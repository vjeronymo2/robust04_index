[Darawshah] A heated debate is taking place on the Israeli  political map and among the Arab community in Israel regarding  the necessary arrangements to guarantee protection for the  Palestinians and prevent the settlers' aggressive acts against  the sons of our Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza  Strip. The reality is that although the Israeli Government has  facilitated the entry of a Palestinian police force and  international forces consisting of Norwegian police, these  arrangements do not seem to be enough, because the population of  Palestinians in the occupied areas exceeds 2 million, all of  whom need protection. They need protection from the armed  extremist settlers, who have been equipped with arms by the  Israeli Government. They receive the full support of the  Israeli Government. The Palestinian people in the occupied  areas also need international protection from the Israeli Army  and the other security organs, particularly the musta'ribin  units [Israeli agents who disguise themselves as Arabs], who  fool the Palestinians.    While we welcome the recent agreement, I am not confident  that these arrangements will provide real protection for the  Palestinians in the occupied territories. While there is  settlement and occupation, the problem will remain. The fears  of massacres similar to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in  Hebron and other such acts will remain. The dangers of renewed  daily aggression against the Palestinian people will remain.    [Al-Jundi] But how do you read Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq  Rabin's recent statements that he is not ready to meet the  Palestinian demand to evacuate the settlers from the Palestinian  city of Hebron?    [Darawshah] This stance is not justified. Yitzhaq Rabin  fears the Israeli right. He is afraid of the demonstrations the  Israeli right might hold. The extremist and criminal settlers  are at the head of the Israeli right. This is why he tries to  appease them at the expense of the peace process, the  Palestinian people, and the Arab nation. Proceeding from this  perspective, we criticize Yitzhaq Rabin's stance and demand  practical action to prove that he has honest intentions toward  protecting the Palestinians and deterring the extremists, be  they settlers or Israeli forces, to prevent them from taking  action against the Palestinians and carrying out crimes of  terrorism against them. This is why Yitzhaq Rabin has been  talking a great deal about peace but he has implemented no real  practical steps that deter the extremist settlers and secure  protection for our defenseless Palestinian people in the  occupied Arab territories. [passage omitted]    [Al-Jundi] How will the Israeli people view the need to  implement the Gaza-Jericho Agreement quickly as a means to cool  down the heated struggle inside the occupied territories?    [Darawshah] There are two trends on the Israeli street. The  Israeli right does not want to implement this agreement and is  working to destroy it. It is also trying to prevent an Israeli  withdrawal from even one inch of the occupied Arab territories.  The left wants the agreement to be implemented immediately to  allow the PLO led by Yasir 'Arafat to enter Gaza and Jericho  first, implement the agreement, and prevent things from  worsening.    There is interest among the forces advocating peace inside  Israel in implementing this agreement. But the problem is that  the Israeli Government swings between the right and the left.  In particular, Yitzhaq Rabin swings back and forth, although he  heads a leftist government. He has not had the courage to take  practical steps to prove his credibility and readiness to  implement the agreement on 13 April. This is why discussions  concentrate on how to reach agreement on implementing the Oslo  Agreement by 13 April. I doubt withdrawal will take place by  the middle of next month. It could take much longer than that.  [passage omitted]</p>

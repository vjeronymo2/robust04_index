			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: MONEY, HONEY  </P> <P> With ticket sales in excess of $100 million, a sequel to Disney's "Honey, I  Shrunk the Kids" is a foregone conclusion. Not so definite: the direction in  which it'll be headed.  </P> <P> To cover its bases, Disney's registered these titles with the MPAA: "Honey, I  Can't Get the Kids Out of My Head," "Honey, I Turned the Kids Into Animals,"  "Honey, I Turned the Kids Into Giants," "Honey, I Faxed the Kids," "Honey, I  Turned the Kids Invisible," "Honey, I Sent the Kids to the Moon," "Honey, I  Xeroxed the Kids" and "Honey, I Ate the Kids."  </P> <P> Not registered: "Honey, I Exploited the Kids."

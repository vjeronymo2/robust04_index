			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, who is  visiting Beijing, says China's attitude towards political reform  in Hong Kong is much more relaxed than in the past. Senator  Evans, a strong supporter of Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's  plan to broaden democracy, was speaking after meeting Chinese  leaders. Eli Moore reports.    [Begin recording] [Moore] Senator Evans has been a target of  sharp criticisms from China over his very vocal support for  political reforms in Hong Kong -- reforms which China has vowed  to overturn when it takes over the territory in 1997. But  Gareth Evans says that in talks with Chinese leaders over the  past two days in Beijing the reaction was softer than it has  been in the past.    [Evans ] Sure, what I'd make here is that this attitude does  seem every much more relaxed and then of course until  comparatively recently on this issue.    [Moore] Senator Evans said Premier Li peng was at pain to  point out that preserving Hong Kong's status, especially its  capitalist system, was in China's own interest. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / New index measures smaller companies THE new FT-SE SmallCap index, which measures the share-price performance of 450 smaller UK companies, was calculated for the first time yesterday, as the main UK indices closed at record highs. The SmallCap index closed at 1377.88, up 14.09 points on the day. The FT-SE 100 index of the largest 100 companies by market capitalisation ended yesterday at 2861.5, up 15.0, a record closing high but a much smaller rise in percentage terms. The FT-SE Mid 250, which contains the next biggest 250 companies, finished at 2896.4 up 33.5, also a record. In percentage terms, the Mid 250 was the best performer, with a rise of 1.2 per cent. The SmallCap index contains all those companies in the FT-Actuaries All-Share index which are too small to qualify for the FT-SE 100 or the Mid 250. The SmallCap is calculated both with and without investment trusts. To make the SmallCap more representative, the All-Share was extended yesterday from 651 to 800 companies, with market capitalisations as low as Pounds 20m at the cut-off date in 1992. The All-Share also ended the day at a record close: 1373.20, up 0.7 per cent. The SmallCap index is published on the back page of the second section of the FT each day, starting today. The table on that page now includes the gross dividend yield and price/earnings ratio for the FT-SE 100, the Mid 250, the SmallCap and the FT-A All-Share. These two measures show the relative value placed by investors on the companies making up each index. The FT-SE 100 yesterday had a dividend yield of 4.25 per cent and a p/e of 19.3; the FT-SE Mid 250 yielded 4.38 per cent with a p/e of 19.2; and the SmallCap (excluding investment trusts) yielded 4.92 per cent with a p/e of 21.4. The most widely used benchmark for calculating these measures for the whole market is the 500 share index, the FT-Actuaries All-Share index excluding investment trusts and financial companies. The expansion of the All-Share means that this group now consists of more than 500 companies. For the time being, however, the name has been retained in inverted commas as the '500' share index. The '500' had a yield of 4.25 yesterday, with a p/e of 17.8.</p>

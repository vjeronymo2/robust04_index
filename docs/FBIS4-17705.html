			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 26, BNS -- Latvian Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs returned Tuesday [26 April] from the Dusseldorf  Dialogues forum, in which he delivered a report on the theme  "From singing revolution to market economy and democracy."    The forum was attended by the leading entrepreneurs and  politicians of the North Rhine-Westphalia Land, chiefly persons,  linked with Latvia by present and future business interests.    The participants of the forum reached a series of principal  agreements on technological cooperation to develop small and  medium size businesses, Birkavs briefed reporters at the Riga  airport.    The North-Rhine Westphalia's entrepreneurs already implement  around 30 joint projects with Latvians.    Birkavs received formal support for the setup of a  foundation  to repatriate Russian retired servicemen and rehabilitate the  environment of Skrunda, the site of the renowned Russian radar  facility in Latvia.    However, "there is no real money yet" because Germany favors  a temporizing policy regarding Latvian-Russian relations,  Birkavs said.    Birkavs achieved the extension of German government  sponsorship of the Latvians high school at Munster for one more  year. Germany planned earlier to suspend the subsidies.    During this one year, Latvia will draft a project on how to  convert the Munster school into its own education, culture and  science center in Germany.</p>

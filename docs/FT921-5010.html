			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Personal View: The wrong type of relief Extending tax relief for childcare must be a real temptation to the beleaguered chancellor. The logic seems obvious. A shortage of labour and skills is predicted, despite the recession. Many women with young children wish and/or need to engage in paid work, but have difficulty in obtaining good, affordable childcare. Childcare costs must be paid out of taxed income with the added affront that tax and national insurance must also be paid by the carer. Where enlightened employers provide childcare it is taxed as a benefit in kind in the hands of the employee, unless it falls within the restrictive conditions applying to workplace nursery relief. All considerations seem to point towards an extended relief. The politically correct view follows this 'logic'. Its proponents are vociferous and influential. A recent Gallup poll showed that 81 per cent of voters favour tax relief for childcare. Yet the logic is spurious and the concentration of effort on the case for tax relief a distraction from issues of low pay for women and inadequate public provision for children. Extension of the existing anomalous relief would produce further anomalies. Wherever the chancellor drew the line, he would be accused of being unfair. Confining relief to employer-provided or assisted care, administratively the most practical approach, would raise a clamour from the self-employed and those not receiving assistance from employers. Extension of relief to all childcare costs would be greeted by calls from other equally deserving carers, such as those caring for elderly parents. Unpaid mothers caring for their own children would also claim their due. What of the grounds for tax-deductible childcare? First, equity. A parent with responsibility for a child incurs a necessary expense on childcare, which must be paid before any profit is made from earnings. This expense should be deductible, it is argued, like other costs of earning. However, many essential expenditures are not deductible, travel and clothing being prime examples. This is not just some quirk of the tax system. The legislative requirement that deductible expenditure must be incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with work done contains claims in a practical way. Instead of a free-for-all, with each taxpayer claiming as much as he can get away with, we have a system of personal allowances that helps every taxpayer to meet this type of expenditure. A system without limits on deductibility of expenditures would benefit the extravagant more than the frugal; the wealthy more than the poor. Similarly, full tax deductibility for childcare would favour those using the most expensive type of carer, though more than two thirds of employed parents of pre-school children rely on relatives. Nannies would still be totally out of reach for many. For these reasons, any general childcare deduction would have to be capped. This would, in fact, be the first step to a standard deduction for all parents. At present, parents without earned income cannot use their non-transferable personal allowances, unless they have investments. On the other hand, the benefits of their unpaid labour are not taxed. The current system is, therefore, probably as fiscally neutral as possible. To introduce tax relief for childcare expenditure, without assistance for parents at home, would upset this balance. A much better way than a standard deduction for all parents is to increase child benefit, which has the added advantage of being of value to non-taxpayers. This solution makes no concession to those who argue that the tax system should provide a work incentive, but they are on sticky ground. If the demographic predictions are correct, fiscal incentives should be unnecessary. Employers will need women in the workforce and will have to pay them accordingly. Tax subsidies for childcare will only undermine market pressures. Assistance for women in the workforce would be far better directed at training and other specific areas of need, rather than being spread across all working mothers, many of whom would return to work in any event. Finally, there is the question of supply of childcare, which is the strongest argument for workplace nursery relief. But the history of this relief shows that supply issues cannot be kept separate from questions of equity. It is not possible to ring-fence a relief for employer-assisted childcare and expect this fence to hold up against the inevitable pressures from those excluded. If provision of childcare is the objective, there are more direct and less inequitable ways of achieving this. Extending tax relief for childcare could win Lamont short-term acclaim; temptation, indeed, just now. But if he believes he will be around to deal with the consequences, he should think hard before he goes any farther down this road.

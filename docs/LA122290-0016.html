			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGASSI SHOULD PRACTICE WHAT HE ADVERTISES  </P> <P> On several occasions last weekend, I observed a rather irritating ad on TV  showing many short scenes of Andre Agassi in different settings swinging his  racket as a manly man. At the end of the ad we were shown a black background  with three little words: Just do it.  </P> <P> Shouldn't that have read: Just don't do it.  </P> <P> MICHAEL HANNIN  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

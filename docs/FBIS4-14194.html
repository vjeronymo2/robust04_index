			<p>BFN     [Text] Judge Munir Hunayn, the investigator into the  assassination of Engineer Dani Sham'un and his family, this  afternoon questioned Dr. Samir Ja'ja' and checked his testimony  against those given by other people in custody. The judge also  listened to a number of witnesses, but the judicial sources who  reported this did not reveal any details.    Judge Hunayn and Judge Jozeph Furayhah, who is investigating  the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, this morning  received in their offices at the Justice Palace lawyers for a  number of detainees and petitions from their families. The  judges agreed to some of the requests.    According to the judicial sources, Chief Public Prosecutor  Judge Munif 'Uwaydat asked that the treatment of Dr. Ja'ja' be  improved. 'Uwaydat pointed out, however, that Dr. Ja'ja is not  being treated badly and that Justice Minister Bahij Tabbarah is  taking care of this.    The sources said that the cases referred to the Judiciary  Council are old files under investigation. Some of them are  being examined by investigating judges and are automatically  activated when new evidence appears. Other cases, including the  assassination of Deputy Tony Franjiyah and his family, require  the appointment of new investigating judges. The sources said  the case involving the bombing of Minister Elie Hubayqah's car  was dropped in accordance with the general amnesty.    Concerning the assassination of former Prime Minister Rashid  Karami, the judicial sources said the case was referred to  investigating Judge Walid Ghamrah and that there is nothing new.  On the file of former President Rene Mu'awwad, the sources said  that Judge Sa'id Mirza is the investigator into this file and  that investigations have been continuing for three years.    Regarding the file of Major General Michel 'Awn, which  includes his breach of state security and keeping state taxes  and fees for himself, the judicial sources said the general  amnesty law did not cover the financial part. They said that  Judge Labib Zuwayn left the case about a year ago and that the  security agencies are now appointing a judge to investigate this  file. The sources said there is no request to extradite Michel  'Awn because such a request cannot be made before an arrest  warrant is issued by the investigating judge. The case is  awaiting the appointment of an investigating judge and an  extradition request is not appropriate at present.    On the assassination of Colonel Khalil Kan'an, the sources  said that it is within the jurisdiction of the military court.  Concerning the assassination of Dr. Ilyas al-Zayik, Beirut  investigating Judge 'Abdallah Bitar today began questioning a  number of people being held in connection with the case. The  chief public prosecutor accused one of the detainees, Rafiq  Ghalib Sa'adah, and will do so with anyone else the  investigation may prove is an accomplice or perpetrator.    We have just received word that Beirut investigating Judge  'Abdallah Bitar questioned the accused Rafiq Ghalib Sa'adah and  issued a warrant for his arrest in connection with the murder of  Dr. Ilyas al-Zayik in al-Ashrafiyah in 1990. The judge sent a  judicial note to security authorities to conduct initial  investigations to identify all perpetrators and accomplices.</p>

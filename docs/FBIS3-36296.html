			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on LOGOTIP-KP news agency materials </F> under the "In the Newspapers of the Newly Independent States"  rubric: "Ukraine"]    [Text] Ukrainian nationalists from the UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian  National Assembly-Ukrainian Self-Defense] said that "on 12  January Ukrainian citizen Kravchuk met with U.S. citizen Clinton  at Borispol airport," as a result of which a crime was  committed, namely: "espionage, the disclosure of a state secret,  high treason." Upon the UNA-UNSO's coming to power in Ukraine,  Kravchuk will not just be held politically responsible for that,  but he will be prosecuted as a criminal. The UNA-UNSO leaders  also said that the Crimean elections were a result of a  conspiracy by the Jews, who have always dreamed about autonomy  in Crimea. In the nationalists' view, Israeli influence in  Crimea will increase. (RATUSHA) [as published]</p>

What impact will the new tax systems have on  foreign- invested enterprises and a new round of foreign  investments in China? With this question in mind, this reporter  has interviewed Li Lijun, head of the Fujian provincial taxation  bureau.  <H5>  Foreign Businessmen Will Not Suffer Losses </H5>   Li Lijun categorically told this reporter: The new tax  systems, which will be implemented as of 1 January, will affect  neither the interests of foreign-funded enterprises nor the  enthusiasm of foreign investors. On the contrary, they will  enable foreign-funded enterprises and foreign investors to get  better returns.    He said: The tax reform will place the taxes of domestic  enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises on an equal basis and  the same starting line. In this way, all enterprises will be  able to compete on an equal basis in the market economy. Prior  to this, the taxes of foreign-funded enterprises in China were  the industrial and commercial unified tax and the income tax of  foreign-invested enterprises and foreign enterprises; after the  tax reform, the industrial and commercial unified taxes will be  turned into value- added, business, and consumption taxes. They  will pay the same taxes as domestic enterprises now. Naturally,  the tax reform will have a certain impact on foreign  enterprises. If the original industrial and commercial unified  tax is lower than the new taxes, foreign enterprises will  certainly have to pay more if they should pay according to the  new taxes; conversely, there will be no effect on them. For  this reason, the state taxation department has also provided  that, while implementing the new tax systems, we can give a tax  refund. That is to say, foreign enterprises which have to pay  higher taxes according to the new tax systems than they formerly  did do are allowed to have a tax refund to ensure that their new  taxes equal the previous ones and to guarantee that they will  not suffer losses. With regard to those foreign enterprises  which pay higher taxes than the new ones, they should pay  according to the new tax systems.    Li Lijun said: To implement the new tax systems, the Fujian  taxation departments have conducted a lot of investigation and  study. They have also worked among foreign enterprises to  enable each of them to have a full understanding of the new tax  systems and thus remove their worries. Viewed from the present  conditions, all foreign enterprises understand the new tax  systems and take the initiative to cooperate with us so that the  tax reform has made smooth progress.  <H5>  The High Science and Technology Industry Tax Will Drop </H5>   Li also pointed out that the foreign enterprises mentioned  above refer to those approved before 1 January 1994. Those  approved after that date must pay according to the new tax  systems. These foreign enterprises will be treated equally  without discrimination like domestic enterprises. Therefore,  when investing in a project and carrying out a feasibility  study, foreign businessmen should take this factor into  consideration.    The Fujian provincial taxation departments have compared the  new tax burdens of foreign enterprises in Fujian with their  original tax level. The result is: In industry, the overall  tax level of the new tax systems is lower than that of the old  tax systems by 27.9 percent; in high science and technology  industry, it is also lower; in electronics, textile, garment,  furniture, cosmetics, drink, trade, transport and  communications, it has risen on the average. It can thus be seen  that if foreign businessmen invest in Fujian according to the  state industrial policy and rationally choose trades that yield  high investment returns, they can have great prospects, such as  investing in high-tech industry, infrastructure, and so on.    Li also stressed: Fujian Province still encourages foreign  businessmen to invest in real estate and other tertiary  industry. The land value-added tax in the new tax systems is  also applicable to foreign businessmen. But this is aimed at  restricting speculation in land transactions by foreign  businessmen; it will not have any impact on genuine property  developers.  <H5>  Taxation Organs Will Collect Taxes According to the Law </H5>   In Li's view, the new systems totally conform with the needs  of socialist market economy and respect international tax  practices. In so doing, China's market economy can enter and  converge with the international market at an early date.  Moreover, the new tax systems provide that, except for the  stipulated tax deductions and exemptions, taxation departments  must not reduce or exempt taxes without authorization. This  makes it possible for the taxation departments to impartially  collect taxes according to the law. Foreign enterprises can also  feel at ease because there is no need to worry about the  imposition of other taxes.    Li stressed: After the implementation of the new tax  systems, foreign enterprises still enjoy the preferential  treatment of tax exemptions in the first two years and tax  reductions in the next three. Therefore, their new tax burdens  will not increase in the wake of the tax reform. On the  contrary, because of investing in high and new technology and  the infrastructure, they will be able to enjoy more preferential  policies. He said: The implementation of the new tax systems  in 1994 will be more beneficial to foreign investments in Fujian.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Text] Amman--The U.S.-led naval task force patrolling the  Red Sea on Saturday [2 April] turned back an al-'Aqaba-bound  ship carrying animal feed for a Jordanian importer, shipping  agents said Sunday.    The Dolphins I was turned back amid the countdown to a  meeting this week in Washington where American officials are  expected to discuss a three month-old proposal to replace  sea-based inspections by the U.S.led force with onshore checks  by a neutral international agency.    His Majesty King Husayn said Monday that Jordan required a  statisfactory solution to the siege of al-'Aqabah in order to  continue playing a positive role in the peace process.    The increased international attention on the blockade of the  Red Sea port has also brought sharp focus on the very legality  of the inspections. Businessmen said that they had learnt that  the interception of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels was a self-assumed  task of the U.S. with no coordination with the U.N. Sanctions  Committee.    T. Gharghur and Fils, agents of Dolphins 1, said in a letter  to the minister of finance that the vessel, which was carrying  nearly 4,000 tonnes of soya bean meal--animal feed--was  intercepted at the Tiran Straits in the mouth of the Gulf of  Aqaba on Friday.    After two inspections of the St. Vincent-flagged ship,  inspectors aboard the U.S. frigate which intercepted the  Dolphins 1 ruled that they did not have accessibility to inspect  the lower holds where the Jordan-bound cargo was stowed and  therefore could not allow it to proceed to al-'Aqabah.    All the papers related to the consignment were in order and  were produced to the inspectors, including details of the  consignee, but the inspectors insisted that they should be able  to check the bagged cargo, said a spokesman for the agents.    The Dolphin 1, which was running out of fuel, could not stay  around in the straits and headed for Port Suez where the cargo  could be rearranged to satisfy the inspectors before returning  to the Tiran Straits, the agents said.    The process is expected to cost several thousand dollars to  the importer.    No official comment was immediately available. But the  interception was certain to fuel fears that the Kingdom's  repeated complaints over the negative impact of Red Sea  inspection methods on its economy have gone unheeded except for  repeated American promises that they would be looked into.    Meanwhile, Jordanians who met with a visiting U.N. Sanctions  Committee official last week said they understood that the  committee had nothing to do with the actual inspections and was  not kept informed of what is going on in the Red Sea.    "We were amazed to get the distinct impression that the  inspections are a self-assumed task of the U.S. and there was  little communication, let alone coordination, between the  enforcers of the sanctions and the committee," said one of those  who met with Jhiang Zhang Wan, secretary of the sanctions panel,  which includes representatives of all the 15 members of the  Security Council.    "We could not but reach a conclusion that the U.S. is mostly  trying unilaterally to cater to the desires of some of the Gulf  states by maintaining the sanctions on Iraq and also pressure on  Jordan," said the Jordanian, who declined to be identified  further.    The Jordanian government has filed several memos with the  Sanctions Committee raising this particular point, but no action  had been adopted, diplomats said.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said last week  that he was looking for ways to ease the impact the embargo  against Iraq is having on Jordan.    "We're certainly working on that," Mr. Christopher said.  "We'd like to find some way to ease the burden on Jordan of  these inspections... we recognise the pressure on Jordan and the  disadvantages to Jordan's economy."    The U.S. has always maintained that it has Security Council  authorisation to enforce the sanctions which the world body  imposed in August 1990 following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.  Legal experts have questioned this assertion, however.    'Ali al-Dumur, head of the Jordanian Jurists Association,  said: "Legally there is a grey area between what the U.S. claims  as the authorisation it has from the Security Council and the  actual modality of enforcing the sanctions."    "But in reality there is no such formal authorisation and  the  enforcement of the sanctions and the interception of  al-'Aqabah-bound vessels were adopted by the U.S. in its own  interpretation of how to monitor respect for the sanctions," Mr.  al-Dumur told the JORDAN TIMES.    Despite the argument, it is unlikely that any bid to  challenge the American assertion will be entertained in the  U.S.-dominated Security Council, observers say.    "But that does not mean that we should shut up and put up  with whatever way the U.S. wants to deal with us," said the  Jordanian who attended the meeting with the Sanctions Committee  official.    A European diplomat said: "Jordanian patience has to be  commended since (the Kingdom) put up with the status quo for  more than three years before deciding that enough was enough and  took a firm position."    "I think most of the Euroepan countries support the  Jordanian  stand although it is not yet clear what individual governments  would do to help the Kingdom," added the diplomat.    So far, only France, whose ships often participate in the  U.S.-led force patrolling the Red Sea, has publicly said that it  supported the Jordanian position and that an urgent solution to  the siege of al-'Aqabah had to be found.</p>

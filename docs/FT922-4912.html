			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Ilva deficit dashes hopes for flotation this year ILVA, the state-owned Italian group which is Europe's third-biggest steel producer, swung to a loss of L498bn (Dollars 410m) last year after net profits of L115bn in 1990 on the back of static sales of L10,608bn. The results are a blow for the group, which had hoped for a stock market flotation later this year. Italian bourse rules require a company to show three consecutive years of profits before listing their shares. Ilva, which had been profitable in 1989 and 1990, will now only be able to quote its shares through a merger with an already quoted company. As expected, the company allocated L411bn of capital gains made in 1991 into a special restructuring fund to help overcome continuing difficulties in the market this year. Like its European counterparts, Ilva has been hit by the sharp fall in prices for many steel products at a time of rising competition from manufacturers in eastern Europe and developing countries. The group, which took its present form in 1988, is controlled by the IRI state holding company and was created from the ashes of the ill-fated Finsinder steel group. Ilva managed to contain the fall in gross operating profits, which slipped by L194bn to L1,314bn, by saving around L290bn through cost reductions. However, the savings failed to compensate for a sharp fall in earnings caused principally by lower product prices. Ilva's results were also hit by L280bn in restructuring costs associated with the group's continuing redundancy programme, which saw the workforce cut by about 2,000 to 42,866. Meanwhile, investments at group level rose by around L200bn to over L1,300bn, while debt charges for the parent company level fell by L176bn to L514bn.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Yemelyanov under the rubric "Kalmykia": </F> "Adoption of the `Code of the Steppe' Instead of the  Constitution Did Not Shake the Republic, but It Did Rally the  Opposition"]    [Text] Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was the first leader of one of  the 16 autonomous entities within Russia to openly accommodate  Moscow, which seemed to many after his statement on 11 March to  be to the detriment of his own people's interest.    Yuli Oglayev, an associate professor of Kalmyk State  University and the leader of the opposition, called the  condition of society in the initial hours following  Ilyumzhinov's statement on cancellation of the republic  constitution one of shock: "Just as in all of Russia, our life  before 11 March was hard but peaceful. Kirsan blew up the  peace." The explosion resulted in the creation of a public  Committee in Defense of the Constitution, Citizenship, and Human  Rights, which representatives of 16 parties and movements  joined, and the convocation by them of the Extraordinary  Congress of the Nations of Kalmykia.    Communists, democrats, and nationalists united for the first  time in order to defend the republic Constitution, which each of  them viewed as serving their interests.    However, neither the congress nor the two rallies in front  of  the parliament building (on the first occasion 500 people  attended, on the second--about 1,500) interfered with Kirsan  Ilyumzhinov seeing the endeavor through to a victorious end. On  5 April the Constitutional Assembly of Kalmykia voted almost  unanimously in favor of the draft proposed by the president as  recently as three weeks ago. The Code of the Steppe replaced the  Constitution of the republic. Attempting to prove the  illegitimacy of what had happened, representatives of the  opposition gave examples of ways in which citizens had ended up  as delegates to the Constitutional Assembly. They had gotten  there in an undemocratic manner, by directives from on high. At  present the public committee intends to contest the outcome of  the voting which was favorable to the president in the  Constitutional Court of Russia.    In Ilyumzhinov's words, introduction of the draft pursued  several objectives: to determine the level of ethnic  self-awareness, to figure out the groups held together by  "anti-Kirsan sentiment," to find out the attitude of other  republics toward anyone that "goes back" to Moscow and the  response of Moscow itself to such, and finally, to verify how  his own entourage "takes a punch." As the president stated, "my  suppositions were borne out 100 percent." In the opinion of the  president, the level of self-awareness turned out to be quite  high. He believes that state and party officials have formed the  previously quite languid opposition together with new leaders  from among the professors and representatives of the Ayrat  National Party. "Weaklings" were revealed among his  confederates: Kirsan's former best friend, the editor of  IZVESTIYA KALMYKII, Koneyev, came out with a protest against the  Code of the Steppe (he was forced to quit of his own accord).  They also replaced the leader of the republic TV and radio who,  in the opinion of the president, was not on the ball. The poet  David Kugultinov, whose outrage was promptly transmitted on  ITAR-TASS channels, calmed down after a talk with Kirsan, and  spoke with inspiration in defense of the presidential draft at  the Constitutional Assembly. In the process, some people in the  audience had to wipe away tears.    The official response of Moscow is not quite clear at this  point. The republics have responded to the Kalmyk demarche in a  very guarded manner, especially Tatarstan and Chechnya.    In the assessment of both independent analysts and those  from  the opposition, the Code of the Steppe perceptibly reinforces  the power of the president, which is far from weak to begin  with, and ordains much closer legal and economic integration  within the framework of Russia than was previously the case.    Responding to a question about when Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, to  whom the right to schedule the convocation of the Khural is  delegated under the new main law, will do so, the president  responded: "I have set a time for myself, but we will still  consult the parliament." Members of the parliament for whom the  Khural means the end of their activity in political life will  possibly try to delay this time. However, Kirsan Nikolayevich  intends to insist on as early as the beginning of next year.    For all most extensive powers of the president, the Khural  in  particular remains a legislative straw at which those unhappy  with the current state of affairs may very well grasp and try to  implement their plans to "contain" Ilyumzhinov, and if it works  out, use a referendum for new presidential elections. In the  opinion of experts, for now the opposition's chances are not  good: The population of Kalmykia is more concerned with its own  everyday problems rather than political battles on high, and  faith in a strong leader as personified by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov  has not ultimately been lost.    Does the president have something to boast of on the  anniversary of his election and the adoption of a new law?  According to data from the republic administration of  statistics, a recession is being registered virtually  everywhere. Sales on the market have fallen 30 percent; freight  carriage by motor vehicles is down to one-half; in the villages  they are slaughtering cattle; of 5,200 unemployed, people under  30 account for almost one-half. To be sure, according to data  from the same administration of statistics, the crime rate in  the republic went down 18 percent last year, and the president  stated officially that he has put an end to racketeering in  Elista (which incidentally was confirmed by merchants at stands  operating around the clock).    Stratification in terms of assets and unemployment is the  most serious problem in Kalmykia, which has been aggravated  precisely in recent years. The gates of the Monitor  demonstration combine are closed; the workers have been on  furlough since January. Most of those who worked at the Zvezda  plant where the labor biography of the Ilyumzhinov brothers  began are also taking a break.    However, Ilyumzhinov is upbeat despite everything. He  promises that the largest tanning factory in the Caucasus will  be started up. The Lockheed company, which intends to build a  large international airport in the vicinity of Elista, should  begin operations in the same month. However, the plant is indeed  half a step away from "burying China and Germany under Kalmyk  products," whereas everything concerning the airport is still  hazy.    Elista is quite clean; old ladies with brooms are seen in  the  morning. The city is quite festive--the president pays for  concerts on a square in front of the parliament building which  have already been visited by the "stars." Milk is 500 rubles a  liter, and hardly any beggars can be seen. However, many people  expected more of the president. At present Ilyumzhinov  frequently reminds us that his program of transformations is  devised for five years, while only one year has passed so far.</p>

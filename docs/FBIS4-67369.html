			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Undated letter signed by "Experts on Nuclear Law "A. </F> Ioyrysh, V. Kiselev, U. Margulis, V. Menshikov, Ye. Nesterov, A.  Protsenko, Yu. Rogozhin, Yu. Fedulov, V. Filonenko, R.  Sharafutdinov, and A. Shramchenko: "Nuclear Laws Have Been  Written but Are Languishing in Parliamentary Archives"]    [Text] The history of civilian and military nuclear power  dates back almost 50 years. But we still do not have a single  federal legislative act directly regulating the use of nuclear  energy. You get the impression that the legal vacuum here suits  the competing branches of power, the nuclear power industry  departments, and industry down to the ground.    Prior to the events of October 1993, one of the initiators  of  the systematic approach to nuclear legislation was the Radiation  Safety Subcommittee of the Supreme Soviet Committee on Ecology.  The subcommittee spent three years studying problems of nuclear  and radiation safety in Russia and cooperated with the U.S.  Senate and the European Parliament in this work. Its portfolio  contained the most important legislative initiatives: a draft  concept of the legal backup for the use of nuclear power, draft  laws on problems of the treatment of radioactive waste, the  application of nuclear technologies in the national economy,  nuclear power station safety, and others. In conjunction with  the draft Law "On the Use of Nuclear Energy," which was prepared  by the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Committee on Industry  and Power Generation, they could soon have become the basis for  Russia's nuclear law. But they did not.    Today neither the Russian Ministry of the Environment and  Natural Resources nor the government departments which deal with  safety problems are showing the due interest in the continuation  of that work. Clearly it is easier to live according to  departmental instructions. As a result radioactive waste, for  example, will continue to be poured into the ground and into  water systems. The most dangerous products -- highly  radioactive liquid waste -- will be buried deep in the earth as  a "gift" to future generations.    Clearly it does not make sense for the State Duma to begin  entirely from scratch and it is necessary to make use of the  existing draft documents.    What are the most important principles that we propose,  insisting on the systematic regulation of legislation in the  sphere of the use of nuclear energy?    1. In the use of nuclear power Russia will be oriented  toward the priority of protecting the health of the population  and the natural environment over economic benefit;    2. The state will monitor the safety of installations using  nuclear power regardless of their forms of ownership;    3. The regulation of safety and oversight in the sphere of  the use of nuclear power both in the national economy and at  installations of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry must be  exercised by a single state organ;    4. The population and pubic organizations must take part in  the discussion of questions of ensuring safety in the use of  nuclear power and this participation must be enshrined in law;    5. A triad consisting of a federal organ, a component of the  Federation, and organs of local self-government must take part  in the solution of the most important questions (the siting of  nuclear power stations and the storage of radioactive nuclear  waste);    6. The final decision on the siting of potentially hazardous  installations using nuclear power must take the population's  opinion into account;    7. The departmental norms must unconditionally be based on  federal laws of the Russian Federation.    After the effective blocking of nuclear legislation in the  Supreme Soviet, the adoption of the Russian Federation  Constitution, and the subsequent hiatus in the legislative  organ's activity, the time has come for those departments which  use nuclear power to finally realize that the present situation  is intolerable. The government must exercise its right to  initiate legislation in this sphere.    As a result of U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Russia  and the subsequent accords on deliveries of enriched uranium to  the United States, the Ministry of Atomic Energy could become  the largest holder of hard currency. It is to be hoped that at  least a small proportion of the resources earned at  installations which represent an enhanced danger to the  population and the natural environment will be allocated by the  Ministry of Atomic Energy to the formation of a nuclear law.  The atom will not remain without rights forever in Russia!    [signed] Experts on nuclear law A. Ioyrysh, V. Kiselev, U.  Margulis, V. Menshikov, Ye. Nesterov, A. Protsenko, Yu.  Rogozhin, Yu.

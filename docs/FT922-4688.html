			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Agreement signed for Australian Airlines sale THE Australian government and Qantas yesterday signed heads of agreement for the international airline's ADollars 400m (USDollars 303m) purchase of Australian Airlines, the government-owned domestic airline. The signing clears the way for the sale of 35 per cent of the merged airline to foreign carriers, followed by the sale of 15 per cent by tender to Australian institutions and a flotation of the remaining 50 per cent. Mr Bill Dix, Qantas chairman, said the sale value of the merged airline would be between ADollars 2.5bn and ADollars 3bn. Qantas hopes about ADollars 1bn will be set aside by the government for recapitalisation. Qantas expects the trade sale component of the sale to be completed by the end of this year. The flotation is expected to take place in March or April next year. British Airways, Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand are the only overseas airlines to have emerged as serious bidders for Qantas and Australian. In a separate development, the Australian and New Zealand governments said some trans-Tasman routes would be opened to carriers other than Qantas and Air New Zealand from November.</p>

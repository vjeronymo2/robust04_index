According to a communique issued  by the Justice and Police Department, the meeting dealt  primarily with the political issues of migration and domestic  security. In addition, the ministers signed an agreement which  settles the reciprocal acceptance of illegal immigrants staying  in either country.    This bilateral agreement also lays down the transportation  conditions for those illegal foreigners from other countries  being repatriated by Switzerland or Hungary. This measure is  important for the repatriation of rejected asylum-seekers.    The agreement is based on the principles embodied in the  agreements signed by Hungary with neighboring countries. The  decisive factor for repatriation is not the illegal crossing of  the border, but the fact that the person was previously a legal  and long-term resident of another country.    Imre Konya also expressed his wish to see increased  collaboration in the fight against terrorism and organized  crime. According to the communique, both ministers agree that  an effective migration policy and an efficient fight against  organized crime must come through close international  cooperation.</p>

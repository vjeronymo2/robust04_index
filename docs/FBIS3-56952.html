			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva 14 Jan -- The second round of talks on a  Georgia-Abkhazia settlement, which have more than once  approached the danger point and threatened to collapse  altogether, has been successfully completed. The outcome of  three days of tense debates, continuing virtually around the  clock, was the adoption of decisions on the more complex  questions of the Abkhaz drama such as the return of refugees,  strengthening trust and security, and the use of peacekeeping  forces. These decisions were included in a communique of the  meeting that was signed by the heads of the delegations and  representatives of the United Nations, Russia, and the CSCE.    The current round in Geneva, like the previous one from 30  November to 1 December, was held under the aegis of the United  Nations, assisted by Russia. The Georgian delegation was headed  by Jaba Ioseliani, chairman of the Provisional Committee for the  State of Emergency and deputy of the Georgian Supreme Council,  and the Abkhazian delegation by Sokrat Dzhindzholiya, chairman  of the Abkhaz Council of Ministers.    Much effort had to be put in by the mediators -- Eduard  Brunner, the UN secretary general's special envoy, and Russian  Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, the head of the Russian  delegation -- to make the agreement possible. "The talks were  difficult," the Russian envoy said in an interview with an  ITAR-TASS correspondent. "The main reason was the very acute  problems that had built up over 18 months of conflict. A great  deal of blood has been shed and the war has brought misery to  hundreds of thousands of people. And yet, despite the sharp  clash of points of view, and when it seemed that a compromise  was impossible, they were able to achieve a positive outcome to  the talks, and this is another important step toward a  full-scale settlement to the conflict in Abkhazia."    One of the main results was the commitment endorsed by the  sides in the communique not to use force and not to resort to  threats to use it. The sides appealed to the UN Security  Council to widen the UN Mandate on Supervision in Georgia, which  requires it to ensure that there is no resumption of  hostilities. They spoke in favor of deploying UN peacekeeping  forces or other forces sanctioned by the United Nations in the  conflict zone, expressing their mutual consent to the use of the  Russian military contingent in such forces. The deployment of  the "blue berets" should be followed by the withdrawal of all  armed formations over the course of five days from the Inguri  River and other possible zones of confrontation and the  replacement of them by the peacekeeping forces. All volunteer  formations and individuals who have come to take part in the  conflict should be disarmed and withdrawn.    A commission for problems of refugees is being set up with  the participation of representatives of the sides, the United  Nations, and Russia. It has been decided to start a  stage-by-stage return of refugees and displaced persons to  Abkhazia on 10 February -- beginning with Galskiy Rayon. The  most difficult question -- the future political status of  Abkhazia -- will be discussed within the framework of the  previously formed group of experts that will assemble for the  next meeting in Moscow on 8 February. On 22 February the  delegations and the international mediators intend to hold a new  round of talks in Moscow or Geneva.    Member of the Georgian delegation Sandro Kavsadze, the  chairman of Georgia's Committee for Human Rights and Interethnic  Relations, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that the talks had  made it possible "to move forward toward a settlement." Even  though the debate was of "very heated and there was a degree of  confrontation," "on the main issues we reached agreement and  understanding."    Having noted the great importance of the accords, head of  the  Abkhaz delegation Sokrat Dzhindzholiya stressed the important  role of the Russian Federation in a settlement. "Thanks to the  efforts of the Russian delegation, and of Russia as a whole, a  great many positive things were achieved," he said in an  interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent. Even before this  the Russian Federation had been doing everything possible in  order to bring our positions closer together. Furthermore, life  itself has, evidently, meant it to take part in the destiny of  the peoples that were joined by the Soviet Union. There is  simply no other way out. Neither other countries nor the United  Nations have the strength or the means to do this. What is  more, no one knows better than Russia the situation on the  territory of the former USSR.</p>

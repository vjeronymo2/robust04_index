In a statement, IFP Political Director Dr. Ziba Jiyane said:  "The IFP disassociates itself from the statements by certain IFP  members implying that the IFP has called for a worker stay-away  on Monday, January 17. "Since the January 17 event is being  organised by the Zulu king and not the IFP, the IFP could not  have made any such decision. We wish to emphasise the meeting  on Monday between his majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini and State  President F W de Klerk has absolutely nothing to do with the  IFP," Dr. Jiyane said.    Mr Ndlovu made the initial stay-away call in a statement on  Wednesday night. He declined to elaborate.    IFP Transvaal leader and Central Committee member Themba  Khoza confirmed on Wednesday night the party would call on Zulus  to stay away from work on Monday. He said the official call  would be made in a statement on Thursday. Mr Khoza said IFP  supporters in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]  region were expected to mass outside the Union Buildings in  Pretoria on Monday when the Zulu monarch met Mr de Klerk.    The IFP has called a press conference in Johannesburg later  on Thursday to clarify the IFP's position on the stay-away call.  The confusion comes amid persistent claims by IFP rivals that  the party is using King Zwelithini for political gain.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA SEEKS WIDE INFLUENCE;  </P> <P> REQUEST FOR SAY OVER HUGE AREA IS PRELUDE TO ANNEXATION  </P> <P> Santa Clarita has formally submitted a proposal that would give the young city  some say over the development of 160 square miles of the fast-growing Santa  Clarita Valley -- an area roughly comparable to the combined cities of  Lancaster, Palmdale, Burbank and Pasadena.  </P> <P> The proposal is the city's first step toward annexing the area, which makes up  about one-third of the 500-square-mile Santa Clarita Valley. The proposal to  establish the city's "sphere of influence" -- the area eligible for annexation  -- was hand-delivered to the Los Angeles County Local Agency Formation  Commission on Monday.  </P> <P> The commission is a state-mandated agency that oversees annexations and  incorporations. The City Council approved a draft of the sphere proposal in  June.  </P> <P> The area includes the 39 square miles within the city limits plus another 160  square miles roughly bordered by the city of Los Angeles on the south, Ventura  County on the west, Los Padres National Forest on the north and Angeles  National Forest on the east. The area includes the community of Castaic but  excludes Acton and Agua Dulce.  </P> <P> The proposed area also encompasses Elsmere Canyon, which is being considered by  the city of Los Angeles, the county and a private developer as a dump site.  Council members said they wanted to include Elsmere in the proposed sphere to  demonstrate their interest in the future of the canyon.  </P> <P> The area includes all the land that LAFCO removed from the original boundaries  proposed by cityhood proponents in 1987. Incorporation activists originally  wanted a city of 90 square miles.  </P> <P> The city's proposal said the large area is justified because the problems of  growth and planning confronting Santa Clarita also face the entire valley. The  principles of good planning demand that the valley be considered a single  entity, the proposal said.  </P> <P> The City Council has said it hopes to annex as much of the valley as possible.  The proposal notes that the city has already submitted one annexation request  to LAFCO and is preparing five others, all within the proposed sphere of  influence. The proposed annexations are scattered about the city's periphery  and cover at least 2,242 acres, the proposal said.  </P></p>

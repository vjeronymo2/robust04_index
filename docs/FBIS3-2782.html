			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 14 (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Qian  Qichen expressed confidence Monday that Washington would renew  Beijing's MFN status, while continuing to insist that Beijing  would not give in to US pressure on human rights. "I believe  that Sino-U.S. trade will continue," Qian told journalists after  his second meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher who leaves here Monday at the end of a frosty  four-day visit that has focused on the human rights issue.    "There is no such thing of China implementing U.S. orders  and  laws," said Qian, reiterating Beijing's opposition to  Washington's linkage of improvements in China's human rights  record to this year's renewal of Beijing's most-favoured-nation  (MFN) status.    "China is opposed to linking MFN and human rights. China and  the U.S. have different human rights concepts. It's worthless  to put pressure on human rights," he said.    Despite Washington's warning and condemnation of a recent  round-up of some 15 dissidents, the Chinese side has all along  appeared confident that the United States would not dare  jeopardise its lucrative commercial ties with China by  withdrawing MFN.    Qian did not announce any major progress in resolving the  two  sides differences, saying only that they had signed an agreement  setting out guidelines for the implementation of a 1992  memorandum of understanding (MOU) on prison labour exports.  Washington has complained that China has failed to observe the  MOU.    Monday's agreement promises rapid arrangement of visits by  U.S. teams to Chinese prisons suspected of producing goods for  export.    The two sides also decided to establish a joint military  commission to develop cooperation in this area, Qian announced.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE / TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> MAI Basic Four Inc. said a partnership controlled by New York investor Bennett  S. LeBow has completed its previously announced plan to invest $55 million in  MAI Basic Four, a financially strapped Tustin computer maker. LeBow is chairman  of MAI.  </P> <P> Under the plan, Brooke Partners LP will give MAI $30 million in cash and will  invest another $25 million in a new class of MAI stock with restricted voting  rights. Additionally, Brooke has agreed to guarantee some loan payments for MAI  through Sept. 30, 1990.  </P> <P> In exchange for the investment, Brooke will get new common stock that will give  it 54% of MAI's shares outstanding.  </P> <P> MAI said that in order to allow shareholders to preserve their equity  positions, it intends to offer non-transferable rights to purchase, on a  pro-rated basis, 17.5 million common shares at $3.54 a share. MAI said it  expects to hold the offering by March 30, 1990.  </P> <P> MAI reported a loss of $46.2 million and a 23% decline in revenue, to $86  million, for its third quarter ended June 30. The company attributed $25  million of that loss to expenses related to its unsuccessful bid to acquire  Prime Computer Inc., a Natick, Mass., firm, in a protracted takeover battle  that ended in August.

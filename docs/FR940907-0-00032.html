Listed below are descriptions of the changes contained in this submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

These sections have additionally been renumbered to accommodate those definitions which have been added or deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Actual emissions'' to not apply in Parts 6 and 7 of these rules. Parts 6 and 7 regulate the emissions of VOCs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) MDNR has removed one of the two definitions of ``Air-dried coating'' from the State's rules. Now there is only one definition which applies to all of the rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Air quality standard'' to mean the concentration and duration of an air contaminant specified by the commission or by the national ambient air quality standards as contained in the provisions of 40 CFR part 50 (1990), whichever is more restrictive, as the maximum acceptable concentration and duration of that contaminant in the ambient air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) MDNR has added the definition of ``Calendar day'' which means a 24-hour time period which normally is midnight to midnight, but which may, upon written notification to the commission, cover a different, consecutive 24-hour time period for a specific process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) MDNR has added the definition of ``Coating category'' which means a type of surface coating for which there is a separate emission limit specified in these rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Coating line'' to mean an operation which is a single series in a coating process and which is comprised of 1 or more coating applicators and any associated flash-off areas, drying areas and ovens wherein 1 or more surface coatings are applied and subsequently dried or cured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Coating of fabric'' to include the application of coating by saturations and impregnation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Coating of paper'' to include saturation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Coating of vinyl'' to not include the application of plastisols.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Completed organic resin'' to include dry organic resin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) MDNR has revised the definition of ``component'' and lists specific parts which are designated as ``components'' for Rules 336.1622, 336.1628, 336.1629, and specifically excludes a valve that has no external controls, therefore having no potential to leak VOCs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

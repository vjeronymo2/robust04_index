			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The ERM - Picking Up The Pieces: Bundesbank gets room for manoeuvre THE Bundesbank president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, came away from Brussels this weekend with parting gifts of inestimable worth for his successor, Mr Hans Tietmeyer. The German central bank had been freed for the foreseeable future from its obligations to spend billions of D-Marks in support of weaker European exchange rate mechanism currencies, he said in Bonn yesterday. He might have added that, for a while at least, the bank could get on with its main job of looking after the D-Mark and German monetary policy without harassment from other countries for rapid lowering of interest rates. But Mr Schlesinger is not given to immoderate language. In keeping with his mild manner, Mr Schlesinger's main gift to Mr Tietmeyer came modestly packaged: 'Naturally, we have also gained rather more room for manoeuvre for our own policies,' he said. In keeping with the bank's tradition for Delphic utterances, this is open to interpretation. Most importantly, it raises the question of how Mr Tietmeyer and his central bank colleagues use their room for manoeuvre. Mr Peter Lang, an economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank, believes the relief could prompt the Bundesbank to proceed even more cautiously than in the recent past with its snail's-pace downward shift with the short-term discount lending rate. Recent indicators - not least an inflation rate more than double the Bundesbank's favoured 2 per cent, and the inevitable expansionary impact on money supply of last week's DM60bn (Pounds 23bn) of ERM intervention - suggest the bank will feel there is no sense of urgency. With the external pressure off, there will be even less. In the recovery stage of the last recession, the German central bank slashed its discount rate by 3.5 percentage points between August 1982 and March the following year. So far in the current slump, it has taken since last September to cut the effective 'floor' lending rate by just 1.5 points to 6.75 per cent. Before last Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting, expectations had been growing that the process would be speeded up. Pro-cut observers had noted that the danger of a resurgence of inflation had been receding fast. The underlying year-on-year rate was below 3 per cent by the Bundesbank's own reckonings. Annualised money supply growth was tending to ease back from above 7 per cent to the bank's target range of 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent. Then came the disappointment of a token drop in the penalty Lombard lending rate, a new ERM crisis, and renewed criticism of the Bundesbank's lack of sensitivity to its European partners. Mr Dietrich Beier, chief economist at Berliner Bank, yesterday defended the Frankfurt monetarists. If the outside world wanted to blame the Bundesbank for the breakdown of the EMS, then 'it can also blame Germany for unification.' Few, least of all German economists, appreciated the scale of the difficulties with unification at the time. But it is clear that while the rest of the industrialised world is struggling with a 'normal' cyclical recession, the slump in Germany has been compounded by the cost of making good structural distortions incurred by unification. The Bundesbank will use some of the time and room it has for manoeuvre to continue to chip away, at its own pace, at interest rates. But it can also be counted on to crack the whip over federal, regional and local governments to keep the spending cuts coming. Little wonder Mr Schlesinger yesterday declared himself 'extraordinarily grateful' to Bonn for taking the initiative in calling for last weekend's most fruitful meeting.</p>

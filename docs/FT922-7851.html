			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Olympia &amp; York Files for Protection: Family fortune slip slides away THE conversation in the spacious, book-lined study of Paul Reichmann's home in north Toronto turned one recent Saturday evening to the subject of Canary Wharf. What went wrong, the Reichmanns' guests were wondering, with the family's mammoth showpiece in London's Docklands? 'Canary Wharf,' one of the Reichmanns replied defiantly, 'is too good for the British.' Such bitterness was not surprising with the family company, Olympia &amp; York, tottering on the brink of bankruptcy. Eulogised for more than a decade as the world's wealthiest and most astute property developers, the Reichmanns may now face the agony of watching the vast empire which they built crumble around them. Ever since they started putting up industrial buildings on the outskirts of Toronto in the late 1950s, Paul Reichmann and his brothers Albert and Ralph have prided themselves on the innovative touches which kept them one step ahead of the competition. Paul Reichmann has been heard ticking off one project after another where O&amp;Y provided features and services which no other developer had thought of - from Toronto's 26-storey Aetna Centre built in the late 1960s, to the marble-decorated towers of Canary Wharf. In spite of the Canary Wharf problems, Paul Reichmann's vaunted skills as a property developer are likely to remain in demand even after O&amp;Y's filing for protection from the courts. But the brothers, and especially Paul, will almost certainly play a less dominant role. O&amp;Y has always been run as a family firm, despite its size. Even in the years of helter-skelter growth in the mid-1980s, almost every decision, big and small, was made by Paul or his elder brother Albert. Their closest confidants for the past quarter-century have been the handful of men they recruited from O&amp;Y's auditors. The company's offices still close well before sunset each Friday to allow the Reichmanns and other Jewish employees to get home in time for the Sabbath. Not even the heads of O&amp;Y's biggest subsidiaries have been invited to Paul Reichmann's unremarkable home in the heart of Toronto's Orthodox Jewish neighbourhood, whose most pretentious feature is a glass-ceilinged family room. But things were starting to change even before the liquidity crisis broke in February and March. Late last year the Reichmanns approached Mr Tom Johnson, former head of the US bank Manufacturers Hanover, to join O&amp;Y. Mr Johnson spent less than three weeks as O&amp;Y's president in March, but a precedent had been established for outsiders to have a significant say in running the company. Mr Johnson has been succeeded as president by Mr Gerald Greenwald, a former vice-chairman of Chrysler. Another ex-Chrysler man, Mr Steve Miller, has for the past six weeks spearheaded O&amp;Y's negotiations with restive banks and bondholders. The Reichmanns remain O&amp;Y's sole shareholders for the time being. But here too, their control shows signs of slipping. A milestone was reached in London last week when the family came to the reluctant conclusion that it had no choice but to offer creditors an equity stake  - albeit a non-voting one - in the parent company, Olympia &amp; York Developments. O&amp;Y has already started shrinking as the Reichmanns have stepped up their desperate search for cash. It has sold a controlling interest in Interprovincial PipeLine, one of North America's biggest oil pipeline operators. O&amp;Y has also announced plans to spin off its 19 per cent stake in Santa Fe Pacific, the biggest single shareholding in the Chicago-based railway, mining and pipeline operator. Its stake in Home Oil, a Calgary-based energy producer is also up for sale. Even some of the precious real estate is on the block. O&amp;Y has been desperately casting around for a partner to buy at least part of Canary Wharf. It has unsuccessfully tried to seal a sale-and-leaseback deal on the 36-storey Exchange Tower building in Toronto. Some of O&amp;Y's other North American properties are also for sale. But prospective buyers have so far found that Paul Reichmann - whose mild manner masks a tough, and even stubborn, will - has no intention of parting with them at bargain-basement prices. Whether O&amp;Y can hang on to the bulk of its property may depend mainly on the length of time its creditors are willing to wait to get their money back. The Reichmanns will be crossing fingers for a strong upturn soon in the North American and UK office property markets. The glut of office space in New York, London and Toronto does not augur well. The damage which O&amp;Y's troubles has wreaked on the Reichmanns' personal fortunes can only be guessed at. Forbes magazine last year ranked them as the world's seventh-richest family, with a net worth of Dollars 7bn. O&amp;Y recently estimated the market value of its net assets at about Dollars 5.5bn. But the volatility of the property market and the sheer size of many of the company's buildings makes it hard to pinpoint a precise value until firm buyers step forward. The Reichmanns own a web of private companies outside O&amp;Y, including Olympia Tile, one of North America's biggest floor-covering distributors. The personal companies own some minor property assets - but, as far as outsiders can tell, all the crown jewels remain under the O&amp;Y umbrella. Before the crisis broke, it was widely expected that O&amp;Y's far-flung empire would eventually be parcelled out among the three brothers' dozen or so children. Two of Paul Reichmann's five children are still at university in Israel, but several other members of the younger generation (and their spouses) work for the family company and sit on the boards of subsidiaries. One nephew is at Abitibi-Price, the newsprint maker which is 82 per cent owned by O&amp;Y. But none of the younger Reichmanns has impressed outsiders as an obvious successor to their fathers. Indeed, some of their present jobs could be in jeopardy if O&amp;Y is forced into massive asset sales. The question of succession will become less pressing as the family is forced to loosen its grip. Although the next generation will probably inherit a tidy sum by most people's standards, they might have had a lot more to look forward to if the British had been more appreciative of Canary Wharf.</p>

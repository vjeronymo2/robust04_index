The proposal requires that participants be limited to entities that are themselves members of both the CME and BOTCC (``joint clearing members''), and provides for computing and transferring performance bond margin, settlement variation, and option premiums in respect of commodity futures and options contracts of such joint clearing members. The proposal also includes procedures governing the distribution of excess performance bond margin deposits between the CME and BOTCC in certain cases of suspension or expulsion of joint clearing members.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the common banking and settlement procedures provide for performance bond margin deposited by joint clearing members to be held in the joint names of the participating clearing organizations at one or more depositories;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the common banking and settlement procedures provide for the netting of daily settlement variation and option premium payments that joint clearing members pay to or receive from the participating clearing organizations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the common banking and settlement procedures can be used to reallocate cash performance bond margin deposits of joint clearing members between the participating clearing organizations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> it is not intended that the common banking and settlement procedures result in a novation of the joint clearing members' obligations to either of the participating clearing organizations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in the event of the suspension or expulsion of a joint clearing member, the common banking and settlement procedures prohibit any excess performance bond margin, or proceeds thereof, attributable to customer origin positions from being transferred between the CME and the BOTCC to satisfy any deficit or unsatisfied settlement obligations attributable to proprietary origin positions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> by letter dated September 29, 1993, the participating clearing organizations acknowledge that, in the event of the suspension or expulsion of a joint clearing member, the common banking and settlement procedures would permit the transfer of any excess performance bond margin, or proceeds thereof, between the CME and the BOTCC only if there was no shortfall in the funds required to meet the joint clearing member's customer segregated funds requirements for all of its customers, and, by letter dated December 13, 1993, the participating clearing organizations acknowledge that the proposed agreement among the joint clearing members and the participating clearing organizations is expressly subject to the terms of this Order;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> by letter dated December 9, 1993, the participating clearing organizations have represented that, before implementation of the proposal, the agreement between the participating clearing organizations will be amended to make clear that, in the event of a default by a joint clearing member, the clearing organization at which the default occurred will transfer funds to the other clearing organization in accordance with its respective gross payment obligations if there is a deficit in payment flows to the other clearing organization resulting from the netting of payment obligations pursuant to the common banking and settlement procedures, and will otherwise satisfy its gross payment obligations to non-defaulting joint clearing members in accordance with the routine settlement schedule;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the proposal requires that participants be limited to entities that are themselves members of both the CME and BOTCC and does not permit participation by affiliated entities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Whereas,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the Commission has reviewed the common banking and settlement proposal, the proposed agreement between the participating clearing organizations, the proposed agreement among the joint clearing members and the participating clearing organizations, the representations of the participating clearing organizations as to the operation of the common banking and settlement system, and such other documents as constitute the complete record in this matter (``Record'');  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Now Therefore,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> based on the Record in this matter, and provided that the common banking and settlement proposal submitted by the CME and the BOTCC is implemented consistently with the representations and agreements cited herein;

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will tonight  return from Belgrade where he held talks with the leadership of  the new Yugoslavia in his capacity as the European Union [EU]  Council of Ministers president and as the Greek foreign  minister. Papoulias will meet Bosnian Serb leader Radovan  Karadzic at 2100 today.    Papoulias said his talks in Belgrade were held in a warm  atmosphere. Within the framework of the new Greek initiative to  avert NATO intervention in Bosnia, Papoulias held talks with  Serb President Slobodan Milosevic and said that both he and  Milosevic ascertained that times are difficult but there is hope  that worse might be avoided. He said: This will not only  benefit Europe, but the Balkans too.    The foreign minister said the Greek Presidency is  considering  convening the EU Council of Ministers before the NATO ultimatum  expires. Papoulias said the procedure to withdraw the heavy  weaponry from Sarajevo is proceeding well and this is hopeful.  But he noted that this is not solely the Serb side's  responsibility and that the Muslims should do the same to save  peace and the EU peace plan, on which the Greek side insists.    Asked if Greece will exercise its veto right at NATO against  the air raids, Papoulias said Greece is considering using every  available means to avert extensive clashes. The foreign  minister said he and Milosevic discussed the possibility of the  war spreading to the south, stressing that this would be a  dramatic development -- the beginning of an armed clash that  would have broader European dimensions. Papoulias said no one  can rule out the participation of third forces.    Replying to another question, Papoulias said the Greeks in  Serbia are safe. He said: They consider it their second home  and there is no need to abandon it. Papoulias said citizens  from other Western countries are evacuated following their  countries' evaluations and decisions.</p>

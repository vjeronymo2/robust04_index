			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Rauf Denktas has said that south  Cyprus' union with the European Union [EU] will secure the full  integration of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC]  with Turkey. Republican People's Party leader Deniz Baykal has  said that he does not believe that a lasting peace can be  achieved in Cyprus without accepting the equality of the two  communities.    Baykal is continuing his contacts in the TRNC. Baykal and  the delegation accompanying him met with Denktas, Assembly  Speaker Ayhan Halit Acarkan, Prime Minister Atun, Deputy Prime  Minister Ozker Ozgur, Foreign Affairs and Defense Minister Atay  Ahmet Rasit, National Unity Party Dervis Eroglu, and Communal  Liberation Party leader Mustafa Akinci.    In a statement at the meeting, Denktas drew attention to a  statement made by Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis to the effect  that the doors of the EU will open for south Cyprus irrespective  of whether the CBM's [confidence-building measures] prove to be  successful. Recalling that both sides accepted the package  submitted to them, Denktas added that it is Kliridhis who [word  indistinct]. He quoted Kliridhis as saying: Either we say yes  together with Denktas and enter the EU or we join the Union  without them, which would be devastating for the Turkish  Cypriots. Denktas added: This is tantamount to diluting the  guarantee agreement and to canceling the rights granted to us.    Denktas noted that the continuation of this injustice and  the  entry of south Cyprus to EU will secure the full integration of  north Cyprus with Turkey. Pointing out that the two sides  should get together to solve the Cyrus problem, Denktas added  that the Greek Cypriot government has been rejecting the  proposals being submitted claiming that it is the government of  Cyprus and that, therefore, it cannot meet as equals with the  Turkish Cypriot side. Denktas further stressed that an agreement  cannot be reached without equality. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Finns firm for Maastricht PRESIDENT Mauno Koivisto yesterday said Finland would meet all its obligations under the Maastricht treaty, including possible participation in a common European defence force. In contrast to Denmark's equivocations, including this week's demands for opt-outs on a common currency and defence force, Mr Koivisto said Finns intended to be 'honest members' of the European Community. At the end of his trip to Brussels to talk about pending negotiations on full EC membership, Mr Koivisto indirectly criticised Denmark for asking for special treatment. 'It is not easy to say old members have more rights than new members,' he said. Mr Koivisto said yesterday that he expected negotiations on EC membership to begin 'sometime next year'. During a news conference, Mr Koivisto also hinted at Finnish interest in joining Nato. He described talks with Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, as 'most interesting' and said Finland wanted to learn more about the role of Nato and the West European Union (WEU) in Europe's security. However, the president stressed it was not 'timely' to discuss possible Finnish membership of Nato.</p>

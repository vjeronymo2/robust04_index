			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERSHISER GETS RUN, BUT ASTROS GET 3-1 VICTORY  </P> <P> Orel Hershiser finally got a run Wednesday night.  </P> <P> But that was it. One run.  </P> <P> Once again, the Dodgers failed to support Hershiser, as their feeble offense  sputtered in a 3-1 loss to the Houston Astros before 21,715 at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> Hershiser (14-13) has lost four in a row and is winless in his last six starts.  The Dodgers have scored only 15 runs in his 13 losses. The Dodgers went 34  innings without scoring for Hershiser before ending the streak in the fifth  inning.  </P> <P> Is Hershiser frustrated?  </P> <P> As he said after his last outing: "It would be much more frustrating for me if  we were in a pennant race. I hope I'm pitching long enough to see another  streak like this, because they can't happen too often.  </P> <P> "I don't have a whole lot to say about it. You guys (reporters) will have to  make it up. I'm having a bad year after getting a long-term contract.  </P> <P> "There are going to be some interesting interviews in spring training (about  his performance) next year. I may walk away from a few interviews if guys don't  do their research."  </P> <P> Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said: "I can't explain what's going on with  Hershiser. But he keeps us in every game."  </P> <P> Hershiser, who gave up six hits and struck out five, deserved a better fate. He  hasn't won since Aug. 8, when the Dodgers beat the Atlanta Braves, 10-2.  </P> <P> But the Dodgers, who came back to beat the Cincinnati Reds, 5-4, with two runs  in the ninth Tuesday, failed to score after the fifth.  </P> <P> Astro starter Mark Portugal gave up three hits in seven innings. After giving  up consecutive singles to Mike Marshall and Jeff Hamilton in the second and a  single to Hershiser in the third, Portugal didn't allow another hit before  leaving in the eighth for a pinch- hitter.  </P> <P> A 1981 graduate of Norwalk High School, Portugal was starting his first game in  Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> "It was pretty exciting to pitch here," Portugal said. "I remember sitting in  the pavilion and catching a Joe Morgan home run in 1972."  </P> <P> Portugal was sent to the minors last June after his earned-run average  ballooned to 8.53. After being recalled July 15, the right-hander is 5-0 with a  2.63 earned-run average.  </P> <P> "Other than his first stint, he's been our most consistent starter," Astro  Manager Art Howe said. "The bottom line is he was throwing strikes and he  deserved to win."  </P> <P> Reliever Danny Darwin retired the Dodgers in order in the eighth before giving  up a one-out double to Hamilton in the ninth. But he got Lenny Harris to fly to  center and struck out John Shelby to earn his sixth save.  </P> <P> The Astros took a 1-0 lead when Ken Caminiti hit Hershiser's second pitch of  the second inning into the right-field pavilion. Hershiser settled down,  retiring the next 12 batters, striking out four. But the Dodgers couldn't get  him a run, stranding three runners in the first four innings.  </P> <P> The Dodgers finally scored in the fifth, a milestone of sorts for Hershiser.  </P> <P> Hershiser, who singled in the third, helped end the streak when he bunted down  the third base line to advance runners on first and second. Alfredo Griffin  drove in the run when he grounded out to second.  </P> <P> After that, Portugal retired the next six batters before he was replaced.  </P> <P> The Astros took a two-run lead in the eighth when Craig Biggio had an RBI  double down the right-field line. After Hershiser walked pinch-hitter Harry  Spilman, Eric Yelding came in to run for Spilman. Terry Puhl sacrificed Spilman  to second, and he scored on Biggio's double. The Astros added another run when  Gerald Young singled home Biggio.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Mike Scott (19-8) will try to become the first 20-game winner in the National  League this season when he faces John Wetteland (4-7) in the series finale at 1  today. Scott is 4-2 against the Dodgers this season. . . . Astro third baseman  Ken Caminiti, who homered in the second inning, has a 10-game hitting streak,  the longest of his career. . . . Craig Reynolds was a last-minute replacement  for second baseman Bill Doran, sidelined with a sore neck. Dodger catcher Rick  Dempsey turned 40 Wednesday. The Dodgers have had six other players who have  been 40 or older in club history: Vic Davalillo, Manny Mota, Pee Wee Reese, Don  Sutton, Hoyt Wilhelm and Maury Wills. Wilhelm was the oldest at 48. . . . Astro  right fielder Glenn Wilson left after aggravating his left hamstring in the  seventh.  </P></p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Beating up on Bush NOWHERE is it written that New Hampshire always gets it right. But, as often as not every four years, this small New England backwater sends a message to those who would lead the United States. It did not shirk its duty this time. The obvious lesson of Tuesday is that President George Bush can be turned out of office in November if the Democrats can find the right candidate, which is still by no means certain. Not even New Hampshire's notorious cocktail of iconoclastic conservatism and current recession can disguise the fact that in the Republican primary Mr Patrick Buchanan racked up a protest vote comparable in numbers to that won by Eugene McCarthy in 1968, which helped persuade Lyndon Johnson not to seek re-election. This is serious stuff for a sitting president, even if Mr Buchanan himself has a minimal chance of being the Republican nominee. Slow tempo But it takes at least two to dance and, on the Democratic side, the tempo is still slow. The victory of Mr Paul Tsongas, from neighbouring Massachusetts, may be considered a local preference, unrepeatable as the battle moves south and west. It may suggest that his sober, sensible campaign struck some chords which could yet resonate nationwide. Governor Bill Clinton's relative recovery from the smears that had surrounded him means he lives to fight another day on more favourable turf. The write-in vote for Governor Mario Cuomo was, predictably, negligible, underlining the difficulty for late entrants, no matter how famous. Nothing is yet resolved except to make more likely an early winnowing of the field. Until now, the two races have proceeded on parallel tracks, crossing only to the extent that Mr Bush has been the target of both his party challenger and the Democrats. But this now changes. How the president responds to Mr Buchanan will be avidly noted for later use by the Democrats, as will be any clear hits the challenger scores. Worst option So what should, or rather will, Mr Bush do? The worst option would be to descend into a battle on Mr Buchanan's chosen ground over who is the more isolationist and the more xenophobic. Mr Buchanan has flourished by picking holes in the once impregnable Bush aura, not by presenting viable alternatives. It follows that the president should concentrate on what he is good at, primarily the management of external policies. There is enough on this agenda in the shape of Gatt, the Middle East and helping the former Soviet Union, to occupy any president to the public's satisfaction. But this must be supplemented, even exceeded, by initiatives to tackle the domestic problems which are so much on the electorate's mind. These will need to be better than as outlined in his disappointing state of the union address last month. All this might amount to a modified Rose Garden strategy. There is something in Mr Bush's character and record, however, which suggests an aversion to the electoral high road. He seems to love a fight but not to know how to wage one, unless, as in 1988, he is run by hardnosed political operatives. Their absence this time should not be mourned but, without their script, Mr Bush seems bereft of direction. This spells more trouble unless the economy revives or the Democrats again pick a turkey.</p>

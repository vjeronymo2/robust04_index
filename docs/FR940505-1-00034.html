			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The solution to these air quality problems will require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation of all sectors that can contribute. There are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several ways that these FIP proposals embody the federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government's contribution to the solution. First, EPA is meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its legal obligations to provide plans for attainment in the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas. EPA has proposed plans which, building upon existing state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission control strategies, will meet the ultimate goal of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment. EPA hopes that this federal effort will, by actually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing a complete plan, leverage state and local efforts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete their 1994 ozone attainment SIPs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, some of the federal rules proposed today would achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions from emission sources over which the federal government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has sole jurisdiction. Emissions from sources such as new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locomotives, ship engines, aircraft engines, and some farm and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction equipment have not been previously included in state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and local efforts to develop comprehensive and complete attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans. While EPA believes that these sources are appropriate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation, there remain unresolved legal and policy issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the extent to which, if at all, EPA can or should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to regulate them indefinitely. In other words, should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIPs, such as those due in November 1994, be allowed to take credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for federally-mandated reductions from these types of sources? EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is requesting comment on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the FIPs proposed today include reductions from federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities such as military bases. EPA intends to continue working  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with other federal agencies to reduce emissions from their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations in these FIP areas as well as other nonattainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, as we have stated earlier, EPA views these FIPs as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to contribute much more than a comprehensive set of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. The ultimate goal of clean air requires public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support and education, development of new clean technologies, use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of environmentally sound modes of transportation, and a fundamental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shift to include pollution prevention into our everyday decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making both at home and at work. Along with these proposed FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules, EPA as an agency is pursuing a set of initiatives which will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribute to these pieces of the clean air solution. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efforts include implementation of the President's Climate Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Action Plan; an increasing emphasis by the agency on public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awareness of environmental issues and solutions and implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the National Environmental Education Act; participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development and funding of a government-wide Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technology Initiative; and a direct, agency-wide focus on pollution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevention in every rulemaking we undertake. Over time, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efforts will provide significant emissions reductions not only for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California, but across America as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Summary of the FIP Contents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Clean Air Act, nonattainment areas are classified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> according to the severity of their pollution problem. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment deadlines that are then assigned reflect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classification. The current classifications for the three FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone nonattainment areas are set forth below. Also depicted are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the attainment deadlines, which are as expeditious as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practicable, but not later than the following dates:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,r25,8 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Area      <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Classification      <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Attainment date <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> South Coast    <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Extreme     <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2010  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ventura         <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Severe       <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2005  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento       <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Serious       <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1999 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For a number of reasons, EPA believes that the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategies available to the Agency to attain the ozone standard in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Sacramento area by 1999 could result in unacceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> socioeconomic hardship. For example, nitrogen oxides (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions within the Sacramento area are overwhelmingly from mobile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources. And, while significant reductions of mobile source NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions will result from the scheduled phasing in of cleaner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines and fuels, this changeover to cleaner engines and fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will take some time (e.g. manufacturing changes, replacement costs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infrastructure changes). This is especially true since owners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legitimately want to continue to receive the benefits of a full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life from their present vehicles and engines. Therefore, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to get the planned emissions reductions earlier, i.e., before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1999, EPA must either restrict the use of current, dirtier vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and engines, or somehow force turnover in the current vehicle and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine fleet. That means considering options like no-drive days,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or dramatically increasing the costs associated with operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles and engines currently in use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, in order to attain by 1999, stationary sources in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Sacramento area would be required to reduce their volatile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic compounds (VOC) emissions by 20% by 1999, which because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the magnitude of reductions could lead to potential production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cutbacks or shutdowns. As a result of these negative socioeconomic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts, EPA is proposing, in addition to the 1999 attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option, the option of reclassifying the Sacramento area to severe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's reclassification proposal would move the attainment deadline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 2005, and would allow the Sacramento area, for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment, to benefit from substantial emissions reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without the use of more disruptive emissions reduction options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even with the additional requirements associated with a severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation (e.g. the Employee Commute Option program, and more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent New Source Review requirements) the Agency believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this 2005 deadline can result in attainment without the onerous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences associated with Sacramento's current classification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

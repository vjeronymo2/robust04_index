			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / FDP members jubilant after clearing poll hurdle It was all over in a second. An empty blue television screen, then a pie chart. First the two big parties and then yells and cheering of the sort reserved for football terraces: the Free Democratic party had made it back into parliament. People threw themselves into each other's arms, managing only just to keep their drinks in their glasses. The first exit poll showed the FDP had won 7 per cent, 4 per cent less than in 1990 but enough to get its representatives back into the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. For the first time in years it was a close shave for the party, which has only once scored more than 12 per cent. In recent weeks polls had shown FDP support slipping steadily. One poll even gave the party 4 per cent, a result which would have left it outside the federal parliament for the first time since the second world war. The party lost out in five state elections this year and also lost its seats in the European parliament. Many people who had previously voted FDP now wondered whether there was any point: the liberals had moved too close to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, they said, and given up the civil rights and free market economics they once stood for. Even as Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister and FDP leader, pushed his way through a forest of cameras, some party members warned that the bad result meant his days as party leader were numbered. 'This is a very poor result for the party leadership,' said Mr Tobias Gartner, a 21-year-old who runs the Young Liberals in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein. 'I've met (Kinkel). He's very nice. . . but he's no good for the job of party leader. He's a civil servant. He doesn't have what it takes.' At Berlin's Congress Hall, meanwhile, the Party of Democratic Socialism was holding its election party. 'We voted for the PDS because we want them to be the voice of the east Germans in the Bundestag,' said Karin Neubert. The hall was awash with posters of Mr Gregor Gysi, the charismatic parliamentary leader of the PDS, with his recognisable round silver rimmed spectacles. The shouts went up whenever fresh exit polls came in. The PDS had succeeded where the other parties failed. It relied on a loyal and large grassroots organisation whose members are known locally. It tapped the vote of former Communist party members, many of whom were dismissed from their jobs after unification and who now feel marginalised. It managed to act as a protest party for the unemployed. Above all, it acted as the party which could represent the voice and interests of the east Germans. Mr Gysi frequently referred to the free and widespread kindergarten system, holiday camps for children, and the sense of solidarity among people under the communist system, all of which virtually disappeared after unification. The unique act of combining a sense of nostalgia for the past with providing some sense of east German identity won over the voters, even the younger generation. Indeed, like the other former communist parties in eastern Europe, the PDS represents one of the phases in the transition from a communist to a post communist culture. The PDS, however, was undoubtedly helped by the campaign run by Chancellor Kohl's governing Christian Democrats, who repeatedly accused the PDS and its supporters of being fascists painted red. 'It played right into our hands. It was free advertising. It made east Germans, many of whom never supported either the former communists, or even the PDS, swing over to us,' said Mr Lothar Bisky, leader of the PDS. The other success of the PDS was the weakness of the Social Democrats, which failed to establish itself as a left-wing party both in east Berlin and throughout eastern Germany, as well as the other political parties.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Birse dives 62% as recession bites PRE-TAX PROFITS of Birse Group fell by 62 per cent, from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 1.8m for the six months to end-October, as the recession finally caught up with the UK construction group. Bilfinger and Berger, the German contractor, owns 15 per cent of Birse. It acquired the shares at 120p in autumn 1989 when the British group was floated. Yesterday, Birse shares closed 3p up at 83p - 31 per cent less than Bilfinger paid two years ago. The German group was currently tendering in joint venture with Birse for at least three large UK tunneling contracts. These include an Pounds 80m section of the proposed Jubilee underground line extension in London. The UK construction market has fallen sharply since Bilfinger acquired its stake. Mr Peter Birse, chairman, said yesterday that contracting margins made by the British group had fallen to half their normal level. It had however, decided to hold its interim dividend at 1.65p, only just covered by earnings of 1.8p (4.7p) per share. The first-half figures have been adjusted to take account of the decision to write off interest charges on development loans rather than capitalise interest as previously. The effect has been to reduce reduce shareholders' funds at the end of April last year from Pounds 50m to Pounds 45m. Mr Birse said that trading conditions had continued to deteriorate. Increased competition for construction contracts meant that profits had fallen sharply, despite a 16 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 189.3m. The commercial property and housing businesses remained deeply depressed and were expected to incur a further loss this year. Demands on cash balances to fund working capital and dividend payments had meant that gearing had increased from 8 per cent at the end of April to 48 per cent. This was despite a decline in borrowings from Pounds 42m to Pounds 38m. COMMENT The rapid deterioration in the trading performance has severely dented Birse's reputation. Last April the group's share price reached a peak of 186p since when its has been downhill virtually all the way. The fall in contracting margins has occurred more rapidly than expected given that profits are being taken on work won which is likely to have been won at least 12 to 18 months earlier, when construction was still a relatively strong market. The rise in the group's gearing, which was not anticipated when preliminary results were announced last July, has not helped the share price. Pre-tax profits for the year may be less than Pounds 5m compared with a restated Pounds 9.99m last time. The fall in the share price may have gone too far but there is unlikely to be a substantial recovery while recent disappointments are fresh in the memory and while UK construction remains deeply depressed.</p>

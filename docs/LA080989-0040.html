			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD;  </P> <P> S.D.'S CONTRIBUTION TO HIP TOLD NOT TO TOY WITH NAME  </P> <P> One of the hottest, hippest and most happening events on any self-respecting  San Diego pop music fan's social calendar is the occasional surfacing of  Playskool, a nomadic underground "nightclub" whose only permanent home is in  the mind of its proprietor, 24-year-old Todd Zweig.  </P> <P> The focus is on dancing -- to the latest Euro-pop, roots rock and heavy metal  records, spun by deejays who consider the Top 40 more of a junkyard than a  happy hunting ground. Adding to the fun is an eclectic assortment of  entertaining asides, such as fashion shows, go-go and belly dancers, mimes,  female impersonators, performance artists and screenings of campy cult films  and videos.  </P> <P> Another trademark of Playskool is its ever-changing decor. On one night, every  wall, every table, every chair, every fixture was covered with aluminum foil;  on another, hundreds of miniature toy parachutes were suspended from the  ceiling.  </P> <P> "It's a complete audio and visual experience, nothing at all like the typical  San Diego nightclub," Zweig said. "You never know what to expect, and this  suspense, I think, really adds to Playskool's appeal."  </P> <P> Inspired by a similar roving club in downtown Los Angeles, where Zweig lived  before moving to San Diego six years ago to study business at San Diego State  University, Playskool's original port of call was the Hotel San Diego.  </P> <P> Starting in October, 1986, Playskool docked every second or third Friday night  in one of the downtown hotel's basement banquet rooms, regularly attracting  more than 700 18-and-older trendies. A year later, it expanded into a second  banquet room, and Zweig began serving alcohol to patrons over the age of 21.  </P> <P> That's when his troubles began.  </P> <P> Concerned over the potential for drink-sharing with minors, the local office of  the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control threatened to revoke the  Hotel San Diego's liquor license, resulting in the November, 1987, eviction of  Playskool. (Zweig subsequently filed suit against the hotel for breach of  contract, since his lease wasn't due to expire until the end of that year; the  litigation has yet to be resolved.)  </P> <P> In the meantime, Zweig has continued to keep alive the Playskool concept  through occasional stagings at the Palisades roller rink in North Park, the  Soma dance hall downtown and backstage at the San Diego Sports Arena, where the  "club" will celebrate its three-year anniversary Sept. 22.  </P> <P> In this month's issue of Details, the flashy New York night-life magazine,  Zweig placed an ad touting Playskool's upcoming birthday bash.  </P> <P> "I felt it was about time that San Diego got some national recognition for  having an alternative to the typical beach-area Top 40 nightclub" scene, he  said.  </P> <P> That's when his troubles began anew.  </P> <P> "Early last week," Zweig said, "I received a phone call from Hasbro attorney  Jim Montalto, telling me to cease and desist using the Playskool name, which is  a registered trademark for Hasbro's line of preschool toys.  </P> <P> "If I didn't, he told me, Hasbro would take me to court and sue me."  </P> <P> Zweig said he argued, in vain, "that because I'm not selling toys, I can't  imagine anyone confusing Playskool, the nightclub, with Playskool, the toy  line."  </P> <P> But, even though he offered to change the spelling, Zweig added, the Hasbro  attorney still said no.  </P> <P> Zweig has since hired an attorney of his own "in an attempt to reach some sort  of compromise," he said.  </P> <P> "But, to tell you the truth, it doesn't look very good," Zweig said. "Even if I  was to change the spelling, which I believe is acceptable under federal  trademark law, they have enough money to take me to court, whereas I don't have  anywhere near enough money to properly defend myself.  </P> <P> "Therefore, I'll probably have to change the name entirely. And that makes me  feel lousy, because, over the last three years, Playskool has really  established itself in San Diego.  </P> <P> "People know the name, and I would very much like to keep it, because it has  such a good reputation.  </P> <P> "At this point, however, I just don't think it's possible."  </P> <P> LINER NOTES: After two no-shows, Rod Stewart finally made it to the San Diego  Sports Arena on Tuesday of last week, four days after he was originally  scheduled to appear. Unfortunately, his stage-lighting system didn't. It had  already been shipped to New Jersey, the next stop on Stewart's summer U.S.  tour.  </P> <P> Larry Richter, the concert's production manager, made several frantic phone  calls before finding a replacement: the system belonging to Tom Petty, who was  playing that night at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles, which, unlike  the Sports Arena, has built-in stage lights. Petty's system was hurriedly  trucked down to San Diego and set up, with only minutes to spare. . . .  </P> <P> When the folks at XLTN-FM (104.5 Radio Latina) learned the Gipsy Kings were  coming to San Diego, they immediately made arrangements for an on-air phone  interview. After all, the French group's recent hit, "Bambaleo," had caught on  big with Latino audiences and was still in heavy rotation on the local Spanish-  language radio station's play list. But, when the much-awaited interview  finally took place -- three days before the group's appearance last Saturday at  San Diego State University's Open Air Theatre -- it proved a bust. Radio Latina  staffers had taken it for granted that the Gipsy Kings speak Spanish. They  don't. . . .  </P> <P> Motley Crue's management team is negotiating with Sports Arena vice president  and general manager Phil Quinn about leasing the arena sometime in November for  four days of pre-tour rehearsals. "They came down two years ago, and they loved  it," Quinn said. "It's close enough to Los Angeles, where they live, but far  enough away so they can get down to business." . . .  </P> <P> Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday for Santana's Sept. 2 appearance at the  SDSU Open Air Theatre, and at 3 p.m. Friday for the Aug. 30 concert by Winger  at the California Theatre downtown. . . . Sheena Easton's Aug. 17 show at the  Civic Theatre has been canceled. So has the Desert Rose Band's Sept. 17 concert  at Humphrey's on Shelter Island.  </P></p>

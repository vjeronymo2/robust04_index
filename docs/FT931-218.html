Although most amendments have been tabled by opposition members and peers, Conservative members have also been giving voice to the anxieties of employers' organisations about the burdens that some measures are imposing. In the latest significant amendment, inspired by the Confederation of British Industry, women going on maternity leave will be required to inform their employer when they are leaving and when they plan to return.</p>

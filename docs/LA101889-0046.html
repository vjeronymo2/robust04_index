			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLU GIVES WESTMONT A SCARE, 3-2  </P> <P> It was a typical freshman mistake.  </P> <P> Apparently Alberto Gutierrez didn't realize that when the Cal Lutheran soccer  team fell two goals behind the top-ranked team in the nation late in the second  half it was time to go into the tank.  </P> <P> No, with typical freshman vigor, he leaped high for a Larry Gidley pass near  the goal and headed it in to pull Cal Lutheran (7-5-1) within a goal of  visiting Westmont College (12-1-3) with five minutes remaining in Tuesday's  game.  </P> <P> Gutierrez's goal made the final score 3-2, but CLU managed to throw a scare  into Westmont, tied for first in the National Assn. of Intercollegiate  Athletics soccer poll with Rockhurst College of Missouri.  </P> <P> "It's probably safe to say they play us as tough as anybody has played us all  year," Westmont Coach Bob Fortosis said. "It's obvious we played pretty flat,  but I don't know if it was because of their effort or because we came in  cocky."  </P> <P> Westmont jumped to a 1-0 lead and controlled the ball throughout the first  half, but Cal Lutheran managed to scratch out a 1-1 first-half tie. Dave  Rinehart kicked the ball into the right corner where Gidley tracked it down and  crossed it to Casey Pirih, who drilled a line drive past diving goalie David  Buehring for Cal Lutheran's goal.  </P> <P> Early in the second half, Westmont's Justin Wall scored his second goal of the  game when he hit the right post, rebounded his own shot and buried it in the  net.  </P> <P> Mike Avery scored minutes later to give Westmont a 3-1 lead.  </P> <P> But Cal Lutheran refused to quit.  </P> <P> "You expect that of them," Coach George Kuntz said. "Playing the No. 1 team in  the nation, the players responded well."  </P> <P> With only two more District 3 matches left, CLU needed a victory to improve its  playoff hopes. Now, the Kingsmen (3-3-1 in district play) will have to beat Cal  Baptist and Fresno Pacific to assure themselves of one of the five playoff  berths.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Samir Ghawshah, secretary general </F> of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front and PLO Executive  Committee member, in Tunis, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, date  not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program--recorded]    [Text] [Al-Jundi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, the Voice of the  Arabs welcomes you.    [Ghawshah] Thank you.    [Al-Jundi] The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was not the first to  be perpetrated against the Palestinians living under occupation.  Following this massacre, numerous question marks hang over the  peace process. What is the PLO's assessment of the peace  operation after this incident?    [Ghawshah] The crime against our kin in the Ibrahimi Mosque  in Hebron was doubtless a turning point for the Palestinian  people's progress and profoundly affected the peace process,  especially as this bloody assault was not the first of its kind  by extremist organizations and settlers. Our people have  already been subjected to many similar assaults. Armed settlers  have attacked our people, stormed houses, assaulted vehicles,  and blocked roads while Israeli army and security personnel  stood by and watched. Despite denunciations and petitions and  discussions about settler issues, Rabin's government continued  its policy of allowing settlers to walk around fully armed and  attack Palestinians.    Basically, we view this as a major incident affecting the  peace operation and halting the talks.    [Al-Jundi] Do you think this massacre will halt the peace  process or only postpone it indefinitely?    [Ghawshah] This depends on the conduct of Prime Minister  Rabin and his government and the measures that will be adopted  following the massacre. They must make a decision disarming all  settlers. The Israeli Government has only decided to disarm some  settlers. What also happened is that the Palestinians were  prevented from laying their martyrs to rest. At the same time,  the settlers continued to walk around fully armed, something  that was relayed by television screens worldwide. We say: In  light of the Rabin government's decisions and judging by how  seriously it handles this issue and the peace process, we might  decide to suspend the negotiations instead of halting them  altogether. We have offered a lot to keep the peace process  going. We are still saying that if earnest and effective  decisions are made, primarily providing international protection  for our people against assault, we might regard what is  happening as a suspension of the talks, not an end to the peace  process.    [Al-Jundi] Following the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the  international condemnation of it, observers have spoken about  the peace process and the basis for negotiations. Regarding the  Israeli settlements inside the Palestinian self-rule area, is  there a specific strategy that the Palestinian side will follow  in the coming phase?    [Ghawshah] Since the Madrid conference, the PLO and its  negotiating delegations have been reiterating that the  settlements and the settlers constitute an obstacle to peace.  In all the rounds of talks, the Palestinian delegations have  been calling for the withdrawal of the settlers and the  dismantling of the settlements. They have been calling for  ending this phenomenon, which is considered to be a continuation  of Israeli aggression and occupation. But because of particular  factors and circumstances, the discussion of the final status of  the settlements has been postponed. Now, after the massacre and  after the world has realized that the main issue is not Israel's  security, but the Palestinian people's security, it has become  clear that these settlements are a threat and a powder keg. We  stress the need to start a serious discussion of the status of  these settlements. This is particularly so because Rabin has  stressed that there are security settlements and political  settlements. We believe some settlements can be dismantled  while others can be put together pending their dismantling.  This constitutes a guarantee for peace. But if Rabin and his  government still insist on their stance, it means they are  putting out obstacles. Thus, the peace process will remain  threatened by this powder keg represented by the presence of the  settlements and armed settlers.</p>

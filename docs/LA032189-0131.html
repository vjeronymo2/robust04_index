			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN KILLED, 5 OTHERS HURT IN DESERT CRASH  </P> <P> A 23-year-old Santa Ana woman was killed and four other Santa Ana residents  seriously injured when a pickup truck overturned in the first major incident of  the Easter Week break in Palm Springs, police said Monday.  </P> <P> Sylvia Munoz Flores was dead at the scene after a truck in which she was riding  struck a concrete wall at 6:34 p.m. Sunday while traveling at high speed, Palm  Springs Police Lt. John Clem said.  </P> <P> The truck flipped end over end four times before coming to rest under a stop  sign in a residential area about 4 miles from downtown Palm Springs.  </P> <P> Witnesses told police the pickup truck failed to stop at two stop signs and had  passed another car when it appeared to "over-correct after passing," went over  the curb and struck the wall, Clem said. No arrests or citations were issued,  but the incident remains under investigation, he said.  </P> <P> "In the debris of the crash there is an indication some alcohol was present,  but we do not know if that was a factor," Clem said.  </P> <P> The driver, Eric Leonard Jones, 23, of Palm Desert, and four Santa Ana  residents -- Linda Vargas, 24; Carlos Cano, 23; Ruben Melendrez, 24, and Molly  Carrillo, 21 -- were listed in serious to critical condition in Desert Hospital  in Palm Springs, Clem said.  </P> <P> The annual spring break draws thousands of college-age adults to Palm Springs.  </P></p>

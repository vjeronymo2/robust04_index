			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Sino-Pakistan Link"] </F>   [Text] Chinese friendship has been an important factor in  Pakistan's foreign policy from two points of view in the last  thirty years. First, every government in Islamabad has sought  Chinese help in procuring military hardware and nuclear know-how  and materials with varying degrees of success. Secondly, the  Pakistanis have naturally attached the greatest importance to  eliciting significant Chinese diplomatic support for its case on  Kashmir. Benazir Bhutto's visit to Beijing has made hardly any  difference to bilateral ties from either point of view. As far  as the first objective is concerned, the Pakistan Prime  Minister's talks with Premier Li Peng have not produced any  dramatic result. None of the five documents on cooperation  signed on this occasion relates to military items although the  Pakistan Defence Minister, Aftab Shaban Mirani, along with the  Foreign and Commerce Ministers, were present at the talks  between the two delegations led by the PMs. It is not clear  whether this is because Mirani, who was in Beijing three weeks  ago also, had already transacted military business. The  possibility of significant military purchases from China cannot,  of course, be ruled out. If the two sides have decided to carry  on covert business in this field, that is the established  pattern all over the world.    In terms of the requirements of Pakistan's current  diplomacy,  a new helpful gesture by China, on Kashmir was actually far more  important to Benazir Bhutto. She has not achieved this purpose.  Li Peng merely reiterated the known Chinese stand that India  and Pakistan should resolve this question "through patient  dialogue" and "welcomed efforts conducive to a settlement".  This advice cannot have been sweet music to the visiting lady's  ears. It is hardly distinguishable from what the Simla  Agreement enjoins India and Pakistan to do. As is well know,  Islamabad pays only lip-service to this agreement while moving  heaven and earth to sabotage it in practice. The lesson to be  drawn, therefore, is that the Chinese connection is unlikely to  give Pakistan more diplomatic manoeuverability than hitherto.  In a notable amplification of China's present policy on  Kashmir, the Chairman of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, Li Ruihuan, during his recent visit to  New Delhi, had also condemned terrorism in any form.    The sooner the Pakistani policy-makers realise the futility  of concentrating on enlisting the support of other countries for  its claim to Kashmir instead of reaching an amicable settlement  with India, the better it will be for regional peace and  stability. To reject such a shift in the face of the demands of  the new international situation will be to cling to a world of  make-believe. The challenge before Benazir Bhutto is to lead  her people not back into the dreary past, but towards a  reassuring future.</p>

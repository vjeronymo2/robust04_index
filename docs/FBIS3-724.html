			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the  UN secretary general in Angola, has arrived in Luanda from  Huambo, where he held talks with Jonas Savimbi, leader of the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA].    Alioune Blondin Beye held talks with President of the  Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos at the Futungo de Belas Palace  this afternoon. The discussions centered on the Lusaka peace  talks. The representative of the UN secretary general in Angola  decided to hold a private meeting with the president, because he  was dealing with very serious and delicate issues. Not even  interpreters were allowed at the meeting. The audience lasted  20 minutes.    Alioune Blondin Beye did not want to say what he discussed  with the president. He said he had made a contract with the  press that the parties could not hold talks and the same time  make statements to the press.    [Begin recording] [Beye, in French fading into Portuguese  translation] We have been holding peace talks in Lusaka since 15  November. You are also aware that this morning I stopped over  in Huambo to meet with Dr. Savimbi.    [Unidentified reporter] What exactly did you talk about with  the president of the republic?    [Beye] It was normal for me to assess the situation of the  peace talks with the president of the republic.    [Reporter] You also visited Huambo today. What guarantees  did you receive from the UNITA president on the peace talks?    [Beye] As you are aware, we made a contract with the press  that we do not want to hold negotiations through the press, and  therefore I cannot reveal what I talked about with Dr. Savimbi  and the president of the republic. All I can say is that the  meetings I had in Huambo and here, at the Futungo de Belas, were  very useful for the peace process. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] In February, Satsuki Eda, a representative of the  Social Democratic Federation who once called for a "five-year  moratorium" and emphasized "doing away with nuclear power,"  assumed the post of Director General of the Science and  Technology Agency in the Hosokawa coalition cabinet. While  Director General Eda stresses the continuation of government  policies on nuclear power, he has also opened the lines of  communications in an effort to clarify the differences with the  policies of the Liberal Democartic administration. Director  General Eda gives some a sense of impending reform, but given  that he is simply one who tries to please everybody, the trust  of neither the pro-nuclear nor anti-nuclear sides will be  gained. The crucial time is from now on.    Soon after Director General Eda assumed his cabinet position  he opened the door for direct dialog with anti-nuclear-power  groups. Nisaburo Takagi of the Nuclear Power Data and  Information Office said, "Up until now, even if they met the  Director General, all they ever did was hand over a list of  demands. Any exchange of ideas was impossible."    On 20 September Miyako Oshita, a single representative of a  nation-wide anti-nuclear group called the Plutonium Action  Network, met with Director General Eda. Her face looked hopeful  when she said, "It was the first time to speak with the STA  Director General, and he made a definite promise to continue  dialog in the future."    That the pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear factions joined hands  for the first time and co-sponsored a symposium entitled "Why  Plutonium Now?" on 25 September, was also on the line extending  out of the route "from confrontation to dialog." After  experiencing the pursuit of nuclear energy policies during the  LDP administration, there appears to be a strong perception that  "those of the anti-nuclear faction are also important  associates" (Director General Eda's words).    On the other hand, in contrast to that situation, it is also  a fact that within the STA there is the following criticism:  "Government policies are decided through democratic procedures.  Formally lending an ear to the anti-nuclear faction will make  administration sluggish." Then the head of a division involved  with nuclear power divulged the following: "After about  November, when the nuclear power administration's study will end  one pass, people in the STA will probably be more nervous. From  now on we wonder what sort of orders will come from the Director  General."    Nevertheless, even if the dialog route is remarkable, the  government's policy of atomic energy promotion and the  establishment of a nuclear fuel cycle aimed at the effective use  of plutonium is no change from that of the LDP administration.  That is because the basis for the existence of the Hosokawa  cabinet lies in the "succession of the previous administration's  policies" based on an agreement among the eight coalition  parties.    Director General Eda himself hinted about the change of  direction in an interview last August: "The Social Democratic  Federation's predecessor, the Social Citizen's Federation, had  been seeking a five-year moratorium on nuclear power. But, when  the basic doctrine of supporting the administration was proposed  three years ago, those words disappeared."    In the 5 October meeting of the Lower House Budget Committee  Director General Eda made a fairly positive observation: "The  effective use of plutonium is a choice that resource-poor Japan  should take."    As the head of the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan,  Director General Eda inherits the promotion of atomic energy for  electrical power generation, but he also listens to the voice of  the opposing forces. How will he deal with the assertions of the  two sides? Director General Eda will continue walking a  tightrope.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Observer: Desperate Dan Can former US vice-president Dan Quayle really be thinking about running for the presidency on the Republican ticket in 1996? CNN reckons that Quayle, currently employed as a corporate lawyer in Indianapolis, has decided to run after brisk trade in his autobiography, Standing Firm. Maybe it's all a mistake - which it could well be, going by past experience. Quayle it was who once advanced the theory that only Republicans understood the importance of bondage between children and parents. He famously insisted 'potato' was spelt 'potatoe'. Indeed, he notched up enough gaffes to sustain a journal called the Quayle Quarterly, to which US citizens could subscribe in order to catch up with his latest mishaps. Then again, any politician who is so despised by the liberal media can't be all bad. Who knows, two years from now, maybe American voters will crave a little dumbness.</p>

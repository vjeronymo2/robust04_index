			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with new Slovak Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus by </F> an unidentified correspondent at the Bratislava Castle in  Bratislava on 16 March--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Minister, what do you regard are  the most sensitive issues facing you in your new job?    [Filkus] It is certainly the budget. I am not saying that we  shall have to revise it. We shall nonetheless have to subject  it to an appraisal from the viewpoint of revenues and  expenditure. The situation in sectors that are dependent solely  on revenues they receive from the state budget, such as the  health, educational, and cultural sectors, is especially bad.  We shall have to take another look at them. [passage omitted]    The problem I shall have to start tackling beginning  tomorrow  is to report to the public and signal to it that I have taken  over the economy in such a state, with such currency reserves,  such a budget deficit, such a degree of unemployment, such a  relationship between the growth of labor productivity and wages.  My task will be to inform the public about macroeconomic  options we have.    [Correspondent] What kind of picture have you formed about  steps you shall have to take regarding the very burning problem  of the stability of money?    [Filkus] First, I believe the center that is to look after  the stability of money is the National Bank. It possesses basic  macroeconomic criteria with which it can judge what to do or not  do within the framework of the stability. You must surely have  in mind the process of devaluation and the like. This must be  done by the bank in accordance with its own judgement. The  Finance Ministry ought not to interefere in this matter. The  Finance Ministry may give assistance, but the consideration and  decision should be made by the National Bank only in accordance  with the criteria the bank has at its disposal. No one should  interefere in this process.</p>

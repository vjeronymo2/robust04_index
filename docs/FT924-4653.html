			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Bonds: French bank uses new structure to launch Dollars 100m paper CREDIT Local de France yesterday became the second borrower to raise funds using the ratchet collared floater, a new species introduced to the bond market by Morgan Stanley International last week. The bank said it launched the Dollars 100m five-year issue on the strength of demand for the first, a Dollars 150m five-year issue for Rabobank Nederland last Friday. Morgan describes the structure as an enhanced floating rate note, the interest rate on which can never go down. The thinking is to take advantage of interest in FRNs from investors who are positive about the dollar, but concerned that US interest rates, while rising, could fall in the medium term. Morgan argues it has taken away the downside risk, and the only limit to the upside is that interest rate rises are limited to a maximum of 25 basis points every three months. Morgan says this innovation has the potential to be as large as the collared floater market, but critics say the structure is too complicated and most investors are sceptical of missing any rise in interest rates. Meanwhile, the Republic of Turkey launched a Y70bn samurai bond in Japan, as part of its strategy to improve the currency composition and maturity structure of its debt, to improve the balance between syndicated loans and fixed-rate paper and to increase the investor base for Turkish risk. Bankers also note the samurai market has been providing more attractive financing for sovereign borrowers than the Euroyen market. The bond, led by Yamaichi Securities, is divided into two tranches, one with a four-year maturity and the other six years. This is the republic's third venture this year into the samurai market and follows moves into Yankee and Ecu bond markets. The platform for this latest issue was the triple-B rating gained from Standard and Poor's in May. Turkey's debt was Dollars 50.9bn at end-June. Of the total, 37 per cent is at variable interest rates and the rest is fixed. Bankers say the pricing on this issue is expected to be tight, making it difficult to sell to institutional investors. But success of Y50bn five and seven-year bonds in June and September respectively suggests the appetite among Japanese retail investors is strong. Mr Masayaki Kanayama of Sanwa Bank in London said the market expects institutional and retail investors to take up the four-year tranche, and retail investors to buy the six-year tranche. The republic has already issued Dollars 899m worth of bonds in 1992, compared with syndicated loans of Dollars 349m. In May, Paribas was lead manager on Turkey's Ecu bond, a Dollars 185m-equivalent three-year exercise. Commerzbank arranged a DM400m seven-year bond issue in July. Also in July, the Treasury arranged a Dollars 250m Yankee bond issue. When the samurai issues are included, Turkey is projected to be a net borrower on the international capital markets in 1992, despite its original target to be a net repayer. Debt repayments are estimated at Dollars 1.9bn in the second half of this year. Public debt repayments are officially projected to peak in 1995 at Dollars 4.6bn. Due to these new borrowings and the adverse exchange rate movements which are estimated to have added Dollars 2.3bn to the debt stock in the first half of 1992, total debt is projected to reach between Dollars 53bn by the year end. This is a net increase of more than Dollars 4bn over 1991. Elsewhere, bankers described as rather optimistic suggestions from Romania that it might follow the reopening of its domestic bond market after 45 years by tapping the Eurobond market as early as 1993. S&amp;P said the debt rating for Hungary, the only eastern European country so far to have its debt rated, is below investment grade at BB+. THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has set an Ecu900m borrowing programme for next year. The bank has so far raised Ecu865m of this year's Ecu900m programme, at economic funding levels. With an average maturity of seven years, the bank's average cost of funds, after swapping the proceeds of its borrowings, was better than 40 basis points below the London interbank offered rate. Mr Rene Karsenti, the EBRD's treasurer, agreed it would be 'difficult' to achieve the same cost of funds next year, but said the triple-A rated bank 'may benefit from the flight to quality' by bond investors. The bank's policy is to borrow a minimum of 45 per cent of projected requirements for cash disbursements over the next three years. The money raised is invested in liquid assets, pending disbursement.</p>

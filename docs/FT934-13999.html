			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Farnell makes Dollars 70m purchase - Growth in all main trading subsidiaries behind advance to Pounds 21m FARNELL Electronics, the electronics components manufacturer and distributor, is paying Dollars 69.8m (Pounds 46.2m) cash to acquire Multicomponents from ITT, the US conglomerate. The proposed acquisition, which will make Farnell the second largest distributor by turnover in Europe after Arrow Electronics and place it among the top six in the world, came as the group announced a 37 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits, excluding exceptionals, to Pounds 21.1m. The acquisition is seen as a natural fit and will be financed from bank facilities and Farnell's cash resources. The market welcomed the move, together with Farnell's better than expected first-half results, and the company's shares closed 26p higher at 486p. Analysts believe Farnell's management will move quickly to squeeze costs out of Multicomponents and boost its operating margins significantly. Farnell acquired the ESD electronics components distribution business from STC for Pounds 61m in 1991 and has since succeeded in boosting its sales and margins considerably despite the recession. Multicomponents, which has 20 sales offices in 12 European countries as well as 7 in Canada and the US, is one of the leading broadline volume distributors of electronic components in Europe. Its turnover in 1992 was Pounds 154m (Pounds 139m). However, the ITT unit has been undergoing a restructuring, and operating profits before exceptional items and restructuring costs were Pounds 2.2m last year compared with Pounds 800,000 in 1991. Mr Richard Hanwell, chairman, said the acquisition was first mooted by Farnell a year ago. He said it had been under negotiation since April and was completed early yesterday by Mr Howard Poulson, Farnell's new chief executive, and Mr Henry Elstone, finance director. He said the acquisition was in line with the group's strategy of expanding its two distribution models, FEC, which distributes about 30,000 components through a catalogue, and ESD, into new geographical markets. Mr Hanwell said the deal would give Farnell 'critical mass' in the European electronics components distribution business and enable it to negotiate more effectively with its suppliers. Farnell's results for the six months to July 31 reflected a strong performance by all its main trading subsidiaries. Sales rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 147m (Pounds 126.8m), fuelled by recovery in the UK and continuing expansion in new markets. Operating profit grew by 33 per cent to Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 16m) as margins improved to 14.5 per cent (12.6 per cent) reflecting operating efficiencies, particularly in the manufacturing division and ESD. Strong cash generation helped reduce interest charges and restored the group to a Pounds 6.77m net cash position. The pre-tax line was only slightly below the Pounds 21.8m reported last year, struck after the inclusion of a Pounds 6.4m one-off gain from the disposal of a non-trading subsidiary. Earnings, adjusted to exclude the exceptional, increased to 10.5p (7.5p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 3.2p (2.7p).</p>

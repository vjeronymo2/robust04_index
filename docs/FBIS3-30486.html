			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 4 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Ministry of Foreign  Affairs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has, with  amazement and bitterness, received reports that the prefecture  of Le Bas Rhin in France has made a decision to ban the rally  entitled "24 Hours of Solidarity With the Serbian People,"  scheduled to take place on 6 February. The Ministry's statement  says that the explanation that "a protest rally against the  sanctions affecting the Serb community could threaten public  order due to the risk of counterdemonstrations by associations  hostile to the Serbs or by those associations whose aims  contradict those of the rally organizers" is particularly  surprising. The explanation and other circumstances indicate  that the competent prefecture could not have made the decision  without the consent of the French Government.    Such measures by the French authorities point to the  existence of double standards which some countries, and --  unfortunately -- France among them, apply to the crisis in the  former Yugoslavia. The decision to prohibit the Serbs from  expressing legitimate protest and dissatisfaction against the  unfounded and genocidal sanctions against the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia and the Serb people gives even more reason for  concern, bearing in mind that such measures have never been  taken against anti-Serb demonstrations in France.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia, Yugoslav citizens who live and work in France, and  the entire Yugoslav public, rightly expect that the relevant  authorities in France will reexamine their decision and enable  Yugoslav citizens and their French friends to express their  viewpoint on the sanctions in a peaceful and dignified manner.  Following the surprising decision by the French authorities the  Federal Foreign Ministry has ordered the charge d'affaires of  the Yugoslav Embassy in Paris to lodge a protest note with the  French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the statement says.</p>

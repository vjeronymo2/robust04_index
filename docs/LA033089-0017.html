			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: SOME SHORTCUTS TO EASY CLEANUP WHEN YOU'RE FLOURING A  CHICKEN  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: One of my least favorite chores is trying to get a plate clean  after using it when flouring chicken. After dipping the chicken in either milk  or egg batter and then rubbing it in flour, the plate is a terrible mess. I  scrub and scrub and eventually it comes clean.  </P> <P> Now before I start cooking, I cover the plate with a piece of plastic wrap and  then put the flour on it. This way I simply roll the flour and everything up  and throw it away. This sure made my meal preparation much easier.  </P> <P>  -- BETSY C., Anniston, Ala.  </P> <P> DEAR BETSY: I use a paper plate and toss the whole mess away.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When I have leftovers, I try to find clever ways of using them.  My family hates the idea of eating leftovers, so when I succeed in disguising  them they never even know, and mealtime is more pleasant for all of us.  </P> <P> When I have a small amount of fruit left over, I add it to the batter of either  pancakes or waffles, whichever I prepare for breakfast. Pancakes and waffles  are now a favorite in this household.  </P> <P>  -- GLORIA C. Phoenix, Ariz.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have some burned-on food on a stainless steel pot. Is there an  easy method without scrubbing endlessly? I can't seem to find anything that  works well.  </P> <P>  -- A READER, Los Angeles  </P> <P> DEAR READER: You are right, that burned-on food can be a devil to remove. The  following method should only be used on stainless steel and not on aluminum  cookware.  </P> <P> Preheat the stainless steel pot until it is slightly warm and place it on a  heavy brown paper bag to protect your counter. Generously spray the pot with  some oven cleaner. Allow it to set for five to 10 minutes and then rinse off  the pot.  </P> <P> If the food has been on the pots for a long time or if it is a heavy  concentration, it may take several applications and some scrubbing. Eventually  most of the burned food will be removed. The pan should be washed after all the  oven cleaner is rinsed off. Wash it well with hot soapy water and allow it to  dry.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Here's a great tip on saving bottled salad oil from pouring out  all over my vegetables.  </P> <P> When I remove the cap from the bottle of oil, rather than removing the seal, I  cut a slit in it. It pours out slowly so I can measure it, without spilling it  everywhere. Sure saves on the calories, and no more soggy salad.  </P> <P>  -- JOAN D., Oklahoma City, Okla.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: It seems I am forever dieting and when dieting it is important to  drink eight to 10 glasses of water a day. This was always difficult for me. I  mean, who actually likes to drink that much water? Certainly not me.  </P> <P> So, to try to help I bought my very own special glass. It is very attractive  and I use it all the time. Whenever it is empty, I refill it. It serves as a  constant reminder of how great I'm going to look.  </P> <P>  -- KAY S., Harrisburg, Pa.  </P> <P> DEAR KAY: I use a beautiful crystal goblet. It does make a difference.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: How can I clean a solid copper kettle? I answered my door and  when I returned, I found it black from being on the stove burner.  </P> <P>  -- NINA, Metairie, La.  </P> <P> DEAR NINA: Of course, you can use a good commercial cleaner or you could try  our home-style remedy. Try pouring some white vinegar on a sponge along with a  sprinkle of salt and rub the kettle. The black should come off. If the kettle  is really black, you may need to do several applications. Good luck.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: This past summer I was invited to a picnic and was told to bring  some soda pop. I stopped by a corner convenience store and bought four cold  six-packs of soda to put in my two small coolers.  </P> <P> When I saw the price of bags of ice, knowing the soda would be gulped down  quickly when I got to the picnic, I bought four cans of frozen orange juice and  put them in my coolers with the soda. The soda stayed cold until it was  consumed.  </P> <P> I took the cans of orange juice home, mixed them and drank it during the next  week.  </P> <P>  -- MIKE, Houston  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: For years I have hassled with the 13-gallon trash bags I put in  my wastebasket. After emptying the trash, I always opened the new plastic bag  and shook air into it, spread it at the bottom and hoped it covered the bottom  and corners of the basket.  </P> <P> Well, it didn't work. Almost every time I threw something in the new bag, the  top part that I had carefully folded over the top edge would fall down inside  the basket.  </P> <P> I thought that a large rubber band (or an elastic cord that has a diameter  about the size of a pencil) around the top of the basket would keep the bag in  place. Since I didn't have either of those, I tried plain old clothespins. My  wastebasket is round and I used three clothespins spaced around the top edge.  They work well and do not interfere with me tossing trash in it.  </P> <P>  -- MARSHAL, Waco, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I am a short person and I found it hard to clean a chest freezer,  but I finally discovered the trick to make it easy. After the freezer  defrosted, I got a sponge mop and mopped up the bottom of the chest. The sponge  takes up most of the water and is easy to wring out. No more bending over the  side to reach the bottom, no more wet hands and no more backaches.  </P> <P>  -- ELAINE, Northfield, N.H.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My family loves frozen waffles. However, it seems that when I  would get them to the table they would be cold.  </P> <P> So, to alleviate this problem I now heat the syrup. I place the syrup in a pan  of hot water for about 10 minutes. Now when the waffles are on the table we  pour the hot syrup over them.  </P> <P> It is delicious.  </P> <P>  -- NANCY, San Diego  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My family loves mushrooms. How can I get them sliced so the  slices will be uniform? They look so much more appetizing when they are neatly  cut and I know there has to be an easy way to do this.  </P> <P>  -- PEGGY, Boise, Ida.  </P> <P> DEAR PEGGY: You are right! There is a simple and easy method to slice them --  use an egg slicer! The slices come out evenly in just the flick of your wrist.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I remember reading in your column some time back several  different uses for chopsticks.  </P> <P> At that time I thought they were good ideas and now I can't seem to locate the  clipping. Would you please reprint this information for me.  </P> <P>  -- A READER, Orangeburg, S.C.  </P> <P> DEAR READER: Chopsticks are quite handy to have in the kitchen.  </P> <P> They are especially good for mixing eggs. They are also handy when mixing  orange juice. You can "chop" at the frozen clump and it breaks apart much  easier.  </P> <P> I also find them helpful when measuring out ingredients. They are great for  leveling off just about anything.  </P> <P> One favorite is to use one to break up clumps of dirt in the ivy sitting in the  kitchen window.  </P> <P> Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio,  Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints  received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.  </P> <P> </P></p>

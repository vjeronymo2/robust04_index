			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik for TASS]    [Text] Kiev, 23 Apr -- I have said more than once, and will  continue to insist in the future, that relations with Crimea, as  a constituent part of Ukraine, should be built on a mutually  advantageous basis. I believe that Yuriy Meshkov's statements  regarding the separation of Crimea from Ukraine are  ill-considered, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said in an  exclusive interview with UKRINFORM correspondents today.    It would appear that Meshkov is doing this out of emotion or  in order to aggravate the situation. His statements saying that  Ukraine should give up Crimea are, to say the least, not  serious. It is a territory of Ukraine that is recognized by the  whole world community, Kravchuk said.    Kravchuk believes it is unlikely that the Republic of Crimea  would be able to lead a proper life without Ukraine. If our  links are severed, the peninsula's population of almost 3  million will feel it straight away. But we do not want to give  in to emotions and arrogance, the Ukrainian president stressed.    Kravchuk believes that Meshkov's illegal actions could  become  a barrier to friendly relations and partnership between Ukraine  and Russia. That is a great responsibility for one man, who,  profiting from current misfortunes and difficulties, flouting  all international norms, is trying to separate Crimea from  Ukraine. But apart from aggravating the situation, he will not  succeed in doing anything, Kravchuk said.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY PANEL ENDORSES VENICE BEACH CRACKDOWN  </P> <P> The city Transportation Commission, seeking to ensure the safety of pedestrians  on Ocean Front Walk in Venice and elsewhere, endorsed a proposed ordinance  Thursday designed to crack down on reckless skateboarders, roller-skaters and  bicyclists. The panel also approved a second ordinance that would let the  Transportation Department establish broad restrictions over such activities.  </P> <P> Both ordinances must be approved by the City Council. Councilwoman Ruth  Galanter, who represents the Venice area, last year suggested the ban on the  "reckless operation of human-powered wheeled vehicles" in a compromise aimed at  finding a way for skaters and pedestrians to coexist on the popular beachfront  without endangering each other.  </P> <P> Her proposal was prompted by the repeal by the council of a 10-year-old  ordinance banning skateboarding and roller-skating along Ocean Front Walk,  which has been largely ignored.  </P></p>

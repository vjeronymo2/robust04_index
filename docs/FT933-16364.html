			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Property (Eastern Europe): Prague, no place for the short-term view - Buying in Europe's most scenic city needs care but prices look certain to fall PRAGUE property prices soared after the release from communism. Now, the signs are that they will stabilise at lower levels as the Czech Republic adjusts to becoming a market economy. There is also the matter of producing a reliable legal framework for transferring real estate. So, at this difficult stage, take your time if you want to buy a flat or house in one of Europe's most scenic cities. Look around and talk to as many Czechs as you can. Then, buy not for the short term but on a medium to long view - there will be no quick return on your money at west European rates. It helps if you are either Czech, have a Czech parent or live permanently there already. If you do not qualify on any of those grounds, the first essential is to set up a joint venture company (although this need not, in fact, be joint - you can provide all the capital). This leads to a long-stay residence permit which, after eight years, qualifies you for permanent residence. So says Nicholas Kirke, of Agentura Kirke, who has written two useful pamphlets*: The Prague Property Market and Buying Apartments in Prague. He adds that the initial capital required can be as low as Kc100,000 (Pounds 2,300). To save money, go directly to a Czech lawyer (he will charge less than a British one - who would have to use a Czech attorney in the end, anyway). One special problem is restitution - the return to its owners, or their heirs, of property confiscated after the communists took over in 1948. Care is needed to ensure titles are clear. So, where to buy? The Old Town (or Mala Strana), the charming old settlement across the Charles Bridge, will appeal instantly but properties are very difficult to find. You might get lucky if you are willing to take on a house with sitting tenants and help them to move elsewhere. That would take time, but you would not necessarily have to pay money to empty the flats. House bought, you would be able to renovate the flats and charge more rent than the average Pounds 12 a month a Czech pays for a two-room apartment (which includes a 100 per cent rise last July). But be prepared for hassles with the builders - and to find that a glorious, newly-painted baroque facade has hidden rot behind it. Kirke says vendors do not know what to ask and prices are tricky. He feels the situation in central Prague will ease when vendors stop selling occupied houses as if they were empty. At present, you could face a demand for Dollars 1m for such a house on the island beneath the Charles Bridge. There are two government valuations on property, although these are of limited help to foreigners in assessing the price. One is for local taxes; weighted in favour of newer houses, it could be far below the market value in the Old Town. The other is for a special tax on sales to foreigners (the law says the vendor must pay this but buyers usually end up footing the bill). It is a theoretical valuation based on what the property might fetch in other European capitals. As the tax ranges from 4 per cent of this value to 11.375 per cent, it can be an expensive extra. An alternative is to live 10 minutes away from the city centre in a well-built 1920s' or 1930s' apartment block. Kirke suggests you could buy the whole building for between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds 100,000, use the cheap and easy public transport, and rent out what you do not need for yourself. *The pamphlets cost Kc50 (Kc100 or equivalent abroad, cash with order) from Agentura Kirke, Perlova 1, 11001 Prague 1 (tel: 010-42-2-264 378).</p>

Documents proving this remittance were seized at Casto  de Andrade's fortress. Rio de Janeiro Attorney Antonio Carlos  Biscaia said: "The numbers game is no longer just the game that  so many people enjoy; it is a mask behind which several forms of  organized crime hide."    Attorneys examining the numbers game kingpins' accounts have  also found that in January 1993, Castor de Andrade deposited  $500,000 in the Swiss Banks Association. Biscaia said: "The  numbers game has been used to permeate crime throughout society,  by bribing policemen and judges, by supporting samba groups and  soccer teams, and even by financing politicians' electoral  campaigns." These accounting books list sums paid to several  candidates and contributions to political campaigns. Biscaia  said: "It is all written down in the books, even the $100,000  given to a major candidate."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 16 (AFP) -- French intellectuals will  present a "Sarajevo list" in the European elections on June 12  to denounce European inaction over Bosnia, French philospher  Andre Gluckman said on Monday [16 May].    Gluckman said the intention was "to explain to Europeans in  general and to the French people in particular that their future  is at stake over there (in Bosnia)."    In an interview with the right-wing daily LE QUOTIDIEN,  Gluckman said the "prevailing consensus is not to speak of the  massacres" in former Yugoslavia.    The Sarajevo list is being formed by Gluckman with writer  and  journalist Bernard-Henri Levy and could be headed by medical  professor Leon Schwartzenberg.    Gluckman said political will was lacking to halt the war in  former Yugoslavia although "we have the means" in NATO, which  was conceived "to resist an army of five million soldiers with  nuclear weapons, the Red Army."    Levy presented his film "Bosnia" at the Cannes Film Festival  Sunday, a two-hour panegyric to Bosnian Moslem fighters that  denounces European and American policy as preferring "a drip  feed of humanitarian aid" to providing the Bosnians with arms to  defend themselves.</p>

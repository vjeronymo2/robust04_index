			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network; passages within </F> quotation marks are recorded]    [Text] The government, which today discussed the strike  situation, has called on Solidarity to negotiate social  guarantees for employees threatened by unemployment. At the  same time, the Council of Ministers emphasized that the draft  budget, which is soon to be approved by the Sejm, cannot be  changed. A complete freeze on energy price rises is also  impossible.    [Reporter Marek Kupis] Industry Minister Marek Pol said the  government agreed with Solidarity's basic demand for an increase  in real pay. He added that the strike in the mining and steel  industries, announced by Solidarity, could weaken the economic  position of these enterprises.    [Marek Pol] "This could very strongly affect the weak  economy  of the mining sector. That is apart from the issue of energy  security of the state. We all depend on energy; we all depend  on coal. This could very strongly affect the entire Polish  industry and what all employees at all enterprises are going to  feel."    [Kupis] Labor Minister Leszek Miller has called on the trade  unionists to hold talks and halt strike actions.    [Labor Minister Leszek Miller] "If the Solidarity trade  unionists decide to discuss the housing reform program, social  benefits, problems of unemployment, or other issues that are  vital for thousands of Polish families, I can confirm again that  there is an open place at the negotiating table."    [Kupis] According to Public Opinion Research Center  research,  in September one Pole in four thought that the situation in the  country was going in the right direction. In November, there  were 20 percent more optimists. But in February the level of  optimism fell below that of September.    [Miller] "Well, the honeymoon is slowly coming to an end. I  am thinking of good relations with the government and an influx  of public expectations. This, as far as I remember, applies to  every government team. And now the dull daily life begins."    [Kupis] Ministers maintain that the government will now have  to prove that the election slogans about an economic policy with  a human face were not merely empty promises.</p>

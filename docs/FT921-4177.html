			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Saatchi falls sharply into Pounds 63m loss: Advertising group reports worse-than-expected decline over 15-month period SAATCHI and Saatchi, the world's second largest advertising and marketing services company, yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 63.6m for the 15 months to the end of December 1991; on a 12-month basis the pre-tax loss was Pounds 58.4m against pre-tax profits of Pounds 35.6m for the year to September 1990. The larger-than-expected losses were primarily due to exceptional items totalling Pounds 54.5m during the last 15 months, including provisions made for leases on vacant property, as well as costs incurred in closing and merging several small companies. Severance costs alone amounted to Pounds 20.8m in 1991 (Pounds 9.7m in 1990). Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive, added that two companies within the group made 'large losses' in 1991; he declined to say which companies had performed badly, but it is believed that the group's consultancy businesses are lagging. Before consideration for exceptional items, the group made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.1m for the 15 months. Over the 12-month period that loss was Pounds 3.5m. On a 12-month calculation, the group registered underlying declines of 2.3 per cent in revenues to Pounds 739.8m (Pounds 757.6m in 1990) and of 49 per cent in trading profits, to Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 40.2m in 1990). Mr Louis-Dreyfus said that net debt averaged Pounds 200m in the final quarter of 1991 and ended the year at Pounds 180m. The group's trading figures were affected by recession in the US and the UK. During 1990, the US accounted for a Pounds 22m trading profit, falling to Pounds 10.2m in 1991; in the UK a 1990 trading profit of Pounds 7.2m transformed into a trading loss of Pounds 4.3m last year. However, the group did better in the rest of Europe, increasing trading profits from Pounds 9.4m (1990) to Pounds 14.4m (1991). Mr Louis-Dreyfus said the group was budgeting for a slight decline in revenues this year, though he believed that a more stable advertising market was likely and that 1992 'will mark the start of a sustainable improvement in operating margins and profitability'. He added that he did not anticipate any severance costs this year, but that a three-year phased introduction of an incentive scheme for the 300 most senior executives would gradually reduce the Pounds 300m salary bill by 1.5 per cent of group revenues, a potential cost reduction of about Pounds 11m annually.

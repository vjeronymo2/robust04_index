			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Letter: Answer for GM simple Sir, The solution to the problem of funding General Motors' Saturn Corporation ('Saturn profit poses funding dilemma - A milestone in the history of GM's innovative sports car', June 24) is all too obvious: issue a tranche of shares in the company to the public and institutions. Saturn was founded by GM as a stand-alone company capable of directing its own destiny. Now that it is turning the corner GM should be willing to allow outside investors to participate so that Saturn can realise its full business potential - thereby benefiting GM as well. Such a strategy would enhance Saturn's stand-alone authority and responsibility and help accelerate its long-overdue export programme. The global fame of this pioneering project is not yet being significantly exploited in markets outside North America. Karl Ludvigsen, chairman, Ludvigsen Associates, 73 Collier Street, London N1 7JU</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Call for more competition in market JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance yesterday called for a loosening of the strong ties between ministries and corporations and for a more transparent and competitive market economy. In a report entitled 'The market economy and the government's role', the ministry says that while the bureaucrat-corporate links have helped Japan become a economic power, they have prevented the development of competition and transparency in financial markets and industries. Japan's new reformist parties are blaming the country's bureaucrats for inefficiency and higher prices and calling for a smaller government ahead of tomorrow's election. The guiding hand of the government, which has nurtured industries, is now seen as a barrier preventing foreign competition. At the same time, 'the nation's consensus over priority to corporations is deteriorating,' says the report. The ministry says the spate of stock market scandals, involving compensation by stockbrokers to favoured clients who incurred losses, was due to the lack of competition and transparency caused by governmental protection. In spite of its admissions that the powerful bureaucrats are now obstructing further maturity of the country's economy, it remains to be seen whether the Ministry of Finance is willing to follow its own recommendations. After the plunge in the Tokyo stock market last August, the ministry was criticised for supporting share prices by pumping in public pension and insurance funds. Investors' concern over the reregulation of the equity market has heightened as the ministry and financial regulators tightened restrictions on controversial stock futures trading.</p>

Speaking at a press conference at the end of his visit, Qian  termed his visit to Iran as "successful and fruitful," hoping  that the two countries will promote their bilateral relation in  various fields.    "The Chinese and Iranian peoples shared historical and  friendly relations and bilateral cooperation between the two  countries has been well expanded in recent years," said the  foreign minister, who arrived here Friday [4 March].    Trade between the two countries hit the historical height  last year, he said, but "both the two sides believe that there  are more potentials for cooperation in various fields."    Iran, which is the bridge between Asia and Europe, has its  strategic importance, said Qian, adding that Beijing-Tehran  relation is based on mutual respect, mutual benefit and  non-interference in each other's internal affairs.    He believed that the friendly relations between the two  Asian  countries will help maintain peace and stability in the region.    Referring to the result of his tour of five Asian countries,  including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Iran,  Qian said that Asian countries have many points in common  despite their differences in religion, politics and culture.    All these countries are trying to improve their economic  situation and are ready for regional cooperation, the Chinese  vice-premier said, adding that these countries share same or  similar views on many important issues.    He also announced China's readiness to expand friendly  cooperation with these Asian countries.    Asked about China's view on the report that Washington set  the improvement of human rights state in China as the  precondition for extending most favored trade status to China,  Qian opposed any linkage between politics and trade, saying that  they are two separate issues and there are no direct links  between the two issues.    On his part, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati  said that bilateral ties as well as regional and international  issues were the main topics for Qian's talks with Iranian  leaders.    Iran and China have achieved a great deal of successes in  their cooperation, particularly in economic cooperation,  Velayati said. Trade between the two countries exceeded 700  million U.S. dollars last year, the highest in the history of  the two countries.    Iran and China share same or similar views on many regional  and international issues, said Velayati, adding that relations  between the two countries are based on independent foreign  policy.    He hoped that the bilateral relations will be further  expanded.</p>

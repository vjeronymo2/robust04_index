			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Letter: Not asked Sir, Your Observer column considers it surprising ('Enterprising initiative', March 18) that I signed neither Sir Allen Sheppard's letter in support of the party of enterprise, nor Lord Tombs's letter protesting at the ditching of Margaret Thatcher in 1990. Not so, I simply wasn't asked. Young, House of Lords, London SW1</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / SIB review holds mixed bag for life insurers Stark differences in how far individual life insurance companies will have to go in re-examining their personal pension cases are set to emerge when City regulators review progress on compensating the victims of pension mis-selling. The Securities and Investments Board, the chief financial watchdog, is to look again in a year's time at the plans it set out this week for providing redress to people harmed by poor advice in buying a personal pension. A study by actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow suggested that 850,000 people were advised to take a personal pension and to opt out of, or not to join, an occupational scheme. Its publication sparked renewed concern about standards of selling in the life insurance industry. SIB's review will assess whether cases of investors less likely to be at risk than the 350,000 cases in high priority categories also need to be examined, or whether work can be scaled back because the extent of mis-selling is less than feared. Companies which could show that they had few or no victims in the categories of investors most at risk could find their workload reduced, or the timescale for achieving it relaxed. But insurers with a high rate of poor advice or large numbers of doubtful cases are likely to be told to re-examine additional categories of pensions sold. SIB has set a deadline which should mean that most priority cases are reviewed by the end of 1996. But starting the process of identifying people who were badly advised to opt out of, or not to join, an occupational pension scheme may not start until early next year. The regulator is designing the questionnaire which must be sent to all employed personal pension customers as a first step, and the market research it has commissioned on this may not be complete until mid-December. TSB, the banking and insurance group, yesterday joined other insurers in playing down the extent of possible further provisions against potential pension claims. Mr John Elbourne, TSB's head of retail banking, said fewer than 9,000 of the 55,000 cases where the group had sold personal pensions to people transferring lump sums out of employers' schemes were in the SIB's highest priority category. He added that more than half the 80,000 personal pensions sold to employed people had been taken out since 1990, when the group banned sales to people opting out of occupational schemes.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / London Markets: Touch wood, we're past the trough JUST AROUND the corner from the FT's offices in Southwark, a notice-board outside a reconditioned office block proudly boasts that it is now 25 per cent let. When a letting rate that would once have been a confession of failure is touted as a sign of success, you do not have to take the river bus to Docklands to realise just how grim is the outlook for London's property market. Curiously, the property crash appears to have had little wider impact on UK financial markets. When the administrators moved into Canary Wharf on Thursday, for example, the effect on shares was negligible: the FT-SE index closed down only 4.4 points. The impact on the banks has also been surprisingly muted. Since the property market peaked in late 1989, property shares have halved against the All-Share, but bank shares have risen nearly a tenth in relative terms. Along the way, there seems to have been no great correlation between the two indices: downward lurches in property shares have left the banks unaffected. On the whole, their shares have moved pretty much in line with the market as a whole, reflecting the view, presumably, that the performance of the banks' loan books depends on the overall health of the economy, rather than any individual sector. The worst damage to the banks' balance sheets has been done by the thousands of small business bankruptcies, particularly in the service sector. In such cases, there is often little in the way of assets to back up a loan, and hence little prospect of getting much of the money back. From this point of view, the most significant economic news of the past week - as reported by one big bank finance director yesterday  - is that loan problems among his small business customers seem to have bottomed out in the first quarter. Treat that view with caution, because that is the way it was offered: indeed, the director concerned clutched the wall as soon as the words had left his mouth, in an effort to touch any piece of wood within reach. Still, his comments can be added to the increasing evidence that a slow, faltering recovery began for much of the economy towards the end of the first quarter. The latest macro-economic support for that view came in the trade figures, out on Tuesday, which showed a sharp pickup in imports. SG Warburg's economists, mulling over the surprising way in which imports have been rising while the economy has continued weak, offer as one explanation the possibility of an unexpectedly large rebound in output in the current quarter, now two-thirds completed. Simultaneously, however, they revised their forecast of gdp growth for the year down again, to growth of 0.2 per cent. That implies that the consensus forecast of 0.8 per cent growth this year, given in an FT survey of City and academic forecasters published on Thursday, may already need downward revision. The two sides of the new market consensus on the recovery - that it has probably already started, but that it will be hard to distinguish with the naked eye from the recession that preceded it - probably account for the continued retreat of share prices from their mid-May peak. Since May 11, when it reached a new record of 1326.36, the FT-Actuaries All-Share index has dropped 1.1 per cent, closing yesterday at 1311.79. The chart alongside show some of the ingredients of the surge that followed the election and the subsequent correction. The most striking bar on the chart shows the water companies' shares: they have risen by slightly under a third since the election, easing off a trifle since the market peaked. Other sectors where there was a particularly marked contrast between performance in the market's two most recent legs are also shown on the chart. Conglomerates, for example, has dropped so much in the past few weeks - 6 per cent - that they have almost wiped out their immediate post-election gains. Health and Household, dominated by the big pharmaceutical stocks, has actually fallen since the election, dragged down by a 3 per cent fall since May 11. This represents a slightly unpromising environment for the big Wellcome share sale, for which a first prospectus (a 'pink herring' rather than a red herring, in investment-banker's jargon) will be published next Thursday. Two sectors where performance in the past couple of weeks has bucked the general downward trend include Electricals, up nearly 4 per cent since May 11, and Oil and Gas, up 6 per cent. The oil shares have done particularly well since the unexpected success of the Opec countries in reaching agreement on output at their meeting in Vienna on May 22. North Sea oil prices reached Dollars 20.45 a barrel on Tuesday, the highest price since December. Analysts wondered whether the Opec agreement represented a fundamental shift in Saudi oil policy, towards the price hawks and away from its traditional preference for volume rather than price. As usual, Saudi Arabia's motives could be interpreted in any number of ways. Since early April, when the oil shares began their run, Shell have risen 18 per cent, and BP 12 per cent. An account of the week would not be complete without a note of one of its less-spectacular insolvencies. Belling and Co, the privately owned cooker manufacturer, passed into receivership on Friday. The sad event is more than just the triumph of the microwave; in its hey-day, the company sent out Baby Bellings in their thousands to the bedsits of Britain. For a generation of greying veterans of the 1960s, another part of youth has slipped away. And who's got my copy of How to Cheat at Cooking?</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Arab bank chief to step down Arab Banking Corp has confirmed that its president and chief executive Mr Abdulla Saudi, a Libyan national, is stepping aside effective May 1, Reuter reports from Manama. 'Notwithstanding record-breaking results for 1993, the board of directors reluctantly agreed with the president and chief executive that, owing to external circumstances, such a decision was necessary to protect shareholders' interests and safeguard the bank's future,' the bank said. The board has appointed Khalifa al-Muhairy, co-deputy chairman of the bank, to chair a committee which will be entrusted with the responsibilities of chief executive officer pending a permanent appointment, it added.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CHANGES IN HEALTH CARE'  </P> <P> The Times' editorial "Changes in Health Care" (Jan. 2) revives the hope that,  somehow, two new presidential commissions reviewing our country's health  problems may discover a new "magic bullet" solution.  </P> <P> Government and private studies have addressed these problems over at least the  last 20 years.  </P> <P> Voluntary efforts to constrain runaway hospital charges have failed. Efforts to  transfer increasing costs to patients have resulted in more than a million new  people denied access to medical care each year. Charges for doctors' services  continue to escalate. The results are that American consumers pay more per  capita for health services than any nation in the world.  </P> <P> In the absence of a "magic bullet" we need to recognize (a) partial patchwork  reforms don't work; (b) comprehensive changes in how health care services are  delivered and financed are essential; (c) national and state budget controls  with increased public financing are a must, and (d) universal access to care is  essential.  </P> <P> MELVIN A. GLASSER  </P> <P> Director, Committee for National Health Insurance  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

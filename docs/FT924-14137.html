			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Bitter prelude for US debate THE BITTER war of words between the campaigns of President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton continued yesterday as their candidates and Mr Ross Perot, the other contender, prepared for last night's critical first televised presidential debate. The debate could prove a pivotal moment in the campaign. It constitutes probably the president's last opportunity to cut into Mr Clinton's appreciable lead in all the public opinion polls, which continue to suggest that the sharply negative turn in Republican campaigning is having no impact on voter sentiment. A national poll out this weekend by Newsweek gave Mr Clinton 44 per cent, Mr Bush 35 per cent and Mr Perot 12 per cent. This survey, virtually unchanged in its overall numbers from last week's, has of late consistently given Mr Clinton a smaller lead than others, which are now mostly in the 14-16 points range. Two polls in key swing states told a similar story. In Georgia, which Mr Bush carried by 19 points in 1988, Mr Clinton was ahead by 44-38-7. In Michigan, another comfortable Republican victory four years ago, the split was 50-31-8. Mr Charles Black, a senior adviser to Mr Bush, said in an interview that Mr Clinton 'must meet a threshold level of trust, which he has not passed yet'. He said Mr Clinton's 1970 trip to Moscow raised 'a legitimate question' about the Democratic candidate's judgment. Mr George Stephanopoulos, the Democrat's communications director, yesterday again raised Mr Bush's involvement with the Iran-Contra scandals and with the courting of Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait as evidence that could be used against Mr Bush's 'judgment'. He drew particular attention to the latest revelations in the BNL affair. The Washington Post endorsed Mr Clinton in an editorial yesterday. Its preference was not surprising, but its language towards Mr Bush was conspicuously harsh.</p>

In a current situation report delivered to various  circles yesterday morning [7 January], the provincial  statistical bureau pointed out: According to preliminary  estimates, the provincial GDP for the year 1993 was 145.4  billion yuan, up 15.2 percent over 1992, making it one of the  three years in which the growth rate exceeded 15 percent since  reform and opening up began.    Sustained and speedy growth of the economy has significantly  increased the composite strength of this province. Last year,  party and government leaders at various levels paid more  attention to agriculture and set forth a series of policies for  increasing input into agriculture, consolidating the status of  agriculture as the foundation of the economy, and reducing  burdens on peasants. The role of the market in guiding  agricultural production has been strengthened. Thanks to all  this, plus favorable weather conditions, total yields of grain  and oil reached record highs. The grain output was 35 billion  kg, an increase of over 10 percent; the output of oil-bearing  crops increased by 42.3 percent; and that of cotton equalled the  previous year.    Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery  developed steadily. The total output value of agriculture is  estimated at 67.5 billion yuan. Township and town enterprises  showed a strong momentum of growth. Rural economic development  was well rounded.    Industrial production grew rapidly, with a good balance  between production and marketing. The total industrial output  value for the year is estimated to exceed [figure indistinct],  up more than 20 percent. The growth rate at and above the  township level was 21 percent and the production-to-marketing  rate was 96 percent. The growth rate of non-state-run industry  was far higher than that of state-run industry.    After the power of investment [words indistinct] was  delegated to lower levels, localities were enthusiastic in  investment. The total investment in fixed assets is estimated  at 42.4 billion yuan, up more than 30 percent. This rate is  nearly eight percentage points higher than 1992. Key projects  made smooth progress.    The consumer goods market province-wide maintained a surplus  of supply. Commodities were in abundant supply and marketing  was basically stable, showing brisk movement. Consumption in  urban areas had a quick growth, while rural markets were picking  up at a faster pace. The general index of retail prices was  basically stable, with a tendency to rise. The increase rate is  estimated at 10 percent, the lowest among 30 provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions.    In addition, the monetary order in this province is  approaching normality, and revenue kept increasing from month to  month in the fourth quarter. Utilization of foreign capital  increased by a big margin. The living standards of urban and  rural people were further upgraded.    The provincial statistical bureau pointed out: The economic  performance of our province in 1993 has laid a foundation and  accumulated experience for the development in 1994. As long as  we conscientiously implement the spirit of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, handle well the  relationship among reform, development, and stability, and  strengthen monitoring of economic operation, we are bound to be  able to realize the sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  growth of the whole province this year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sun Yong (1327 0516)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- Li Lanqing, vice premier  of the State Council, invited a number of State Council  counselors to Zhongnanhai this morning for a informal meeting to  solicit their views on China's education reform.    Speaking at the meeting, Counselors Zhang Houcan, Tang  Sheng,  Zhou Xiqing, Lu Deyun, Shen Daming, Tang Zongshun, Deng Yinyin,  Li Jiahua, and Zhou Jing affirmed the achievements made in  China's education. At the same time, they pointed out: we  leaders at all levels should further enhance our awareness of  the strategic role of education in socialist construction. We  must set up school disciplines in a scientific way and according  to the laws governing education. While giving students  knowledge, we must cultivate their independence and creativity.  We must strengthen advanced in-service study and training of  teachers. The counselors also gave their opinions and  suggestions on raising teachers' pay and benefits as well as  other issues.    Li Lanqing earnestly listened to the counselors' views,  thanking them for their concern and support of China's  education. He said: China is a developing country, not well-off  in economic terms. To run the world's largest educational  system, it is necessary to gradually increase investment in  education as the economy develops. The fundamental approach,  however, is through reform. The State Council and local  authorities are actively but prudently promoting education  reform on the basis of the "Outline for China's Education Reform  and Development" to raise teaching qualities and improve the  social effect of school education.    Li Lanqing said: At present, it is necessary to concentrate  on improving basic education first. This is a fundamental issue  affecting the improvement of the entire nation's standards. At  the same time, we must vigorously develop vocational education  at the elementary, middle, and secondary levels as well as adult  education to train more practical personnel needed in society.  Higher education should be reformed to improve its teaching  quality and social effects. To make our education more  successful, it is necessary to raise the awareness of society as  a whole, particularly the awareness of leading cadres at all  levels, on the strategic importance of developing education on a  priority basis, and it is necessary to foster a social ethics of  respecting teachers and valuing education. Li Lanqing urged all  counselors to continue their investigation and research in this  regard and give their views and proposals on improving education  to the State Council.</p>

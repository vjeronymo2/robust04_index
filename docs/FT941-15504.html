			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Strong orders fail to brighten Siemens' outlook Siemens, the electrical and electronics multinational, expects earnings to fall by between 10 and 15 per cent in the current financial year, in spite of a strong flow of orders in the first quarter. Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of the German group, yesterday warned against drawing hasty conclusions from the 15 per cent rise in demand recorded in the three months to December. Mr von Pierer based his estimate of lower earnings on assumptions that financial income of DM2.1bn last year, compared with about DM1bn in 1991/92, would fall. 'We cannot assume that capital market conditions will remain unfailingly favourable.' Siemens-Nixdorf (SNI), the loss-making computer business would return a deficit of about DM300m (Pounds 117m), according to Mr Karl-Hermann Baumann, finance director. SNI last year reduced its deficit from more than DM500m to about DM400m. The company, which shed 5,000 workers last year, would again be hit by plans for some 10,000 group-wide job cuts in the current year. According to Mr von Pierer, the computer business still hopes to break even in 1996. Officials said they expected semi-conductors, another drain on profits, to return to the black in 1995. Mr von Pierer rejected speculation that the departure of Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig as chairman of SNI was premature because of his failure to turn the business round. Mr Wiedig, who is to hand over to Mr Gerhard Schulmeyer, head of ABB in the US, on October 1, had told him that 10 years in data processing was enough. SNI was doing better than many others in the computer business, Mr von Pierer claimed. New mid-range products had been well received. Volume sales of personal computers had doubled, although the business was still suffering from falling prices. The company's problems stemmed from a culture clash when Siemens and Nixdorf were merged in 1990. Those problems were compounded by a collapse in the industry worldwide and by the recession, Mr von Pierer said. Group pre-tax profit for the last financial year fell 9 per cent to DM2.9bn and net income increased marginally to DM1.98bn. During the first quarter of the new year, foreign orders rose 33 per cent to DM13.2bn, but only 8 per cent when adjusted for the distorting effects of booking large Asian contracts and for the inclusion of the Osram Sylvania lighting business in the US. The domestic order book, heavily dependent on public contracts, fell by 6 per cent to DM8.2bn. Details of new orders booked for the last financial year, which were released yesterday, showed clear signs of the recession and of reduced government spending, particularly in Germany. Demand for public communications, the group's biggest single business, fell 7 per cent to DM13.4bn after rising by 10 per cent the previous year. The KWU power generation division booked an increase of only 1 per cent. However, fast-growing businesses, such as private communications and railway operations, showed increased orders of 15 and 25 per cent respectively. Lex, Page 22 World stock markets, Page 37</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Guwahati, May 8.    As expected, the internal crisis in the Bodoland People's  Party [BPP] has further intensified.    The first annual conference of the BPP at Bodobazar in Bijni  in Bongaigaon district, under the chairmanship of its president  Mr. Sansuma Khunggur Bwiswmutiary (6-7 May), expelled Mr.  Premsing Brahma, presently the Chief Executive Member of the  Bodoland Autonomous Council (BAC) and General Secretary of the  BPP, from the primary membership of the BPP.    At another two-day conference of the BPP, also described as  the first annual conference, held at Tamulpar in Nalbari  district on 29-30 April, Mr. Sansuma Khunggur Bwiswmutiary  himself had been removed from the presidentship of the BPP and  replaced by Mr. Premsing Brahma.    The Bijni conference appointed Mr. Rabiram Brahma, the  General Secretary of the All Bodo Students' Union (ABSU)  throughout the years of the Bodoland agitation and, who had  recently resigned as Executive Member of the BAC, as General  Secretary of the BPP it annulled the expulsion of Mr. Baliram  Boro, Vice-President of the BPP, from the party, and reinstated  him in his original position. The decision to expel Mr. Baliram  Boro had been taken on April 18 following public criticism by  Mr. Baliram Boro of some of the actions of Mr. Premsing Brahma  and his supporters in the BAC, particularly disbursement of BAC  funds.    According to reports available in Guwahati, the Bijni  conference was attended by about a thousand delegates  representing eight of the 11 district committees of the BPP.    On the face of it, these developments appear all too typical  of any fledgling political party and seem to be based on  personal rivalries and accusations of financial irregularities  as well as frustrations over the non-implementation of the Bodo  accord, in particular the refusal of the State Government to  include 515 more villages (in addition to the 2,750 already  notified) in the BAC area. However, beyond these real and  manufactured grievances are some more fundamental issues  touching on the "Bodo national question" that animated the  Bodoland agitation -- issues which the Bodo accord did not even  touch upon.    It is true that Mr. Hiteswar Saikia has exploited the more  superficial of the differences among Bodo leaders with a view to  splitting the leadership and finally marginalising the Bodo  nationalist aspirations -- as he has done in the case of ULFA  [United Liberation Front of Assam]. Nevertheless, such  developments do not mean that one faction of the Bodo leadership  is less sensitive to those more basic issues than the other or  that one faction has compromised itself by agreeing to have a  working relationship with Mr. Hiteswar Saikia -- the charge  brought against Mr. Premsing Brahma by Mr. Bwiswmutiary and his  supporters. For, whoever occupies political office in the BAC  structure will, by definition, be tarred as a  "collaborationist," with those excluded adopting, apparently out  of necessity, a more nationalist posture.    Viewed from a broader perspective, however, there seems to  be  an underlying unity of perception on Bodo 'national' aspirations  even in the midst of all these wrangles. And as these  developments enfeeble all the organically related structures  committed to the Bodo accord and the fulfilment of these  aspirations within the ambit of the Indian Constitution -- the  ABSU, the BPP and the BAC -- the only certain gainer will be the  most extreme and explicitly secessionist of the Bodo nationalist  structures, the Bodo Security Force, waiting in the wings to  pick up the pieces and appropriate the Bodo movement.</p>

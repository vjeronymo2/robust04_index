			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- A business leader urged  Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday [10 May] to  achieve progress in economic reform to ensure domestic economic  recovery and a better relationship with the United States.    "Steadfast progress in economic reform is vital to a sure  turnaround in the economy and improvement in the Japan-U.S.  relationship," said Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Association  of Corporate Executives [Keizai Doyukai], visiting Hata at his  headquarters.    He called on the premier to move forward with economic  reforms, including deregulation, which former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa had implemented.    Hayami's comments met with approval from Hata, who said he  agreed with the business leader's view completely.    Hayami also said he hoped the bill for dividing the nation  into 300 single-seat electoral districts for House of  Representatives elections would be enacted soon, and that  efforts would be made for tax system reforms.</p>

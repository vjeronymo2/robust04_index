			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: D-Mark weaker across board THE D-Mark weakened across the board following the 9 basis-point drop in the rate for two-week German securities repurchase agreements to 6.29 per cent, writes Conner Middelmann. The French franc firmed to FFr3.465 against the D-Mark, from FFr3.476 at Monday's close. The Belgian franc rose to BFr21.23 per D-Mark from Monday's BFr21.35. The Italian lira also edged higher against the D-Mark, closing at L978.2, from L984.5 on Monday. While the fall in the German repo rate had been largely discounted, it was seen to facilitate near-term rate cuts among its European neighbours, notably France and Belgium. This underpinned those countries' currencies on the belief that further rate cuts will revive their flagging economies. The Danish krone also firmed against the D-Mark, in spite of yesterday's 1/4 point cut in its two-week certificate of deposit rate to 7.50 per cent and Monday's  1/4 point reduction in its discount and deposit rates to 6.75 per cent. The krone rose to around DM3.9765, from DM3.9935 on Monday. While many market participants expect the Bank of Denmark to continue cutting rates independently of the Bundesbank, some say it may start to throttle the easing pace. 'They are being very cautious - like the Bank of France, they do not want to trigger speculative flows out of their currency,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS. Although the Danish krone has put on a strong performance in absolute terms since the European exchange rate mechanism was revamped on August 2, it nevertheless remains the weakest currency in the EMS currency grid. Sterling also received a boost from the German repo rate reduction, breaching a key technical resistance level at DM2.5175 and closing at DM2.5275. Today's UK retail sales and price data will be closely watched and could provide further upside for the pound, traders said. The US dollar remained subdued in tense trading as dealers awaited the result of today's vote in the US congress on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The outcome of the vote is expected to be known around 0100GMT. While the vote still appeared to be a close call, cautious optimism that the trade pact might scrape through congress supported the dollar in late London trading. The US currency continued its slow recovery against the Japanese yen, closing at Y106.55, up from Monday's Y106.50. Against the D-Mark it ended at DM1.7020, up from DM1.6900. New York trading finished with the dollar at Y106.75 and DM1.7060. The Canadian dollar slipped to CDollars 1.3212 against the US dollar after the Canadian government announced its budget deficit for the current fiscal year would be CDollars 40.5bn, compared to previous forecasts of CDollars 35.5bn. The currency closed at CDollars 1.3190.</p>

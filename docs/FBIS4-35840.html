			<p>BFN     [Text] A Foreign Office spokesman in Islamabad today  expressed Pakistan's serious concern over the final trial launch  of the Prithvi missile by India. He said if India proceeds with  the deployment, a qualitatively new threat will be posed to  Pakistan's security. It will lead inevitably to a missile race  in South Asia and accentuate the danger of nuclear arms  proliferation in this region.    The spokesman said Pakistan has repeatedly warned the  international community that India's deployment of missiles  threatens nuclear arms race and destabilizes the South Asian  region. It would also threaten all the countries of the Gulf,  Central Asia, China and parts of Southeast Asia, evoking  defensive responses and eroding stability. The spokesman called  upon the international community, especially the members of the  Missile Technology Control Regime, to prevent India from  crossing a critical and possibly irrevocable threshold through  the deployment of the Prithvi missile.</p>

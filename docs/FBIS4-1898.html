			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin by </F> unidentified TA KUNG PAO reporter in Guangzhou on 25 February:  "Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin Answers TA KUNG PAO Reporter's  Questions"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 25 Feb (TA KUNG PAO)--Guangdong Governor  Zhu Senlin was interviewed by this reporter in Guangzhou today.  The full text of the interview follows:    [TA KUNG PAO] Looking toward the next few years of the post-  transition period of Hong Kong, how will Guangdong and Hong Kong  cooperate? Have any new plans and measures been promulgated  which can help the two places to converge with one another on  economic affairs, trade, and key projects and to jointly fight  against crime?    [Zhu] Economic exchanges and cooperation between Guangdong  and Hong Kong has been getting closer and closer since we  started implementing the policy of reform and opening up.  Approximately 80 percent of the trade volume of the entire  province goes through Hong Kong, and 80 percent of direct  investment by Chinese and foreign businessmen which utilizes  foreign capital originates from Hong Kong. Likewise, our  province's rapid economic growth during the 15 years of reform  and opening up, the vigorous development of joint-venture  enterprises, and the investment in Hong Kong by enterprises from  our province has also played a vital role in promoting Hong  Kong's prosperity. At present, the economic ties between  Guangdong and Hong Kong are as close as lips and teeth. Over  the next few years of the post-transition period, Hong Kong will  be able to bring into full play its superiority as an  international financial, trade, transport, and information  center. At the same time, our province will be able to bring  into full play our superiority of having rich human and land  resources, a full complement of production industries, low  production costs, and a certain level of scientific and  technological strength. While supplementing one another, our  cooperation in many areas can advance to a new stage, such as  the construction and convergence of infrastructure, the  adjustment and upgrading of the industrial structure, the  vigorous development of new- and high-technological industries,  and the opening up of the international market. Moreover, the  two places can further cooperate with one another in fighting  crime.    As far as economic cooperation and trade is concerned, we  are  formulating the following plans: (1) Guangdong and Hong Kong  can work through various channels, such as business circles, the  financial sector, various social groups, and government  departments. These exchanges can take many forms, such as  conducting reciprocal visits and holding symposiums, trade  fairs, and sales promotions to explore and enhance economic  exchange and cooperation between the two places. (2) Guangdong  will widen the scope of foreign economic cooperation, will  improve the investment atmosphere, will create a market  environment for fair competition, and will vigorously attract  financial groups from Hong Kong which have good reputations and  abundant funds to invest in public utilities and basic  industries, including power, communications, and some large  industrial projects (for example, ethylene, oil refining, iron  and steel, automobile, and other projects.) (3) Guangdong will  utilize these channels and client relationships to open up a  plural market, will vigorously take part in the international  division of labor and competition, and will make our own efforts  in maintaining economic prosperity in Guangdong and Hong Kong.    Regarding convergence on key projects, the construction of  all key projects in our province will be stringently proved in a  scientific manner. For those that are linked to Hong Kong, all  factors -- including social, economic, environmental, and  security issues -- will be carefully considered. At present,  the concerned departments from both sides are making frequent  contacts with one another to accomplish the work of converging  key projects. This year, we are prepared to hold a symposium on  the development of transportation and communications between  Guangdong and Hong Kong, with the key lying in coordinating the  development and convergence of transportation and communications  between the two places.    As far as the task of fighting crime is concerned, we intend  to enhance our cooperation with the Hong Kong side in the  following areas: First, efforts will be made to exchange more  information on crime, to quickly inform one another about  criminal activities, and to provide timely assistance to the  other side in finding clues and investigating and prosecuting  criminals. Second, efforts will be made to enhance cooperation  in fighting all types of crimes, particularly in cracking cases  of armed crimes, kidnapping, drug trafficking, smuggling, and  swindling, pursuing and capturing those listed as wanted  criminals at large, and retrieving spoils. Third, efforts will  be made to enhance cooperation in cracking down on triad crime.  As far as the triad issue is concerned, our principles are as  follows: (1) Overseas triad societies are not allowed, under  whatever circumstances, to seek development and expand their  influence on the mainland, and we will resolutely crack down on  and ban any triad activities that are found; (2) Overseas triad  elements who violate the law and commit crimes in the mainland  will be severely punished in accordance with the law; (3)  Overseas triad elements and all criminals who have committed  offenses should harbor no illusions about escaping to the  mainland, as we will pursue and capture them once they have been  found and will turn them over to the police at their place of  origin; (4) We will fight against activities conducted by  criminal rings on the mainland which are triad groups by nature.  They should never be tolerated. Fourth, efforts will be made  to enhance cooperation and exchange in anticrime skills, and the  two places will take concerted actions to discuss this issue and  study new skills.    [TA KUNG PAO] As Guangdong is going to select a site for  the construction of its second nuclear power station, and Zhuhai  is gong to build the Lingding Yang Bridge, which will link up  with Tuen Mun. How are the plans for these projects progressing?    [Zhu] Regarding the selection of a site for the construction  of our second nuclear power station, because our province is  rapidly developing its economy and has a great demand for  energy, it will not work if we simply rely on coal, petroleum,  and other conventional energy sources. Instead, we must have a  multiple structure, and, hence, it is necessary to vigorously  develop nuclear power. From a long-term point of view, this is  an important way to solve the problem of the demand for energy  in our province. In order to develop and to meet the power  supply needs for the next century, it is not only necessary for  Guangdong to build a second nuclear power station but third and  fourth ones as well. The work of selecting the sites for the  second and third power stations has been carried out for many  years, and both Lingao of Daya Wan and Dongping of Yangjiang  have been determined ideal sites. Of course, the construction  project of the second nuclear power station must be finally  examined and approved by the State Council.    As far as the site selection and construction of the second  and third nuclear power stations is concerned, I know the people  of Hong Kong are very concerned about it. I can definitely tell  all of you that a set of strict surveillance measures will be  used in the area within 5 km of the stations and another set  will apply between 5 and 50 km. In any case, in building the  new power stations, we will follow Premier Li Peng's  instructions that "safety must be the top priority."    The construction of the Lingding Yang Bridge in Zhuhai is a  project which will straddle the centuries and a requirement of  reform, opening up, and economic development. It plays an  important part in perfecting the layout of the coastal highways  in western Guangdong and in linking up with Hong Kong and Macao.  The feasibility report for the Lingding Yang Bridge project has  been completed and examined, and the project will be implemented  after receiving state approval.    The construction of Lingding Bridge was an original idea of  Zhuhai. The section from Zhuhai to Qiao Dao will be built in  the first phase, and the section from Qiao Dao to Hong Kong will  be built after 1997. When the time comes, I believe that it  will be much easier to talk to the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Regional Government.    [TA KUNG PAO] How will Guangdong curb commodity price rises?    [Zhu] This year, our province wants to keep the overall  level of commodity price rises within 12 percent, and our  government will try every possible means to achieve this goal,  even though it will be quite difficult to do so. First, we will  strengthen macroscopic regulation and strive to keep total  supply and demand in balance; in particular, we will guard  against excessively rapid growth in fixed-assets investment and  consumption. Second, we will pay close attention to the  production and supply of the residents' daily necessities and  try to keep the prices of the "rice bag" and "shopping basket"  stable. Third, we will further implement price reform in a  timely and moderate manner. Fourth, we will strengthen the  administration, supervision, and inspection of commodity prices  and of charges. Our government will strive to properly control  and manage prices and charges which are monopolistic,  compulsory, and protective in nature and which belong to public  welfare. Meanwhile, the practices of arbitrary price rises and  unreasonable charges will be sternly punished in accordance with  the pricing laws and policies so as to maintain the price order  of fair competition and safeguard consumers' interests. Fifth,  more work will be done to give publicity to and explain reforms  in such key areas as taxation, finance, investment, and prices  and to strive to eliminate man-made price rises.    Of course, the control we have over inflation is determined  to a very large extent by the macroeconomic environment of the  state, which will take vigorous measures to keep the scale of  fixed-asset investment and currency circulation in check so as  to control the overall level of commodity prices. The issue of  price increases is closely related to the people's lives, and  governments at all levels must make efforts to regulate  commodity prices.    [TA KUNG PAO] The central authorities have implemented key  reforms in many areas this year. Will Guangdong make some major  breakthroughs in financial and taxation reform?    [Zhu] The central authorities have implemented major reforms  in finance and taxation. Our province will strictly carry out  the reform measures taken by the central authorities and will  introduce some reform measures under the reform framework  devised by the central authorities.    As far as financial work is concerned, we must fulfill the  following tasks: (1) We must support and help the provincial  branch of the People's Bank of China to transform its functions  and strengthen monetary control, and we must also transform the  operating mechanism of professional banks, take gradual steps to  transform them into state-owned commercial banks which bear  their own risk and are truly responsible for their profits and  losses, and implement assets-liabilities ratio administration.  (2) We will take gradual steps to run urban cooperative banks  on a trial basis in major cities. (3) We will vigorously seek  the state's approval for the establishment of the Overseas  Chinese Bank. (4) We will create conditions to attract more  foreign banks and PRC-invested banks from Hong Kong and Macao to  set up branches in our province in accordance with the law, and  we will also encourage competitive financial organizations to  set up overseas branches. (5) We will develop and perfect the  provincial monetary market, which mainly relies on bank  financing, which is strictly administered, centralized and open,  and which stresses fair competition. We will also accelerate  the formation of a financial center in Guangzhou and will set up  a standardized and united provincial financing center as soon as  possible.    Guangdong and Shanghai are simultaneously creating  conditions  to accelerate the establishment of a financial center.  Shanghai, the historical financial center which is now  implementing a great plan, has vacated approximately a dozen  large buildings in order to run financial businesses and set up  the financial center of the Far East. Guangdong will set up the  financial center of South China. These two centers will have  their own particular superiority and will not be able to be  replaced by the other. Hong Kong is an international financial  center with decades of experience. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and  Macao should cooperate with one another, and this is precisely  Guangdong's superiority.    [TA KUNG PAO] When Guangdong cooperates with foreign  enterprises in various large-scale construction projects -- for  example, the Guangzhou subway and ethylene projects -- how  important are political considerations?    [Zhu] When cooperating with foreign enterprises in  large-scale construction projects, we always insist on  considering each case according to our national interests, our  industrial policies, and the needs of our national economic  development on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Taking  the Guangzhou subway project as an example, we bore six  principles in mind when choosing partners: (1) They were to  possess high prestige and have had concrete experience similar  to that required by the Guangzhou subway project; (2) the  equipment and systems provided must conform to the functional  requirements stated in the letter of requirements for  introducing equipment for the Guangzhou subway; (3) the  equipment provided should be better in terms of technology,  price, and capital (loans); (4) the equipment and systems  provided should be safer and more advanced, mature, and reliable  and must have a certain proven track record of operation; (5)  the overall package should be favorable to project management  and smooth project implementation and can also lower the overall  project investment scale; and (6) we chose the best by upholding  the principle of fair competition in line with our country's  overall economic, trade, and foreign policies. Good inter-state  relations constitute favorable conditions for our cooperation  with foreign enterprises. If inter- state relations are in a  state of abnormal development, they will inevitably affect our  cooperation with enterprises from these countries.    [TA KUNG PAO] As Guangdong and Hong Kong are closely  related, some of the reform measures introduced by Guangdong  will immediately affect Hong Kong investors. How have you taken  this into consideration?    [Zhu] Some of the current reform measures introduced by our  country -- for example, foreign exchange and foreign trade  restructuring -- will help our country administer foreign  exchange in accordance with market standards. Meanwhile, the  unitary and manageable floating exchange rate, which is set on  the basis of market demand and supply, will further strengthen  the role of market regulation in our country's foreign trade  activities. The unification of exchange rates can settle the  conflict that foreign businessmen encountered in the past when  their registered capital was calculated at the official rate,  but the profits sent out of the country were calculated at the  swap rate. The foreign exchange administration for  foreign-invested enterprises will remain unchanged, and this  will be favorable to foreign investors in China, including  investors from Hong Kong.    [TA KUNG PAO] What measures are being taken to guarantee the  safe production of a large number of foreign-invested  enterprises and to safeguard the rights and interests and  well-being of their staff and workers?    [Zhu] Over the past few years, the provincial people's  congress and the provincial government have formulated a series  of laws and regulations on guaranteeing safe production of  enterprises and safeguarding the working rights and interests of  staff and workers, including: The Guangdong Provincial  Regulations on Working Safety and Health, the Guangdong  Provincial Regulations on the Labor Administration of  Foreign-Invested Enterprises, and the Guangdong Provincial  Regulations on the Working Rights and Interests of Enterprise  Staff and Workers. These regulations are equally applicable to  foreign-invested enterprises. In the future, we will vigorously  strengthen law enforcement and supervision and guarantee the  implementation of the regulations. We are taking effective  measures to settle the existing problems and loopholes.    [TA KUNG PAO] In some counties and cities, laborers from  other provinces outnumber the number of local laborers. What is  Guangdong's attitude towards laborers from other provinces?    [Zhu] Laborers from other provinces make great contributions  to Guangdong's economic development. At present, more than 6.5  million laborers from other provinces are working in Guangdong,  thus meeting our province's labor needs in the process of  economic development. Meanwhile, laborers from other provinces  can learn skills and become more capable when they are working  in our province, which is also an important channel for bringing  Guangdong's influence and its "window" role into play.  Therefore, we welcome laborers from other provinces to work in  Guangdong. However, we must strengthen the administration and  arrangement of laborers from other provinces who are working in  Guangdong and recruit them according to our province's needs of  economic development in an organized and planned manner. At  present, the labor departments of our province have established  ties with their counterparts in eight neighboring provinces to  enhance cooperation in this respect.</p>

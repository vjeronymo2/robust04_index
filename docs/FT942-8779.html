			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / S Africa's development plan costs soar The South African government yesterday admitted that its planned reconstruction and development programme will cost more than R80bn (Pounds 14.6bn) over five years, more than twice its pre-election estimate of R39bn. The increased costs will put a severe strain on the country's financial resources and could increase inflation, reversing the recent trend toward lower price rises. Inflation fell sharply under the previous government, to below 10 per cent annually. However, the political pressure on the ANC to implement the programme, in which it promises to address a wide range of social and development issues, will be strong. The plan was the centrepiece of the party's election platform and President Nelson Mandela has committed himself publicly to full implementation. Mr Jay Naidoo, minister-without-portfolio charged with implementing the programme, admitted that the cost would be higher than expected but said he was confident it could be funded without compromising fiscal discipline. The bulk would be financed by restructuring and rationalising present government spending. The revised figures are drawn from the National Institute for Economic policy, an ANC think tank. Mr Max Sisulu, head of the institute, said that the revised estimates of R80bn-R90bn included spending by both central government and government bodies such as the electricity supplier Eskom. The anticipated costs still remain well below the R700bn figure given in a pre-election study commissioned by the outgoing National Party. Mr Sisulu said that the research, the full results of which are due to be released in the next few days, was based on the assumption that there would be no foreign grants and no marked tax changes over the first two years. The increased costs are unlikely to be reflected in this year's budget, expected to be presented to parliament on June 22. That is not expected to differ significantly from last year's as the previous government had already begun to address many of the reconstruction programme's social spending commitments in previous budgets. Mr Naidoo said the full effect would not be felt until the 1995-96 fiscal year. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange reacted negatively to the new cost estimates, with the overall index falling 70 points to end at 5387. Dealers expect no significant market movements until after President Mandela delivers his state of the nation address in parliament next Tuesday.</p>

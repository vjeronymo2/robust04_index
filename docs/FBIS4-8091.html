			<p>BFN     [Text] Brcko, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- Early this morning, Muslim  forces launched a heavy combined mortar and infantry attack from  the direction of Pejici and Pejina, seven kilometers south of  Brcko. They attacked Serb positions in the areas of Ulice,  Lukici, and Lipovac, Serb military sources have announced.    More than 20 60-mm and 82-mm mortar shells were fired on the  Serb defense lines, followed by fierce fire from infantry  weapons.    Members of the Serb republic army responded to the attack,  after which there has been a lull in this section of the  Posavlje [River Sava valley] battlefield.

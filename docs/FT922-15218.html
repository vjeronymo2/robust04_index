			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Warning of growing grain bill THE FORMER Soviet Union will have to import about 33m tonnes of grain for 1992-93 to ensure adequate supplies in key areas, according to a World Bank report published today. The Bank's Review of Food Policy Options and Agriculture Sector Reforms warns, however, that if weather conditions deteriorate significantly, import needs could rise to a 40m-45m tonne range. It puts the total 1992 food import bill for the Commonwealth of Independent States at Dollars 11bn, including the Dollars 5bn in credits and humanitarian aid already given for this year. Food imports worth between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 19bn a year from mid-1985 made a major contribution to the balance of payments crisis of 1990 and the resulting inability to continue importing food through commercial credits. The study, designed to provide a comprehensive strategy to help the country feed itself, extends from reform of agriculture to the distribution system. In a graphic example of how poor distribution is a chief cause of the country's dependence on imports, it says that 1991-92 grain imports of 37m tonnes 'would not have been necessary if grain losses could have been prevented through adequate storages'. A third of food produced is lost through poor storage, waste, theft, and inadequate transport systems. Although private agriculture, where it is allowed on small plots, has already displayed its superiority over the state sector, the report recommends a cautious approach to land reform. It recommends restructuring rather than abolishing collective and state farms, until they become efficient enterprises or are replaced by family farms. It says, however, that it will 'take many years before individual farms are established in sufficient number to have a dominant role in agricultural production.' With this in mind, it places a high value on co-operatives and the retention (but as private enterprises) of so-called machine tractor stations - common pools for equipment devised by the Bolsheviks. At the retailing end, it urges the state, which, until recently, has been bogged down in arguments about how to privatise, to take immediate steps to lease shops to managers and their workforce. It calls for the provision of small business loans and education programmes to teach retailers 'the fundamentals of good retailing and good business practices.' But it warns that this must be accompanied by rapid steps to take out of state hands and demonopolise wholesale and processing sectors. Among the effects of the liberalisation of prices in January, food prices rose four to five times on average. Meat consumption is expected to fall and there will be an increase in per capita consumption of bread, fruit, vegetables, fruit and potatoes. The report's recommendations on how the international community can help include:- Assistance for the next year or so at least with financing critical imports of food, spare parts and equipment. Direct foreign investment in projects that can be operational within six months - farm-level storage facilities, truck imports, constructing small to medium wholesale markets, and equipping new retail outlets. Loans for investment projects from multilateral and bilateral assistance programmes and technical assistance programmes.</p>

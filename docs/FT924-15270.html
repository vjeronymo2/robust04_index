			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Clinton under attack over new Nafta accords MRS Carla Hills, US trade representative, yesterday criticised as 'dead wrong' Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, who said, if elected, he would negotiate 'supplemental agreements' with Canada and Mexico to the recently-concluded North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Clinton had said more needed to be done to protect the environment, workers and farmers and guard against unexpected import surges. He urged an Environmental Protection Commission headed by Senator Al Gore, his vice-president if elected, and a commission for worker standards and safety. The speech was so unclear she was not sure 'where he comes out' because 'words seem to be strewn around to attract every view.' There had been no 'glaring omission' on worker adjustment aid, because Mr Bush had announced 'a Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn) five-year programme for workers displaced by the pact. She denied Mexican truckers could drive in the US without meeting its safety standards, that foods with pesticide residues would be allowed into the US, or that environmental safeguards were insufficient.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Thousands of Croats flee town Croat forces yesterday abandoned Vares, one of their last remaining pockets of control in central Bosnia, to the Bosnian army as thousands of civilians were reported to be fleeing the town, writes Laura Silber from Belgrade. Fearing an assault by the mostly Moslem government army, some 15,000 Croat villagers fled, with 5,000 people hiding out in a quarry south-east of Vares, the UN said. Some 10,000 people were 'on the run' in forests surrounding the town, 20 miles north of Sarajevo.</p>

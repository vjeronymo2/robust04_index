			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York, March 21 (YONHAP) -- The United Nations  Security Council on Monday held permanent members' and informal  general meetings to discuss how to handle the North Korean  nuclear dispute.    The United States presented a draft resolution on the issue  to the council's other permanent member nations -- Britain,  France, Russia and China.    The draft resolution was relatively moderate, simply urging  Pyongyang to accept additional inspections by the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), sources here said.    The 15 members of the council were briefed on a resolution  by  the IAEA board of governors and decided to ask Hans Blix,  director- general of the agency, to verbally report to the  council this Thursday before he answers questions from council  members.    The IAEA board of governors decided Monday to refer the  North  Korean nuclear problem to the Security Council, which is  empowered to impose sanctions.    The Security Council is expected to adopt a resolution early  next week, according to the sources.    The Chinese did not show any reaction to the draft  resolution  presented by the United States, saying that the home government  in Beijing must first be consulted.    Since the draft resolution does not impose sanctions on  North  Korea but gives it the opportunity to avoid such action, the  council is likely to adopt it, the sources said.    The United States consulted the South Korean mission to the  United Nations before drawing up the resolution, they noted.    The United States decided to draft a rather moderate  resolution to acknowledge that North Korea had honored at least  part of an earlier agreement with Washington, an official at the  South Korean mission said.    "It is also designed to give North Korea time to reconsider  (its decision)," he said.    He added, "now is too early to discuss imposing sanctions on  North Korea."    North Korea refused to let IAEA experts conduct full checks  at all seven declared nuclear sites earlier this month, and the  IAEA on Monday asked the UN Security Council to intervene in the  inspection dispute.</p>

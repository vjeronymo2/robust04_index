			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Closing speech by Russian President Boris Yeltsin at </F> signing ceremony of the Social Accord Treaty in the St. George's  Hall of the Moscow Kremlin -- live]    [Text] Esteemed participants in the assembly! The Treaty  on Social Accord has become a reality in Russian life. In  signing it we had only one objective: to strengthen civic peace  in the country, to make the life of Russian citizens more stable  and tranquil. The treaty does not harm the interests of any  party, organization, or association. Each signatory, while  remaining committed to his own convictions and programs, will  uphold them in an honest and peaceful political struggle for the  votes of the electorate.    The treaty places additional responsibilities and  obligations  on all those who signed it, above all on state bodies. It  spells out the priority tasks which must be resolved by the  president, the government, the Federal Assembly, and the bodies  of power in the republics and regions. These tasks must be  resolved, not separately but in close cooperation with each  other, with the political and public forces of Russia.    The most important thing now is to implement the treaty  which  we have signed. Every one of us who has signed it and will sign  it undertakes the role of guarantor of implementation of this  document. I am sure that the mass media and the Russian public  will undertake to monitor compliance with the treaty. But the  highest guarantee of the treaty's implementation will be our  practical deeds in the spirit of cooperation and mutual trust.    On behalf of those present, I invite all those for whom the  idea of accord and civic peace are dear to join the Treaty on  Social Accord. Today it has been signed and comes into force.  With all my heart, I congratulate the participants in the  assembly and the Russian citizens on this remarkable event. We  will spare no effort to ensure that civic peace becomes  established in Russia forever. Thank you.</p>

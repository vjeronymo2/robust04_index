			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Text] "When the Gaza-Jericho negotiations are completed  and an agreement with the PLO is signed we will move on to  serious negotiations with Syria," a senior political source in  Jerusalem told HA'ARETZ. He said "we are now preparing the  ground for serious negotiations with Syria." According to the  source "the price for peace with Syria is obvious, but there is  no point in declaring it before negotiations start."    The source said he believes that Israel will reach a peace  agreement with Syria this year. In Jerusalem's contacts with  Washington, it was suggested that Secretary of State Warren  Christopher come to the region prior to the completion of the  talks with the Palestinians, participate in the signing ceremony  of the Gaza-Jericho withdrawal agreement, and go on to Damascus.  In this way, Christopher's trip would symbolize transferring  the emphasis in the peace process from the Palestinian track to  the Syrian one.    Israel expects at this stage additional public moves by  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad as an opening to negotiations and  in order to help convince public opinion to support an agreement  between the two sides. Al-Asad's agreement to renew the talks  with Israel, even before the Palestinians announce the  resumption of their talks, is seen in Jerusalem as a sign of the  Syrian president's seriousness and as a proper response to Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's remarks on Syria during his recent  visit to the United States. Rabin said that "the time has come  for painful decisions over Syria. We will agree to do what is  required of us if the Syrians do what is required of them."    Nevertheless, analysts recently reiterated the evaluation  they passed on to the political echelon in Jerusalem that  al-Asad will not advance significantly in the peace process with  Israel before he is convinced that Israel intends to withdraw  from the Golan Heights.    Israel hopes that speeding up the talks with the Syrians  will  also find expression in a change in the negotiating format and  character. Israel called on Syria to replace Muwaffaq  al-'Allaf, its representative to the negotiations, claiming that  its delegate, Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, is a Rabin confidant  while al-'Allaf does not have a similar status with al-Asad.  Another Israeli request, raised by Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres during his recent visit to Washington, was that a peace  settlement with Syria lead to peace arrangements with Jordan and  Lebanon, and normalization of relations with the other Arab  states, except for Libya and Iraq. Israel will not, however,  present that as a condition to the Syrians so that the agreement  with Damascus will "stand on its own two feet." Syrian Foreign  Minister Faruq al-Shar' said recently in talks with western  sources that Syria opposes a separate agreement with Israel, but  will be able to make do with "progress" along the other tracks.  Al-Shar' made it clear that Syria will oppose the lifting or  easing of the Arab boycott on Israel at the present time. He  explained that such an action depended on progress in the peace  process and that the Arabs would not give up such an important  card at this stage of the negotiations. Syria also ties its  participation in the multilateral talks to progress in the  bilateral negotiations with Israel.</p>

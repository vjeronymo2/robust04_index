			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SLUM BUILDING PUT INTO ESCROW PROGRAM  </P> <P> A slum building in the Westlake district of Los Angeles became the first to be  placed under a punitive city program that takes rent money away from landlords  and places it in a special bank account controlled by the city.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to put a 36-unit property at 521 S.  Union Drive, owned by Peter Berrocal of Mano Industries Inc., in the "rent  escrow account program." The program was authorized by the council last  November.  </P> <P> "We have to send out a very stern warning to all property owners," said  Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who co-authored the ordinance with Councilman Zev  Yaroslavsky, "that we intend to do business."  </P> <P> The owner can retrieve the money, minus city administrative costs, once repairs  are made.  </P> <P> The council gave a week's reprieve to a second building at 1041 S. Westlake  Ave., which was also considered for the program, to give owner Luis Guerrero  time to complete repairs.  </P></p>

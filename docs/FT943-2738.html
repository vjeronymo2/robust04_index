			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sonae shrugs off falling prices and demand Sonae, Portugal's largest distribution and industrial conglomerate, reported a 109.7 per cent increase in net consolidated profits, to Es6.5bn (Dollars 41.2m) for the first half, in spite of falling private consumption and higher raw material costs. Sonae's Continente hypermarket and Modelo supermarket chains, which account for about 80 per cent of group turnover, registered a 28.9 per cent rise in retail sales, to Es95bn. However, a high level of investment and internal reorganisation costs weakened results. Continente's net profit fell 4.2 per cent to Es2.3bn. Modelo's net profit slid 79.2 per cent to Es1.1bn, largely due to the sale of a smaller supermarket chain. Sonae's industrial arm, focused on wood-based products, reduced its net loss to Es100m from Es1.7bn for the first half of last year. In spite of strong price and volume performance, margins were hit by rising raw material costs. Extraordinary profits for the group rose to Es4.7bn from Es4.2bn for the same period last year.</p>

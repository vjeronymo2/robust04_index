			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> IN JAPAN, SOME VOTES MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS;  </P> <P> ELECTION: LOPSIDED APPORTIONMENT FAVORS RURAL AREAS OVER CITIES. BUT EVEN UNDER  A 'FAIR' SYSTEM, THE RULING PARTY WOULD HAVE WON SUNDAY.  </P> <P> In the 4th District of Kanagawa Prefecture (state), a dormitory area for the  Tokyo-Yokohama megalopolis, 1,347,435 voters elect four representatives to the  House of Representatives.  </P> <P> Out in the Japan Alps 3rd District of Nagano Prefecture, 427,478 voters also  cast ballots for four members of the lower house of Parliament.  </P> <P> Such are the anomalies of Japan's electoral system, where one vote in the  countryside can be worth three in the cities.  </P> <P> The lopsided apportionment is often cited by American trade negotiators, who  for years have been trying to persuade Japan to open its markets to imports of  rice and other farm products. Some U.S. officials even have charged that the  conservative Liberal Democratic Party keeps itself in power by inflating the  value of the rural vote.  </P> <P> So do Japanese critics. Newspapers and scholars routinely report that farmers'  support is critical to the Liberal Democrats' maintaining their control of the  government.  </P> <P> But an examination by The Times of the results in Sunday's election for the  lower house showed that, with Japan's present system of multi-member  constituencies -- most with three to five seats apiece -- Prime Minister  Toshiki Kaifu's party would have won the election even if the chamber's present  512 seats had been reapportioned to have roughly equal numbers of voters. It  also would have won the last lower house election four years ago.  </P> <P> Both contests would have been much closer, however. Instead of finishing with a  majority of 34 seats, the Liberal Democrats probably would have scraped through  Sunday with the kind of razor-thin margin that political analysts initially had  predicted.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the analysis underscores one point made by the critics:  distribution of seats in Japan's multi-member constituencies is a mess.  </P> <P> With 90,578,761 eligible voters, a reshuffling that would assign one  representative to each 176,911 voters -- the nationwide population average for  the 512 districts -- would have produced a reapportionment in 99 of the 130  districts.  </P> <P> So out of whack is the system that only one of Tokyo's 11 districts has the  proper number of seats for its population. Six districts are under-represented,  while four others are over-represented.  </P> <P> Because the number of candidates would increase or decrease depending on the  number of seats at stake, any application of a one-man, one-vote analysis to an  actual election can offer only an indication of a likely trend. But The Times'  examination showed that 44 Liberal Democrats won seats Sunday that should not  have existed in over-represented districts. Fourteen other Liberal Democrats  who lost would have won if their districts had not been under-represented.  </P> <P> The difference, or 30 fewer seats, theoretically would have trimmed the party's  victory to a four-seat majority. Four years ago, instead of a 54-seat majority,  their margin would have been about 30 seats.  </P> <P> In earlier, nip-and-tuck elections, the result, indeed, would have been a  defeat.  </P> <P> Ironically, the Socialists, who scored the biggest gains in their history, also  would not have done as well Sunday. Socialist winners in 11 districts would  have lost under a more equal apportionment. And no Socialist loser would have  benefitted.  </P> <P> The biggest beneficiaries would have been precisely the parties that suffered  the biggest setbacks: the Communists and the middle-of-the-road Democratic  Socialist Party. Their power base is concentrated in urban areas.  </P> <P> While the farm vote is important -- so much so that the Socialists have become  more protectionist in their agricultural policies than the Liberal Democrats --  the rural clout does not, by itself, explain the perennial conservative grasp  on power.  </P> <P> Indeed, last July, far from sustaining the Liberal Democrats, the farm vote  contributed to their defeat in an upper house election. Conservatives lost all  of their seats in the rice-rich Tohoku (northeast) region and on the mikan  (mandarin orange) island of Shikoku.  </P> <P> Hardly had vote counting ended Monday when 11 complainants in Tokyo and  Hiroshima once again filed separate suits demanding that courts rule the Sunday  election a violation of the constitution's guarantee of equal representation.  If past cases are a guide, the suits are unlikely to succeed.  </P> <P> Japan's court system, prone to hand down judgments based more on custom and the  status quo than on the letter of the law, has consistently refused to insist on  reapportionment of seats.  </P> <P> Four years ago, the court ruled that a 2.99 to 1 discrepancy in population and  a 2.92 to 1 imbalance in voters is acceptable. In 1986, Parliament  reapportioned seats to reduce the maximum mismatch to 2.99 to 1.  </P> <P> Kaifu has promised to carry out another reapportionment as part of a political  reform package to be presented on the 100th anniversary of the founding of  Japan's parliamentary system this fall. But no one is holding his breath.  </P> <P> Although everyone agrees that seats need to be reapportioned, no one is calling  for a one-man, one-vote system.  </P> <P> Even the perennial opposition Socialists and Communists demand only that the  discrepancy be reduce to less than 2 to 1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> JAPAN'S ELECTION FOR PARLIAMENT  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.42IN:2.00IN:1.89IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL SPN="2" CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> NUMBER OF SEATS  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Change  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Liberal Democratic Party  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 310  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 290*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -20  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Socialist Party  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 86  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 141*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +55  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Komei (Clean Government) Party  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 57  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 46  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -11  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Communist Party  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 27  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 16  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -11  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Democratic Socialist Party  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 26  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 14  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -12  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Minor parties  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 512  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 512  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> * Includes unaffiliated winners expected to vote with the party.  </P></p>

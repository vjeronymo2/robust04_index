			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Eridania advances 7% to FFr614m at halfway ERIDANIA Beghin-Say, the sugar and foods group controlled by Italy's troubled Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company, underlined its financial resilience in the face of its parent's difficulties with a 7 per cent rise in net first-half profits, to FFr614m (Dollars 109.25m) from FFr572m. Mr Guido Rossi, the Ferfin chairman imposed by creditor banks earlier this year, underlined the Paris-based company's importance to Ferruzzi when he said the Ferruzzi rescue plan being studied by creditor banks did not envisage a sale of Ferfin's majority stake. The management of Eridania Beghin-Say, which has been trying to underline its independence and financial health, said they had no intention of divesting any activities acquired under Ferfin's control. EBS has diversified into some branded consumer food sectors and pushed into new markets in eastern Europe. Sales rose 3 per cent to FFr24.75bn, while pre-tax earnings soared 32 per cent to FFr1.29bn. EBS said all its main activities had either maintained or improved profitability in the first half. With a 'favourable' outlook for the remainder of the year, it predicted that full 1993 profits would probably exceed 1992's FFr1.28bn With attention focused on the financial problems of its controlling shareholder, EBS stressed that its own ratio of borrowings to new equity had remained virtually unchanged over the past six months, in spite of investing about FFr300m on a new plant in eastern Germany. EBS has been identified as one of the most appealing parts of the Ferfin empire if there is a break-up, and a number of aspiring buyers have already shown informal interest. The Paris government has said it would monitor closely any plans to change the group's future ownership in view of its strategic importance for the French farming sector.</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Finland raises interest rates Finland's central bank yesterday increased interest rates by one percentage point to 18 per cent, the third rise in less than a month, in an attempt to stem the outward flow of capital from the country, write Robert Taylor in Stockholm and Hilary Barnes in Helsinki. Last month the country's reserves fell to FM23bn (Pounds 2.9bn) from FM31bn. Since last November, when Finland devalued the markka by 12.3 per cent against the Ecu, the international money markets have mistrusted the ability of the fragile centre-right coalition government to deal with the country's most serious economic recession - despite government spending cuts. The government yesterday released its draft 1993 budget, which allows for a deficit of FM47.7bn and expenditure of FM175.3bn.</p>

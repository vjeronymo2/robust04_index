			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Green light for Dublin commuters: A rail system may soon relieve traffic congestion DUBLIN'S long-suffering commuters may soon find relief from the traffic that chokes the city centre at rush hours. After years of prevarication over public transport issues, a government green light is expected soon, for the construction of a IPounds 500m (Pounds 463m) Light Rail Transit (LRT) system for the city. Detailed proposals are being drawn up for the project to be presented to the EC Commission in the submission for the 1994-98 tranche of EC Structural Funds (ESF) for Ireland. Ireland is anticipating a doubling of ESF payments to some IPounds 6bn in the next tranche, and rail systems for Dublin and nationally are top priorities for funding. Mr Dick Doyle, an economic adviser to transport minister Seamus Brennan, said: 'The minister is very strongly behind the (LRT) plan. It has cross-party support and the Dublin councillors are behind it.' He said that 50-75 per cent capital funding by the EC would be required, but that the system would then be able to operate without subsidies. Major contracts will be up for grabs for engineering works, rolling stock and even operation of the system itself. At least five different proposals have been submitted to Mr Brennan for consideration since he first made public the government's interest last year. These include proposals from GEC in the UK, Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss group, Annsaldo in Italy and Aer Rianta in Ireland. Professor Simon Perry, the Dean of Engineering at Trinity College Dublin, and the man who co-ordinates the Irish Universities Transport Studies Group (IUTSG) says that an LRT system is 'ideally suited for Dublin's problems'. 'It is light enough to be laid on top of existing roads, can use existing rail routes, and is less likely to have its routes blocked by car traffic than alternatives such as guided buses'. Route blockage is already a big problem for Dublin's 800 buses in the narrower of the city's Georgian streets. Dublin's city centre, is bounded on three sides by two canals that arc around to join the River Liffey, which flows through the centre. This boundary, known as the inner cordon, forms a rough circle with a radius of a mile-and-a-half. Into this seven square-mile area, containing some 27 bridges, 55,000 cars stream every day, reducing traffic flows to a crawl during the rush hour. Serious bottlenecks occur not only at the bridge crossings over the river and canals, but at most road junctions in and out of the city. A 10-mile car trip from an outer suburb can take over an hour during peak traffic flows The Dublin Bus company estimates that, even with the existing bus lane system, its vehicles are slowed to average speeds of less than 3 miles per hour inside the inner cordon during rush hours. Car ownership in Ireland is increasing by some 3 per cent a year. Most of the city's present traffic problems can be traced back to two transport studies completed more than 20 years ago: one by a Professor Miles Wright, and the other by the Dublin Corporation. Both studies envisaged an increasing role for road-based private transport and planned four 'satellite' towns to the west of Dublin to disperse housing, factories and offices and ease traffic congestion to the centre. The centre and these new urban suburbs were to be linked together by a new 100-km network of motorways. Professor Wright wrote at the time: 'There is every sign that Irishmen, as sturdy individuals and democrats, will wish to use their cars fully.' A road-based transportation strategy, relying on the private motor car, thus became embodied in successive Dublin Corporation transport policies. Public transport was relegated to a secondary role, the only exception being the building of a commuter rail line, known as the Dart, which serves the coastal suburbs north and south of the city. The problem, however, was that as the new western satellite towns grew up, jobs did not grow at the same pace, and most of the transport infrastructure plans remain to be implemented. The result has been that since 1967, the proportion of people using public transport to enter the city centre has fallen from 54 per cent in 1967 to only 34 per cent today. In areas served by the Dart however, commuters still prefer to use public transport. Indeed it has been the Dart's success, run by Irish Rail, which has largely led to the government to finally consider an LRT system as a long-term solution for the capital's traffic problems. According to Professor Perry, the first phase of a commercial LRT system could be built relatively cheaply and quickly using old abandoned railway routes. 'What existed in terms of rail-based corridors are still there, mostly with the right-of-way intact, and lend themselves ideally for a modern system' he said. The first phase, linking the major southern suburbs to the city centre would cost some IPounds 150m, he said.</p>

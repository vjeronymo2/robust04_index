			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Soft soap and high drama - Mass-appeal TV programmes which sell a wide range of consumer goods and services as part of the story line are big business in Brazil The attractive young woman walks along the road, hips swaying provocatively and a boutique bag swinging from her shoulder. Stopping at a bar, she sits down and takes out a shoe box. Suddenly Reginaldo, her punk haired would-be paramour, appears as she opens the box and removes a sports shoe. Caressing it lovingly, he places it on Yasmin's foot. After a tantalising few seconds she flounces away leaving Reginaldo holding one of the shoes which he takes to his room, kisses, and holds up to Ze, his pet skeleton. Dancing round the room with the shoe, he finally places it on his bedside table next to Yasmin's photo. The scene is from De Corpo e Alma, Brazil's top soap opera which draws a 50m-plus audience six nights a week. To the innocent viewer it all seems part of the story of Reginaldo's obsession with Yasmin. But by the end of the 90-second sequence, the camera has focused seven times on the Azaleia label and the shoe company can expect an instant increase in sales. For what the viewer has just experienced is a lucrative spot of merchandising - the Azaleia shoe company cashing in on the Brazilian national obsession with novelas or soap operas. TV Globo, Brazil's main channel, claims that seven out of 10 televisions are switched on to the novelas which make up two-thirds of programming between 6pm and 10pm. And so powerful is the force of novelas in promoting new trends that Marcos Grahl, media planning director at Standard, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, says: 'If a star of a popular series appears with her hair dyed red, you can bet you'll suddenly see a whole lot of dyed redheads in the street.' Boutiques frequently report selling out of particular lines the day after they are worn in a novela and, currently, male strip clubs are springing up everywhere because of the prominent role of one such Clube das Mulheres in De Corpo e Alma. Ingrid Buzkman from the Contemporaneo advertising agency recently used the Doce do Amor soap opera to launch a new range of Triumph lingerie and has no doubt of the medium's pull: 'It's fantastic. You have an enormous audience and you're speaking to your consumer when he's absorbing 100 per cent and is not unresponsive as he would be during a normal commercial slot.' Banned in many countries - though used increasingly in the US film industry  -perhaps nowhere is merchandising used as blatantly as in Brazilian soaps. Conversations take place over bottles of Antarctica beer, business deals are struck in Itau bank, dinner parties use Santa Marina glassware. Jeans, watches, fridges, even underwear, are all making appearances, sponsored by their makers. In last week's episodes of De Corpo e Alma eagle-eyed viewers could spot the camera zoom in on Renner paint as young Junior watched his room being redecorated, admiring the colour at some length, or catch his father using his Itau credit card in a toy store, lingering over the trade name. Merchandising is used so extensively that the Brazilian advertising industry defines it jokingly as 'advertising which sometimes has a novela in the middle'. TV Globo has been selling merchandising spots for the last 15 years and now has a 120-member support department largely for this purpose. Its director, Jorge Adib, is a staunch defender: 'Merchandising exists because of the need to give authenticity to a novela. Novelas focus on the day-to-day lives of people - they travel by car, they drink beer, they catch flights, they check the time, so we need real cars, beer, planes and watches. As good capitalists, we use the products of those who pay.' TV Globo's only rule is that it will not allow merchandising of cigarettes, drugs or hard drink, nor anything of a dubious nature. Each series can feature only one bank and one brand of beer and no product can appear more than eight times. A bank will appear roughly every 20 episodes. Merchandisers pay about the same per product appearance as they would for a commercial spot at that time  -an average Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 19,800). According to Adib, the company aims to cover a third of the production costs of each soap-opera through merchandising, which averages Dollars 33,000 in revenue per episode and around Dollars 20m a year. He has no doubt about the pull: 'It's a very powerful vehicle because you're not obviously promoting a product, but rather creating the sympathy of the viewer for it.' Washington Olivetto, who runs the creative agency, W/Brasil, agrees. 'If well used, merchandising can be very effective. A couple kissing in front of a bank might just irritate a consumer but a man dreaming of owning a brand new Volkswagen seems like part of the story. It needs to appear as reality.' To achieve the natural touch, as soon as Adib's team receives the synopsis of a new novela, it starts focusing on 'sales opportunities'. 'We don't change or destroy characters or interfere with the story line, but we may alter a character's trajectory,' Adib says. 'Say for example that the writer has a scene involving an English journalist going to interview a businessman. We might suggest to the author that the journalist uses a Bic pen and, if he or she agrees, then whenever this character does an interview the same pen will be used. Then we might choose a Ford car for the journalist to travel in and may even suggest stops on the way to the interview to buy shoes,' he says. Once this has been cleared with the writer and the artiste, both of whom will receive a bonus, Adib approaches his clients to suggest the appearances. Unlike normal advertising, the client cannot see the clip before it goes out. In some cases the product even becomes part of the story. In this year's hit, Pedra sobre Pedra, the main character, Jorge Tadeu, is a denim-clad photographer with whom all the women in the village fall in love. After his death, the women remember him every time they sees a pair of his trademark Onix jeans. Another case this year where merchandise became integral to the story was the policeman in Perigosas Peruas who was almost stripped of his commission after modelling Y-fronts on billboards around the city. Soap operas are frequently used to launch products or to change the image of a well-established product. Itau bank has been appearing in Globo novelas for 10 years as part of a long-term campaign to change its sober image and appeal more to the younger and less monied classes. And Melissa plastic sandals, which are now the rage in trendy Copacabana and Ipanema, were mostly only bought by poor slum dwellers until they started appearing on the feet of sophisticated soap opera characters five years ago.</p>

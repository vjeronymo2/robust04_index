			<p>BFN     [Text] None of the candidates in yesterday's presidential  elections received the necessary number of votes -- 50 percent  of all votes cast -- to achieve an outright victory and become  president of Belarus. However, two candidates -- who will  continue their battle for the presidential post in a second  round of voting -- have been specified. They are People's  Deputy Alyaksandr Lukashenka, former chairman of the legislative  anticorruption commission, and Belarusian Prime Minister  Vyachaslaw Kebich. Alyaksandr Lukashenka was the obvious leader  in yesterday's presidential race -- he received some 2,659,409  votes -- 45.1 percent. Vyachaslaw Kebich received 17.4 percent  of the vote (1,025,732 votes). Zyanon Paznyak, leader of the  opposition Belarusian Popular Front faction in the legislature,  received 12.9 percent (757,586 votes), former Supreme Soviet  Chairman Stanislaw Shushkevich -- 9.9 percent (584,604 votes),  Alyaksandr Dubko, chairman of the Belarusian Union of Kolkhozes  -- 6 percent (356,222 votes), and [Vasyl Novikaw], cochairman of  the Communist Party of Belarus -- 4.6 percent.    BELAPAN draws attention to the fact that these are  preliminary results, subject to change, however, not  considerably. All in all, 5,870,055 voters participated in the  elections. The total number of eligible voters in Belarus is  7,457,939. At a briefing held this morning, Alyaksandr  Abramovich, chairman of the Central Commission for Presidential  Elections, predicts the need to hold a second round of voting.  According to him, the final results of the 23 June vote will  likely be announced on 30 June. The second round of  presidential elections will be held no later than 14 days after  the results of the first round are officially announced.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 4 May (XINHUA) -- A Foreign Ministry  spokesman said today that the Chinese Government and people wish  to express their warm congratulations over South Africa's first  successful general election and the victory the African National  Congress [ANC] has won in the election.    Preliminary results of South Africa's first multiracial  general election have been announced. The ANC, led by chairman  Mandela, has won the election and South Africa will form a  government of national solidarity dominated by the ANC.    The spokesman said: The vast number of black people in South  Africa have exercised their democratic rights for the first time  in history during the general election. The birth of a new  South Africa with racial equality is the beginning of a new era  in South Africa. This victory is the result of the protracted  struggle which the South African people have launched with  support from the international community. The ANC and other  liberation organizations of black people have played their key  roles in bringing about this historic change in South Africa.    The spokesman added: "We also appreciate the positive  contributions which the government of the Nationalist Party  headed by President de Klerk has made through carrying out  reforms to conform to the trend of the times."    The spokesman said: The Chinese Government and people  wholeheartedly hope that, under the leadership of the government  of national solidarity of South Africa, all parties will work  together with greater unity and cooperation in building a  stable, democratic, prosperous, and affluent new South Africa  enjoying racial equality.    The spokesman pointed out: The Chinese Government and people  have always firmly supported the South African people's just  struggle against racism, and we are delighted with the South  African people's historical victory. After the founding of the  new South African Government, China is ready to establish and  develop friendly relations and cooperation with South Africa on  the basis of the five principles for peaceful coexistence. The  spokesman expressed the belief that the traditional friendship  forged between the Chinese and South African peoples during the  protracted struggle certainly will be consolidated and developed  on a new basis.</p>

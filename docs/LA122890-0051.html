			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> RETAILER SAYS CITY NEGLECTS DOWNTOWN QUAKE SAFETY;  </P> <P> VENTURA: A MAIN STREET MERCHANT CHARGES THAT LANDOWNER INFLUENCE HAS KEPT THE  COUNCIL FROM REQUIRING BUILDING UPGRADES.  </P> <P> Controversy over whether the city of Ventura has done enough for earthquake  safety erupted Thursday when a Main Street merchant accused the City Council of  yielding to influence from the largest downtown property owner.  </P> <P> Bill Zwirn, who owns The Paul Bunyan Shop, charged that the city should have  required upgrades long ago to make unreinforced masonry buildings safe enough  to withstand the major earthquake that scientists say is inevitable in Southern  California.  </P> <P> But Zwirn, who posted a sign in his window Thursday saying that his building  could become a "death trap" if an earthquake hit, said the largest downtown  property owner, Ventura Realty Co., had influenced the City Council to defeat  an earthquake ordinance two years ago.  </P> <P> "Nonsense," said Tom Wood, general manager and attorney for Ventura Reality,  which is predominantly owned by members of the Lagomarsino family. Wood, a  nephew of Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), said the company was founded  by his great-grandfather in 1908.  </P> <P> Wood said he has long supported an ordinance requiring the level of upgrades  needed to protect life in the event of an earthquake. But he said he fought  against the more stringent law that city engineering consultants recommended in  1988, which would have required extensive upgrades to preserve the buildings as  well as save lives.  </P> <P> The upgrades to save the structures could include adding steel bars to  reinforce walls, replacing mortar between bricks or making the foundation more  stable.  </P> <P> "You can't fault the city for trusting in their consultants," he said. "But you  can't fault us for influencing legislation that was unwarranted either."  </P> <P> Wood said he hopes that the city's next ordinance, which is expected to be  introduced next spring, will not "destroy what it is trying to protect."  </P> <P> The city of Ventura has 143 unreinforced masonry buildings, mostly downtown.  Improvements on those buildings might already be under way if city consultants  had not pushed for the more stringent ordinance. The tougher ordinance created  opposition among merchants and property owners, including Wood, who said they  could not afford the expensive work.  </P> <P> Despite a change in the ordinance to require the minimum level of upgrades,  threats of lawsuits from two property owners, including the owner of the  building that houses The Paul Bunyan Shop, led the council to defeat the  ordinance, said Everett Millais, Ventura's director of community development.  </P> <P> But he said, a new law must be passed soon.  </P> <P> "It's an ordinance that should have been on the books a long time ago," he  said. "We are sort of tempting fate."  </P> <P> Millais said a city environmental impact report, which was ordered after the  lawsuits were threatened two years ago, is due out in mid-January. He said the  report recommends that the city require owners to begin the first level of  upgrades by tying walls to roofs and floors.  </P> <P> However, over 20 years, the report recommends that the building owners should  do much more extensive reinforcing, bringing their properties up to a second or  third level of upgrade, Millais said. If the owners chose not to upgrade the  buildings, they would have to pay to have them razed and removed.  </P> <P> Wood said two of the seven unreinforced masonry buildings that Ventura Realty  owns downtown may have to be razed and rebuilt in several years. Those two  buildings, in the 300 block of Main Street, are just plain "cruddy" buildings,  he said, and not worth the money to fix them.  </P> <P> Ventura Realty has already spent $100,000 to perform the first level of repairs  on the building that houses Franky's Place on Main Street. The face of the  building remains dismantled while Wood decides whether to install a steel bar  the width of the building to begin the second level of upgrades.  </P> <P> He said he understood Zwirn's frustration with his building, because the owner,  Andrew Chakires, has done no earthquake upgrades and vehemently opposes any  ordinance that forces even minor earthquake repairs.  </P> <P> Chakires said Thursday that the state has not proven that unreinforced masonry  buildings are at high risk of crumbling in an earthquake.  </P> <P> "They have only shown us anecdotal evidence," he said, referring to the  crumbled buildings in Santa Cruz, Watsonville, Coalinga and Whittier. "You're  at higher risk of getting cancer from benzene when you buy gasoline than you  are from getting killed by an earthquake."  </P> <P> But Zwirn said he wants all downtown shoppers to know about the condition of  the buildings.  </P> <P> "All the other merchants on Main Street are afraid to say anything because they  are all worried about their own little businesses," he said. "But they don't  understand that people are afraid to shop downtown because they are afraid of  what would happen in an earthquake."  </P></p>

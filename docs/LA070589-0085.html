			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RINGLEADER OF ESCAPE BACK IN COUNTY JAIL  </P> <P> An alleged master jewel thief who authorities believe masterminded the escape  of five prisoners from Orange County Jail last year was returned to that jail  Tuesday from South Dakota, where he was captured May 20.  </P> <P> Michael Douglas Taylor, 36, suspected of a crime spree after his escape, now  faces charges of robbery, kidnaping, rape, grand theft and escape. Taylor, who  is also known as Michael Douglas Gianetti, will be arraigned Thursday,  according to Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Larry Richey.  </P> <P> Taylor and four other inmates escaped from the recreation area of the men's  jail on Nov. 20 by rappelling down braided sheets from the top of the  four-story building in downtown Santa Ana. Two inmates, one of whom had  suffered a broken a leg, were captured immediately and the other two were  caught two weeks later by FBI agents in Denver.  </P> <P> The two guards on duty at the time were blamed for the escape. One was fired  and the other was disciplined.  </P> <P> Authorities finally tracked down Taylor in Rapid City, S.D., after he tried to  pawn loose diamonds that law enforcement officials believed came from a Chicago  jewelry heist. The Rapid City jeweler became suspicious of Taylor and called  police.  </P> <P> Taylor was awaiting trial in Orange County Jail last November, accused of  committing seven robberies in Orange County, including the theft of more than  $100,000 in gems from a Huntington Beach jewelry store last year. He was also  facing trial in Los Angeles for 10 other robberies.  </P> <P> The suspect was extradited despite his plea that he feared for his life if he  was returned to Orange County Jail. Last week, he finally agreed to drop his  fight against extradition and return for prosecution.  </P> <P> Taylor also faces robbery charges in Illinois, Alameda County in Northern  California and Des Moines, Iowa, authorities said.  </P></p>

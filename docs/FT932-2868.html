			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Workplace union deals to be encouraged THE AUSTRALIAN government plans to introduce legislation before the end of this year designed to accelerate the spread of workplace bargaining agreements between companies and employees, Mr Laurie Brereton, minister for industrial relations, said yesterday. The Labor government of Mr Paul Keating is seeking to replace a centralised system, under which industrial relations commissions set most wages, with direct negotiation at company level in which productivity is a key element. This would be subject to a 'safety net' stipulating minimum standards. Nearly 1,000 companies have signed such deals but this represents only 11 per cent of the work-force. Mr Brereton, in an interview in London, said: 'I would like workplace agreements to be the norm. . . That is the change of attitude that we want to create.' Mr Brereton said that trade unions, with which successive Labor governments have had a series of accords, were the driving force behind the trend towards workplace agreements and their target was for 70 per cent of the workforce to be covered by them. Mr Brereton said the workplace agreement system would move Australia away from the craft-based union system inherited from Britain.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls 62 points amid sell programs Wall Street US STOCK prices plunged across the board yesterday as nervousness about the decline in Tokyo markets coupled with Wall Street computerised sell programs wiped more than 50 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. By the close the Dow was down 61.94 at 3,213.55. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 7.53 weaker at 398.06, while the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks dropped 14.68 to 581.61. Turnover on the New York SE amounted to 205m shares, while falls outnumbered rises by more than three-to-one. In the absence of fresh economic news, and lacking a firm direction from bonds, the newfound confidence about the economic and earnings outlook that fuelled Monday's rise vanished yesterday. Some analysts said they detected the first signs of genuine unease among investors about the effect on US markets of the heavy losses in Japanese equities. The trigger for the sudden sell-off, however, was a big computerised sell program mid-afternoon, which single-handedly wiped 20 points off the Dow average. One observer said that he believed the program involved a strategic shift of assets out of stocks and into other forms of investments. The program was swiftly followed by several others, and amid a lack of buyers, prices dropped sharply in the final 1 1/2 hours. One of the few big stocks to buck the trend was General Motors, which climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 38 in turnover of almost 3m shares. Trading was delayed at the opening due to an order imbalance on the buy side as investors responded favourably to news of a 'mini coup' in GM's boardroom. Mr Robert Stempel, GM group chairman, was ousted from his position as head of the board's key policy-making executive committee, being replaced by an outside director. Airline shares, already undermined by higher oil prices and fears of a fresh price-cutting war among big carriers, were hit particularly hard. UAL weakened Dollars 10 1/4 to Dollars 129 1/2 , Delta Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 58 7/8 , AMR Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 67 1/2 and USAir Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 16 1/8 . Oil issues, which played a big part in Monday's advance, were weaker. Texaco lost Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 , Occidental Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 18 7/8 , BP ADR's Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 52 1/4 , Chevron Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 65 1/4 and Exxon Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 56 5/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Right Management plunged Dollars 9 1/2 to Dollars 8 after the company estimated first-quarter earnings would be between 8 and 13 cents a share, down sharply from 36 cents in the same quarter a year ago. Canada TORONTO plummeted nearly 50 points or 1.5 per cent, its sharpest drop for 1 1/2 years. Dealers said players have been backing away from the market for the past month and listless volumes have exaggerated the swings in the market. Nervousness over rising inflation and fears the trend towards lower interest rates has come to an end may have contributed to the sharp losses, some added. The market is waiting for the US producer and consumer price indices for March to be released tomorrow and Friday respectively. The composite index dropped 49.3 to 3,336.6. Declines led advances by 388 to 195 on volume of 25.5m shares. Confirmation that Olympia &amp; York missed a payment of USDollars 62m on March 25 weakened bank shares, already reeling from the property giant's cash flow troubles.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yefim Shvartsman] </F>   [Text] Odessa January 10 TASS - "We are studying now" the  question of a place and time for a possible meeting between  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and U.S. President Bill  Clinton, Viktor Stelmakh, head of the press service of the  Ukrainian president and the government said in a telephone  interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday at 10:45, Moscow time [0745  GMT].    This is the only response by Ukraine for the time being to  an  issue which is of interest to many other capitals, apart from  Kiev.    However, nobody doubts Ukraine's interest in such a meeting.  Describing numerous possible versions, local analysts prefer  three most probable: the first suggests that a meeting may take  place at the Kiev Airport on January 12 if Clinton makes a  stopover en route from Prague to Moscow.    According to the second version, the Ukrainian president  will  visit Moscow on January 14. The third presupposes the two  presidents' meeting in Minsk on Sunday, January 16.    Kiev very painfully reacts to another inaccuracy circulated  by various mass media, including Russian, concerning the number  of missiles in Ukraine. Some periodicals wrote about 1,000  nuclear missiles.    In actual fact, this is an error made as a result of  confusing nuclear warheads with missiles. Ukraine has 176  strategic nuclear missiles. Kiev believes that it is to destroy  130 of them in compliance with the START-1 treaty.</p>

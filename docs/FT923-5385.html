			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Letter: End copier anti-dumping duties Sir, As a lawyer for a Japanese photocopier manufacturer accused of 'dumping' in the EC, I would like to comment on your 'Copier makers still fighting Japan' (August 25). The Commission makes findings of dumping in situations which no independent observer, and few economists, would consider dumping. For example, in the original 1985 investigation, many Japanese companies' prices on the EC market were considerably higher than prices in Japan. Despite this, the Commission awarded my client a dumping margin of some 35 per cent. The advantages of copiers made by Japanese owned companies flow from the efforts to improve production processes and reduce costs - which are passed on to users. Every industry has to remain innovative to be competitive, and anti-dumping measures are no substitute for competitive practice. You rightly observe that 'the most important question' is whether it is in the 'Community's interest' to continue imposing duties on Japanese photocopiers. Rank Xerox, Oce and Olivetti/OCI now represent about a quarter of total EC production. If anti-dumping duties are imposed to enable them to increase their prices and profits, the rest of the industry (largely Japanese owned) will be able to follow suit. This means that, for a given benefit to the complainants, the burden on European users of photocopiers is magnified several times. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, said in November last year that anti-dumping duties in the original photocopier case cost EC consumers 'over Ecu400m a year, which is twice the value of the total production of the European companies which had sought protection'. The EC should now let the anti-dumping duties on copiers die a graceful death. Simon Holmes, 118 Avenue de Cortenberg, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium</p>

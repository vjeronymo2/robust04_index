			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has stated  that Moscow and Kiev have no mutual understanding over the  recent incidents in Odessa. Russia will take measures of its  own in response to Kiev's actions, Pavel Grachev asserted.    The Russian defense minister also voiced his opinion about  replacing Russia's peacekeeping forces with UN units in CIS  hotspots. He considers that this cannot be done since the UN  does not have the money for this, they are unlikely to find  anyone willing to go these hotspots and, furthermore, the CIS  heads want to see on their territories only units of the Russian  Armed Forces.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Security council split on sanctions DISAGREEMENTS between permanent members of the United Nations Security Council are likely to delay further the adoption of a draft resolution for tougher sanctions against Serbia - already postponed three times last week. Both the US and Russia have reservations about different aspects of the resolution which no one now expects to be adopted before President Clinton and President Yeltsin meet this weekend. Russia has said it would vote against the enforcement of a no-fly zone over Bosnia unless the resolution was modified to exclude attacks on ground targets, the Russian Interfax news agency reported. The harder Russian position follows demands by conservative parliamentarians, who criticise Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the liberal foreign minister, for co-operating with western governments in condemning Serb military action in Bosnia. Russian conservatives have been upset that Moscow appeared to be abandoning its traditional Serbian allies. Meanwhile, to the surprise of European members of the Security Council, the US has objected to including a clear endorsement of the international peace plan for Bosnia, drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, as part of the new sanctions resolution. The draft resolution, backed by Britain, France and Spain, is intended to persuade Belgrade to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to sign the peace plan, which has so far been endorsed only by the Bosnian Croats and Moslems. According to some reports, the US remains divided about the workability of the plan and has doubts about its fairness to the Moslems.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Yesterday we reported that six ministers had  mysteriously left the country, the rumor in Maseru being that  they had fled in fear of their lives. But government sources  maintained they had left for official duties. Well, two of the  ministers have returned and another four are expected to return  shortly, according to the principal secretary for information,  Seeiso Serutla. Koja Berwado got in touch with Mr. Serutla on  the line to Maseru and asked him why the ministers had decided  to come back.    [Begin recording] [Serutla] This is as a result of the army  having accepted their pay cheques because the ministers had to  flee because of the allegations of threats on their lives, when  the armed forces received their salaries, which apparently did  not include the increase.    [Berwado] So, is it the case that the army has now been paid  these new wages with the 100 percent increase which they  demanded?    [Serutla] No, at the moment there is no increase in their  salaries, but the army has accepted that there will be an  increase and there are some increases in their salaries for May,  which obviously will be backdadted from April. Let me make it  clear that it is not 100 percent, as the army (?heard).    [Berwado] So, how much is it?    [Serutla] I am not sure about the percentage, but it is  certainly not 100 percent.    [Berwado] Who exactly is in charge of the country at the  moment? I mean, is it the army or is it the government?    [Serutla] The Government of Lesotho, through the prime  minister, Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle, is the government of this country,  and they are still there.    [Berwado] So, now, you are definitely going to see a kind of  a backlash of this situation that erupted last week?    [Serutla] I cannot guarantee you anything as, I mean, the  army in Lesotho is obviously a problem, and I can't guarantee  anything. All I can say is that we are talking and we are in the  process of talking to each other.    [Berwado] And who in the army are you negotiating with? Who  is in charge of the army at the moment?    [Serutla] A major general.    [Berwado] Mr. Serutla, it is quite a worrying prospect if  you  say the army have agreed, but then there are no guarantees.  What about the political situation?    [Serutla] What kind of guarantees would you want? I mean,  they have guaranteed to us that they have accepted some  increases in their pay salaries, whatever it is. They have said  they have settled down and that we will continue talking to each  other.    [Berwado] On the question of the mutineers who killed the  deputy prime minister last week, are they going to be brought to  book?    [Serutla] Well, I want to leave that question really to the  head of the army. It is their job, whenever there is anything  like that to deal with it as it is appropriate.    [Berwado] Have they indicated that they are going to deal  with that aspect of the situation?    [Serutla] Well, not to me personally.    [Berwado] Do you believe they will?    [Serutla] I believe that. The situation in Lesotho was bad  by killing the deputy prime minister, and that the only way  which will advance peace in Lesotho is for the law breakers to  be seen to be punished for what they have done, I mean that is  my personal view. I mean, I think in any civilized country that  is what we expect.</p>

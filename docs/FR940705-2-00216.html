			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;J. Minimization. Minimization is the design and operation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containment systems in order that any incidental release is a de minimis release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;K. Pathogen. A pathogen is any microbiological agent or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eukaryotic cell containing sufficient genetic information, which upon expression of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such information, is capable of producing disease in healthy people, plants, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;L. Physical Barrier. A physical barrier is considered any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, facilities, or devices (e.g., fermentors, factories, filters, thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxidizers) which are designed to achieve containment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;VII&hyph;M. Release. Release is the discharge of a microbiological agent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or eukaryotic cell from a containment system. Discharges can be incidental or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidental. Incidental releases are de minimis in nature; accidental releases may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> de minimis in nature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix L. Release into the Environment of Certain Plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix L&hyph;I. General Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix L specifies conditions under which certain plants as specified below, may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be approved for release into the environment. Experiments in this category cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be initiated without submission of relevant information on the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experiment to NIH, review by the RAC Plant Subcommittee, and specific approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the NIH Director. Such experiments also require the approval of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutional Biosafety Committee before initiation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix L&hyph;II. Criteria Allowing Review by the RAC Plant Subcommittee Without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Requirement for Full RAC Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consultation with the RAC Plant Subcommittee and without the requirement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full RAC review (Institutional Biosafety Committee review and approval is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary), NIH/ORDA may approve the growing of plants containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recombinant DNA in the field under the following conditions: (i) The plant species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a cultivated crop of a genus that has no species known to be a noxious weed; (ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the introduced DNA consists of well-characterized genes containing no sequences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harmful to humans, animals, or plants; (iii) the vector consists of DNA from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempt host-vector systems (see Appendix C), from plants of the same or closely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related species, from nonpathogenic prokaryotes or nonpathogenic lower eukaryotic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plants, from plants pathogens only if sequences resulting in production of disease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> symptoms have been deleted, or chimeric vectors constructed from sequences of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempt host-vector systems (see Appendix C) or from sequences from plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathogens in which the disease symptoms have been deleted. The DNA may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduced by any suitable method. If sequences resulting in production of disease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> symptoms are retained for purposes of introducing the DNA into the plant,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greenhouse-grown plants must be shown to be free of such sequences before such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plants, their derivatives, or seed can be used in field tests; (iv) plants are grown in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled access fields under specified conditions appropriate for the plant under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study and the geographical location. Such conditions should include provisions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using good cultural and pest control practices, for physical isolation from plants of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same species outside of the experimental plot in accordance with pollination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics of the species, and the prevention of plants containing recombinant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DNA from becoming established in the environment. Review by the Institutional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Biosafety Committee should include an appraisal by scientists knowledgeable of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crop, its production practices, and the local geographical conditions. Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for assessing alterations in and the spread of organisms containing recombinant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DNA must be developed. The results of the outlined tests must be submitted for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review and approval by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Copies of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results must be submitted to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 496&hyph;9838.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix M. Points to Consider in the Design and Submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Protocols for the Transfer of Recombinant DNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Molecules Into the Genome of One or More Human Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix M applies to research conducted at or sponsored by an institution that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives any support for recombinant DNA research from the NIH. Researchers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not covered by the NIH Guidelines are encouraged to use Appendix M.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Experiments in which recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recombinant DNA is introduced into one or more human subjects with the intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of stably modifying his/her genome are covered by Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2, III&hyph;B&hyph;2, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III&hyph;B&hyph;3 (see Section V&hyph;U). Experiments in which recombinant DNA or DNA or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RNA derived from recombinant DNA and that are not covered by Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III&hyph;B&hyph;2, or III&hyph;B&hyph;3 and that are not considered exempt under Section V&hyph;U, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered under Section III&hyph;C&hyph;7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This document is intended to provide guidance in preparing proposals for NIH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration under Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2 and III&hyph;B&hyph;2. Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2 addresses Major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Actions involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects that have been determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NIH/ORDA, in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as necessary, to: (i) Represent novel characteristics (e.g., target disease or vector),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) represent an uncertain degree of risk to human health or the environment, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) contain information determined to require further public review. Proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered under Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2 will be reviewed by the RAC and approved by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NIH Director. RAC review of experiments considered under Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will follow publication of a precis of the proposal in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity for public comment. Section III&hyph;B&hyph;2 addresses Minor Actions involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DNA into one or more human subjects that have been determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NIH/ORDA, in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as necessary, to qualify for the Accelerated Review process. Proposals considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2 and III&hyph;B&hyph;2 will be on a case-by-case basis. A list of actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved under Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2 and III&hyph;B&hyph;2 involving the transfer of recombinant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subjects is available from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 496&hyph;9838. The list of actions to the NIH Guidelines involving the transfer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more human subjects does not include experiments considered to be exempt from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RAC and NIH/ORDA review under Section III&hyph;C&hyph;7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to be confined following transfer to one or more human subjects, no risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to public health or to the environment is expected. Nevertheless, Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;b specifically asks the researchers to address this point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

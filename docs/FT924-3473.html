			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Big gas users told that bills may rise LARGE industrial gas users may pay higher bills as more competition is introduced into the gas market, Mr Ian Powe, chairman of the Gas Consumers council, warned yesterday. British Gas's agreement with the Office of Fair Trading to halve its share of the industrial gas market in the next three years might see the company substantially raising the price of its cheapest gas, Mr Powe said. That is the gas sold to its largest customers on 'interruptible contracts' - meaning British Gas can cut them off at short notice. Competitors have shown no interest in entering the interruptible gas market as it offers low profit margins. Mr Powe believes British Gas might increase prices for such gas to maintain its profit levels as it loses market share. Separately, Sir James McKinnon, the gas industry regulator, fired another salvo in his dispute with British Gas over the rate of return it should earn for its pipeline business. Sir James said British Gas should be able to earn between 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent on transporting its own and other companies' gas through its pipelines.</p>

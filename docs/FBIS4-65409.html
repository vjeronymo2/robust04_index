			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sebastiano Messina: "Truce Already Broken; </F> Scalfaro Under Siege"]    [Excerpts] Rome -- [President] Scalfaro was already under  siege even before the ministers, having left the [presidential]  Quirinale Palace all in their blue suits, reached their  respective offices. The moment the president finished signing  the 25 appointment decrees, he heard the first sounds of mortar  fire. It came from the direction of National Alliance [AN]  headquarters, and the trigger was pulled by Maurizio Gasparri,  one of [AN leader] Gianfranco Fini's generals. He said  nonchalantly: "Scalfaro was very worried about the Italian  Social Republic, which ended 50 years ago. We, however, are  very concerned and very worried about the Sisde [Intelligence  and Military Security Service], which is much more currently at  the center of judicial developments. Furthermore, time will  tell whether Scalfaro is as beyond reproach as many believe him  to be, or whether, as interior minister, he too, like others,  was implicated in the scandal."    In Fini's MSI [Italian Social Movement], it is Gasparri who  sets the line every day with his editorial in IL SECOLO. So his  recent interview marks the end of the cease-fire between the new  government majority and the chief of state. Its tone gives no  room for uncertainties, because the National Alliance deputy  even hints at problems for the president with the judiciary:  "The fact is that the chief of state enjoys legal immunity only  with respect to acts performed in the exercise of his duties.  The Sisde affair, however, does not concern these duties." So  according to Gasparri, Scalfaro could be accused and tried over  the scandal of the intelligence service funds. This was made  clear by MSI member Teodoro Buontempo, known for his plain  speaking: "Scalfaro must go, because he has everything to lose  if he remains a prisoner in his own palace." [passage omitted]    Former President Francesco Cossiga has sided with Scalfaro:  "The president's strong intervention [sending a letter to  Berlusconi] was correct and legitimate. I approve of and agree  with his action, and he personally enjoys my esteem, my  friendship, and my support."    Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio agrees that he was right:  "Overall, I judge it a very opportune act at this stage in  Italy's political life," because the presence of the National  Alliance "is prompting anxiety" abroad. "The aim was to issue  as clear and as strong a signal as possible to the international  community and to the national community on three issues of  particular importance from the viewpoint of internal and  international relations."</p>

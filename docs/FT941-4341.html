			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: T Clarke falls sharply to Pounds 61,000 Shares in T Clarke fell 8p to 54p yesterday as the electrical contractor reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 1.44m to Pounds 61,151 on turnover some Pounds 10m lower at Pounds 58.5m for the year to end-December. The directors said the results reflected reduced margins, redundancy payments and bad debts, along with a substantial loss associated with disputed completion costs incurred on the Waterloo International Terminal project. Losses per share emerged at 0.17p (7.34p earnings) and the final dividend is passed leaving the interim dividend of 1.265p as the sole pay-out for the year. The dividends for 1992 totalled 4.07p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric] </F>   [Text] The National Democratic Party of Georgia has  proposed the holding of new parliamentary elections this fall.  Some other parties, in particular the Union of Traditionalists  of Georgia, oppose such a proposal, believing no parliamentary  elections should be held before fall 1995, until the term of  office of the current parliament of Georgia is up.</p>

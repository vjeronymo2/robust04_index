			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Markets: Bonds that offer a saving grace - Serious Money SHOULD your savings be in ICI's Eurosterling 1995 issue, instead of deposited in the building society? The idea is not as way out as it sounds. In the US and on the Continent, it is quite common for private investors to own corporate bonds, or those issued by local authorities. Years of inflation have knocked the bond-owning habit out of the UK investing public. But if the 1990s really are to be an era of low inflation and low short-term interest rates, UK investors may be attracted by the corporate bond sector. Investors have certainly shown enthusiasm for the permanent interest-bearing shares (PIBS) issued by building societies. These securities are actually a good deal more risky than many of the other corporate bonds on issue - which is why, of course, they pay a higher yield. PIBS are at the end of the queue when it comes to repaying building society creditors; most corporate bonds are close to the front of the creditors' queue. Whether investors understand the risk is hard to say; some may have bought PIBS in the belief that they are just a different type of high interest account. But the name 'building society' is obviously a source of much comfort; it is a long time since any investor lost out from a building society collapse. If, however, you can buy PIBS because of the comfort offered by the name of, say, the Leeds building society, why not buy a bond issue, with much greater security, from Midland bank? The yield might be lower than on a PIBS issue, but it will be higher than on a gilt of the same maturity. The main risk, when buying a long-dated corporate bond, is that the company concerned might not survive the many economic cycles over the coming decades. On issues of a similar maturity, the higher the yield on the bond concerned, the more the market is worried about the company's potential to survive. Conversely, if investors want the security of a blue-chip name, they must accept a lower yield. Apart from the credit risk, there is also obviously a market risk of bond prices falling. Such has been the strength of the rally in bond prices over the past three years, fuelled by lower interest rates and falling inflation, that there must be a chance of a setback. But if investors are prepared to hold the bond until maturity, at least they know precisely what nominal return they will achieve. With many issues trading above face value, buying bonds may involve converting some capital into income. There are many bond issues available, and other types of security - such as zero dividend preference shares - which may offer similar attractions to investors. On page V, Michael Dyson, a director of BZW Capital Markets, highlights a number of issues which he feels might be attractive to private investors. Coincidentally, BZW's parent company, Barclays, launched a Pounds 100m Eurosterling bond issue this week. It will yield around 8.8 per cent, well above the returns available on cash. The bond has no repayment date, although Barclays has an option to repay it in 2017. Eurosterling bonds are normally issued in bearer form (which some private investors do not like for security reasons); the Barclays issue is also available in registered form. IF YOU ARE at all interested in investment, you must have noticed that world stock markets were reaching record highs in August. You will probably also have realised that bonds have enjoyed a powerful rally, with the yield on US Treasuries falling below 6 per cent. In short, bond and equity investors have rarely enjoyed such happy times. So why, this week, did the Prudential, the UK's largest life insurance company, make a provision against further bonus cuts on its with-profits policies? The reason dates back to the late 1980s when bonus rates were chased up by insurance companies eager to get a larger slice of the lucrative endowment mortgage market. The companies got used to an era when investment returns averaged between 15 to 20 per cent a year - and set their bonuses accordingly. Despite the recent rally, the 1990s have not matched those returns and bonuses need to be cut. In effect, policyholders are seeing the downside of the smoothing process, often touted as a benefit of endowment policies. Prudential started the adjustment earlier than most; it was one of the few to cut bonuses in the 1991 season, after the battering taken by stock markets in the 1990s. Other companies hoped that 1990 would prove an aberration and maintained their payouts; the present adjustment might, accordingly, be sharper. Holders of 10-year policies have tended to suffer most because short-term market movements have a greater effect on short-term policies. This could come as a shock to those who raced to buy policies in the months leading up to the abolition of life assurance premium relief in 1984. The bad news for existing policyholders is that bonus cuts are likely to continue for some years as the industry adjusts gradually to the new conditions (assuming low inflation and low interest rates prevail). Of course, returns on other investments have also dropped. But a unit trust, for example, does not carry the historical baggage of an endowment policy; gains are not transferred between generations of investors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Francois Soudan: "The End of Prehistory"] </F>   [Text] Morocco. Three months from now, the press, radio,  and television are expected finally to get legal protections  appropriate for contemporary media. But much remains to be done  in the economic, social, and professional domains....    Three months from now, if all goes as expected, Morocco's  parliament will be asked to put an end to an anomaly that has  persisted for half a century. More specifically, in April the  very obsolete "dahir" [statue] that has regulated journalists'  status and governed their professional conduct since the era of  the French protectorate is to be abrogated and replaced. For the  thousand or so Moroccan journalists working at the two  television stations, two national radio stations, and some 400  newspapers and periodicals, the end of prehistory is thus in  sight, since their status will be fully recognized in the law,  if not fully in practice.    Over the last year, the commission established in March 1993  to follow up on the National Colloquium on Information and  Communication has elaborated a series of legislative bills to be  submitted to the deputies for approval. Among the bills (none  has yet been made public) is the new statute on professional  journalists, destined to replace the 1942 "dahir."    A boiler-plate statute, it extends freedom of information  protection to professional journalists who have been issued a  special card by the joint commission. Most importantly, it  stipulates in Article 2 that "journalists have right of access  to sources of information," a provision that thus formulated  almost amounts to a small revolution: Investigative journalism  traditionally has been considered tantamount to espionage.    Another bill is supposed to replace the "dahir" decreed in  1940 "in the French zone of the Moroccan empire" limiting  activities of film crews and photographers. Under the new bill,  "taking of photographs is not regulated or subject to any prior  administrative formalities."    No more police interference or confiscation of film on the  pretext the subject being photographed was of "strategic  significance." With respect to film takes for television, the  obligation to submit beforehand a detailed description of each  shot and afterward allow authorities to view the footage is  replaced by simple prior accreditation.    In addition to creation of a National Media Observatory (to  be responsible among other things for public opinion polls),  changes are expected to include appointment of press attaches in  each ministry, restructuring of the Advanced Institute of  Journalism in Rabat, and establishment of a High Council on  Information--a body of "wise men" with advisory powers. The only  point of contention: its composition. It is not yet clear  whether the final make-up of the Council will be very restricted  (10 to 15 members, jurists and academics) or enlarged to include  representatives of journalists' unions and newspaper management.  <H5>  Social Malaise </H5>   But important as it is, this updating and modernization of  the laws should not obscure the fact that taken as a whole  Morocco's media establishment--especially the written press--is  far from flourishing. Out of 406 registered  publications--two-thirds of them in the Arabic language, mostly  specialized and trade journals--very few pay their employees  adequately or regularly. The malaise is thus first of all social  in nature, and the scope of the problem went unrecognized until  three well-known journalists died in abject poverty in 1993.    But there are also structural problems. In a document  prepared for the National Colloquium on Information, Jamal  Eddine Naji, a journalism teacher and member of the Moroccan  Human Rights Organization, drew up a list of these dysfunctions:  the precarious financial condition of newspapers, the small size  of the advertising market, the weakness of editorial staffs,  absence of training, total lack of knowledge about the  readership.... The absence of any means of monitoring sales and  circulation only adds to the impression of disorder. Of course,  we know that during the Gulf war and the rape trial of  commissioner Tabet, the dailies had record press runs--up to  200,000 copies. But do the figures announced in normal times  (100,000 for LE MATIN, 80,000 for AL-ITTIHAD AL-ICHTIRAKI,  50,000 for L'OPINION and AL-ALAM, 30,000 for AL-BAYANE) really  correspond to circulation? And what are actual sales?    Another problem: the poor distribution of Moroccan news  publications outside Morocco. Whereas LE FIGARO, FRANCE SOIR,  L'EQUIPE, and ACHARQ AL-AWSAT are printed locally in facsimile,  and proceeds from sales of foreign newspapers in Morocco amount  (after conversion and transfer) to $10 million per year, the  local press is still unable--or barely able--to find readership  abroad. "The French, Tunisian, and Egyptian markets are much  more protectionist in this area than our own," newspaper  executives complain. "In Algeria, it is impossible even to find  a distributor. In late 1991, one small entrepreneur tried his  hand at it: The experiment lasted all of three months."    One of the most important questions is not even addressed:  Is  the Moroccan press able to offer a product sufficiently  generalized and informative to attract non-Moroccans outside the  country? Alas, for now the answer must be no. The goodly number  of party newspapers, including some of real quality, the  existence of a respectable economic and commercial press, and  the recent appearance of more hard-hitting weeklies cannot hide  the lack of a single really independent daily newspaper. The  readership exists, and so does the investment capital, but no  one has done more than toy with the possibility. The  broadcasting sector, although greatly modernized since creation  of the encrypted 2-M station and radio station Medi-1, seems  paralyzed by the old taboos whenever it reports on internal  politics. The result: Events as important as the legislative  elections of June 1993 and the failed governmental alternation  have been covered only from a partisan and thus selective slant  in the press, radio, and television.    This lack of objectivity ultimately penalizes the newspapers  and lays bare their often archaic operating structures.  Disappointed and weary readers are turning increasingly toward  journals that offer a greater variety of news and do not shrink  from scandal; such journals have had unprecedented growth in  recent years. The pioneers in this domain, Mustapha Alaoui and  "Ousbou' Assahafi Wa Assiyassi," have been overtaken by former  cartoonist Mohamed Filali, who today heads a small group of  three periodicals with press runs totaling close to 700,000.  What is distinctive about these journals is that they cover  everything, address interests of all readers (including  Islamists), and blithely commingle little "scoops" and gross  rumors.    "The government has done much to help the press," says the  Ministry of Information--"help it become more professional, and  if necessary help it cope with the chores of management."  Communist Ali Yata, political party leader and newspaper  publisher, enthusiastically confirms that "never has the  Moroccan press made such important advances as those of the last  few years."    That much is probably true. Journalists are getting a  variety  of benefits, newspapers are getting subsidies, and even the  National Press Syndicate, headed by the able Mohamed Larbi  Messari, is getting assistance. Hassan II dips regularly into  palace coffers to support dailies regardless of political  affiliation. Since 1987, the "annual royal gift" of about 20  million dirhams ($2 million) has been divided into checks  distributed in a televised ceremony to managing editors of the  various newspapers. Admittedly, no one exactly knows what  happens to the money, and journalists, who are asking for a  little more transparency, would like to see training programs  get the lion's share. All the same, the gesture is far from  negligible, and neither are the efforts made by the Ministry of  Information to improve the circulation of the big national  dailies.  <H5>  Vast `Uplift' </H5>   Perceived as an anomaly, even an archaism, the lumping  together of the Information and Interior portfolios--for the  last eight years both have been under the wing of the same  bicephalous minister, Driss Basri--has been from one standpoint  paradoxically helpful. A strategic sector, information has been  beefed up with material and human resources it previously  lacked, and the minister--who has been quite careful, apart from  a couple of gaffes, not to be accused of "controlling" the  journalists--has in general tried to discourage filings of  numerous court actions against the press by the state or private  individuals. Everyone agrees, however, that the current  arrangement is outdated. If the opposition had been included in  the government that issued from the last legislative elections,  the two ministries were to have been delinked. For the moment,  the vast task of "lifting up" the Moroccan media still falls on  the shoulders of Driss Basri--a man who fervently believes in  that mission.    As for the future of the Information Ministry, almost  anything is possible: a complete and autonomous ministry, a  state secretariat, a directorate under the prime minister?  Increasingly, however, voices are being raised calling for it to  abolished outright and replaced by a communication agency. That  would be a proud milestone in the "new deal" for Moroccan  journalism.</p>

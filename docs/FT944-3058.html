			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Post Office triples its profits for half year The Post Office yesterday reported half-yearly pre-tax profits up more than threefold on last year, and announced that there would be no early increase in stamp prices. In spite of uncertainty about the future status of the industry, Post Office pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 198m in the six months to September 25, from Pounds 59m for the same period last year. This puts the Post Office on course to meet its government levy of Pounds 226m, taken from its post-tax profits for the full year 1994-95, without a stamp price rise. However, Mr Michael Heron, chairman, refused to rule out a price rise for the whole of 1995. Mr Heron continued to insist that decline was in prospect unless the government gives the Post Office greater commercial freedom to run the Royal Mail, the letter delivery division which accounts for most of the industry's turnover and profits. The government last month backed away from its plan to privatise the Post Office, fearing that the steadfast opposition of about 10 Tory MPs would lead to defeat in the Commons. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has yet to decide the future status of the industry within the public sector. The Post Office board is anxious that its healthy financial performance does not reinforce the case for the status quo, yet the Treasury appears intent on resisting moves to reduce the government profits levy and other commercial constraints. The half-yearly results showed a rise of 1m in the number of letters delivered a day by the Royal Mail over the past year, taking the figure to 64m. The division's turnover increased from Pounds 1.96bn to Pounds 2.15bn and its pre-tax profit from Pounds 55m to Pounds 199m. The counters division, which has responsibility for high street and village post offices, also reported a sharp increase in profit, from Pounds 10m to Pounds 14m. Overall productivity continued to improve, with employee numbers down by 1,500 to 191,200 over the year to September. However, Parcelforce, the Post Office's parcel delivery division, went deeper into the red, reporting pre-tax losses up from Pounds 17m to Pounds 28m. Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive, blamed Parcelforce's problems on the intensity of competition in the parcels market, where the Post Office competes with more than 400 private companies. The Post Office told the government it needed to invest Pounds 400m this year to modernise its plant, but was allowed only Pounds 320m. Referring to the increase in the government levy on the Post Office, from Pounds 66m two years ago to Pounds 226m this year, Mr Heron said: 'The government should be ashamed of taking this level of profit out without allowing us the necessary investment for the future.'</p>

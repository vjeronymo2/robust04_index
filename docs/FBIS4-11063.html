			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 19 Apr (EFE) -- The Army Command has  officially reported in Montevideo that nine Uruguayan officers  from the UN peacekeeping forces in Rwanda, who had been  surrounded in Kigali, were evacuated to Kenya today.    The "blue helmets" are now in Nairobi in UN service, and are  awaiting orders before returning to their country.    The Uruguayan Army public relations office noted that the  United Nations was reducing its personnel in Rwanda, and that a  small mission alone would remain.    Another four Uruguayan officers, among the 25 Uruguayan  officers who were acting as observers in Rwanda, are in the  interior of the country and in border areas, ready to leave for  Uganda.    Two Uruguayan officers were injured in Rwanda two weeks ago  by a machine-gun burst shortly after the tribal fighting began.    The two injured officers, who are out of danger, have also  been evacuated by the United Nations.    The Army reported that another five officers had left for  Uganda before, and that a similar number was in Montevideo on  vacation when the conflict broke out, and received orders to not  return to Rwanda.</p>

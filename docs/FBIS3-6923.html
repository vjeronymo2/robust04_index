			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "You Should Not Object to the People's </F> Will" from the "Program for Officers and Men of the South Korean  Armed Forces"]    [Text] Soldiers of the South Korean Armed Forces: Since a  long time ago, our people have had an old saying that the  people's will is the will of heaven, and if one objects to the  people's will, one will be punished by heaven.    The will of heaven and punishment by heaven mean the  intention of heaven and divine retribution.    This proverb contains a historic lesson that the people's  will is just and if one objects to the people's demand, one  cannot avoid punishment by heaven.    The disgraceful destiny of successive South Korean ruling  groups clearly illustrates the consequences that were brought to  one who objected to the will of the popular masses.    The successive South Korean ruling groups frantically ran  amok with maneuvers of a northward war of aggression by carrying  outside forces on its back and implemented a cruel fascist rule.    The act of the South Korean ruling groups went against the  demand of the people who were aspiring to independence,  democracy and reunification. The South Korean ruling groups  reigned over the popular masses and ran wild with oppression.  What was their destiny? We think that you, the soldiers of the  South Korean Army, are well aware of it.    The successive South Korean ruling groups were overthrown  because they only committed traitorous acts, going against the  people's will and the nation's aspirations.    The civilian-veiled traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique is  objecting to the will of the popular masses and the nation's  demand more viciously than successive South Korean ruling  bunches.    The most urgent demand of our people and nation at present  is  achievement of the peaceful reunification of the country. Our  people, who suffered pains of division for nearly half a  century, cannot live being separated from each other any longer  and are looking forward to national reunification even in dreams.    To achieve the nation's peaceful reunification -- our  people's long-cherished desire -- war exercises must be  suspended on the Korean peninsula.    However, the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique is waging  exercises of a northward war of aggression every day by carrying  outside forces on its back by challenging the people's desire  for reunification, and is driving you, the soldiers of the South  Korean Army, into these exercises.    You, the soldiers of the South Korean Army, should not  traverse the road of objecting the people's will by following  the order of the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique.    History is the course of achieving the demand of the popular  masses. No strength can block our people's desire for national  reunification. The traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique, which  challenged our people's desire for national reunification, will  be judged by history and will not be able to avoid the collapse.    You, the soldiers of the South Korean Army, who are the  young  men of Korea, should not spoil your destiny by traversing the  road of objecting the people's intention on the side of  traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique.    You, the soldiers in the 3d Battalion, 51st Regiment, 12th  Division of the puppet Army, who are barely keeping up your  bodies being driven into various exercises and hard work, and  you, the soldiers in the 1st Battalion, 63d Regiment, 11th  Division of the puppet Army, who witnessed the death of  colleagues caused by accidents during training some time ago,  should deeply examine yourselves who have fallen into disaster  and misfortune.    If you want to get rid of the miserable situation, you  should  travel the road of patriotism on which you can share the  intention of the people. This is the very hope of your parents  and brothers, and is the nation's demand.    You, the soldiers of the South Korean Army, should rise on  the road of patriotism to share the intention of the people and  should seek a genuine life.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SARAH VAUGHAN  </P> <P> Sarah Vaughan is prematurely dead of cigarette smoking, hard on the heels of  Lucille Ball and Ava Gardner. My sadness at the Divine One's passing is tinged  with anger that a singer blessed with such a magnificent voice could destroy it  -- and herself -- with nicotine addiction.  </P> <P> MARVIN H.

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Environment shake-up call The government's creation of a new Environment Agency should be taken as a chance to shake up British environmental regulation, says Mr Dieter Helm, director of forecasting group Oxera. In a paper to be published tomorrow he says recent controversial decisions, such as licensing the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant and extending the M4 through Twyford Down - have failed to weigh up costs and benefits. Mr Helm calls for the proposed agency, which will unite the regulatory functions of the National Rivers Authority and the Pollution Inspectorate, to be independent from Treasury interference so that it can encourage the development of market-based instruments to control pollution, such as taxes and pollution permits.</p>

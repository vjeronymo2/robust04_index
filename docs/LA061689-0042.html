			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREMIER BLAMES CORRUPTION, SHADY DEALINGS FOR UZBEKISTAN VIOLENCE  </P> <P> Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told Communist Party activists in Uzbekistan  on Thursday that corruption, political intrigue and ethnic hatred led to  violence against the Meskhetians, a Turkish minority.  </P> <P> Ryzhkov completed a four-day investigation of the rioting with a party meeting  in the republic's capital of Tashkent, the official news agency Tass said.  </P> <P> "This was the work of ruthless and cruel hands of those to whom inter-ethnic  enmity has always been the soil for the criminal mentality that everything  goes," Tass quoted him as telling party officials. "Corruption and shady  economic and political dealings" played a role, he said.  </P> <P> Ryzhkov said the violence was well-planned and aimed at destabilizing the  republic and the country. He did not identify any group or people he held  responsible.  </P> <P> At another party meeting Wednesday near Fergana, the city hit hardest by the  unrest, Ryzhkov said party and government officials gave gasoline,  transportation and vodka to attackers who killed the Turks.  </P> <P> Pravda, the party daily, said prosecutors have arrested several hundred people  on charges of organizing pogroms and violent actions and that proceedings have  begun in more than 60 cases. Up to 100 people were killed and hundreds were  injured in the attacks.  </P></p>

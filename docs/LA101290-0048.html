			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIETZ RESIGNS PASADENA PLAYHOUSE POST;  </P> <P> STAGE: ARTISTIC DIRECTOR SUSAN DIETZ IS GIVING UP THE THEATER TO PURSUE FILM  AND TV PROJECTS.  </P> <P> Susan Dietz has resigned as artistic director of Pasadena Playhouse, effective  Oct. 21, in order to pursue film and television opportunities.  </P> <P> No replacement is waiting in the wings, but "we'll look at a host of people who  have expressed interest over the years," said the theater's managing director  Lars Hansen.  </P> <P> A meeting on Oct. 20 between Hansen, other key staff members and David Houk --  the developer who has an ownership interest in the theater -- will "examine our  opportunities," added Hansen, but he declined to predict when a decision will  be reached.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the announced season will continue, and "guest producers may  present attractions."  </P> <P> Dietz herself will be one of the guest producers. She still plans to produce a  spring season in the playhouse's smaller Balcony Theatre. The playhouse  recently received a $35,000 grant from the Fund for New American Plays to  present Ronald Ribman's "Rug Merchants of Chaos," and Dietz said it would be  the centerpiece of the Balcony Theatre season.  </P> <P> However, Dietz said her primary energies would now go into such projects as a  Steven Banks TV pilot she recently produced for Disney -- which is a potential  Showtime series, she said. Dietz initially produced "Steven Banks' Home  Entertainment Center" at a small theater in Universal City and later brought  his act to the Pasadena Playhouse's Balcony Theatre; she is also his manager.  </P> <P> She said that while working on the Banks pilot, "the atmosphere was so easy.  There was a whole lot less stress than in the theater, which is very  stressful."  </P> <P> Dietz also plans to start what she called "a management production company of  writers, directors and actors" who will jointly develop projects, primarily for  film and television. "But every once in a while, we'll go back to the theater."  Dietz already has at least two ongoing theatrical projects; she co-produces  "Love Letters" at the Canon Theatre and is associated with "The Baby Dance," a  play that began at the Playhouse and has now moved on to theaters in the East.  </P> <P> "It seems like a positive thing for Susie," said Hansen. "I wish her all the  best." He said her departure was not a complete surprise, and "this seemed like  a logical time for it. Our projects (for the rest of the season) are firm, and  we have a natural break between now and January," when the next mainstage show,  "Ad Wars," will open.  </P> <P> Hansen and Dietz denied that the theater is in danger. Owner Houk "is in there  for the long haul," said Dietz. "It's not something he dabbles in. He won't let  it go down the drain." Houk could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Dietz also denied that her leaving is related to reactions to "The Wonderful  Ice Cream Suit," the theater's current show. "It's doing better business than  any show we've had in 18 months," she said.  </P> <P> Hansen pointed to the theater's subscription base of 18,000 and an annual  fund-raising campaign that is "very promising, running ahead of last year."  </P> <P> He cited a challenge grant received last week from the Ledler Foundation. The  foundation will contribute a dollar for every $3 that come in prior to Jan. 1,  up to a $15,000 cap, said a Ledler spokesman. Movie star Kevin Costner will  chair the campaign that will attempt to raise the $45,000 that would match the  grant.  </P></p>

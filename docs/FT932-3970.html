			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Letter: Not really the soft options Once again, in your article 'Losing lots of layers' (June 8) on the reshaping of National Westminster Bank, we witness Britain's implicit disdain for so-called 'soft', as against 'hard', factors when it states: 'While some of these are 'soft' measures, others such as asset quality will be reflected directly in the profit and loss account in future years.' How long will it be before these 'soft' measures - quality of service, customer satisfaction, staff motivation - are recognised to be not just namby-pamby enthusiasms, but crucial factors which will impact on 'the profit and loss account in future years' at least as much as hard ones?

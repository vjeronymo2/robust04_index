			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / High office for man who aimed low THE BENEFICIARY of a political jinx, which seems to destine most of Brazil's civilian presidents not to complete their mandates, never aimed for high office. Mr Itamar Franco, the new acting president, almost quit politics after his first term as mayor of his home town of Juiz de Fora, in Minas Gerais state in the 1970s, writes Christina Lamb. By contrast, President Fernando Collor, who now steps down, always felt destined for great things. On becoming head of the football association of his home state of Alagoas when he was only 19, he told friends he was headed for the presidency of the republic. It was an aim he never abandoned, even during his years as a playboy in Rio de Janeiro, and he achieved it in March 1990 at the age of 40. Mr Franco is as introverted and home-loving as Mr Collor was adventurous and dynamic. The new man's time in office is expected to be a welcome relief from the drama of the Collor years, which the impeachment vote on Tuesday night spectacularly interrupted. Nobody expects Mr Franco, 62, to enter the history books as a great leader, but few Brazilians are looking for that. The overwhelming hope is for a stable government which will calmly carry out its functions without the bouts of hysteria and depression which characterised the Collor administration. 'An Itamar government will mean a much smoother ride,' says Mr Alexandre de Barros, a political consultant. 'With Collor, we were in the hands of a nutter, where anything could happen.' His cabinet is expected to be a grey, more managerial, affair than Mr Collor's assortment of characters. Those included a fervent environmentalist, a union leader, and a woman economy minister who fell in love with the justice minister, a married man, passing him billets doux in cabinet meetings and then authorising a biography about it all. Mr Franco has no party political allegiance, having quit Mr Collor's party this year after a row. A staunch opponent of the military regime that ended in 1985, he is most closely identified with the Democratic Movement Party, the country's largest party. Mr Maurcio Correia Lima, widely expected to be justice minister, says: 'The Itamar government needs to be one of transition, above party fights. It should not get involved in polemics, such as (those on) the referendum next April on the political system, or in backing candidates in the 1994 elections.'</p>

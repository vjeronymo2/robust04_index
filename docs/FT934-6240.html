			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Euro Disney plunges on stock market Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group desperately trying to negotiate a financial rescue, lost a sixth of its stock market value yesterday. Its shares closed FFr6.20 lower at FFr27.20 in Paris and fell 62p to 318p in London. The decline may complicate efforts by the company to restructure. In Paris, the shares slid after heavy selling from convertible preference holders. More than 4.14m Euro Disney shares, or 2.4 per cent of its equity, changed hands. The decline followed steady selling since Euro Disney, which is burdened by heavy debt and has suffered in the European recession, disclosed an unexpectedly heavy net loss of FFr5.3bn (Pounds 604m) for the year to September 30. The share price peaked at FFr160 in April 1992 and was worth FFr43.70 before the announcement of last year's loss. Euro Disney, with Walt Disney, the US entertainment group that owns 49 per cent of its equity, began negotiations last week over the restructuring with the 60 international banks that own its FFr20.3bn net debt.

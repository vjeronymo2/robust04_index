			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO FURTHER DELAY, PLEASE  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon will hear arguments today on a request that  he stay his order directing the L.A. County Board of Supervisors to present him  with a legally acceptable redistricting plan by June 27.  </P> <P> Kenyon issued the order following a lengthy trial in which the board's five  members were found to have conspired to maintain themselves in office by  denying the county's 2 million Latinos the voting rights to which they are  legally entitled. Now the board's majority -- which already has enjoyed nine  years in power on the basis of an electoral system that has been found illegal  -- wants the judge to postpone the June deadline so that it can pursue an  immediate appeal. It is worth noting in this context that, over the past two  years, the supervisors, who repeatedly have claimed the county is unable to  adequately fund many essential human services, have spent $4 million in legal  fees defending their indefensible and self-interested affront to this basic  civil right. (If Kenyon awards legal fees to the plaintiffs, the county will be  liable for an additional $2 million in costs.)  </P> <P> Naturally, the plaintiffs are opposed to further delay and to the board's  additional request that Kenyon allow the November election between Sarah Flores  and Judge Gregory O'Brien, even though the boundaries of the 1st District seat  they are contesting have been judged to have been illegally drawn. The latter  issue is a knotty one, fraught with the often conflicting considerations that  arise when the willful misconduct of one co-equal branch of government forces  another to intervene in its affairs.  </P> <P> Since passage of the Voting Rights Act, federal judges have generally conducted  such intervention with an integrity and tact that has vindicated the public's  faith in the judiciary as the ultimate guardian of its constitutional rights.  Judge Kenyon's conduct of this case stands squarely in that tradition.  </P> <P> The district boundaries the supervisors illegally drew for themselves in 1981  are more than lines on a map. They are a web of deceit and discrimination.  Every day they are allowed to remain in place is another day of disgrace.  </P></p>

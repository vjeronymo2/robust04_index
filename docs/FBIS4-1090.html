			<p>BFN     [Text] The police today responded to yesterday's incident  that partially destroyed the vehicle of Mfulumpinga Victor,  chairman of the Democratic Party for Progress-Angolan National  Alliance. Maianga Police Station Commander Jose Alberto says  that by this afternoon Mfulumpinga Victor had not presented a  formal complaint, that is why the investigations are stalled.    [Begin Alberto recording] Until now we have not received any  complaint from Mr. Mfulumpinga Landu Victor. We are waiting for  him to arrive and present a complaint.    [Unidentified correspondent] But the police yesterday  visited  the place where the incident occurred.    [Alberto] It was about 2200 that we learned that a Land  Rover  vehicle carrying people dressed in plain clothes stopped in the  October Revolution Street and shot at Mr. Mfulumpinga's vehicle  after he had parked it in front of his house.    [Correspondent] What measures are the police taking?    [Alberto] We have already investigated the case by  questioning some people who were at the venue of the attack.  They saw the people who were in the attackers' vehicle, but we  are still waiting for Mr. Mfulumpinga's complaint. [end  recording]</p>

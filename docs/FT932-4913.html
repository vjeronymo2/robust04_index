			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Letter: Power sharing in South Africa Sir, Your report that President De Klerk had 'rejected black majority rule' created widespread confusion and concern ('De Klerk resists rule of black majority in S Africa', May 26). President De Klerk rejects the Westminster 'winner takes all' formula because of his conviction that as many of South Arica's complex interest groups as possible should feel themselves included in, rather than alienated from, government. This can be achieved through acceptable mechanisms such as strong regional states, the constitutional limitation of majority power, without a minority veto, and special majorities for some types of legislation. Most of our parties are multi-racial, so there is no question of resisting 'Black majority rule' or of entrenching 'white' power. President De Klerk rejects the abuse of majority power to the detriment of minorities, however that majority is composed. He and other political leaders believe that, at this stage, no single party can rule South Africa alone regardless of its majority. They accordingly support the idea of a government of national unity based on power sharing during the first five years. However, the underlying realities will not change during that period and some inclusive formula for the continuation of a form of power-sharing will, in all likelihood, be necessary. David Steward, government spokesman, Office of the State President, 8000 Cape Town, South Africa</p>

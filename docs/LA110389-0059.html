			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELM'S FAMILY PLANS LAWSUIT, SORTS FILM OFFERS  </P> <P> The family of Buck Helm, who survived four days in the rubble of the collapsed  Nimitz Freeway after the Bay Area earthquake, has retained an attorney to file  a claim against Caltrans -- and a press agent to deal with reporters and "sort  through" a plethora of offers from movie and television production companies.  </P> <P> "I'm taking all the offers," said Gary Frischer, the Beverly Hills public  relations man who was hired by the Helm family's attorney, Vasilios B. Choulos  of San Francisco. "We are sorting through all the offers at this time,"  Frischer said. "Some are lucrative."  </P> <P> But Choulos, in an interview, insisted that the family was not trying to cash  in on Helm's instant status as a folk hero. "I want to deny and scotch that  before it gets started," Choulos said.  </P> <P> Choulos said he hired Frischer, who is not well known in the Hollywood  community, "to interface with the media."  </P> <P> Choulos said it is "premature" to discuss the sale of rights to the Buck Helm  story. "Buck could take a turn for the worse," Choulos said. "He is a tough  bird, (but) he is under heavy medication and has a tube down his throat."  </P> <P> Helm, 57, who spent 90 hours pinned in the Nimitz rubble and was rescued after  officials had given up hope of finding more survivors, was transferred Thursday  from Highland Hospital to Oakland's Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, where his  condition remained "serious but stable."  </P> <P> The attorney first said the family had received "at least 50 phone calls" from  television and film producers seeking rights to the story, though he later  scaled the number back to 25.  </P> <P> "Their interest is noted, and they're told that at a later date, we'll get back  to them," Choulos said. He declined to name the companies that made approaches.  </P> <P> Choulos said he was retained by Helm's former wife and their children "to look  after his interests when a claim is made against the state" and "to sort out  various problems." He also said he welcomes the state to set up a compensation  package that would avoid taking the Helm matter to court.  </P> <P> The lawyer told an Oakland press conference Thursday evening that the family  intends to set up a charitable foundation that would receive contributions from  the public "to help victims less fortunate" than Helm. He was vague about how  the funds would be disbursed.  </P> <P> Robb Rothman, a partner with Leading Artists Agency in Beverly Hills, said the  "feeding frenzy" among Hollywood types is typical for such a high-profile  story.  </P> <P> "There are a number of ways to tell this story: from the point of view of the  family, from the point of view of the rescuers," he said. "In a true-life story  like this, (producers) will go out and try to buy up as many peoples' rights as  they can."  </P> <P> The agent, who is not involved in the Helm story, said that typically "a lot of  marginal players" come out of the woodwork to bid for participants' rights.  </P> <P> Rothman said the Helm saga is best suited to movie-of-the-week treatment and  estimated that the rights to the story could bring a total of $75,000 to  $100,000 to all the major participants.  </P> <P> Typically, an independent producer would secure the rights to the story and  then approach a television network.  </P> <P> An official at NBC said the network has not yet been approached. "Obviously,  this is a very uplifting and heartwarming story, but that doesn't automatically  make it a TV movie," he said.  </P> <P> "You've got to look at the whole package," he added.  </P></p>

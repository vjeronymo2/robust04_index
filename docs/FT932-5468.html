			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Generali uses reserves to buy two companies GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance company, is dipping into its cash reserves to reinforce its dominant position in the domestic market by buying two small insurance companies. The group is purchasing 50 per cent of Risparmio Vita and majority control of Risparmio Assicurazioni, two subsidiaries of Turin's big city savings bank. The two companies have premium income of L19bn (Dollars 13m) and L22bn respectively. The acquisitions, part of a closer co-operation between the insurer and the bank in financial services, follow last month's increase in Generali's stake in its growing Hungarian operation. EA Generali, the group's Vienna-based subsidiary, raised its stake in Hungary's Providencia Versicherung to 75.1 per cent from 56 per cent. Providencia, created in 1990, is Hungary's third biggest insurer, with 650,000 customers and total premium income of Ft5.6bn (Dollars 63m) in 1992. Premiums are forecast to rise to Ft8bn this year. The Generali group is already active in Hungary through its majority-owned Generali Budapest subsidiary. Providencia made a net loss of Ft495m in 1992 as a result of costs associated with building up a branch network. The company hopes to break even by 1995.</p>

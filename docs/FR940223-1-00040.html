This change would allow carriers more time to take actions necessary to retrofit Stage 2 airplanes, and would make the flight data recorder replacement rule more compatible with the noise transition requirements without having a significant impact on safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> dates:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received by March 25, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> addresses:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on this notice should be mailed, in triplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;200), Docket No. 27532, 800 Independence Avenue, Washington, DC 20591.

The final rule, &sect;121.343(c), was issued in response to a recommendation from the National Transportation Safety Board that was based on accident/incident files for January 1983 to February 1986 that revealed a high failure rate for metal foil flight recorders. The data revealed that 37 recorders (48 percent) had one or more malfunctioning parameters preceding the accident or incident, preventing the recording or readout of pertinent data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Air Transport Association's Petition for Exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In August 1991, the Air Transport Association (ATA) petitioned the FAA for an exemption from &sect;121.343(c). The ATA stated that the compliance date for the digital flight data recorder (DFDR) retrofit was inappropriate when considering the schedule for either retrofitting airplanes with noise abatement equipment or retiring airplanes in order to comply with the Stage 3 transition mandated in September 1991 (56 FR 48628, September 25, 1991). The FAA denied the ATA exemption request, stating that the Stage 3 transition rule did not mandate the retirement of any Stage 2 airplanes. The FAA pointed out that noise abatement equipment was expected to be available for virtually the entire active fleet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / UK Company News: First-quarter setback for Royal Trustco THE RECESSION, higher non-performing loans and lower spreads reduced profit at Royal Trustco, Canada's second-largest trust company, in the first quarter. Profit was CDollars 24m (USDollars 20.3m), or 6 cents a share, down 38 per cent from a year earlier. Loan volume was weak and assets dipped CDollars 4bn to CDollars 36.6bn from a year earlier. Expenses remained relatively high, while non-performing loans are mostly in the depressed real estate sector. At March 31 they totalled CDollars 1.1bn, including CDollars 440m for the British subsidiary and the balance in north America. Royal Trustco is the key financial services unit of the Bronfman interests of Toronto. Toronto Dominion Bank has had its credit rating reduced slightly by Canadian Bond Rating Service because of problem loans in the troubled Ontario economy. Net non-performing loans rose to 2.9 per cent of total loans at October 31 last, and although they have since declined slightly, they are still higher than the industry average. Midland Walwyn, Canada's biggest retail brokerage, earned CDollars 11.4m, or 37 cents a share, in the first quarter, up from CDollars 3.5m, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>

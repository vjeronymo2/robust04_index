			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Solitary activist takes on a giant - A boardroom tussle at Sears, Roebuck IN the right hand corner, the combined boardroom might of retailing and financial services giant Sears, Roebuck, one of the largest companies in the US. In the left, the solitary figure of Mr Robert Monks, seasoned shareholder activist. A tussle between the two sides over the composition of the Sears, Roebuck board will come to a head next Thursday when the Chicago-based company holds its annual meeting. Mr Monks is seeking shareholder support to take up one of three vacant seats on the Sears, Roebuck board. Sears, Roebuck is strongly opposing him. Contested board elections are hardly unusual during the US annual meeting season: takeover bidders and corporate raiders with large stakes in companies are increasingly using proxy, or shareholder voting battles, to exert leverage over managements. What makes this contest so unusual is the figure of Mr Monks, who owns only 100 shares in Sears, Roebuck and is using the contest as a testing ground for ideas of the growing US corporate governance movement - the belief that companies' professional managers should be more accountable to their shareholders. In particular, Mr Monks' candidacy has focused attention on the composition of US boards and the methods by which directors are nominated. Mr Monks is one of the leading figures in the corporate governance movement, which includes some of the country's most powerful public pension funds. Aged 57, and a voluble zealot for the cause, he is a Harvard-educated lawyer who once headed the US Labor Department's pension programme. In the mid-1980s, he founded Institutional Shareholder Services, a pioneering Washington firm that advises pension funds on how to vote their proxies, but last year he resigned from ISS to set up a new organisation - Institutional Shareholder Partners. This, he said, would allow him to take a more directly activist role in pushing shareholder rights issues - and the Sears, Roebuck campaign is one result. It comes at a time when Sears, Roebuck is suffering from considerable shareholder dissatisfaction over its poor financial and share price performance. The problems centre on its core 104-year-old retailing business rather than its large financial services operations, which include the brokerage house Dean Witter Securities. Last summer, the situation was deemed so serious that Mr Edward Brennan, the group's chairman and chief executive, resumed direct responsibility for the retailing side and began to slash costs. The starting point for Mr Monks' campaign is his observation that the Sears, Roebuck board - in common with virtually all large US corporations - is a self-perpetuating body, nominating new directors who are then rubber-stamped in shareholder elections. He complains that although this passes for 'shareholder democracy,' it does not allow investors to exercise any real choice and does not produce a board of genuinely independent directors, even if the nominees come from outside the company. 'So long as an individual 'owes' his membership on a board uniquely to personal selection by the chief executive officer, he cannot be considered to be 'independent.'' Applying these principles to the particular case of Sears, Roebuck, Mr Monks suggests a lack of independent boardroom voices may be related to the company's 'less than mediocre performance.' His election, he says, would give the board an independent shareholder perspective and his business experience - such as the chairmanship of the Boston Company, a financial services business taken over by Shearson - would allow him to offer ideas which might help Sears, Roebuck to work better. For example, he says the company should either reach its target return on equity or be restructured. These remarks echo suggestions by some critics that Sears, Roebuck might be better broken up. He also maintains that Mr Brennan has taken on too many responsibilities for one man and the functions of chairman and chief executive should be separated. The Sears, Roebuck viewpoint is very different. The company argues Mr Monks' primary interest is in using it as a laboratory for his ideas of corporate governance and his presence on the board would distract it from its central goal of improving the group's financial performance. Whatever the merits of the case, the odds seem stacked against Mr Monks. One reason is an initiative Sears, Roebuck took in March which blunts his campaign. It announced that it would be strengthening the role of outside directors, initially by cutting the size of the board from 15 to 10 and eliminating the seats of four company employees. The only inside director will now be the Sears, Roebuck chairman. The smaller number of directors also has the effect, given Sears, Roebuck voting methods, of making it harder for a candidate such as Mr Monks to win a contested election. Mr Monks' limited financial fire power is also a factor. While Sears, Roebuck has budgeted Dollars 5.5m for the proxy contest, Mr Monks is using only Dollars 250,000 of his own money and he says this has limited his ability to reach smaller Sears, Roebuck shareholders. So, too, has the company's refusal to give him access to its shareholder list - and legal action it is taking against him to support this action. He also complains that the tortuous regulations of proxy contests - which the Securities and Exchange commission is considering reforming - has restricted his ability to manoeuvre. The composition of the company's shareholder list will weigh against him. Some 35 to 40 per cent of its stock is held by institutional investors and he may pick up a significant protest vote here. For example, the California Public Employees Retirement System, the largest public pension fund in the US, has been so dissatisfied with Sears' performance that last January it send a delegation to demand change from Mr Brennan. But even institutional backing may not be that forthcoming: Mr George Reagan, from the large Teachers Retirement System of Texas, expresses some admiration for Mr Monks, but says he may vote against him because he is worried about public funds, which are ultimately responsible to politicians, playing such an activist role in corporate governance. 'Would you want the (British) prime minister to be running private enterprise?' he asks. It will be even harder for Mr Monks to win the backing of smaller shareholders, who hold around 40 per cent of the company's shares, while the trustees of Sears, Roebuck's employee benefit funds - which own a particularly large 23 per cent of the company - can be virtually guaranteed to vote against him. Mr Monks admits to being a little pessimistic. 'My situation is distinctly a long shot,' he declares. In the event of victory, he will try to recoup his expenses from the company, but if he fails, he will be Dollars 250,000 out of pocket. Sears, Roebuck suggests that he will have other compensations - immense free publicity for his business and for a book he has written on corporate governance, due to be published immediately after the proxy battle. Mr Monks, wearing the mantle of an idealistic zealot for better corporate governance, says he hopes his campaign will at least have focused attention on some important issues. That it may do, for while the Sears, Roebuck battle seem unlikely to lead to a rash of such initiatives, it could help focus US investor attention more closely on the selection of the people running companies  - supposedly in shareholders' best interests.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PIERCE DECLARES HIS INNOCENCE, THEN TAKES 5TH  </P> <P> Former Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. declared himself innocent of  wrongdoing Friday but again invoked Fifth Amendment protection against  self-incrimination to avoid testifying about scandals at the Department of  Housing and Urban Development.  </P> <P> "I believe that I committed no illegal or wrongful acts," Pierce said in a  statement to a House oversight subcommittee. "I look forward to the time when  innuendoes and rumors to the contrary are put to rest. I look forward to the  time when I can tell my story, and I can assure you that I have a story to  tell."  </P> <P> But Pierce refused to talk when members of the panel questioned him about his  eight-year tenure during the Ronald Reagan Administration, declining to answer  on the constitutional ground that it might tend to incriminate him.  </P> <P> Two of Pierce's former top assistants, Lance H. Wilson and Deborah Gore Dean,  also have invoked the Fifth Amendment in refusing to testify at previous  hearings before the employment and housing subcommittee of the House Government  Operations Committee.  </P> <P> Two Democratic congressmen said they would press for a formal demand that Atty.  Gen. Dick Thornburgh appoint a special prosecutor to determine if Pierce  violated the law at HUD or committed perjury when he testified to House  investigators last May.  </P> <P> Under the law providing for appointments of independent counsels, the attorney  general must consider such a step if a majority of the Democratic or Republican  members of the House Judiciary Committee request him to do so. If he refuses,  he must explain his reasons in writing.  </P> <P> Reps. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.), who serve on  the Judiciary Committee and attended the oversight hearing as observers, said  that they would seek signatures of other Democrats on the judiciary panel and  forward the request to Thornburgh next week.  </P> <P> "I think it is clear from these hearings . . . that there is criminal activity  at HUD in the area of defrauding of the federal government, conspiracy to  defraud the government, and we may well have perjury," Morrison said.  </P> <P> "Sam Pierce is stonewalling," Schumer said. "Our only choice now is to take the  process from the legislative arena and move it into the arena of an independent  counsel."  </P> <P> Pierce, who last Sept. 26 became the first former Cabinet officer since the  Teapot Dome scandal of the 1920s to take the Fifth Amendment before a  congressional committee, renewed his accusation of bias against the House  investigative panel.  </P> <P> But he immediately invoked his constitutional privilege to remain silent, even  when asked such questions as whether he had obtained all the documents he needs  from HUD to prepare for his appearance.  </P> <P> Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the panel, said its hearings over  the last five months have disclosed a "colossal scandal" at HUD during Pierce's  tenure, including fraud, embezzlement and rampant political favoritism.  </P> <P> Although Lantos contended that Pierce legally had waived his right to remain  silent on many subjects by his voluntary testimony last spring, he said that he  would not seek to prosecute Pierce for contempt of Congress for refusing to  answer questions at the hearing.  </P> <P> "My feeling is the American people on the whole know all they want to know  about HUD . . . . I have high hopes the Justice Department will do its duty,"  Lantos said.  </P> <P> Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) told Pierce that his previous testimony  conflicts with sworn statements by other witnesses. "I was hoping you'd use  this opportunity to clarify what I think could be perjury," he said.  </P> <P> However, Pierce, accompanied by three attorneys, refused to say anything beyond  the statement that he volunteered at the outset of the hearing. In the  statement, he said that all of the allegations against him had been  investigated by HUD's inspector general and found to be groundless.  </P> <P> Although a report last April by HUD Inspector General Paul A. Adams set off the  inquiry, Adams had been unable to question Pierce until the former secretary's  last day in office on Jan. 20, 1989.  </P> <P> In his latest appearance before the House panel, Pierce again invoked his  privilege as a witness to bar television, radio and photographic coverage. As a  result, he was chased down the halls and into the street by a group of  photographers and broadcasters as he left.  </P> <P> Lantos said afterward that Pierce tried to bill the government for his legal  fees in connection with the House hearings. He said the request had been  rejected.  </P></p>

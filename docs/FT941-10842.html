			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / LA quake 'set to cost insurers about Dollars 2.5bn' The Los Angeles earthquake last month is set to cost the insurance industry Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.69bn), the third largest insured losses after hurricanes Andrew and Hugo, according to an insurance trade association estimate yesterday. The estimate of losses, from Property Claims Services, is at the high end of other, less well-informed estimates in recent days. These have put the cost to insurers at anything from Dollars 1bn to Dollars 3bn. The association's figures are compiled from information supplied by 30 insurance companies and an analysis of the association's database, which carries details of the level of property insurance cover in the affected area. They are generally regarded in the insurance world as the most accurate picture available of the final cost of the earthquake. According to the association, about a third of home-owners in the area, and a slightly higher proportion of businesses, have earthquake coverage. The high cost of such insurance, and the large deductibles born by people with cover, has discouraged many from buying insurance. The industry is anticipating about 230,000 claims as a result of the earthquake, many of them from causes other than direct shock damage, including damage by fire, explosion and broken glass. If the association's estimate proves accurate, and if Congress approves the proposed Dollars 8.6bn federal relief plan for the area, then total outside help for California will reach about Dollars 11bn. The rest of the earthquake's cost will be born by property owners or taxpayers in California. California Governor Pete Wilson said last month that the total cost of the quake could be anywhere between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 30bn. Hurricane Andrew, in southern Florida and the Gulf of Mexico in 1992, cost insurers Dollars 15.5bn; Hugo cost Dollars 4.2bn.</p>

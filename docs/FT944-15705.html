			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Equity Markets Markets: Final quarter promises more gains - London Suddenly, the UK stock market looks a more confident place and the final quarter of the year offers a more promising prospect. Since the beginning of October, the market has recovered by about 5.7 per cent after its prolonged setback over the previous month and, more importantly, the gilt-equity yield ratio has returned to around 2.19 times. The first question on the lips of every market analyst is whether the market rebound will carry it up to those optimistic year-end targets set up earlier in the year. This would require a further gain of well over 8 per cent from Friday night's levels, so it may be a little early to start cheering. The technicians, as always, sound cautious. Derivative Securities, the futures market specialist, having correctly pointed out that the market was markedly oversold at the end of last week, is now wary of the steepness of the sudden rise; 'far too steep to be sustained for too long', it comments. If the market breaks out above the Footsie 3,110-3,135 band, Derivative Securities sees the next line of resistance at 3,175-3,220. Still a fair distance away from those 3,400-3,600 Footsie year-end forecasts on record. The view consolidating among analysts is that the market has been over-estimating the dangers of inflation and the interest rate fears which go with them. '. . . the implied risk embedded in the valuations of gilts and equities is way too high,' summarises Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tilney, adding bluntly that the belief that base rates could move a further 1 per cent higher this year 'was wrong'. The strategy team at Yamaichi puts it even more strongly, saying the latest inflation data indicates that the previous figures were 'probably an aberration'. This sea change in views on inflation has been inspired by the US as well as developments at home. Linked to expectations of a broadly neutral Budget next month - at the Conservative conference, the chancellor of the exchequer stood fast against premature tax cuts - the likelihood of a further recovery in gilts this week is rated highly. And, as equity strategists have argued for many weeks, recovery in bonds is the required basis for a recovery in equities. Markets have remained highly volatile, and investors would be wrong to ignore this just because the trend has been upward, for a change. This week and the week following present a host of hurdles in the shape of global and domestic economic data. Also overhanging investors will be the prospects for the November budget and the likelihood that an important by-election will shortly test the nerves as well as the political ratings of Mr Major's government. The market may have to struggle hard for that final 8 per cent gain.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The fighting between Burmese Government troops and  minority rebels which broke out along the Burmese-Thai border  areas opposite Mae Hong Son, Chiang Mai, and Chiang Rai shows no  sign of cessation. Reinforcements from both sides were sent to  the battlefields.    A report received on 27 May said that the minority rebels  were well prepared and expected to push the Rangoon troops out  of the border town of Thachilek soon. The two sides are now  fighting at 23 different locations in the Shan State.  Meanwhile, 7,000 rebels are surrounding government strongholds  at Mong Chot, Mong Pan, and Mong Twan. The government troops in  the three townships are expected to surrender to the rebels.    Two hundred Burmese soldiers were reportedly killed and  several hundred others wounded during the encounters at Doi Tung  and Doi Kongmu on the night of 20 May. Rebel casualties were 30  killed and 65 wounded. The Burmese troops at the three  locations were assigned to block the road leading to the border  town of Thachilek.    The Border Patrol Police Zone 3 has issued an order  completely sealing the border with Burma and has pledged to take  drastic legal action against any persons violating the ban.  Patrol teams have been sent out to work along the border around  the clock to cope with any possible territorial infringement.    The latest report indicated that Khun Sa's soldiers have  successfully crossed the Salween River to the western bank  despite tough resistance from government troops. No reports on  casualties are available. Three battalions of Khun Sa's Army  are now surrounding Mong Pyak, Mong Tongi, and Doi Wi, only 30  kilometers from Tachilek. Khun Sa plans to attack and destroy  Tachilek before the end of this rainy season.    Three hundred and twenty Burmese fled to Thailand from 24 to  26 May and were later repatriated by Thai authorities. Police  and military reinforcements were dispatched to guard the border  in Chiang Rai Province to deter an influx of refugees.    Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan disclosed that the  Thai Government has no policy of setting up a new refugee  holding center. However, refugees from Burma will be allowed to  stay in the country on a temporary basis.</p>

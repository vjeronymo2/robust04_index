			<p>921022 FT  22 OCT 92 / Successor to Kanemaru named MR Keizo Obuchi, an aide to ex-premier Mr Noboru Takeshita, was today named as successor to former kingpin Mr Shin Kanemaru as chairman of the dominant faction in Japan's ruling party, but rivals refused to accept the new leader, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The announcement was made by Mr Ken Harada, 73, a respected elder of the faction, which is the largest of five groups that make up the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Mr Harada chaired a week of meetings behind closed doors to try to achieve consensus on the appointment. However, Mr Obuchi's rivals, who back Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata as Mr Kanemaru's heir, put off a decision on whether to accept the choice, NHK television reported. Mr Obuchi, 55, a former LDP secretary-general, could inherit extensive influence in Japanese politics if he can avoid a break-up of the faction. However, there has been much public criticism of the closed-door horse-trading involved in his selection.</p>

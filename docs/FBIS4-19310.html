			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ernst Bieber: "The 72-Billion Deal by E. </F> Shevardnadze in Vienna"]    [Text] The Republic of Georgia is apparently making  adventurous efforts to raise money on the free Western capital  market. In Vienna, a court has temporarily seized copies of  Georgian Government bonds and securities, documents signed by  President Eduard Shevardnadze. The total value of the sum  guaranteed by Tbilisi is the equivalent of nearly 72 billion  schillings! A Vienna businessman tried to convert these bonds  into money. As a result of this, he was imprisoned for a few  days.    The 54-year-old Heinz J. was arrested on 12 April on  suspicion of fraud and forgery at a hotel in Vienna's 15th  district when he tried to sell Georgian securities to an  interested person.    Securities of a nominal value of $10 million each (120  million schillings) were involved. The government bonds were  offered at half or one-third of this price. Buyers were  promised repayment of the nominal value in a few years' time.    The Vienna businessman got involved in the capital  procurement operation through other agents and wanted to  participate in the profit. J. is not unknown to the finance  police. About two years ago, on 9 April 1992, he was arrested  in Vienna on suspicion of participating in a fraud involving  millions of schillings. At the time, he described himself as an  expert on deals with the East, reported enthusiastically about  profits from coffee and cigarette deals, and persuaded several  people to participate. Yet these megadeals turned out to be  failures, and the damage amounted to about 2 million schillings.  Heinz J. was released from prison a few days later. He then  fled to Florida, where he has a second residence in Boca Raton  near Miami. His lawyer at the time, Herbert Eichenseder, was  successful in obtaining the rescindment of the international  arrest warrant. J. returned to Austria and has largely paid off  the damages.    However, he will still be facing charges of fraud at the  provincial court in Vienna in June. Klothilde Eckbrecht will be  the judge.    This new affair also "smells" of fraud. Officials from  Vienna police headquarters even suspect organized crime behind  the planned deal involving billions of schillings. The fact  that a Vienna businessman who had previously come under the  suspicion of fraud was trying to sell Georgian Government bonds  worth 72 billion schillings was not exactly credible.    J. claimed that the documents were copies of real  securities.  The originals were to be handed over to the buyer after the  money transfer.    The criminal police submitted the documents to the Georgian  Embassy in Vienna for examination. On Friday [15 April] the  answer from Tbilisi arrived: The documents are authentic, and  so is Shevardnadze's signature.    The judge responsible who until recently had been carrying  out the investigations on the suspicion of fraud (punishment one  to 10 years) ordered J.'s release from prison on Friday.    The question remains whether the Vienna businessman will be  continuing to raise money for Georgia.</p>

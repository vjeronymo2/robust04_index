			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Beckenham reduces loss to Pounds 5.12m BECKENHAM Group, the USM-traded engineer, cut its pre-tax loss by Pounds 325,000 to Pounds 5.12m in the year to October 31. The outcome was struck on turnover down from Pounds 47.1m to Pounds 34.1m and after exceptional charges of Pounds 2.33m (Pounds 1.92m). These were related principally to redundancies, reorganisation and property write-downs. The company said margins on ductwork trading had been very poor, particularly in the second half. After a tax charge of Pounds 782,000 (Pounds 697,000 credit), losses per share came out at 11.4p (11p). There is no divided for the year - last year an interim of 0.5p was paid.</p>

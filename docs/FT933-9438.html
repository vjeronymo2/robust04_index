			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Arts: Verdi and Britten - Bath and Wessex Opera City of Bath Opera, launched two years ago, is now more grandly re-titled Bath and Wessex Opera, and its activities are expanding apace. All this week in the Bath Theatre Royal there are alternating performances of La traviata and The Turn of the Screw: this is the first attempt to put on two operas at one go. The stated aims of this small company - most ambitious of the many 'private' opera enterprises that have recently sprung up, founded by the producer-designer John Pascoe and the conductor Klaus Donath - are 'international' casting and productions faithful to the letter of the text. Both were embodied in the Verdi, sung in the original language, yet it was hardly the result of their combination that made the performance so peculiarly affecting. It was, rather, the acquisition of one of the world's tiny handful of 'real' Violettas currently before the public, Nelly Miricioiu. This soprano, a Romanian now resident in this country for more than a decade, has for some strange reason never arrived at an established position of eminence in British opera that such great and special gifts should assure her. All of our opera intendants ought to drop in on the Theatre Royal this week, to remind themselves how Verdi singing of Mediterranean intensity, colour and musical grace, can sound. We have had much of other kinds in recent times, but this abundant, intensely italianate kind has been a particular rarity. Miricioiu's Violetta, as Londoners will recall from her moving 1984 ENO portrayal (in good English) at the Coliseum, is achieved upon a wonderfully full, free yet fine-spun delivery of the singing line. Her control of portamento phrasing, tapering of dynamics (with soft high shadings of exquisite delicacy) and generously vibrant emotional attack are all characteristics of a noble tradition in the role - a tradition exemplified by fewer and fewer singers, which is why this particular exemplar deserves to be cherished. She is a touching actress, who fits into Pascoe's cleverly designed costumes and David Myerscough-Jones's romantic scene-perspectives with easy authority, and who creates a relationship with Gordon Wilson's Alfredo (youthfully handsome, vocally callow but sensitive) in which all the basic points - illness, passionate response, awareness of age difference, access of moral courage, extremes of pathos and poignancy - are made without resort to outlandish or strenuously original effects. In the Theatre Royal the constant glow of her womanly warmth made up for much that was less satisfying around it. Pascoe's production, traditional in the less distinguished sense, and Donath's stolid conducting of the Bournemouth Sinfonietta (fearfully loud on occasion) suggested rather too often that this Traviata was international-opera-by-numbers, not an artistically serious ensemble performance. David Barrell's drily eloquent Germont senior and Penelope Walker's Flora regularly raised the tone; but the divertissement at Flora's party, complete with four Chippendale-style body-builders decked with bulls' horns and Marion Tait and David Morse from the Birmingham Royal Ballet as guest-appearance dancers, lowered it considerably. From this to the remarkably inventive Britten performance the following evening was a reassuring move in the right direction. No 'international' names, perhaps, but notable British singing-actors - Janis Kelly (Governess), Nigel Robson (Prologue and Quint), Enid Hartle (Mrs Grose), Sarah Pring (Miss Jessel) - who with telling accuracy and subtlety lock into their roles. The children, Paula Bishop as Flora and Ben Sutcliffe as Miles, are among the most troublingly vivid I have seen and heard: nervously alert, vocally true, quicksilver in their manipulation of governess and housekeeper. Roger Vignoles, a celebrated recital-pianist now building an additional career as an opera-conductor, focuses the musical tensions with unforced tautness: in terms of an intimate yet dramatically forceful projection of this astonishingly spare, fertile opera-score there can be few better theatres in the country in which to play, sing or indeed hear The Turn of the Screw. With a precise, always subtly motivated use of a few curtains - underscored by side mirror-panels and trailing scarves for the ghosts - the producer, Paula Fuchs, and designers, Mr Myerscough-Jones and Andrea Carr, create layers of illusion, fantasy and dream through which the spectator moves as if spellbound. Theatre Royal, Bath: season continues until August 14</p>

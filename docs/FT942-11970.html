			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / International Company News: Arcon cleared to develop mine Arcon, the Irish exploration company in which Mr Tony O'Reilly, the chief executive of the Heinz food group, holds a 23 per cent stake, has received final planning permission to develop its 6.2m tonne zinc/lead ore deposit at Galmoy in Ireland. Once brought into production at an estimated development cost of some IPounds 65m (Pounds 63m), the mine is anticipated to be one of the lowest-cost zinc mines in the world due to the proximity of the ore to the surface, and will rank alongside Europe's largest. The reserves have an average grade of 11.31 per cent zinc and 1.12 per cent lead, and will be extracted over a 10-year period. The directors expect construction work to begin this August or September, and for the mine to come into production in early 1996. Debt financing was being put in place but a rights issue was not ruled out to finance part of the development cost.</p>

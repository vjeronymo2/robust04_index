			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Depressed prices drive Kaiser down to Dollars 2.6m KAISER Aluminum, the Texas-based aluminium processor, yesterday reported fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 2.6m, or 5 cents a share, down from Dollars 27.1m, or 47 cents, in the same period a year earlier. Full-year earnings fell to Dollars 27.9m, or 47 cents a share, down from Dollars 108.4m, or Dollars 2.03. The sharp drop was due to depressed prices for alumina, primary aluminium and fabricated products, Kaiser said. Fourth-quarter results included a pre-tax charge of Dollars 29m for the write-down of inventory. Kaiser said the company was able to remain marginally profitable in the quarter, in spite of aluminium industry overcapacity, because of cost-cutting and shipments of value-added products. Fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 496m, up from Dollars 471.3m, and full-year 1992 sales totalled Dollars 1.9bn, down from Dollars 2.0bn. Maxxam, the US natural resources group that owns 87.2 per cent of Kaiser, yesterday reported a net loss for the fourth quarter and year. Forest products showed a profit for the quarter and the year, but property activities recorded a loss and Kaiser's earnings slump limited profitability. The fourth-quarter net loss came to Dollars 10.3m, or Dollars 1.09 a share, compared with profits of Dollars 9.8m, or Dollars 1.04, a year earlier. For the year, the group incurred a net loss of Dollars 7.3m, or 77 cents a share, against a 1991 profit of Dollars 57.5m, or Dollars 6.08.</p>

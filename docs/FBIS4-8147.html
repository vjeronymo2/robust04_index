			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 11 (AFP) -- NATO Secretary General  Manfred Woerner said Monday [11 April] that effective air  strikes in Bosnia would be impossible if Russia was to be  consulted first as it had demanded. "If we have to set up a  process of consultation which would last hours and hours, it  would never happen," Woerner was quoted as saying by a NATO  official.    He also warned Serbs against revenge attacks against UN  Protection Forces, saying NATO would not hesitate to launch more  air strikes if requested.    Russia reacted angrily to air strikes Sunday [10 April] and  Monday on Serb positions around the besieged Moslem enclave of  Gorazde by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). After  Monday's air strikes, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  insisted that Russia should be consulted before all NATO raids.    "It is very dangerous and a big mistake to make such  decisions without prior consultation with Russia," Kozyrev said  during an official visit to Madrid.    But Woerner, speaking at Aachen in Germany, said it would  not  be possible to protect UN troops -- who called for NATO's air  strikes Sunday and Monday -- if there were hours-long delays.    "Close air support has to be rapid. You have troops under  fire. You want to protect them. You have to hit very rapidly,"  Woerner was quoted as telling reporters.    He also said he hoped attacks on UN troops and Gorazde, in  eastern Bosnia, would stop after Monday's air strikes. But he  added: "We did what we said and we will not hesitate to repeat  close air support air strikes as long as requested."</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WRITING CAN BE DANGEROUS. . . .  </P> <P> Your column "Maiming the Message Is Only Half the Danger" (View, Sept. 19)  might be subtitled "Cliches, Ill-Thought-Out Assertions, and Timid Fears by a  Cowardly Writer."  </P> <P> The whole article is a mass of mush about the alleged ruination of civilized  writing caused by word processors. If you were still teaching English you could  send one of your Freshman Comp kids to do a library search on the topic and,  assuming the kid could do research, you would be presented with a list of more  than 250 similar articles, an average of about one per week for the past five  years, on the same subject, and all like yours, sans substance and full of  vague, dumb fears.  </P> <P> It does no good to point to that English professor's conclusions about whether  using a computer or a typewriter produced better composition. Her test was  flawed from the beginning because she failed to include a third group of  writers: Those who write by hand. By logic, by nature, and by sheer mass of the  evidence, the direct link between brain, arm, hand and fingers onto paper  produces the best prose and thought. From Plato and Aristotle to St. Augustine,  St. Thomas, Shakespeare, Hobbes, Locke, Goethe, Jane Austen, Dostoevski,  Neitzsche, and on and on and on, the really great writers wrote by hand. (The  only major one whose works would have been improved by using a word processor  is Leo Tolstoy. War and Peace is just too long.)  </P> <P> So instead of your muttering over the dangers to the nation's literary prowess  of the computer as a writing tool, you'd show more strength of character by  renouncing your typewriter and declaring heroically that you are going back to  basics and henceforth write with a quill pen. Be a real Luddite.  </P> <P> Forty years ago a fountain pen might have been an acceptable alternative, but  now a Waterman costs from $150 up and is just a status symbol, so a quill pen  is the only serious choice.  </P> <P> As for your other point, about the potential life-threatening dangers posed by  electromagnetism from computer screens, that's piddling stuff for real writers  who historically have been placed in jeopardy by all kinds of hazards:  stabbing, hanging, beheading, shooting, imprisonment, torture, Siberia, the  Gulag and other forms of exile such as that currently suffered by Mr. Salman  Rushdie. The worst you have to worry about as a writer is that at some future  wine and cheese party there are those Costa Mesa officials who might cut you  dead.  </P> <P> Nor can it be demonstrated that one writing machine is significantly safer than  another. Use a pencil and you're apt to get lead poisoning, especially if you  lick the point; for inspiration. From a pen (whether quill, steel nib or  fountain) there's a danger of general poisoning -- well-documented in the  syndrome known as the "poison pen." They say that people have drowned while  writing under water with their ball points. Even a typewriter is not risk-free.  I heard of an author whose foot was smashed when she dropped her Underwood on  it.  </P> <P> What with one thing and another (and I forgot to mention the possibility of  alcoholism), it's surprising that serious writers can buy health and life  insurance.  </P> <P> So please stop moaning on about another tired old topic.  </P> <P> THOMAS MCENROE,  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Modernisation of west coast rail planned - Pounds 600m cost of updating Victorian link with London will be privately financed Today the government will announce plans for a Pounds 600m privately financed modernisation of Britain's west coast railway line,to the relief of industrialists in north-west England and Scotland. An original Victorian artefact, the line links London with the industrial cities of Birmingham and Manchester and the ports of Liverpool and Glasgow. However it has too many bends, unstable banks in cuttings, old rail bridges over roads, road bridges over rails, and outmoded brick tunnels. These have prevented high-speed trains using the line, keeping typical journey times up at 2 hours, 40 minutes or more between Manchester or Liverpool and London. The result is a deterrent to inward investment and relocation, according to agencies responsible for wooing footloose industry. The prospects of using the UK as a land bridge to the rest of the European Union via Liverpool and the Channel Tunnel are also affected. There was a warm welcome for yesterday's announcement at KPMG Peat Marwick's budget-watching party, where most north-west industrial leaders gathered. Industrialists were cynical, however, at the prospects of funds being readily forthcoming.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Divided on dividends The main interest for investors next week might normally be the final leg of the current company reporting season. But though the next decisive move in the FT-SE clearly hinges on the next occupant of 10 Downing Street, the fundamentals should not be overlooked. The news so far from companies with a December 1991 year-end has been mixed. Profits have perhaps been a touch worse than expected, owing mainly to harsh cost cutting and high provisioning. But balance sheets have emerged looking healthier than the predictions. Above all, the market's worst fears on the dividend front have not been realised. Financials were always the most vulnerable sector, and even there the shock of a completely passed final from Royal Insurance was offset by a mere two-thirds cut from Midland. That said, the determination of managements to maintain payouts leaves the market badly exposed to a yet further prolonged recession. Even on a sharp bounce in 1992 earnings, very few capital goods stocks will show dividend cover of more than two times. For bulls, the high yields on many industrials have turned shares into convertibles on an economic recovery. The danger is in believing there is no downside. Equally, the other great hope - that low inflation would justify higher multiples - does not seem borne out by the inclusion of Guinness and Cable &amp; Wireless among the 10 worst-performing FT-SE stocks since Mr Lamont's Budget. Nor will it be while high real interest rates make it hard to value real growth in earnings.</p>

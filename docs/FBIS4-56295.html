The PRI  [Institutional Revolutionary Party], PAN [National Action  Party], and PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution]  representatives who agreed to hold the debate on 12 May also  decided that it would take place at 2100 to allow most of the  Mexican people to watch the debate, which will be broadcast live.    At a brief news conference called by PRI Deputy Secretary  General Esteban Moctezuma, PRD representative Adolfo Aguilar  Zinzer, and PRI presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de  Cevallos, it was announced that the site of the debate has not  yet been determined. According to presidential candidate  Fernandez de Cevallos, the site has not yet been selected  because of technicalities and logistics that need to be worked  out among the three parties.

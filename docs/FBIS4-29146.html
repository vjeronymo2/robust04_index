			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- The Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum opened a four-day working-level meeting  here Monday to discuss manpower development.    The 10th meeting is being attended by representatives from  17  APEC member countries, Chile, which is scheduled to join the  group in November, and the Pacific Economic Cooperation  Committee (PECC).    Discussions will be held in four subcommittees -- the  education forum, the economic development network, the  management network and the industrial technology network.    Participants are expected to concentrate on an occupational  training program proposed by South Korea at the fifth APEC  ministerial conference and the manpower development projects  agreed at the APEC leaders' meeting in Seattle, Washington, last  year.    The APEC occupational training program calls for exchanges  of  teachers, technology and technicians, job training, equipment  support and the formation of a network to exchange information  on occupational training.    Pae Yong-sik, an official of South Korea's Economic Planning  Board and chairman of the conference, said the meeting is aimed  at promoting the introduction to developing countries of  management skills from advanced nations.    South Korea hopes to foster a favorable investment and trade  climate in other countries by providing occupational training  for workers from developing states, Pae said.</p>

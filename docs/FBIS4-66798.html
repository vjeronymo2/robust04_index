			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Subrata Sen: "S.S. Ray Likely to Leave </F> Washington by November"]    [Text] New Delhi, April 11--While the United States is  clearing the decks for the appointment of its Ambassador to  India, a post lying vacant for about 17 months, the Indian  Ambassador to Washington, Mr Siddhartha Shankar Ray, is  reportedly preparing to return sometime in November.    Sources said that Mr Ray--during his recent six-day visit to  the country--had received an indication that the Prime Minister  was not averse to the idea. Officially, Mr Ray denies that he  will return by the end of the year.    During an informal chat with reporters, just before leaving  for Washington early this morning, Mr Ray said that it was too  early to discuss the issue. "There is plenty of time to think  about this. In any case I have some more months to serve there,"  he said.    However, sources said that after getting the indication from  appropriate quarters, Mr Ray had asked his family friends to  arrange for the renovation of his two houses: one at Friends  Colony in New Delhi; the other at Beltolla Road in Calcutta.  Also, he has reportedly asked that the houses be ready by the  end of October.    A source added: "If he comes back, he is no more interested  in politics in West Bengal but would like to spend more of his  time in New Delhi." Incidentally, Mr Ray was the president of  the West Bengal Pradesh Congress(I) and a member of the State  Assembly, before he was appointed the Ambassador to Washington  in November 1992.    It is not clear whether Mr Ray will be involved in politics  at the national level once he comes back.    Talking to reporters at his New Delhi residence on Sunday,  Mr  Ray had said that he would be using his trip to Jammu and  Kashmir, where he went to collect "facts" on terrorist  activities to consolidate India's position on the issue of  Pak-aided terrorism. He claimed that he had collected figures  during his two-day trip to J&amp;K [Jammu &amp; Kashmir] for the  "purpose of showing that Pakistani interference is still  continuing in the Valley."</p>

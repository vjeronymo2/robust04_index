			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wa'il al-Ibrashi] </F>   [Text] Libyan diplomatic sources have revealed that the  fugitive Egyptian millionaire Tawfiq 'Abd-al-Hayy, who lives in  Greece, was the main middleman in an abortive deal between Libya  and Russia before the recent UN Security Council resolution was  issued.    The sources said Tawfiq 'Abd-al-Hayy maintained close  relations with the Russian ambassador in Greece and introduced  him to Libyan officials. Libya was to pay Russia $1.8 billion  immediately in return for Russia using its veto when the draft  resolution to impose new sanctions against Libya came up for  voting at the UN Security Council. The deal failed because  Russia wanted the money paid before it used the veto. Libya  suspected that Russia would take the money and consider it part  repayment for Libyan debts to Russia and would not use the veto.  Libya transferred just $65 million and the deal failed.    It is known that the fugitive millionaire, who is wanted in  Egypt, maintains close relations with 'Abdallah al-Sanusi, a  close aide to al-Qadhdhafi and the man responsible for his  security.    ROSE AL-YUSUF has learned that the Libyan Council of  Ministers recently submitted to Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi a  memorandum demanding an investigation into all the funds paid to  middlemen to solve the Lockerbie crisis without result.</p>

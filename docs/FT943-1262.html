			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Give me a Hot Monk - Liqueurs / Giles MacDonogh rediscovers the joys of a sticky winter drink Tastes change. In the late 19th century sweet liqueurs were all the rage. It was a time when the idle rich drank themselves to death on powerful, sugary brews such as green Chartreuse or Benedictine. In the German painter George Grosz's autobiography we learn that even the inhabitants of Pomeranian Stolp, now Polish Slupsk, could, for as little as a mark, obtain powders which transformed crude schnapps into Chartreuse or Benedictine. Later as an art student in Dresden Grosz met a dreamy former schoolmaster who introduced him to Klosterlikor, which looked like 'thick, yellow glue' and tasted like a blend of brandy and syrup. The pot-bellied bottle's colourful label and imitative seal gave the impression that it had been culled from some monastery or other. 'The image of a fat, chummy monk drank our health.' If the number of imitations is anything to go by then Benedictine must have been one of the most popular drinks in the world on the eve of the first world war. In the Palais Benedictine, in Fecamp, northern France, there is a vast pyramid composed simply of counterfeit bottles drawn from every corner of the globe. I presume that somewhere in that heap is the bottle which Grosz enjoyed in his art school days while he put the world to rights with his friend. Benedictine was the bright idea of a Norman wine merchant called Alexander Le Grand. He came across the recipe for a monastic elixir apparently invented by a Venetian monk at Fecamp Abbey in the early 16th century. Le Grand reworked the recipe giving it that sweet, viscous quality which was the most memorable aspect of German imitations. In 1863 he launched Benedictine. It was an overnight success. Three years later he founded a public company to sell the liqueur. In 1881 it was quoted on the Paris bourse. By the turn of the century Le Grand had made such tremendously big profits that his humble house had metamorphosed into a little Chambord, stuffed to the oesophagus with works of art harking back to the age of those self-same monks who had contributed so unwittingly to his fortune. Ne'er-do-well sons and French succession laws wrought the usual havoc. Benedictine was eventually bought by Martini vermouth which was, in its turn, swallowed up by Bacardi rum. The drink, we are told, is much the same. It is made from 27 different herbs and spices: aloes, ambrette (a sort of amber-like hibiscus derivative), angelica, apricot kernels, arnica, maidenhair fern, melissa, cardomom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, hyssop, juniper, lemon peel, myrrh, nutmeg, pine kernels, saffron,tea, thyme and vanilla. From these wonderful ingredients a number of distillates and flavoured alcohols are made which are subsequently assembled together with syrup and honey (to give it the sweetness) and saffron and caramel (to give it colour). The brew is then heated and aged in cask. It takes about two years to make a bottle of Benedictine. Few people like the taste of neat Benedictine these days. It is a little like drinking liquid gingerbread. In America the most popular way of consuming the liqueur is with brandy (a B and B) and the company now bottles a ready-mixed version which accounts for a large percentage of sales in the US. The brandy goes some way towards cutting the sweetness of the Benedictine. Benedictine also combines well in cocktails. One of the more successful long drinks I tried in the bar of the Palais Benedictine was with a good slug of Benedictine combined with half orange and half grapefruit juice. Benedictine is apparently popular in some parts of Lancashire where it is drunk with hot water in a drink called 'Benny and Hot'. Sometime during the first world war a Lancastrian regiment was removed from the Western Front and sent to recuperate near Fecamp and this curious brew was born. Better, I think, is a Hot Monk which involves pouring hot lemon juice over Benedictine in the manner of a toddy. Best of all, I've found, is a Scotch Benny: a blend of 50 per cent Benedictine with 50 per cent blended Scotch whisky. It is the perfect winter warmer.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Take a rich sprinkling of serious chefs . . .  -Nicholas Lander gathers some tips from top professionals for entertaining throughout the year Rick Stein, The Seafood Restaurant, Padstow, PL28 8BY, Cornwall. Tel: 0841-532485. Earlier this year I bought Bistro Cooking by Patricia Wells (Kyle Cathie, Pounds 14.99). It is a book of recipes from bistros in France which serves the sort of food that everyone loves to eat and every chef loves to cook: Oeufs en Meurette, Estouffade Provencale, Brandade de Morue, Pommes a l'huile and Petit Sale. All the recipes work and are refreshingly simple. There are two fish dishes with similar sauces - skate wing with a sherry vinegar sauce and savoy cabbage and turbot in cider vinegar sauce. Both use plenty of good vinegar, have a bite to them but are not too acidic. I have borrowed both dishes and cooked them with great success in the restaurant. The sauces are little more than fish stock and mature vinegar reduced down together and finished with plenty of unsalted butter. Why I have not experimented with vinegars in butter sauces before when beurre blanc, beurre rouge and beurre noir are such popular vinegar-based fish sauces, I do not know. You need the best vinegars, preferably long matured; the cider vinegar we have just finished from Trebethrick, just across the Camel estuary, was more than 20 years old. I am now busy making vinegars for long maturation. If anyone has any old vinegars for sale (but not balsamic) please get in touch.</p>

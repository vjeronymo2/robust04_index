			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Leading Article: New tax for councils IT IS difficult to forgive the government for being engaged in a second complete overhaul of local authority finance almost 12 years after coming into power. It is not difficult to understand, however, since it made an appalling mess of the first attempt. The question is whether the second one is any better. The answer is 'yes', but only within the limited terms of reference that the government has set for itself. Bryan Gould, shadow secretary of state for the environment, complains that the government still cannot say 'sorry'. He is a little unfair. There in the consultative document on the new council tax is an apology, albeit a limp one, for the community charge: 'the public', it admits, 'have not been persuaded that the scheme is fair.' There, too, can be found something more startling still, an apology from the Treasury: 'The government', it acknowledges, 'considered the relative shares of local expenditure financed from local and central sources, and concluded that the burden on the local element had become too great.' How much more glasnost can you hope for, Mr Gould? The proposal on local taxation looks like a final plan in consultative clothing. The principal question, therefore, is whether it is a reasonable one, or at least better than either the community charge or the old rates. It looks as though it is. Sensible features Each property is to be allocated to one of seven broad tax bands, with houses and flats being placed in a band, according to how their value relates to the average for all properties in England, Scotland and Wales. Furthermore, 'couples living in properties in the same band anywhere in each country will face the same council tax bill (before any rebates or discounts) if their authorities spend at the standard level'. Both features look sensible. The detail of the proposed tax is subject to two main criticisms: first, that increases in tax bills are not proportionate to increases in the value of the properties; second, that it retains the head tax element, in the form of the 25 per cent personal discount for single adult households. But once one has abandoned the myth that each individual adult must receive an individual bill, for the sake of accountability, the latter element is hardly defensible. If broadly based discounts are to be given, it would be better to relate them to other household characteristics, such as whether or not it contains pensioners or dependent children. Nevertheless, this is not a bad tax, as domestic property taxes go. The fundamental objection is that it does not go far enough. This is to be the only tax local authorities are allowed to set and is to cover a mere 15 per cent of local authority current spending. Given this degree of gearing, the power to cap will be used extensively. Local authorities are to remain the government's poodles. They can bark, but only softly. Attractive concept This point is underlined by the consultative document on the structure of local government. It starts from the assumption that local authorities have little choice about what they are to do. 'The government is committed', it declaims, 'to develop the concept of enabling authorities.' The concept is attractive, but the lack of choice for local communities themselves is not. Equally unattractive must be the planning blight that will now afflict much of local government, as the Local Government Commission wends its weary way through the structure of local government, area by area. These proposals are, as everyone knows, about getting the government out of a hole that it dug for itself. Whether they can do so will become somewhat clearer after next week's local elections. The government is certainly in better shape on the issue than it was. While the poll tax will be around at least until 1993, the levels will be lower and a less unacceptable replacement will be on the way. Perhaps it has even escaped the political problem of its own making. If so, this is not because it deserves to, but because a year is a long time in politics.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Economic Notebook: UK inflation: a snake scotched but not killed A year ago, the idea was radical: now it is commonplace. Pick up any brokers' circular or attend a City investment seminar, and the chances are that a key part of the message will be that the days of high inflation are over. In Britain's case, the drop in inflation was certainly the surprise story of last year. In spite of sterling's steep devaluation after September 1992, headline inflation has fallen to 1.4 per cent - about the level in the early 1960s. The latest figures, for November, put the government's chosen underlying rate of inflation, measured by the retail prices index less mortgage interest payments, at 2.5 per cent, the lowest level for 26 years and exactly in the middle of its 1-4 per cent target range. Other recent price indications have been encouraging. Both the Confederation of British Industry and Income Data Services, an independent pay monitoring body, last week reported further slowing of pay increases in the private sector. The CBI's pay data bank showed manufacturing pay deals averaged only 2.2 per cent in the three months to November. Government figures show average earnings rising at an annual rate of 3 per cent, lower than at any time since a temporary incomes policy in the late 1960s. Although manufacturers' selling prices rose faster last year than in 1992, the post-devaluation rise in the cost of inputs has gone into reverse in recent months, aided by a sharp drop in oil prices. But at the risk of sounding gloomy, it is too soon to declare an end to inflation. The disinflationary forces that built up during the recession and the long period of high interest rates and a strong sterling exchange rate that precipitated it have almost certainly passed their peak. It is as yet unclear whether last year's unexpectedly good price performance has eradicated the UK's long standing inflation mentality. Adjusting after more than 20 years of high inflation is not easy and there are one or two straws in the wind to suggest that inflation is suppressed rather than dead. The indicative rates of return on investments of 6 and 12 per cent per year that are currently quoted by personal pension providers appear ambitious if the government is to be taken seriously when it says it aims to have underlying inflation in the lower part of its target range by the end of this parliament. The tendency for companies to push up their margins aggressively wherever possible has troubled the Bank of England, which sees this as an example of behaviour that is out of tune with permanent low inflation. The increase in margins coupled with higher activity as Britain recovers from recession should be reflected in improved profits this year. It would be characteristic, after a period of extended pay restraint, for the coincidence of improved profits, greater output and employment, and higher personal taxes from April to be reflected in increased pressure for higher pay. It would be equally in character for British managements to bow to such pay pressures. A cautionary tale emerges from the accompanying chart prepared by Ian Harnett of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull in London. This shows how UK inflation, relative to the average of the 24 members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, has fallen to its lowest level since August 1963. This suggests that domestic rather than global factors have been responsible for Britain's good inflation performance last year. But Mr Harnett points out that such a good relative inflation performance in the past has been unsustainable. The UK and OECD inflation rates have typically equalised within a year of the trough, and usually through British inflation rising, rather than world inflation slowing. There are grounds to hope that this pattern will not be repeated. International competition in the traded goods sector is intensifying, thanks partly to the rapid industrialisation and integration into the world economy of former developing countries in east Asia and Latin America. This trend will be enhanced by the recently concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade liberalisation negotiations. There is probably still a considerable amount of slack in the UK economy. Last month, the OECD estimated that the gap between the UK's real and potential gross domestic product last year was 5.5 per cent: the second highest of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. The UK Treasury, according to Professor Alan Budd, the government's chief economic adviser, has come to a broadly similar conclusion. It estimates the output gap at between 3 and 7 per cent. But the wide range cited by Mr Budd at a post-Budget Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee hearing also highlights the statistical uncertainty surrounding the UK economy. If you look at industrial output figures, the picture is one of a painfully slow and faltering recovery. Look instead at the 175,000 drop in unemployment in the first 11 months of last year or the steady rise in retail sales (which preceded the reports of buoyant trade in the shops before and after Christmas) and the picture is brighter. Such uncertainties help explain why Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and the Bank of England have not shared the City's enthusiasm for a rapid lowering of interest rates over the past few months. The inflation figures for the latest two months make it unlikely that the top of the government's target will be breached in the short term and give the authorities more scope to ease monetary policy in the event of a sudden slowdown in the economy. But the government and Bank are targeting inflation two years into the future. Until we have seen how the economy in general, and wages in particular, respond to the higher taxes announced in last year's two Budgets, it will be too early to consign above average inflation in Britain to the history books.</p>

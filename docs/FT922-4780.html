			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Equity Issues: Siemens launches Dollars 1bn offering with warrants SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, yesterday launched a Dollars 1bn bond issue with warrants, one of the largest equity-related bond issues in the Euromarkets. The German group is one of three borrowers - the others are Japan Associated Finance and Investor of Sweden - to issue equity-linked bonds this week, leading to speculation that other companies may start to use these instruments again in the near future. Convertible bonds fell out of favour a few months ago after investors had their fingers burned in some of the less accessible markets. A number of South Korean, Indonesian and Taiwanese companies launched convertible issues at a time when foreign investors had only limited access to the underlying equity markets. However, investors were disappointed when the underlying stock markets subsequently fell, which meant that there was no point in taking up their conversion rights. The Siemens 10-year bonds-with-warrants issue, which has an 8 per cent coupon, was launched at a price of 132 yesterday and dropped back to 131.00-131.50 by late afternoon. The bond portion was priced to yield 50 basis points over the US Treasury bond, but the yield spread narrowed to 42 basis points during the day. The warrants alone, which were priced at 173, fell to 164-166, while the stripped bonds traded at par-30 to par-35. The warrants give investors the right to buy Siemens shares at a 25 per cent premium over yesterday's market price of DM688.50. There are 15 warrants per bond. Continental European investors bought the bonds with warrants, but dealers said German investors were keener to buy the warrants alone, while UK institutions picked up the stripped bonds. Siemens last launched a bond-with-warrants issue in 1986, but in that case it was a zero-coupon bond, and the warrants are due to mature in mid-June. The money is being raised for general purpose funding. Japan Associated Finance, a venture capital group also known as Jafco, announced a Dollars 200m convertible bond issue yesterday. 'For European investors this kind of instrument provides a play on the (Japanese) over-the-counter market,' said one syndicate official. The convertible bond has a coupon of 4.5 per cent and the conversion price will be fixed at either 2.5 per cent over the six-day average of the daily low trade, or at the highest quotation on June 9, whichever is the higher of the two.</p>

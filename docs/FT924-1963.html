			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zambia prepares for copper privatisation - The government's efforts to revive a vital sector of the economy MR MATHIAS Mpande, Zambia's deputy minister of mines, Mr Ed Shamutete, chief executive of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the state company that runs the copper industry, and Mr Francis Kunda, President of the Mineworkers Union of Zambia, all have one thing in common: in their younger days, they worked together underground at the Nkana mine on the copperbelt. The symbolism of this unusual unity between labour, managers and state is appropriate, Mr Mpande insists, because they all have similar views about what is best for the industry. Certainly, they are united on one important point of departure: the accession to power of the Chiluba government - in November 1991 - has been the catalyst for a major turnaround in fortunes of the industry. From a production and financial nadir in 1991-92, when output of 387,000 tonnes yielded profits of only Dollars 30.5m, ZCCM looks set to recover in 1992-93, achieving production close to 450,000 tonnes and profits in the region of Dollars 200m. If the wheel is turning on the production side, this is no less true in terms of the control of the industry. One of the main issues facing the Chiluba government is whether, when and how to proceed with the privatisation of ZCCM. The chances are good that these questions will be addressed in 1993, with few betting against Anglo American Corporation, South Africa's largest mining house, re-establishing its dominant position on the copperbelt. Copper has long been the jewel in Zambia's crown. It earns more than 90 per cent of the country's foreign exchange earnings and has been, historically, a very important contributor to the state's tax revenues. In 1991 the corporation's production placed Zambia fourth among market-economies in terms of mined copper production and sixth as a producer of refined copper. By the end of the 1980s, however, 20 years of nationalised control of the industry had taken its toll and copper had become an increasingly tarnished jewel in a very shabby crown. When the Chiluba government took over in November 1991, installing new management at ZCCM, the corporation was in serious financial trouble. Debts to overseas suppliers had reached the point where those companies stopped selling to ZCCM. Production problems - the 1992 annual report is awash with references to 'plant breakdowns', 'equipment outages' and shortages of spares and supplies  -were the direct outcome of financial difficulties. These, in turn, resulted from the government's increasing failure, over a number of years, to invest in the core activity of metals production. From the time of nationalisation in 1970, with the government also taking over management control in 1974, the copper industry was increasingly saddled with extraneous government investments in areas such as tourism, buses, jewellery and dry-cleaning. These businesses were a drain on resources and management time. To make matters worse Zambia's deteriorating financial position through the 1980s caused disbursements of foreign exchange to ZCCM to become ever more erratic as the government succumbed to pressure to divert resources to other areas of the economy. Mr Shamutete notes that whereas the company should have been reinvesting at the rate of about 25 cents per lb of copper produced, it was only achieving a rate of about 16-18 cents per lb. The past year has seen a considerable improvement in the fortunes of ZCCM. Good luck has played a part. The relatively high price of copper, a spike in the cobalt price following unrest in Zaire (the two countries together dominate the world market) and problems at the South African producer Palabora have all been extraneous events from which ZCCM has benefited. The main reasons for the turnround, however, lie with the new government, which realised that the national interest was best served by a flourishing ZCCM and set about creating a conducive environment. Indeed, Mr Mpande sees his main task as minister being the restoration of ZCCM to profitability through privatisation. Apart from offering critical political support, the government has provided consistent and adequate foreign exchange allocations, which have allowed ZCCM to minimise unnecessary equipment failures. It has also given the corporation the mandate to return to its core businesses - the peripheral activities will, in time, be privatised or closed - and has upheld its commitment not to interfere in the running of the business. The benefits of these changes are beginning to filter through. With increased production and a trimming of the labour force - the full complement will have been cut by 10,000 to 46,000 by June 1993 - unit costs have improved dramatically. The cost at mine (before debt servicing, tax, depreciation and capital expenditure) in the first seven months of 1992-93 averaged 60.3 US cents a lb, down from 73.5 cents in 1991-92. Although the corporation is now on a more even keel problems remain to be faced in the future. While Mr Shamutete says the company has the financial means to meet normal investment needs for the next five years the question of what happens after that is a pressing one. Production at the Nchanga Open Pit, the largest producer in the group, will start to tail off in seven to eight years' time. If the corporation is to ensure that its production stays in the 450,000 to 500,000-tonnes-a-year range into the next century a decision on a replacement source of tonnage is urgent - possibly within the next six months. The source of this tonnage is no secret - the Konkola deep project, in the north of the copperbelt, with reserves of about 355m tonnes and a mill head-grade of 3.5 to 3.6 per cent copper. A feasibility study has suggested that within six years the mine, which will cost about Dollars 550m, could be producing at full capacity of 6m tonnes of ore a year. Mr Shamutete is confident that a decision to go ahead with the project can be reached soon. A separate but related issue concerns the privatisation of ZCCM. Although there are misgivings in certain quarters about selling off the family jewels, the balance of opinion clearly favours privatisation. The government knows that failure to privatise ZCCM would shatter its hard-won economic credibility. Prospects for further multilateral and bilateral aid would probably also be damaged. The shape privatisation will take, however, is unresolved, and this is clearly relevant to the development of Konkola. The World Bank will be undertaking a study of ZCCM during the first quarter of 1993 from which an action plan for privatisation will emerge. The main issue to be resolved is whether the corporation will be sold off as one unit or broken up into smaller operations (there are six operating divisions). Mr Mpande says he favours breaking the company up as this will foster competition from which Zambia should benefit. He also says that he takes it for granted that Anglo American will return to the position where it has management control over a significant portion of the industry.</p>

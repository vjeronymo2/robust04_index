			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMIGRES ON THE GLASNOST EXPRESS  </P> <P> The photograph of Mikhail S. Gorbachev that friends gave Elena and Vadim  Chernobilsky when they left the Soviet Union last year evokes two vastly  different responses when they show it around the kitchen table in the Anaheim  apartment they now share with four other relatives.  </P> <P> On one hand, they express gratitude for the Soviet president and his policy of  glasnost, which has opened the gates for thousands of Soviet Jews such as they  to leave. But on the other, they are reminded of the stifling political system  and what they describe as an increasingly dangerous surge in anti-Semitism in  the country they left behind.  </P> <P> But as the sounds of laughter arise in the spring twilight from the pool  outside, their smiles become irrepressible. "I believe in this country is all  good things. I'm happy that now I'm over here," said Vadim, 30.  </P> <P> "The same. Me," said his mother-in-law, Inna Yurkovetsky, 53, with a grin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 100 Expected This Year  </P> <P> They are among 100 Soviet Jews expected to resettle in Orange County this year,  according to Jewish Family Service, an affiliate agency of the Jewish  Federation that has aided 35 Soviets so far. Last year, none of the 70 refugees  the agency aided was from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Under the current relaxed emigration policies, Jews are now leaving the Soviet  Union at the rate of 5,000 a month, according to the Council of Jewish  Federations in Washington. According to the National Conference on Soviet  Jewry, as many as 40,000 Jews may leave the Soviet Union this year, contrasted  with the 18,965 who left in 1988, the 8,155 who left in 1987 and the record  51,320 in 1979.  </P> <P> In Orange County, Jewish leaders are raising funds and seeking volunteers, not  only to help resettle the immigrants, but also to help other Soviet Jews leave  soon.  </P> <P> Many, including Vadim Chernobilsky, see the glasnost reforms as superficial and  undependable. "Gorbachev spoke a lot of words about glasnost. They were just  words," Vadim said. "The system breaks everyone who goes against it. Even a  president."  </P> <P> "We have concerns about the ulterior motives behind glasnost," said Chelle  Friedman, community relations director for the Jewish Federation. "What happens  if Gorbachev changes his mind? Or if he gets into real trouble and glasnost  suddenly ends? It could be tomorrow. That means every single person holding  permission (to leave) gets cancelled."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Passage to Freedom Campaign  </P> <P> The federation aims to raise $175,000 -- part of a $75-million national Passage  to Freedom campaign -- to help an estimated 100,000 Jews who want to leave to  do so and to resettle as quickly as possible in either the United States or  Israel.  </P> <P> "Most of us remember what the Holocaust was like," said Selma Rosen, a  co-chair, with her husband Samuel, of the Orange County Task Force on Soviet  Jewry, a volunteer assistance organization that includes most leaders in the  local Jewish community. "Most of us were not in a position to help (Jews in  trouble during the Nazi regime). We say, 'Never again,' and here is an  opportunity to help Jews who are living through terrible persecution get out.  We failed once. We won't fail again."  </P> <P> Glasnost has meant that many Soviet Jews could obtain exit visas, that  rabbinical schools and synagogues in the Soviet Union have opened, and,  ironically, that anti-Semitism has been encouraged, Jewish leaders said. They  put the blame for much of the anti-Semitism on Pamyat, a nationalist  organization founded in 1980 that has grown to embrace the idea that there is  an international Jewish conspiracy set to attack the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "The freedom has brought all the problems a free society brings -- like the  freedom to hate," said Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who  returned last week )from a tour of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Wieder met with the family of her granddaughter's pen pal, Victoria Kats, a  13-year-old in Kiev who is partly paralyzed because of a brain tumor. The two  girls were brought together in a Jewish "twinning" program that provides  religious rites by proxy for boys and girls unable to have bar or bat mitzvahs  in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Citizenship Lost  </P> <P> The family members lost their Soviet citizenship when they applied for  passports 5 years ago. But under glasnost, they will be able to leave for the  United States in July.  </P> <P> The mother, a computer scientist, asked Wieder whether it would be degrading  for her to work as a hairdresser and whether there would be sufficient health  care for her ailing mother, who is 63.  </P> <P> The meeting in the family's one-bedroom apartment had a strong emotional impact  on her, said Wieder, who is a member of Temple Beth David in Westminster.  "Here, you see a family," she said, but "they're not your average, normal,  healthy family. They're not in control of their own destiny. You wonder where  they'll end up."  </P> <P> Wieder said she is exploring ways to help the family when they arrive, and she  has asked them to keep in touch during their journey.  </P> <P> Soviet immigrants now hit a snag at a  </P> <P> refugee station in Italy, where, according to INS figures, 37% are now being  denied refugee status by the United States.  </P> <P> "Merely being a Jew in the Soviet Union does not presumptively meet the refugee  standard," said Duke Austin, a spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and  Naturalization Service in Washington. "We must review each and every applicant  to see whether they were persecuted as a Jew or not." The reviews began last  October, after the increasing numbers of exiting Soviets put a strain U.S.  resources, he said. Those who are rejected may continue on to Israel, he said,  or they may enter the United States under a different status.  </P> <P> The Chernobilskys and their daughter, and Elena's parents and Elena's younger  sister were granted refugee status quickly because the family could prove that  they had been subject to religious persecution: The KGB in 1985 had searched  their home for Jewish literature, and the family had kept a copy of the report.  In December, they settled in Anaheim, where a family friend, Naum Kreymer of  Odessa, had been living for several years.  </P> <P> Having been trained under foreign work standards, the Chernobilskys face the  problems typical for most Jewish Soviet refugees trying to adjust to life in  the United States.  </P> <P> Elena, a former schoolteacher, has found work as a receptionist despite the  fact that her English is limited. She is studying for a business degree at a  vocational college.  </P> <P> Vadim, a former engineer, is working as a toolmaker in Los Angeles. He hopes  for promotion.  </P> <P> Inna Yurkovetsky, a former psychiatrist, and her husband, Yefim Abinya, 59, a  former engineer, are receiving public assistance while they look for jobs or a  retraining program. Their daughter, Irina, 14, attends public school as does  Yana, the Chernobilskys' 6-year-old daughter.  </P> <P> In addition to seeking employers and job training for refugees, Jewish leaders  are working to reacquaint the Soviets with their religious traditions.  </P> <P> Last month during Passover, Jewish Family Service held a seder, or ritual meal,  for the refugees. The Chernobilskys and Elena's parents said it was the first  seder they had attended.  </P> <P> Orthodox leaders of the Chabad Centers offer free tuition for any immigrant  Jewish child in their Hebrew or day schools.  </P> <P> But the Chernobilskys, who were reared as atheists -- Elena taught atheism in  Soviet schools -- are not interested.  </P> <P> "They change our brains. It's too strange for us," Vadim explained.  </P> <P> "When you're away from Judaism that long, it's hard," Selma Rosen said. "We who  are fighting for these rights feel it will come. The Russian Jews who came out  in 1900s were socialistic and atheist, but their grandchildren are in  synagogue.  </P> <P> "Our eye is to the future," Rosen said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Chrysler Reinstates Merit Pay: The company said raises have been resumed after  being frozen last October.  </P> <P> About 27,000 salaried employees are eligible for the pay increases, based on  performance evaluations. The program was suspended as part of a cost-cutting  plan designed to trim $1.5 billion from the auto maker's $26-billion annual  budget by year-end. The reinstatement didn't sit well with the United Auto  Workers union. The Detroit News quoted an unidentified UAW official as saying:  "Chrysler's crying they ain't got any money. Where's all that money coming  from, for raises for their salaried people?"  </P></p>

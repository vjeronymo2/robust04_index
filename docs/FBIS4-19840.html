			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Finlay Marshall, PRESS ASSOCIATION news correspondent] </F>   [Text] The threat to Bosnian Serb forces from NATO  warplanes could extend to strikes on roads, bridge and power  stations in all areas controlled by them.    Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Armitage, former commandant of  the Royal College for Defence Studies who was also head of  Defence Intelligence, said NATO had three options:     -  They  could continue combat air support attacks in support of United  Nations troops on the ground    -  Within the three kilometre  withdrawal zone ordered by Manfred Woerner, Secretary General of  NATO, aircraft could attack ammunition dumps, local headquarters  and tank emplacements    -  Under the UN Resolution 834, the war could  be extended beyond the Gorazde area to include power stations,  bridges and roads, destroying the country's infrastructure.    Sir Michael said: ``We must have gathered sufficient  intelligence by now to know where their supply dumps are and  they could be clobbered within a three kilometre area. Under  the first option it is very difficult for air attacks to succeed  where UN troops may have been ambushed. You can't do it.    ``The third thing we could do is extend the war into Serbia.  We could bring down bridges and put out the lights in Belgrade,  destroy rail links and roads. You would have to warn them in  advance that is what we were going to do but it would be pretty  serious and make their eyes water.    ``The situation there is very dirty indeed. Some of the  Serbian commanders may be out of control fighting a war of their  own and they are making us look silly. The Serbian leadership  is playing games with us. Air power alone will not succeed  there.''    Sir Michael said he had met the British UN commander, Lt  General Sir Michael Rose, and admired him as a soldier who  needed to be backed by his commanders and given the extra troops  he required to hold safe havens.    He said: "If General Rose says he needs 8,000 troops he  should be given them. But on no account should the United  Nations contemplate major operations out there. We are being  made fools of by the Serbians every day. I have lost count of  the number of ceasefires there have been. Even the Russians  have given up on them."</p>

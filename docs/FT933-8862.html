			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Talks on Sizewell application THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced the start of an eight-week consultation on Nuclear Electric's application for authorisation, under the Radioactive Substances Act 1960, for radioactive discharges from Sizewell B power station, Suffolk. The Department of the Environment said yesterday that nuclear power plants inevitably made some discharges, but in the UK they must be regulated under the 1960 act. Nuclear Electric has completed construction of a pressurised water nuclear power station at Sizewell B. It is aiming to raise power early next year. The consultation starts tomorrow.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> SHOPTALK;  </P> <P> BOOKS TO TRAVEL BY  </P> <P> THESE DAYS, Adrian Kalvinskas isn't traveling much, but he's learning a lot  about the world. As owner of Distant Lands -- A Traveler's Bookstore,  Kalvinskas gets a lot of off-the-wall questions about a lot of off-the-wall  places.  </P> <P> "It's a real education," he says.  </P> <P> The small, comfortable shop invites intense browsing. In addition to maps,  4,500 travel titles and a wide selection of travel videos, Kalvinskas stocks an  extensive armchair-travel section. "It's less dry to take an armchair adventure  than to read a guidebook," he believes. "Travel literature gives a better idea  of people and place."  </P> <P> Kalvinskas grew up in the Pasadena area and, after following his own  wanderlust, decided to become involved in the evolution of Old Pasadena. "It's  a lot of fun," he says of running such a bookstore. "Ninety-nine percent of the  time people come in happy because they're excited about traveling."  </P> <P> Distant Lands -- A Traveler's Bookstore, 62 S. Raymond Ave., Old Pasadena;  (818) 449-3220.

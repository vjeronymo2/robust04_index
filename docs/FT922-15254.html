That compared with Pounds 1.04m for the corresponding period and Pounds 2.31m for the previous full year. The market for electrical, electronic cable and lighting became more competitive in the prolonged recession in the UK. The consumer electrical and electronic division was sold from November 1 and has stood extraordinary charges of Pounds 811,000 for losses and closure costs. Earnings per share were 0.01p (0.98p). Proposals will be made to reconstruct the capital which should lead to a resumption of dividends out of future profits.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BERLINER BRINGS A SPECIAL PERSPECTIVE TO 'FIDELIO';  </P> <P> GOTZ FRIEDRICH, DIRECTING THE MUSIC CENTER SEASON OPENER, IS A MAN WHO KNOWS OF  TYRANNY FIRSTHAND  </P> <P> Huddling around a table with cast members of "Fidelio," Gotz Friedrich seems  calm now, even philosophical. But earlier in rehearsal the eminent German  director had been scolded by his wife, soprano Karan Armstrong "for crying," he  says, "for getting too emotional" during the ultimately moving Prisoners'  Chorus.  </P> <P> Beethoven's only opera -- opening the Music Center Opera season on Tuesday --  does that to people, and not least to a man who knows personally about its  subject: the loss of human rights, "the terrible process that all Germans of my  generation have gone through."  </P> <P> Indeed, Friedrich was a boy when the Third Reich came to power and turned his  country into a police state. By age 14, he knew the implied horrors and more,  thanks to a father "who was close to the men responsible for trying to kill  Hitler on July 20, 1944."  </P> <P> "And where I lived (Naumburg) came at first the liberating Americans, only to  be followed by the Red Army. Political oppression was then all around me.  Living in East Germany until 40 years old I knew little else."  </P> <P> But Beethoven, he says, sounded the call to freedom more than a century earlier  -- when Napoleon's armies crossed into Austria and occupied Salzburg. Rallying  against that travesty, the prescient composer tapped into what Germans have  experienced in the last half century: living as a divided people.  </P> <P> It was 1973 when Friedrich defected from East Berlin's Komische Oper. Since  1981, he has been director of the Deutsche Oper in West Berlin. Now, with the  end of the Cold War and the crumbling of the wall, he finally is unified with  the city of his artistic origins.  </P> <P> So how will the innovative director who sees opera as a theatrically serious  and socially relevant subject stage his "Fidelio"? Will it depict East Berlin  with Checkpoint Charlie still a decisive border? Or maybe he will look to  something equally topical -- the United States in Panama or the Iraqi invasion  of Kuwait. Just last year, San Diego Opera placed "Fidelio" in a  banana-republic context.  </P> <P> "Nothing of the sort," says Friedrich in a mellifluous Maurice Chevalier basso  with a pronounced accent. "I know that seems strange, especially when you  consider what is usual among German directors who like to set 'Fidelio' as a  Nazi death camp or a gulag in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "In my mind, you should keep old operas in their time while doing everything to  show that the same oppression could happen right here, right now. Each person  in the audience must have his own inside picture of what that oppression is.  </P> <P> "An old story can be good and a brand-new story likewise, but opera is most  thrilling when it has both the old and new story. Combining the two of them  shows the humanistic message in all its permanence."  </P> <P> It's not that Friedrich minimizes the milestone of German reunification. He  says that he is profoundly touched, especially because what occurred last year  "was a weightless and nonviolent revolution."  </P> <P> "I am amazed that not one person was killed. This is new in world history. But  the danger would be to show the ("Fidelio") prisoners as victims of the Stasi  (the East German intelligence service). The fundamental message carries better  without social realism because everyone knows the appellation of freedom. It  covers all situations -- in camps and prisons everywhere."  </P> <P> The director -- who brought to the Music Center Opera its inaugural "Otello,"  earlier oversaw his evocatively surreal "Die Tote Stadt" and in 1988 a stylized  "Kat'a Kabanova" -- now asks for the freedom of abstraction.  </P> <P> He points to the character Leonore, who searches for, finds and liberates her  captive husband.  </P> <P> "She knows nothing about politics," he explains. "Why should she have a  political identity? Her courage defines her. It's such a strong, human story --  I don't need to place it in a specific location or even to teach the audience  history lessons. Let them respond to the tale, which is a fairy tale, in a way,  a dream/nightmare as it was in 1945, when the Nazi death camps opened."  </P> <P> Even the sets, which will borrow only "a few concrete symbols," are not tied to  an actual time or place. "I want to provoke a feeling of claustrophobia, to  show everyone in its grip and how the imprisonment of one person implicates all  the others."  </P> <P> The lunch break is over and Friedrich calls his cast back to rehearsal, the Act  I finale. Now he gets the chance to illuminate his brand of theatrical truth --  through characterization. A hands-on director, he searches out the motives for  each actor's utterances.  </P> <P> The scene begins with Jonathan Mack (Jacquino) remonstrating his impatience  with Marzelline. She doesn't want to marry him, preferring that nice Fidelio  (who is really Leonore disguised as a man).  </P> <P> The ruddy-complexioned, rather paunchy director sits back and watches, fumbling  for a cigarette. He lets the episode finish, then slowly gets up, shuffles onto  the playing area and stands next to Mack. Lapsing into English -- the main  rehearsal business is all in German -- he declaims Jacquino's line:  </P> <P> "Even if she doesn't love me, at least let her marry me," he hollers, banging  his fists on his thighs and gasping in exasperation. He pads back to his seat  and observes Mack's improved repeat. "Ja, wohl," says the director.  </P> <P> But when Michael Devlin fails to appear on cue, Friedrich calls out to the  singer, who is standing behind the bleachers: "You will not be issued a special  invitation to be on stage for your sung parts."  </P> <P> The tone of gentle sarcasm is mock-gruff. Friedrich is not really-high strung  or temperamental. Later, he shows Devlin, as the villain Pizarro, how to inject  vitality into a small exchange between himself and Rocco (Matti Salminen). A  cross-examining Pizarro, suspicious of Rocco's possible sympathy for the  prisoner, listens to the lowly jailer absolve himself.  </P> <P> As Pizarro, Friedrich moves up brazenly close to Rocco and gazes right into his  face. Then he turns away and speaks aloud his observations of Rocco: "Oh, he's  smarter than I thought. This is no little dog. He's at least a buffalo." A new  dimension has been added.  </P> <P> By the time Karen Beardsley (Marzelline) arrives, the action is considerably  more intense. The director makes her translate her lines because he feels they  sound too much like generalized bluster to mean anything. Afterwards she goes  back to the German and he issues an appraisal:  </P> <P> "It is better, but not good. I almost understand one word," he laughs. "But  that's progress, my love."  </P> <P> Sometimes a director's concept fails to make itself known to audiences and  critics. But if Friedrich has his way, unification will come about as surely  for "Fidelio" as it has for Germany.  </P> <P> The two-act opera, commonly regarded as problematic, sits uncomfortably between  the category of rustic little household conflict and paean to soaring idealism,  replete with highly charged, transcendent music.  </P> <P> "However, I don't think of 'Fidelio' as a Singspiel (light opera) that  progresses to a drama," he says earnestly, while fumbling again for a  cigarette. "What seems so trifling in the first scene is only a cover for  terror, which I show by using a shortened form of the dialogue, with pauses  between lines.  </P> <P> "All of the characters -- Marzelline, her father Rocco and his assistant  Jacquino -- know at some level that they are prisoners too.  </P> <P> "I even have my doubts that Florestan (the principal prisoner) is saved at the  end. As for Leonore, she wants to rescue everyone -- not just her husband."  </P> <P> Friedrich, who learned his craft under the legendary Walter Felsenstein at the  Komische Oper, says he had to save himself some 20 years ago from an oppressive  regime.  </P> <P> "In order to gain just the ordinary human rights that the West takes for  granted, I had to rebel. Like Don Quixote, I could not exist with the terrible  border that had been imposed."  </P> <P> At the time, he gave interviews citing "artistic freedom" as his reason for  defecting. "But that was inaccurate," he says now. "My real goal was to gain  political freedom. I couldn't admit that then, however, without risking the  penalty of criticizing the system. The DDR (East German Republic) would have  chased me for uttering such bad words."  </P> <P> When he returns home, Friedrich will face an entirely different dilemma: a  newly unified Berlin that must administer three opera companies -- his own  Deutsche Oper, the State Opera and the Komische Oper. With the economy already  in an upheaval because of the East-West disparity between jobs and technology,  the arts are equally up for grabs.  </P> <P> "The decisions will be momentous," he says. "Does Berlin need three opera  companies and 20 theaters and separate houses for operetta? Which of these  belong to the central government, which to the state of Berlin and which to the  city of Berlin? It's so complicated I don't want to even think about it."  </P> <P> Judgments must be made, he says, and they involve ranking of the different  companies as well as allocating monies based on the ranking.  </P> <P> "I do not hear any of this with pleasure," Friedrich admits. "But I'll have to  get into the fray just to fight such categorization. All these years we were  liberal in the best tradition of free art. What irony that with the great  opening of our world the arts are in jeopardy."  </P></p>

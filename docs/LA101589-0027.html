			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SEX' AND ART  </P> <P> Cudos to Dan O'Neill's labeling of the movie "sex, lies and videotape" as the  pretentious mediocrity that it is (Letters, Oct. 8).  </P> <P> There is a tendency for film critics to laud any so-called "art film" so long  as it is ponderous, slow-paced and photographed to look as though it were a  half-finished student film.  </P> <P> "Sex, lies and videotape" fills all of these criteria. Also, all of the letters  in its title are lower case. It must be art.  </P> <P> CHESTER BENTON  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

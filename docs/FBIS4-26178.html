			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Bi Quanzhong (3968 0356 1813) and </F> XINHUA reporter Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376)]    [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- The national work  conference on the inspection of the two basic tasks opened  today. Participants in the meeting are expected to make  arrangements for implementing the guidelines set out at the  national education work conference and for further strengthening  the education inspection work.    The two basic tasks are basically popularizing nine-year  compulsory education and basically eliminating illiteracy among  the younger generation and people in the prime of their lives by  the end of this century.    Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and State Council vice premier, met with 58 state  education inspectors prior to the meeting. He said that the  national education work conference had set out the tasks of  accelerating the pace of education reform and development, had  decided on the major goals of various types of education, and  had clearly set out the tasks of basically popularizing  nine-year compulsory education and of basically eliminating  illiteracy among the youth and middle-aged people by the end of  this century. The basic popularization of the nine-year  compulsory education and the basic elimination of illiteracy are  fundamentally in accord with the demands for raising the overall  quality of the Chinese people and are the most important tasks  for developing China's education for a certain period in the  future. The key to meeting the demands is to forcefully  implement the guidelines set out at the national education work  conference. The current education inspection work conference is  the first of such practical moves to implement the guidelines  set out at the national education work conference. He pointed  out that education inspection work is the forceful guarantee to  realize the goals of the "two basic tasks." Therefore, all  levels of party committees and governments must attach great  importance to and enhance this work. Realizing the goals of the  "two basic tasks" is the responsibility of the government. All  levels of governments should strive to fulfill this task during  their terms. Work on fulfilling the two basic tasks should be  made the chief criterion for evaluating administrative and  personal performance. Li Lanqing expressed the hope that all  levels of education inspectors would work hard, give full play  to the role of education inspectors, and contribute to the  revitalization of China's education.    China has set up a complete education inspection system and  has established the State Education Commission Inspection Group  and provincial, prefectural (city), and county-level education  inspection organs since the restoration of the education  inspection system in 1986. The inspectors supervise the  enforcement of the Education Law. They carry out supervision  and inspections, and they provide evaluations of and guidance to  subordinate governments' education work, education  administrative departments, and schools' work. The scope of the  education inspection work at the present stage mainly involves  the inspection of secondary school education and below, as well  as the supervision of other relevant work. They mainly  concentrate their work on compulsory equation and on the  elimination of illiteracy.</p>

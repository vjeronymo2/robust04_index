			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Kenya to merge exchange rates KENYA is to rationalise its dual exchange rate system today by floating the official rate of the shilling to the level of the free market rate, Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi said yesterday. The measure will lead to a small devaluation of the official shilling, which is used in central government purchases and debt-service payments. At the start of business yesterday the official exchange rate was 67.6 shillings to the dollar and the inter-bank commercial rate was 68.85 shillings - a gap of less than 2 per cent. Import bills and most private sector transactions are settled at the inter-bank rate. International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials, currently reviewing Kenya's economic progress in Nairobi, had recommended the merger as a step towards the abolition of currency controls. Mr Mudavadi said the flotation would encourage exporters, who must remit half of their foreign earnings to the central bank, which reimburses them in local currency at the official rate of exchange. The flotation is the latest of several liberalisation measures which have included three devaluations since December.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Bundesbank surprises THE BUNDESBANK loves surprises. Virtually nobody expected yesterday's cuts of half a percentage point in the discount and Lombard rates, to 5.75 and 6.25 per cent, respectively. But most will welcome them, not merely in countries whose currencies are shadowing the D-Mark or, like the Dutch guilder, closely tied to it, but further afield. Mr Kenneth Clarke can now lower UK interest rates with greater equanimity. The easing of German monetary policy since the summer of 1992 has been substantial: the discount rate has fallen by 3 percentage points, 2 1/2 percentage points in 1993 alone. These latest reductions, which will presumably be followed by money market rates, also mean that the Bundesbank is no longer just following the long-term rate of interest down: the redemption yield on a 10-year government bond is at the low level, by historical standards, of just under 6 per cent, but the discount rate is below the bond rate, for the first time since early 1992. Justifying the latest cuts, the Bundesbank's president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, cited the stabilisation in the growth of broad money (M3) at only half a percentage point above the Bundesbank's ceiling of 6 1/2 per cent. He also noted that the rise in the consumer price index has been running at an annualised rate of 2.4 per cent over the latest three months. In addition, the D-Mark has been strengthening since early summer, against other European currencies and also against the US dollar. The Bundesbank is still casting a wary eye on wage settlements and fiscal policy, but further reductions in interest rates are virtually certain. The disinflationary pressure in the German economy is substantial, with gross domestic product and industrial production now 'bumping along the bottom'. Meanwhile, recessionary conditions in Germany's main markets, the contractionary fiscal policy and the structural problems of German industry all mean that there is little, except monetary policy, to facilitate recovery. Short-term rates of interest may have quite a way to go. Since stability remains the Bundesbank's watchword, the cuts will be cautious. But the monetary restraint in its major partners should continue to ease, even if too slowly to restore the old ERM. The Bundesbank's behaviour this year strongly suggests that dissolution of that system was an objective in its own right. The cuts since August could have been justified earlier, if the Bundesbank had wanted to do so. Short-term real rates of interest in the European Community are at least moving towards levels at which recovery is conceivable. Even so, for countries like France they remain disturbingly high. They will continue to do so if these countries keep their currencies as close as possible to the D-Mark. Partly for this reason, recovery in the EC economy is likely to be slow and weak. That will be painful, even politically dangerous. But, with existing policies, it is also inevitable.</p>

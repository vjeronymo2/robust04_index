Another commenter thought designating critical habitat at the present time would interfere with the delta smelt recovery planning process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Designation of critical habitat is prudent at this time because the designation will provide substantive benefits to the delta smelt beyond those already resulting from its status as a threatened species. Critical habitat serves to preserve options for a species' eventual recovery. A critical habitat designation contributes to species conservation primarily by identifying important geographic areas, and by describing the features within the areas that are essential to the species. The designation puts public and private entities on notice that the area is important habitat. Section 7 of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that any action they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat. This section requires parties to consult with the Service to avoid jeopardy and destruction or adverse modification to important habitat areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A designation of critical habitat provides a clearer indication to Federal agencies as to when consultation under section 7 is required, particularly in cases where the action would not result in direct mortality or injury to individuals of the listed species (e.g., an action occurring within the critical area when a migratory species is not present). The critical habitat designation, describing the essential physical or biological features of the habitat, also assists parties in determining which activities conducted outside the designated area are subject to section 7 consultation (i.e., activities that may affect primary constituent elements of the designated area). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designating critical habitat also assists private, State, and Federal agencies in planning future actions, since the designation establishes, in advance, those habitats that will be given special consideration in section 7 consultations and section 10 incidental take activities. With the designation of critical habitat, potential conflicts between projects and endangered or threatened species can be identified and possibly avoided early in the agency's planning process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designating critical habitat will not interfere with recovery planning efforts now in progress. A recovery plan would be prepared for the delta smelt pursuant to the Act whether or not critical habitat was designated for the species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 29:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter thought Club Fed could not restore natural resources to levels existing during times of significantly fewer people under current California law. Another respondent believed the Service may not refer to EPA's water quality standards because the estuarine standards are based on historical conditions, rather than on ``existing conditions'' now occurring in the Estuary. The respondent claims there is a temporal element in the definition of critical habitat, stating that critical habitat is defined in the Act in terms of existing conditions, and the Service must look to specific areas which contain physical and biological features essential to the conservation of the species at the time it is listed. The commenter went on to say that critical habitat may only consist of those areas that currently contain essential physical and biological features. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of critical habitat does not require that all primary constituent elements necessarily be conditions existing at the time critical habitat is designated. Conditions existing historically in the Estuary are required to recover the delta smelt. Conditions now occurring in the Estuary have resulted in the decline of the delta smelt population, because the Estuary currently does not contain all of the physical and biological features (e.g., habitat requirements and salinity) necessary for each of the species' life stages. Critical habitat for the delta smelt identifies areas needed to conserve the species, so it may recover and, ultimately, be delisted. In order to accomplish recovery, it is necessary that critical habitat encompass conditions that are superior to existing conditions, so that all of the physical and biological features necessary for the delta smelt are present in the Estuary. The Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team has identified 1968 as a time when the Estuary had appropriate hydrologic conditions that would allow recovery of the delta smelt. An interagency Statement of Principles (Plenert, Fullerton, and Seraydarian,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992) among the Service, NMFS and EPA have found that the Estuary ecosystem and its anadromous and resident fisheries were relatively healthy during the years between 1960&hyph;1970. The Service recognizes no significant conflict with managing toward historic conditions for all primary constituent elements as a conservation strategy for the delta smelt. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service notes that the 1994 revised proposed critical habitat for the delta smelt contains the physical and biological features essential for the conservation of the delta smelt. Using equations developed by Kimmerer and Monismith (1992) to calculate salinity, DWR (1993) determined that the isohaline was located downstream of the Roe Island historic reference point 124 days, and was between Roe Island and Chipps Island habitat 14 days between February 1 and June 31 in 1993 (DWR 1993). Therefore, conditions for spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing and adult migration was, in fact, available for all life stages as recently as 1993. However, these physical and biological features do not occur frequently enough, and are not protected during critical periods in February through June, especially in drier water years. The mixing zone was pushed out beyond Roe Island during this period because 1993 was a wet year. Water quality criteria are necessary to ensure habitat suitable for the delta smelt are available at critical times in all water-year types. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 30:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service did not identify a plan, any directives, or a goal to ensure that delta smelt are protected, or to indicate when the species is recovered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

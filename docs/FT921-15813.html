			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: AT&amp;T and NEC start advanced chip project AT&amp;T of the US and NEC of Japan are strengthening their collaboration in semiconductor technology to develop a high-performance memory chip which does not require continual electronic refreshment. The companies said they intended to work together to design and manufacture fast static random access memory chips (S-RAMs) able to store up to 4m bits of information. The project will involve further co-operation between NEC and AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories. S-RAM chips are used in a wide range of electronic circuitry where they can have power-saving advantages over D-RAMs, the most common kind of electronic memory. The S-RAM chips will be manufactured by NEC and sold by both companies. The agreement is a step towards the establishment of manufacturing technologies for the next generation of semiconductors. AT&amp;T and NEC agreed last April to work on developing technology for advanced chips with memories four times more dense than current methods allow. The agreement is one of several between Japanese and US semiconductor companies aimed at easing trade friction between the two countries. Other examples include an agreement between Hitachi and Texas Instruments. Separately, International Business Machines of the US and Siemens of West Germany are collaborating on advanced memory design.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Parker &amp; Parsley sues bid rival PARKER &amp; Parsley, the US energy group which last week agreed to pay Dollars 448m for Prudential Securities' troubled energy investment partnerships, is suing Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas, a rival US energy company which has submitted a higher bid for the partnerships, for attempting to interfere in the transaction. Graham Royalty, which was a general partner in the lossmaking partnerships with Prudential, is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit. Parker claims Dreyfus 'maliciously interfered' with the merger agreement between Parker and Prudential and that Graham Royalty breached the merger agreement and committed conspiracy and fraud by negotiating with Dreyfus. On Monday, Prudential agreed to sell its partnerships to Parker for Dollars 448m but a few days later, under pressure from investors in the partnerships, it was forced to reveal that a counter-offer worth Dollars 510m had already been made by Dreyfus. At the time, Prudential said it did not accept the higher offer because there was not enough information in the bid. Prudential has since said it would consider the bid once Dreyfus had provided a full financing commitment for its offer, which Dreyfus said it would provide in the next week. The affair is being watched closely by investors in the Prudential energy partnerships. After the partnerships racked up big losses in the late 1980s, the investors sued Prudential for allegedly misleading them over the risks involved in buying into the partnerships.</p>

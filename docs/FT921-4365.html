			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Genscher warns on the rise of nationalism GERMANY must continue working for European unity or risk the re-emergence of nationalism, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, warned yesterday. Leaders of Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) party, meanwhile, yesterday decided not to try to block parliamentary approval of the European Community's Maastricht treaty on economic and monetary union (Emu). Mr Bjorn Engholm, party chairman, said the SPD still wanted improvements, but their implementation would not be tied to the ratification deadline. Even so, the SPD insisted in a statement that transition from the second to the third stage of Emu, planned for 1999 at the latest, could not be automatic. Ratification of the treaty was no 'carte blanche' for the government. The Bundestag, the German parliament, must have a new vote before the final steps were taken and a common European currency adopted. Speaking after a meeting of the SPD executive in Bonn, Mr Engholm attempted to repair the damage done to the party's staunch pro-European posture last week by Mr Oskar Lafontaine, prime minister of Saarland. His proposal that the SPD should use its power to reject the whole Maastricht deal had drawn fire from SPD colleagues and members of the ruling coalition alike. SPD votes would be needed for the government to achieve the two-thirds majority needed for constitutional changes made necessary by the treaty. Mr Genscher, speaking in Berlin yesterday, made political capital out of recent opposition disarray over European policy. 'The 'yes' from Europe to German unity must be followed by a 'yes' to Europe from Germany,' he said. There must not be any doubt that small-minded rejection of progress towards European unity could damage Germany's positive image and lead to new nationalism. Mr Engholm stood by most of the SPD's demands for a thorough re-examination by the Bundestag of the outcome and implications of the Maastricht summit as part of its 'new decision before entry into the third stage'. The parliament had to ensure that necessary economic convergence criteria could be guaranteed, an official statement said. It would need to be assured that progress towards Emu was balanced with similar advances in European political union (Epu). Rights of the European Parliament should also be strengthened, and that the future European central bank should ensure that economic policies should be responsibly co-ordinated.</p>

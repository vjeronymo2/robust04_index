			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Breakthrough made on cause of diabetes Scientists have taken a big step towards understanding the genetic basis of diabetes, which affects 150,000 people in the UK. They have used a rapid-search technique to identify two genes likely to lead to the disease. Mr James Copeman, an author of one of two papers describing the results in the journal Nature today, says the technique means research into diabetes and other complex diseases is going to move very rapidly in the next 10 years. One of the papers, published by a group of 16 scientists from institutions in the UK, identifies new genes predisposing to insulin-dependent diabetes on chromosome 11 and on chromosome 6. Independently, 14 scientists from institutes in France, the UK and the US have also identified the gene on chromosome 11. This independent confirmation of one of the genes is an important validation of the new technique for finding the genes for complex diseases - those that are influenced by more than one gene - which include schizophrenia, heart disease and cancer. Mr Copeman said the UK research group would pursue two lines of work: to study the way the two newly identified genes worked and to search for more genes. So far the group has identified 16 further possible locations in its search of the whole genome - the complete set of human genes. Mr Copeman suspects about 10 of these will turn out to be important for diabetes. Checking each possible location takes two months. In insulin-dependent diabetes the patient's immune system destroys the insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas. Insulin is essential for the uptake of glucose into cells. Of the four genes identified so far the most important is IDDM1, which was already identified, and appears to be involved in the development of the immune system. The other three genes, the two new ones and IDDM2, appear to be of roughly equal importance. The research involved comparing the genetic material from pairs of diabetic children in a group of 96 diabetic families. By identifying regions of the genome that are the same in both children, suspect locations can be identified. The research used a set of 'markers' - parts of the genome that are present in everybody - to identify exactly which parts of the genome contained the suspect genes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, president of the  largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and U.S.  Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale agreed Friday [27 May] that  persistent negotiations with North Korea are necessary to deal  with Pyongyang's suspected nuclear arms development, LDP  officials said.    Kono, meeting with Mondale at LDP headquarters in Tokyo,  said  he hopes the issue will be resolved through dialogue involving  China, Japan, South Korea and the United States, the officials  said.    "Our country is within the range of North Korean missiles,  and people of North Korean origin are also living here. We  should not react eccentrically," Kono was quoted as saying of  speculation that Pyongyang would attack Japan at any moment.    Mondale said the basic U.S. stance is to continue talking  with North Korea, maintaining close contact with Japan and  negotiating with South Korea and the United Nations, according  to the officials.    They met for the second time at Mondale's request, following  a meeting last October, they said.</p>

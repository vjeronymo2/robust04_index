			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Russia/Italy: Italian Firm To Aid </F> Russian Packaging Industry"]    [Text] (ANSA) Moscow, May 4 -- The Italian firm Fata has  signed a deal worth 80 million dollars (130 billion lire) to  supply equipment and machinery for production of packaging  materials to a plant in the Russian region of Tyumen, in west  Siberia, company officials today announced.    The plant, to be built on the site of a former petrolium  industry equipment supplier, is expected to have a yearly  production of 16,000 [metric] tons of packaging materials  consisting mainly of aluminum, card and paper sheets.    Russia's lack of packaging materials is considered one of  the  main reasons for the huge losses incurred by its agricultural  sector, a situation only partially eased by the country's  purchase in 1992-1993 of materials worth 190 million dollars.</p>

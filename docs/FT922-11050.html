			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (14): Happy returns on first birthday - Stock Exchange WARSAW'S stock exchange, which celebrated its first birthday this month, remains small, albeit perfectly formed. It is based on the French order driven system with shares rising and falling within a 10 per cent band at any one session. It is computerised and its modern book entry system is designed to protect investors. Pioneer International Corp from the US, the first foreign investment fund to get a licence to operate in Poland, say that this was an important factor which prompted them to get involved. The exchange and the brokers are policed by the Polish Securities Commission, which is a full member of the International Organisation of Securities Regulators and has adopted a US regulatory model. The commission, headed by Mr Leslaw Paga, demands the highest standards in company prospectuses and has already suspended several stockbrokers found guilty of contravening trading rules. For the moment the exchange trades in 12 stocks including breweries, clothes and electronics manufacturers. Another 10 are expected to join the list this year with the first bank, the Export Development Bank (BRE) among them. Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, chairman of the stock exchange, is disappointed at the slow pace of privatisation but the few stocks traded have a high turnover ratio with 30 to 40 per cent of the stock of most companies changing hands over the year. This means that quite a lot of money has been made and lost in the exchange on the fifth floor of what was once the Communist party headquarters in downtown Warsaw. The past 12 months have seen 3.5m shares worth 700bn zlotys traded first at weekly sessions and lately twice a week. The 12 quoted shares are capitalised at about Dollars 150m and are relatively cheap with a lowly p/e ratio of 3 compared, say, to the Budapest exchange where the ratio is 7. Investors are mostly small savers. Around 100,000 Poles have bought shares and half of those opened accounts with the 26 stockbroking offices mostly run by banks which enable them to buy and sell at will.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANAGING YOUR MONEY;  </P> <P> THE RIGHT PATH;  </P> <P> CONTEMPLATING THE GOOD LIFE;  </P> <P> PLANNING FOR YOUR LEISURE YEARS CAN GENERATE MANY PERPLEXING QUESTIONS.  </P> <P> Perhaps one of the biggest myths in our society is that your retirement years  are easy. Sure, quitting your job may not require much effort, but the rest of  it -- such as knowing how to manage and invest savings wisely and how to  negotiate the maze of Social Security regulations -- is hard. Doubts and  uncertainity persist. And answers are hard to come by.  </P> <P> Here are five retirement questions most often raised by readers of "Money  Talk," a question-and-answer column regularly appearing in the Sunday edition  of The Times' Business section.  </P> <P> Q. I will be retiring in a few months and have opted to take a lump sum pension  payment of about $200,000. What steps can be taken to shelter this distribution  from immediate taxation? This is a sizable portion of what I will be depending  on for income during my retirement. -- R.T.  </P> <P> A. Basically, you have two alternatives. You may put your entire pension  distribution into a tax-deferred individual retirement account or you may pay  taxes on it now and probably take advantage of a special income averaging  benefit available to many in this age bracket.  </P> <P> Which is the better choice? Torrance financial planner Thomas Gau believes that  you would be far better off rolling the pension account into an IRA. But let's  walk through the situation and explain why.  </P> <P> If you turned age 50 before Jan. 1, 1986, you are eligible to take advantage of  a special 10-year income averaging, a tax benefit that essentially treats the  $200,000 lump sum distribution as though it had been received over 10 years.  Gau estimates that even using this tax break, you would be liable for about  $50,000 in state and federal taxes for the year, leaving you with about  $150,000 to invest for retirement. Remember too that earnings from this  investment are still taxable; it is just the principal on which the tax has  been paid.  </P> <P> Gau argues that if you rolled his pension distribution into an IRA and invested  it wisely, you could withdraw whatever you needed from the account and pay  taxes only on that amount. Gau notes that many retirees are in a low tax  bracket, which means that less of their pension distribution goes to taxes.  </P> <P> As a rule of thumb, Gau says that pension distributions in excess of $100,000  should not be subjected to the special 10-year income averaging, but rather  should be rolled into IRAs. "Unless you need the money right away for some  reason, the 10-year averaging doesn't make sense for distributions over  $100,000," he says. "Why pay the taxes right away when you can defer it and  probably pay less."  </P> <P> Q. If a woman has been married more than 10 years to two different husbands,  does she have a choice of which man's benefits to claim for ex-spouse Social  Security payments? If she were married to the second husband for less than 10  years, may she still claim benefits from the first marriage if it lasted more  than 10 years? What are the payment levels: Are her benefits based on a  percentage of the taxes paid during the marriage, or are the benefits based on  the total amount of taxes paid by the former spouse into Social Security? --  A.R.  </P> <P> A. A divorced person who was married at least 10 years to the same spouse is  entitled to claim Social Security benefits on the ex-spouse's account. This  applies equally to men and women, although most ex-spouses claiming the benefit  have been women.  </P> <P> If the ex-spouse is alive, the claimant must be at least 62. At 62, the  ex-spouse is entitled to 37.5% of the wage earner's benefits. If the ex-spouse  waits until 65 to claim benefits, the payment is 50% of the wage earner's  benefits. The wage earner need not be receiving benefits in order for the  ex-spouse to claim his or hers -- so long as the couple has been divorced at  least two years. (This last point varies substantially from the qualification  criteria for married couples, which do require that the primary wage earner be  receiving benefits in order for the spouse to receive spousal benefits.)  </P> <P> If the wage earner is dead, the ex-spouse is considered equivalent to a widow  or widower. He or she may claim benefits at 60, and, at this age, is entitled  to receive 71.5% of what the wage earner would have received. The percentage  increases until reaching the full 100% if the ex-spouse is age 65 when benefits  begin.  </P> <P> By the way, the ex-spouse and the current spouse are both treated as the widow  or widower, and both receive a full 100% of the wage earner's benefits; they do  not split the benefit.  </P> <P> Ex-spouse benefits are based on the total contributions made by the wage earner  during his or her working career, not just those made throughout the duration  of the marriage. People who have been married more than once, for longer than  10 years, may claim benefits against the ex-spouse with the largest Social  Security account. And a divorced person who was remarried for less than 10  years may claim benefits on the account of the first spouse. However, as long  as a person remains remarried, he or she may not claim benefits on the account  of the ex-spouse.  </P> <P> Finally, one point that bears repeating: Benefits paid to an ex-spouse in no  way reduce the amount available for the primary wage earner and his or her  current family. They are entirely separate payments.  </P> <P> Q. I have recently heard of something called a reverse mortgage. I own my home  free and clear, and I would like to tap into my equity so I can have more money  to enjoy my life. -- N.I.  </P> <P> A. Reverse annuity mortgages were created in the late 1970s to help senior  citizens who have substantial equities in their homes but need additional cash  to meet their living expenses. Basically, these mortgages allow owners to tap  into their equity without selling their homes.  </P> <P> Here's how they work. Typically a lending institution makes the homeowner a  loan for up to 80% of its appraised value. After taking its loan fees and  points up front, the institution then pays the homeowner the balance of the  loan in equal monthly installments, minus accruing interest on the already  dispersed funds, for as long as he continues living in the home. The loan --  actually the amount dispersed plus interest -- is repaid when the house is sold  by the owner or his heirs.  </P> <P> These open-ended loans are complicated because it's impossible to know how long  the homeowner will continue to live in the house. If he stays just a brief  time, the reverse mortgage proves a costly way for the elderly homeowner to  pull equity out of the house, since loan fees and points on the full potential  loan amount is assessed at the outset. However, if he stays a very long time,  the lending institution stands to pay out more than the home may be worth.  Because of this latter issue, several institutions offering reverse mortgages  require that they share in any appreciation of the the borrower's home during  the course of the loan.  </P> <P> According to the American Assn. of Retired Persons, three private lenders  currently offer reverse mortgages to California homeowners. They are: American  Homestead in New Jersey, (800) 233-4762; Providential Home Income Plan in San  Francisco, (800) 441-4428, and Capital Holding Co. in Kentucky, (800) 942-6550.  Each lender offers a slightly different loan package, explains Bronwin Belling,  a housing counselor for the AARP, so it is important for borrowers to carefully  evaluate their choices before making a commitment. For example, Belling  explained that with a $200,000 loan at 10%, monthly payments from the three  lenders previously mentioned would range from $903 to $1,124, with  substantially varying requirements and restrictions.  </P> <P> For more information about reverse mortgages, send a self-addressed, stamped  envelope to the Independent Living Resource Center, 70 Tenth St., San  Francisco, Calif. 94103.

My friend's husband a few years ago died after retiring, and my friend was  shocked to discover that his pension stopped with his death. Now my husband,  who is also retired, is ill and is not recovering. How can I find out whether  his pension ends with his death? Shouldn't there be laws to protect women like  me? -- M.Y.  </P> <P> A. First of all, there is a law now that provides just the sort of spousal  protection that you are talking about. Under the Retirement Equity Act, which  became effective in 1985, a spouse must consent to the type and terms of the  pension plan a worker elects to receive at retirement. The law was designed to  prevent just the type of horror your friend undoubtedly experienced when she  learned that her husband's pension did not continue, even at a reduced rate,  after his death.  </P> <P> Is is entirely possible that this law became effective after your husband  elected the terms of his pension. But you can still find out what those terms  are. Simply contact the pension plan administrator at his former company. Also,  our experts advise that it may be possible for your husband -- if he is not  incompetent or completely incapacitated -- to change the terms of his pension  payment. Again, you can check this through the company.  </P> <P> Even if you're not at or near retirement, this is probably as good a time as  any to check how your pension plan is structured. Do payments continue when you  die? If so, at what level? Are you satisfied with the choices you made years  ago, when retirement seemed as remote as the moon? If not, can you change them?  Should you? This is not just an issue for older folks.  </P></p>

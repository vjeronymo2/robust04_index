			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 11 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  met with the chairman of the main opposition Democratic Party  [DP], Yi Ki-taek, Friday and agreed on the need to clean up the  political climate.    At a two-hour meeting Friday morning, Kim and Yi, however,  disagreed on abolition of the controversial National Security  Law, Yi's proposed visit to North Korea and ratification of the  Uruguay Round accord.    The two party leaders also showed a considerable difference  of opinion on the political neutrality of the police.    The meeting, held at the invitation of the president, was  their second since Kim Yong-sam inaugurated the first civilian  administration in more than three decades in February last year.    In view of their differing opinions, the abolition of the  National Security Law and National Assembly ratification of the  Uruguay Round agreement are expected to become hot political  items in the months ahead.    Responding to Yi's demand that the National Security Law be  revised, President Kim said firmly: "It cannot be done."    "North Korea, which had denounced the South in propaganda  broadcasts for 10 hours a day, is doing it now for 13 hours a  day and it (Pyongyang) has never given up its ambition of  communizing the South.    "Under the circumstances, we cannot revise the National  Security Law any more," the president said, according to  presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik.    With regard to Yi's request for support of his plans to  visit  North Korea, President Kim warned the DP chairman might be  "caught up" in North Korea's strategy to communize the South.    Yi's plans to visit North Korea at a time when Pyongyang is  trying to gain nuclear weapons capability are undesirable both  for Yi and the country.    Commenting on the Uruguay Round, Kim said renegotiation of  the global trade agreement is not possible, while asking Yi to  marshal opposition support for ratification of the accord at the  National Assembly.    As for issues of political neutrality of the country's  police  forces, the president said the National Police Administration  has already been launched for that purpose. "There was no need,  however, to set up a new government agency for police neutrality  in a small country like ours," Kim said.    Touching on implementation of the revised political bills  that were just passed by the National Assembly, President Kim  said there can be no ruling and opposition parties "in the sense  that they (new laws) signal a renaissance of parliamentary  democracy in this country."    The president also pledged to mobilize all administrative  powers to crack down on those who break election laws during  polls for the heads of local autonomous governing bodies in 1995.    "It does not matter how many law-breakers we catch," Kim  said. "We will bring all of them to justice."    Yi told the president that the government should demonstrate  its determination to implement the new political laws in order  to foster a cleaner political climate.    The opposition leader also proposed that National Assembly  proceedings be televised to help realize political reform.    On the National Security Law, Yi said it should be replaced  with democratic law-and-order legislation or absorbed into the  criminal code because the law as it stands now is liable to  abuse.    With regard to the North Korean nuclear question, Yi said it  should be resolved through negotiation among the three involved  parties -- the United States, and South and North Korea.</p>

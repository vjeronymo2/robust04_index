			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Eagle Star to receive Pounds 450m from BAT BAT Industries, the tobacco to insurance group, is to invest Pounds 450m in its Eagle Star insurance subsidiary, bolstering the company's solvency and increasing its ability to take advantage of the recent upturn in insurance rates. BAT, which reported a 56 per cent increase in its pre-tax profits for the first nine months of 1992, is capitalising a Pounds 260m loan extended to Eagle Star in February this year, by converting it into redeemable preference shares. It is also injecting an additional Pounds 190m in the form of ordinary share capital. The injection follows a number of capital raising exercises by UK insurance companies this year, which have been weakened by two years of heavy losses related to stormy weather and the recession. Commercial Union and General Accident have raised Pounds 200m and Pounds 140m respectively through issues of cumulative irredeemable preference shares and Royal Insurance last week raised Pounds 76m with an issue of convertible bonds. Mr Michael Heath, executive director at Eagle Star, said the new money would 'greatly strengthen' the company's ability to expand its premium income at a time when premium rates were increasing. 'The timing is right, since there is a turn around in the market,' said Mr Heath. Overall the new money nearly doubles Eagle Star's net assets to between Pounds 900m and Pounds 1bn. By the end of 1992 the solvency ratio of the company's general business (which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income) should rise to more than 50 per cent, compared with its present level of less than 30 per cent. Analysts suggest the capital injection was necessary if Eagle Star was to win new business. Mr Youssef Ziai, insurance analyst with Morgan Stanley, said Eagle Star's solvency 'seemed quite weak'. 'At that level there was no way brokers would give them new business,' he said. Mr Heath said that with security and financial strength of insurance companies becoming increasingly important, the issue would be well received by the building societies and national brokers which generate much of Eagle Star's business.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 29 (AFP) -- An international  contact group looking to mediate between the warring Bosnians  left here Friday [29 April] amid little sign of progress. The  nine-man group, which Friday travelled the short journey to  Pale, east of Sarajevo, for talks with Serb leaders later  returned for a further meeting with Bosnia's Moslem President  Alija Izetbegovic, before flying on to Zagreb. [passage omitted]    In a statement after the group's departure, Izetbegovic said  his discussions with the group had provided no results. He said  he had set no conditions for restarting negotiations apart from  full Serb compliance with the NATO ultimatum and ceasefire, but  said he was not satisfied with the situation in Gorazde. There  were Serb troops deployed in part of the three-kilometre  (two-mile) exclusion zone dressed as police, and artillery  remaining in the outer exclusion zone of 20 kilometres (12.5  miles). He added that since the Bosnian Government had received  no guarantee from the international community, the army must  continue to defend "free" territory. [passage omitted]</p>

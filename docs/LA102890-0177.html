Most of the illegal miners apprehended were taken to Puerto  Ayacucho, a jungle outpost on the Orinoco River, where they are to be tried on  charges of damaging the environment, authorities said. Since last year,  officials have made more than 1,000 arrests in attempting to staunch an  invasion of miners crossing the unmarked jungle border between Brazil and  Venezuela.  </P></p>

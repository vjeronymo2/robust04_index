[passage  omitted]    Before departing for London, Prime Minister al-Hariri told  AL-HAYAH that he is going to discuss with senior British  officials, first and foremost Major and competent ministers, in  the presence of Lebanese ministers, aspects of cooperation  between the two countries in various spheres in the light of the  plan prepared by the Lebanese Government to rehabilitate vital  facilities, proceeding from the plan to begin the development  and rebuilding process.    The prime minister expects the talks to include current  political issues, bilateral relations, and the stage reached in  the peace talks in the Middle East region in the wake of the  success achieved in the Syrian-U.S. summit held in Geneva  recently between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton.    He said that he and the delegation accompanying him are  carrying files related to all that concerns Lebanon with regard  to economic cooperation and the role Britain could play at this  level, in addition to holding meetings with businessmen and  representatives of British companies.    Prime Minister al-Hariri said that the government -- through  the Defense and Interior Ministries -- has programs to modernize  the weapons of the Lebanese Army and internal security forces,  "taking account of our current conditions, which suggest that  facilities should be offered to enable us to pay for the new  equipment supplied to us."

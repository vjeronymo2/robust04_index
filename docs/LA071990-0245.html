Final  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> SOLIS GAINS GROUND IN RIDING TITLE RACE  </P> <P> Sports View came from off the pace to edge Golden Voyager by three-quarters of  a length in the $37,000 allowance feature Wednesday at Hollywood Park as jockey  Alex Solis and trainer D. Wayne Lukas scored key victories.  </P> <P> For Solis, who also won the seventh race aboard favored Horsche, it was his  51st winner of the meeting.  </P> <P> That put him in a tie with Laffit Pincay Jr. for third place in the rider  standings behind leader Pat Valenzuela (55 winners) and runner-up Gary Stevens  (52).  </P> <P> For Lukas, the nation's leading money-winning trainer, it was his 21st victory  this meeting. That places Lukas one ahead of Ron McAnally for leading trainer  of the spring/summer meet, which has five more days.  </P> <P> Sports View, owned by Beal, Cox Jr. and Lukas, battled with Golden Voyager  through most of the long stretch before prevailing in 1:35 2/5. Stevens was the  rider on Golden Voyager, a 6/5 favorite in the field of six.  </P> <P> Oh Wow came on late to take third, a nose behind Golden Voyager.  </P> <P> The victory was worth $20,350 to the winner.  </P> <P> It was Sports View's second win in eight races, with three seconds. Sports View  has now earned $59,400.  </P> <P> The winner paid $6.40, 3.20 and 2.40. Golden Voyager paid $2.60 and 2.10 and Oh  Wow was $2.80 to show. (Charts, Section C)  </P> <P> Trainer Ron McAnally put the final touches on Arkansas Derby winner Silver  Ending over the weekend, as plans were completed for Sunday's $200,000 Swaps  Stakes.  </P> <P> "We worked the horse a mile Sunday," said McAnally. "He went in 1:39.1, and I  was happy with the move."  </P> <P> The 3-year-old Silver Hawk offspring has four wins in 10 starts.  </P></p>

Arafat told journalists that the cabinet decisions were  "empty gestures and do not represent an adequate response" to  Friday's slaughter.    The Israeli cabinet on Sunday gave the army the power to  disarm hardline Jewish settlers, restrict their movements and  place them in administrative detention.    It also agreed to form a committee of enquiry into the  massacre, and to release up to 1,000 of some 10,000 jailed  Palestinians as a gesture.    Arafat is to chair an emergency meeting of the PLO  leadership  here late Sunday to decide whether to resume peace talks with  Israel.    President Bill Clinton wants Israel and the PLO to hold  non-stop talks in Washington in a bid to seal agreement on the  overdue launch of Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and  Jericho.    Israeli settlers denounced the government's response as  going  too far.    The Council of Jewish Communities in Judaea, Samaria and  Gaza  "rejected out of hand the proposals by irresponsible politicians  ... to confiscate the weapons of Jews living (in the  territories) and to punish Israeli citizens without a trial.    "Making people more vulnerable is no way to calm the  situation," it said.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Polaroid set to create three business units POLAROID, the US photography company, plans to create three business units as part of its 'strategic vision' from the beginning of next year, agencies report. The company said the three operations would be 'highly autonomous with specific profitability goals,' with each relying primarily on its own sales and marketing, business sector management, and manufacturing and development groups. Polaroid said it would group its operations in core photography, high resolution imaging, and imaging media and peripherals. It also intends to offer early retirement for selected employees. Details would be available next month. A spokeswoman declined to comment on the number of employees who would be offered the early retirement option, or on the financial impact of the programme. She said that the company currently has about 11,000 employees. Allied-Signal, the US aerospace and vehicle parts group, has completed the sale of its 33.3m Union Texas Petroleum Holdings shares, Reuter reports. Allied said net proceeds from the secondary offering were Dollars 585m. This was in addition to the Dollars 355m the company received in September from the redemption of Union Texas preferred shares and warrants.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second and final part of interview with Renamo Secretary </F> General Vicente Ululu; Alcido Ngwenha, member of the Frelimo  Political Commission; Monamo Secretary General Maximo Dias; and  Inacio Chire, PCN foreign affairs coordinator, by correspondent  Moises Mabunda -- place and date not given]    [Text] [Ngwenha] I would like to answer Chire. I think  this a very appropriate moment for dialogue. My view is not  only that things may be positive. My view is that things may be  positive or negative. I think it is somehow demagogic to say  that there are countries with perfect democracies. We are at a  certain phase of democratization in our country. It is true  that it may be relatively inferior or limited, but neither Chire  nor anyone else are to blame for this. There is no way one can  deny that Chire formed a party on the basis of a law in  Mozambique and he was not harassed. No one can deny that we are  holding this dialogue, that there are different parties in the  country, and that this is an important moment for the country,  for the democratization process.    No one can deny that the National Convention [PCN] Party has  been criticizing the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party  in newspapers and it is not being harassed... hence, one cannot  say Frelimo is not changing !!... Even the most beautiful girl  in the world cannot show what she does not possess. This means  the Frelimo Party is making efforts to democratize the country.  If the PCN was in power it could do more, that is another  issue... but there is no evidence that it could do more. It is  totally wrong to completely refuse to acknowledge what has been  happening. This is not going to help the situation.    As Mozambicans we are making very concrete steps forward to  democratize the country. We cannot do more than others, because  we are poor. One must bear this in mind. We are holding a  debate, but we are still poor. One cannot say that the Frelimo  Party is not talking with the people. The president of the  republic has been to provinces on several occasions, held  meetings with the people, and talked about multipartyism. Even  I myself have talked about the PCN in my rallies. I have  explain the situation. One cannot completely deny what has  taken place... what surprises me is: What is the PCN's work?  What does it do? It only says it has no resources, it has no  this or that, but what has it been doing? It is able to air its  views in newspapers, but I have never heard that it has ever  done anything for multipartyism. It only says the government is  corrupt and nothing else. It is false to say that there is no  democracy and nothing is being done... there can never be a  perfect democracy. Democracy is an old concept and it is always  changing, even in the United States...    [Mabunda] I would like to hear Renamo's comments on this  issue, that Frelimo is not making any changes...    [Ululu] People say that there is no democracy in Mozambique  because they have reasons. They say this because they are able  to justify it. We are democratizing the country. We know that  democracy was nonexistent in this country. We are trying to  build a society where we can enjoy our political rights. When  people say there is no democracy in the country, they may be  right because the principles, the democratic ingredients are  still lacking. There is talk of corrupt, inefficient  government...    [Mabunda] But there is also corruption in democratic  countries...    [Ululu] There is ... I say this because the opposition uses  these small faults to say there is no democracy in the c?untry...    [Chire] We could speak of the independence of the judiciary,  the news media. We could speak of means of communication; do  you think that the judiciary here in Mozambique is independent?    [Mabunda] Are you asking me?    [Chire] I am putting the question on the table...there are  clear examples. There is a law that speaks of the independence  of the judiciary, but this independence does not exist at  present. For years, the media has operated in a certain manner.  There has never been a clear-cut change. I am not saying that  all journalists belong to Frelimo. I am not saying that and  that is not what I think. I am also not saying that journalists  are working for Frelimo. I am not saying that. I am ony saying  that there have never been clear-cut changes. The directors of  principal news media are the same people who were there during  the period of the one- party system. I can even say that most  of them are Frelimo members. There are many other examples... I  think that theoreticians define a series of principles that are  fundamental for a transition to democracy. I would also like to  clarify that I have never said -- I would never say it -- that  there is perfect democracy. There is no perfect democracy. It  does not exist, as far as I know. Democracy is a process of  readjustments, reorganization. I believe that from phase to  phase, we have to find the best form of democracy.    [Ngwenha] I agree...    [Mabunda] I would like to ask Dr. Maximo Dias to air his  views, but I would like you to begin by clarifying the  following: Of the experiences of a Government of National Unity  [GNU] that we know of, there are some that were successful and  others less successful. After 25 April, Portugal tried to  establish a GNU but it had more failures than successes. There  are people who even say that the two years of its existence was  a period of total misrule. Will it function in our case?    [Dias] No, your example...it is not true that a GNU did not  function in Portugal. The GNU operated during a period of  revolutionary shakeup. It was able to establish a Constituent  Assembly which prepared the Constitution. The Constitution was  not prepared by Salazar or Marcelo Caetano. It was prepared  during the revolutionary GNU. As a matter of fact, it was not  clearly a GNU. It was a revolutionary government formed by  certain parties and the Armed Forces Movement. Despite all the  problems it worked. It reached a consensus. It formed the  Constituent Assembly which prepared the elections which were won  by the Socialist Party by a more-or-less 35- or 40-percent  margin. The Socialist Party ruled with difficulty because it  was a minority Government...then there was a democratic  alliance, a majority government, and now the Social Democratic  Party. Here in our country, we speak of many problems. The  national problems are so serious, so fervent. We are holding  this round table to discuss GNU's establishment. I believe our  people would want to know what we mean when we talk about GNU  and how it is going to function. GNU is not a political option.  It is a political imperative. Each party should not think: "I  am going to form a GNU", no. This is reserved for parties  capable of greater political consciousness, greater political  responsibility, in this case, Frelimo and the Mozambique  National Resistance [Renamo]. I am not saying other parties  cannot have political consciousness. The problem is they have no  capacity to impose themselves on the two parties, which are  still parties with a military tendency. It does not mean that  we cannot hold dialogue with either Frelimo or Renamo. We have  already held dialogue with them, but they are different from  other parties.    It now remains to be seen whether these two parties will  have  the political awareness. One of them, Renamo, already has. At  least, its president presented a solution to save the situation.  Renamo believes that there should be a GNU. We are now waiting  to hear the stand of the other party, the ruling party, which  has not yet said whether or not it is going to have a GNU. Its  president said that after elections, we are going to see whether  or not GNU is necessary. There is a declared and open awareness  from both sides however to discuss GNU's establishment.    [Mabunda] Perhaps we could conclude here. The aim of this  round table was to exchange views on GNU's establishment, as  well as to clarify its meaning to the common citizens. It was  not the newspaper's intention that the parties should reach a  consensus on the issue. That is not its role. Mr. Ululu, would  you like to have the last word?    [Ululu] I think all the essential things have been said...    [Dias] I would just like to once again stress that GNU is  not  an option. It is not power sharing. GNU, I repeat, is a  political imperative. It is a political awareness decided by  the existing economic, social, and political difficulties in the  country. GNU, for when? We all agree that it should be after  elections. Why after elections? After elections, because the  country cannot postpone them. The two militarized parties must  publicly promise that elections are going to be held this  October.    We cannot accept what a British diplomat said: "There will  be elections, even if the armed forces have not been  constituted". We cannot accept that. It is a recipe for  military confrontation. We have to avoid it. How can we do  that? By adopting a system of proportionality, involving  independent or political individuals, individuals in the  religious, economic, and social fields, people who are ready to  volunteer to reach a compromise. When Monamo defends a GNU's  establishment, it is not demanding to participate in it. If the  two most voted for political forces in the country feel,  however, that there are elements in Monamo -- which despite not  having the required percentage -- who can participate in the  government, Monamo will allow them to do so as a concession, not  because that is its ambition. Many people can think that we are  calling for GNU's establishment because we are unable to win the  elections. That is not the case.</p>

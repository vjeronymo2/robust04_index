			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 21 KYODO -- North Korean President Kim  Il-song hopes that a historic summit meeting with his South  Korean counterpart Kim Yong-sam can be held in Pyongyang in  August, the widow of former Japanese Prime Minister Takeo Miki  said Tuesday [21 June].    Speaking with reporters at Beijing airport, Mutsuko Miki  said  she was invited to Pyongyang by the North Korean president on  June 14 and met with him for two hours on Sunday.    "I don't remember clearly the date of the scheduled summit  meeting that Kim Il-song referred to, but I believe he said  August 17," Miki, 77, said.    The summit was first proposed by the North Korean president  during talks with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter in  Pyongyang late last week and relayed Saturday to South Korean  President Kim Yong-sam, who readily accepted the proposal.    The mention of the August date and Pyongyang is the first  proposal by either side of a time and place for what could be a  historic meeting.    The south has proposed a preparatory meeting for the summit  on June 28 at the heavily armed border crossing at panmunjom and  it is believed the North Korean side will put forward the August  date at meeting, analysts said.    Kim Il-song was very upbeat in describing his meetings with  Carter, which he called "very successful" and "in a very  friendly atmosphere," Miki said.    "We would like to have more personnel exchanges with Japan  and get along with Japan," she quoted Kim as saying, adding that  he expressed a strong hope of establishing diplomatic ties with  Japan.    Takeo Miki was prime minister from 1974 to 1976.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Vietnam seeks Seoul investors MR VO Van Kiet, the Vietnamese prime minister, arrived in Seoul yesterday on a four-day visit to seek Korean investment. He is the most senior Vietnamese official to visit South Korea since the two countries established relations last December. Korea is already the sixth largest foreign investor in Vietnam, with Dollars 343m. Besides signing agreements on trade and investment guarantees, Mr Vo Van Kiet will tour the industrial facilities of Korea's biggest conglomerates. Korean investment in Vietnam is expected to increase once the US lifts economic sanctions against Hanoi, which will permit international financial institutions such as the World Bank to provide credit for infrastructure projects. Korea's big construction companies, including Hyundai, are seeking contracts to build or repair roads and port facilities. Meanwhile, joint ventures are being established. Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco) is building two steel facilities in Vietnam and it announced yesterday it would build an agrochemical plant in co-operation with Daewoo, another Korean conglomerate. Samsung wants to set up fertiliser and containers factories. Daewoo has signed contracts for a Dollars 60m hotel, a truck assembly plant and TV picture tube plant. and Lucky-Goldstar is installing telecommunications systems. Mr Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, will hold discussions in Seoul next week on resolving the North Korea nuclear problem. South Korea is relying on China to help persuade Pyongyang to reverse its decision on withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), which takes effect on June 12. It is still uncertain whether China will support economic sanctions against Pyongyang if it leaves the NPT.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Pang-hui: "Defense Industry on a </F> Ruinous Road and the Collapse of a Self-Reliant National  Defense"]    [Text] "Turn cannonballs into coins." This is not a mere  euphemism to describe an era when economic war has replaced the  cold war; This describes the urgent situation in which ROK  defense-industry companies have no choice but to make changes on  their own.    Pungsan virtually led the ROK defense industry, and its main  business was manufacturing. However, domestic demand for  artillery shells plummeted, and as a result, the company faced a  serious management crisis. Consequently, it is drastically  curtailing its facilities for producing defense-industry  materials. It is also cutting its work force for the defense  industry by 800 a year. The company is making coins in the  United States by using knowhow gained from manufacturing copper  artillery shells.  <H5>  Past Special Privileges Are Now a Form of Bondage </H5>   Approximately 80 defense-industry companies, including  Pungsan, are now facing difficulties in management primarily  because domestic demand for conventional weapons has almost been  met. The domestic defense-industry companies are now operated  at close to 40 percent of capacity.    Similarities between defense-industry companies and ordinary  companies end when it comes to their difficulties in management.  Defense-industry companies cannot freely close their shops.  This is due to the legacy of a special government policy for  the defense-industry companies.    If a defense-industry company facing serious management  difficulties wants to dismantle facilities used exclusively for  the defense industry, it must obtain approval from the  government under the Special Law for Fostering the Defense  Industry. This law was promulgated in 1973 and has made it  possible for the government to give various forms of assistance  to defense-industry companies. This special treatment has turned  into a form of bondage.    Of course, even if defense-industry companies freely  dismantle defense-related facilities and relocate workers to  other areas, the government has no effective means to punish  those companies. In fact, since the mid-1980's many  defense-industry companies have dismantled defense-related  facilities in disregard of the law.    Companies that manufacture firearms, shells, mobile  equipment, and other weapons and small and medium-size companies  have a strong tendency to dismantle defense-related facilities.  Even big companies that were over 20 percent defense  industry-related have reduced defense activities to less than 10  percent. The president of a defense-industry subsidiary of a  big business group says: "General sentiment in this industry is  that the defense industry is a shortcut to ruin."  <H5>  "Almost All Defense-Industry Companies Will Disappear in </H5> Three to Four Years"    Under these circumstances, Paek Yong-hun, chairman of the  Defense Industry Association and director of the Korea  Industrial Development Institute, says: "Almost all companies  that manufacture basic military weapons will disappear in three  to four years. Is it all right for defense-industry companies  to disappear like this?"    It is not its share in the ROK economy that makes the  defense  industry important. Even though exact statistics are not  available, the net sales of the defense industry were close to  28 trillion won in 1990. The most serious problem of our  defense industry is that even though various countries of the  world are curtailing this "industry of death," we are not in a  position to do so.    This is why the government cannot do anything about this  industry. Representatives of the defense industry who attended  the 15 April "high-level policy meeting to foster the defense  industry" asked the government to make some sort of decision  with regard to the defense industry.    What would happen if defense industrial companies that  produce basic weapons were to disappear from our country? The  government would lose not only the capability of supplying basic  weapons in an emergency, but also not be able to procure the  sources for the spare parts necessary in manufacturing basic  weapons. This will then result in reducing the country's  self-defense capability. The defense industry has an aspect  which cannot be judged from a viewpoint of mere economic logic  just like at the time when we began to develop this industry 25  years ago.    Another aspect of the defense industry is that unlike other  industries, this industry has no room to grow. In other words,  today, when heavy and chemical industries, which were once  deemed failures have returned to the stage of success, only the  defense industry is in a state of decline. This is because  there is not gateway out. In other words, the defense industry  can not grow like other industries because it lacks export  activities.  <H5>  The United States Has Been Stingy in Transferring High </H5> Technology to the ROK    Exports in the defense industry were actually blocked by  restrictions imposed by the United States. The National Defense  Ministry has not officially made public the balance of payments  in the defense industry sector. However, it has been learned  that the defense industry sector accumulated debts of over $2  billion in the nineties. In the eighties, the deficit amounted  only to $1 billion.    The defense industry's domestic demand has been met, and  exports have been blocked. Such being the situation, the future  of our defense industry is very dark and gloomy. The "Report on  Military Cooperation and Competition Between the United States  and Allied Countries For 1992" of the U.S. Congress' Military  Technology Evaluation Committee which was conveyed to the  National Defense Minitry via the American Embassy in Seoul,  indicates the following in connection with the ROK defense  industry: "The ROK's basic purpose is to maintain the present  defense industry and to achieve complete self-reliance in weapon  production capability.    "However, it will be difficult to achieve this by the next  century."    While this report properly reveals the vulnerability of the  ROK defense industry, it foresees that the ROK defense industry  will be completely self-reliant in weapons production capability  by the next century, and this is too optimistic a view of the  future of the ROK defense industry.    Admittedly, the domestic defense industry has made equally  rapid progress as the other industries. The ROK has become the  only country which has become self-reliant in the production of  basic weapons in the short period of less than 10 years. It is  not too much to say that the ROK's success in the defense  industry sector was realized from its "tactic of relying on" the  United States. The ROK began to rapidly develop the defense  industry by receiving grant-type military aid, loans from  foreign military sales [FMS], and military technology materials  [TDP] from the United States as early as in the fifties.    In particular, data on U.S. military technology provided by  the United States since 1971 has been the main source for the  ROK to attain U.S. military technology. Data for over 1,000  such cases of U.S. military technology was transferred from the  United States to the ROK thus far, and this can be evaluated as  having greatly contributed to the development and production of  as many as 200 different types of weapons in our country. This  data has greatly contributed to developing Korean-type arms such  as Korean-type armored vehicles and Korean-type tanks in  particular.    Besides the technological aspect, the ROK defense  industry's dependence on the United States is great. Among  other things, over 70 percent of the weapons the ROK purchases  from abroad are of U.S. origin. Moreover, the ROK defense  industry has been producing the weapons of U.S. origin through  technological licence agreement or has been producing them  jointly with the United States since the seventies. Since it  began producing M16 rifles through a licence agreement in 1971,  the ROK defense industry has produced M60 light machine-guns and  various kinds of communications equipment through licensing  agreements. This led to our attainment of complete local  production of this type of the weaponry.    In the 1980's, the ROK began the off-set program [as  published] with the United States and has since then actively  pushed ahead with joint production. The defense industry, which  has jointly produced some basic weaponry, has been making  considerable progress in the area of aircraft production. The  defense industry has produced F-5E/F fighter-bombers and 500MD  helicopters jointly with the United States, and is jointly  producing F-16's at present.    The problem in our cooperation with the United States in  defense industry is that our dependence on the United States has  become too great. This problem has become even more burdensome  since the 1980's when the U.S. Government and the U.S. defense  industry began to regard the ROK defense industry as a  competitor. There has been discord between the ROK and the  United States over U.S. restriction of ROK weapons exports,  transfer of advanced military technology, opening up of the  defense industry market, and compromise trade [cholchung kyoyok].    For instance, the United States, while providing the ROK  with  military technology data, has been stingy in providing data for  relatively advanced technology, such as in aviation and marine  and submarine guided weapons systems. Up to 1990, not more than  10 technological transfers were made in these areas. Moreover,  the ROK Government has requested that the United States conduct  joint research and development or joint production for key  technology transfer of defense industry, but little progress has  been made so far. In the latter half of the 1980's, the ROK  submitted a request for U.S. technology related to laser and  guided weapons and detection of submarines and sound, which the  United States rejected.    No doubt, it would be most desirable if the ROK could  develop  advanced weapons and technology on its own. However, reality is  not that simple. For instance, key technologies designated by  the Defense Institute [as published] as high precision weapons  that need to be procured by the 2000's, were already being used  in the United States in the latter half of the eighties.    In view of the level of ROK science and technology and its  capability of acquiring funds for research and development,  independent development is not easy. Hwang Tong-chun, policy  development officer of the Defense Research Institute, said that  in this respect, the ROK-U.S. defense industrial cooperation  will be an important factor that will determine the fate of the  local defense industry.    How much necessary technology the ROK can obtain with the  present research and development system is another important  factor connected with the future of the defense industry.  Unlike other industries, the National Defense and Science  Institute, a state policy research institute, has a monopoly on  the defense industry's research and development. This  institute's annual budget is estimated to be about 200 billion  won, of which about 60 percent is allocated to defense industry  businesses for development and production.    Whether this monopolistic system in research and  development is appropriate in view of the trend of the defense  industry which is attaching increasing importance to technology  that can be used both for civilian and military purposes is  subject to controversy. A considerable number of experts assert  that a considerable number of the 800 projects which the  institute is charged with should be transferred to civilian  businesses, but the institute refused to comment on this  assertion.  <H5>  Judgment Based on Economic Theory Is Hardly Workable </H5>   The perspective on the defense industry has changed  drastically from the seventies to the eighties. During the  former, the defense industry was seen from a perspective of  national survival rather than economic theory. This was the  logic former President Pak Chong-hui upheld in cultivating  defense industry. Former President Chon Tu-hwan, however,  asserted that economic logic be applied to the defense industry  as well, following the advice of economic aides and ministers  whom he favored.    Depending on the weight placed on either of the two  assertions, the defense industrial experts can be divided into  two groups--one favoring local development and production, and  the other favoring overseas purchase. The former's assertion is  that in order to cultivate the local defense industry, we should  produce weapons locally through our own research and  development. On the other hand, the latter's assertion is that  we should not hesitate to purchase weapons from abroad if we are  unable to have relative superiority in local development.    At one time, the two differing approaches were referred to  as  the "Taejon faction view" and the "Hongnung faction view"  according to the organizations they belonged. Taejon was home  to the National Defense and Science Institute (ADD) [as  published], while Hongnung was home to the Korea Institute of  Defense Administration (KIDA). The two organizations have been  feuding since the early eighties when researchers of the  National Defense and Science Institute were dismissed en masse  according to former President Chon Tu-hwan's instructions. This  difference in view is considered to persist today.    According to defense experts, whichever view assumes greater  weight, a view for the nineties needs to be formed, as the lack  of principle in the defense industry will result in the collapse  of this important industy, which, in turn, could result in a  fatal defect in the ROK's self-defense capabilities.    An even more difficult point is that conclusions regarding  the defense industry should not come from the working level  officials of the Defense Ministry. An Pyong-kil, second  assistant defense minister, said, "The Defense Ministry's  coordination ability regarding defense industry policy is  limited," and added, "The problem of defense industry should be  reviewed from an entirely different perspective starting from  scratch."</p>

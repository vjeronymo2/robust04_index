			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Russia increases Caucasus role: Grachev announces greater military presence in troubled north Russia is establishing a large military presence in the Northern Caucasian region, the most unstable area in the country and one in which conflict is expected to spread. General Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister, made the announcement yesterday at the regional centre of Rostov on Don shortly after the resolution of the area's third hostage crisis in the past six months. Three armed men had held a bus load of 40 hostages and escaped with a reported Dollars 6m and a helicopter, but were captured in the autonomous republic of Chechnya. Gen Grachev, in remarks to the Interfax news agency, said he was creating 'an army capable of conducting combat operations', able to defuse large and small conflicts. If regional forces proved unable to cope, Russian troops would help crack down on 'terrorist groupings' which have flourished in the region. The Caucasus, with several autonomous republics providing a home for numerous, often mutually hostile, ethnic groups, has become in the past two years a hotbed of feuds and outbreaks of hostilities which are barely controlled. The fiercest fighting has been across the Russian border in Georgia, where some 3,000 Russian peacekeeping forces have been deployed this month in the breakaway region of Abkhazia. They are already blamed by the Abkhazian delegation in Moscow for promoting the return of Georgian refugees who had committed 'war crimes' against Abkhazia, which has declared itself independent. At the same time, the Russian military continues to deploy armour in the region in excess of levels agreed in talks within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. This has caused fears of Russian expansionism, especially in Turkey, whose regional power had itself been expanding and which has several areas of potential tension with Russia. Gen Grachev's announced initiative puts in doubt once more the ability of the military to live within a budget for 1994 of Rbs40,000bn, the sum agreed by the parliament last week when it passed the overall budget. It shows he is willing to use such incidents as the taking of hostages to again argue the case for the army's higher profile as a saviour of the nation from border and other conflicts. President Boris Yeltsin, who is anxious to retain military support, has partially bowed to the generals' demands by saying that while their access to budget funds was limited, 'off budget funds' would have to be created to satisfy their most urgent needs, and those of the arms-producing plants which are being starved of orders. One proposal has been to use the money gained from weapon sales abroad for expenditure on the military.</p>

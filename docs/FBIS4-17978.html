			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Mikheyev: "Duma Deputies Assess Lessons </F> of Gorazde on the Spot"]    [Text] The crisis in Bosnia abated slightly after the  Bosnian Serbs had fulfilled the UN and NATO ultimatum, and  withdrawn their heavy armaments from the 20-km "safe area"  around Gorazde.    Two soldiers from the Russian "blue helmets" battalion had  been taken as hostages, but they were released the next morning.  The warring and interested parties are in a state of some  confusion. The "lessons of Gorazde" are still being assessed,  and this they are doing in the State Duma.    The flames could have been extinguished before the bomb  attacks, Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma International  Affairs Committee, believes. Before the Bosnian Serbs were  "forced to show they were not afraid" in response to the  "deterrence strategy."    The latest spiral in the crisis in Bosnia, Lukin believes,  demonstrated the "ineptitude" of the U.S. Administration, which  is linking bombing raids in former Yugoslavia to the domestic  political situation at home, the fact that the West Europeans  are "easily persuaded," since they opted for a "diplomatic  facade rather than political decisions," and also the "weakness  and incoherence of Russian diplomacy."    The deputy paid tribute to the flexibility of the West,  which  had "given the Serbs a way out," and to Boris Yeltsin's timely  intervention, which was carried out not through "Russian  diplomats in the field," but directly, although "within the  framework of nonpublic diplomacy."    Although the departure of the president's special envoy from  the trouble spot was seen as a positive contribution, Moscow's  actual participation in the efforts to unravel the Balkan knot  of tension was not called into question. Bosnia has  demonstrated, though, that neither the West nor Russia "will be  able to handle it alone."    There was criticism in the Duma of the Clinton  administration, which is following ideologized precepts: The  Serbs are an enemy who must be punished, but U.S. soldiers must  not die and the U.S. taxpayer must not bear the extra cost.  Lukin, Russian ambassador in Washington, observed: "The  methods of indoctrination employed in the United States often  remind me of the methods used in North Korea."    The head of the parliamentary committee suggested that  Russian shuttle diplomacy should not be so closely linked to the  "personal factor," so that "people like me do not begin to  suspect that ambition plays too great a part in it." "Personal  resentment and disappointment" must not be allowed to come into  it, a diplomat must not lose his cool," Vladimir Lukin said,  although he did not once mention the name of Vitaliy Churkin.  You might say the gist of the speech was that you have to "play  as a team."    The Duma delegation, made up on a factional basis, which  toured the republics of former Yugoslavia, showed how to play as  a team.    In a statement for ITAR-TASS in Belgrade, Duma Deputy  Konstantin Zatulin expressed regret that "mature diplomats  preferred vexation to patience," by echoing the "rhetoric on the  benefit of ultimatums." Delegation head Nikolay Bezborodov  expressed his colleagues' view that the Duma must raise the  question of lifting sanctions against the Serb Republic of  Yugoslavia and pass it to the United Nations for a final  decision.    It is believed that, before ending up on the president's  desk, the Duma's recommendations will absorb two traditional  elements from the diplomatic arsenal -- "pressure and  encouragement"; the latter will incorporate a proposal on a  stage-by-stage lifting of sanctions.</p>

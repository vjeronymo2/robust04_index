			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow eases as airline stocks turn lower Wall Street US share prices were flat to weaker in light trading yesterday as stock market investors took their cue from an uninspired bond market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.50 at 3,851.72, but off its low for the session of 3,842.72. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.03 to 465.88, while the American SE composite shed 1.38 to 467.68 and the Nasdaq composite declined 2.93 to 792.12. Trading volume on the New York SE was 298m shares. After achieving impressive gains on Monday - when the Dow climbed 24 points  -the equity market was unable to maintain its upward momentum when trading opened yesterday. This was in spite of a firm start for bonds, which edged higher in the expectation that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates soon. Analysts said that, in the absence of fresh economic statistics, there was little mot-ivation for investors to buy stocks. Consequently, as soon as bond prices started to decline, turning an early quarter-point gain on the benchmark 30-year bond into a quarter-point loss by midday, stocks quickly followed suit. The declines were most pronounced among Nasdaq issues, primarily because they have outperformed the wider market in recent days and so were due for some kind of sell-off. Among individual sectors, leading airline issues were notably weaker after Prudential Securities, the Wall Street brokerage house, lowered its 1994 earnings estimates for the five airline companies it covers, citing a new round of fare-cutting in the industry. The news left Delta Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 47 3/4 , AMR (parent of American Airlines) down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 61 1/4 , UAL off Dollars 1/2 at Dollars 128 and Atlantic Southeast (traded on the Nasdaq market) Dollars 2 cheaper at Dollars 31 3/4 . The only stock to buck the trend was USAir, which firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 9 1/4 , having already suffered from heavy selling on Monday when it issued a profits warning. Varity jumped Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 48 3/4 in busy trading after the automotive, agricultural and industrial machinery maker announced a surge in fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 27m, a result that exceeded analysts' expectations. The bigger cyclical stocks were mixed. Alcoa dipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 74 3/4 , Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing edged ahead Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 104 7/8 and International Paper rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 74 1/4 . Canada Toronto stock prices closed on a mixed note following moderate trading. The market opened slightly lower and continued to fall through to midday. However, sharp gains among media-related issues, prompted by the announcement in the early afternoon that Rogers Communications and Maclean Hunter had reached an agreement on Rogers' proposed takeover of Maclean Hunter, helped to fuel a subsequent recovery. The TSE 300 composite index lost 5.4 on the day at 4,431.2, but advancing issues outnumbered declines by 395 to 362. Volume was 67.6m shares. Rogers Communications 'A' advanced CDollars 1 1/4 to CDollars 24 and the 'B' CDollars 1 1/4 to CDollars 23 1/4 . Maclean Hunter put on CDollars  5/8 at CDollars 17 1/8 on heavy volume of almost 3m shares. The media group index rose 2.8 per cent, but the mining sector fell 1.5 per cent and golds lost 1.0 per cent.</p>

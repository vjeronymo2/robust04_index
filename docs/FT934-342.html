			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Arts: Today's Television The thought of professional directors and choreographers going into Wandsworth prison and drilling the inmates for a production of a big theatrical musical would be peculiarly satisfying, whatever the title involved. When it happens to be Guys And Dolls with its cast of card sharps and con men the idea becomes irresistible. Guys, Dolls And D-Wing (BBC2, 8.00) is a documentary which records the process. Given the speed with which stills photographers from the advertising industry switch these days into directing Hollywood movies, it was a bright thought to have David Bailey try his hand at directing a studio drama. The result is Who Dealt? (C4, 9.30) a half-hour story about a woman, in a game of bridge with her husband's friends, who begins to talk too much. Hard to establish exactly how much has been edited out of Beeban Kidron's account of prostitution in New York, but Hookers, Hustlers, Pimps And Their Johns (C4, 11.10) is reckoned to be the most explicit programme of its sort ever shown on British television.</p>

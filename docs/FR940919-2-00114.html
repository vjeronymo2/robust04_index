			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Process Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Team utilized a document prepared by the SSA Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Workforce Analysis in April 1993 which outlines the ``as-is''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability claim and appeal processes of SSA. The document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains a description of claim processing tasks performed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> line-employees in the seven operational components that deal with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disability claim process. Team members also collected,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed, and researched an extensive amount of existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedural guides, laws/regulations, studies conducted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> internal and external components, processing time and quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management information, workflows, cost data, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Computer Modeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Computer models are close representations of work processes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, if properly constructed, allow for better understanding,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing or forecasting, and study. Team members worked with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modeling professionals in SSA to build the models used to predict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the operation of a redesigned process. A model was built to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent both the current and proposed processes. The model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> helped the Team assess the best features and performance of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new disability process; to better judge the magnitude of change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from one process to another; and to do some ``what-if-nothing- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes'' analysis to get a feel for the impact of inactivity. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summary of the model assumption and results appears in Appendix II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Release of Initial Team Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The product of the Team's effort was a redesign proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that was presented to the Commissioner and Executive Steering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee on March 31, 1994. The proposal provided the Team's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> view of the best process improvement and process innovation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ideas. The proposal is a high-level concept that provides a broad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understanding of how a redesigned process would work but leaves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operational, organizational, and other details for later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Team distributed the proposal as widely as possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout SSA, the State DDSs, and to interested public and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private individuals and organizations with the goal of seeking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactions, items of concern and additional ideas for improvement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of a shorter 25-page version of the Proposal were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributed to all SSA and DDS employees in early April 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the complete 132-page Proposal and Background Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were also distributed to each SSA DDS facility in sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers to make it easily available to staff. A 30-minute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> videotape containing remarks by Commissioner Chater and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presentation of the proposal by members of the Reengineering Team  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was distributed for use in all SSA and DDS facilities. Group  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feedback discussions with SSA and DDS employees were held in all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ten regions and in SSA headquarters components. A survey was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributed to each SSA and DDS employee to assist employees in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Proposal and Background Report was published in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18188). A 60-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment period was established to invite public comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal. A public hearing on the proposal was held in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington, DC on May 16, 1994. Team members conducted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extensive briefings on the proposal with interested parties,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including employee unions, professional association groups,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability advocates, the legal community, other Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, and Congressional staffs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the comment period that ended on June 14, 1994, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Team received over 6,000 written responses from all interested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties. The Team reviewed and analyzed each comment received. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summary of the comments is included in Appendix III. In response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reactions received during the comment period, the Team made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes to the original proposal and submitted a revised proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Commissioner and the Executive Steering Committee on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 30, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After extensive consultation with the members of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Steering Committee, SSA senior staff, representatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from employee unions and associations, disability advocates and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others, the Commissioner accepted the Team's recommendations for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a redesigned disability process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

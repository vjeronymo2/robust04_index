			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Goodhead slips 6% to Pounds 721,000 Profits of Goodhead Group, which has interests in printing, paper, publishing and marketing services, declined by 6 per cent to Pounds 721,000 pre-tax for the year to May 31. The result was in line with directors' expectations and came from turnover on continuing activities down 26 per cent at Pounds 40.3m. Profits before tax were struck after a Pounds 1.05m reduction in net interest charges to Pounds 1.29m and exceptional charges of Pounds 257,000 (credit Pounds 660,000) for reorganisation. Fully diluted earnings emerged at 1.3p (0.8p). The interim dividend was omitted but a 0.5p final is being paid - last year shareholders received an interim of 0.5p but no final.</p>

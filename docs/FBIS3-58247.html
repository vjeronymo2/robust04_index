Many  of his remarks addressed objections to the declaration that had  been raised in Republican circles. He recognized it faced them  with a momentous and historic decision, requiring real  leadership, courage and conviction. He said the government  wanted to provide continuing clarification but without putting  in question the balance of the document. [passage omitted]    [Begin Reynolds recording] The joint declaration makes it  clear on behalf of the Irish Government with the endorsement of  all the constitutional and nationalist parties that it would be  wrong to impose a united Ireland in the absence of the  freely-given consent of a majority of the people of Northern  Ireland. Likewise, the democratic right of self-determination  by the people of Ireland as a whole must be exercised with and  subject to the agreement and consent of a majority in Northern  Ireland. Both Governments accept that Irish unity would be  achieved only by those who favour this outcome, persuading those  who do not, peacefully and without coercion or violence.

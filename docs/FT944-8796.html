			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / London Tecs launch prospectus The nine London Training and Enterprise Councils yesterday launched an economic development prospectus for the capital, calling for flexible skills training for London's employees. Mr David Hill, chairman of Aztec, the Tec for south-west London, said training would have to be more general, rather than targeted at precise job descriptions. The prospectus said the key issues for London's employers were: updating skills to combat obsolescence, reskilling to enable staff to make job changes, upskilling to respond to the rising skills content of many jobs, multiskilling to enable staff to work across a range of tasks, and improving generic skills such as customer service and personal relations.</p>

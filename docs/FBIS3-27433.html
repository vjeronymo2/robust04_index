While waiting fro a formal response from the Russians,  Clinton stressed the seriousness of the case but said Washington  would continue to pursue its supportive policy toward President  Boris Yeltsin.    Clinton said he had already had a preliminary assessment of  the damage caused by Aldrich Ames's selling of vital CIA  operations and personnel information to the Russians.    On the capitol, secretary of state Warren Christopher said,  "the extent of the effect of this incident on our relationship  with Russia will depend upon Russian actions in the days ahead."    "Events in Russia over the past few weeks have revived our  fears about the future," Christopher said.    "Let me emphasize the United States will take every measure  to protect the United States and prevent such activities from  being carried out in the future," Christopher told a Senate  hearing on U.S. foreign policy.    Ames, 52, had been worked for the CIA for 31 years before  arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigations on Monday [21  February]. He is allegedly to have provided Moscow with vital  information in return for more than 1.5 million dollars.    Ames' wife, a 41-year-old Colombian native who worked for  the  CIA as a Colombian Embassy employee in Mexico City, Mexico, also  was arrested, she is now a naturalized U.S. citizen.    She is said to be cooperating with the authorities, even  before Monday's arrest, partly because of concerns over her  young son, reports said.    As Washington gauges the extent of the damage done to its  national security, reports are emerging that at least two Soviet  citizens spying for CIA were killed shortly after Ames disclosed  their identities to Russian intelligence agencies.    Ames and his wife face a maximum penalty of life  imprisonment  and a fine of 250,000 million dollars for each.</p>

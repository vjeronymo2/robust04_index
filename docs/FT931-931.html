			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Japan's industrial output rises 1.9% JAPANESE industrial production rose 1.9 per cent last month, compared to a month earlier, but the increase could be short-lived as manufacturers apparently lifted output in the hope of a recovery in domestic demand this month. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said the month-on-month increase was the first since last September, but year-on-year production was down 5.4 per cent, compared to falls of 7.6 per cent in January and 8.5 per cent in December. Carmakers have increased production in expectation of fresh demand for newly-released models, and the Japan car manufacturers' association reported a rise in sales for the first half of this month. The slowly returning confidence of carmakers was reflected in 4.4 per cent increase in transport machinery production in February, as well as a 7.9 per cent increase in metal production and a 7.6 per cent increase in precision machinery output. Meanwhile, Tokyo's consumer prices rose 1.6 per cent in the current fiscal year, the smallest increase in four years, due to increasing price competition in a slowing economy and an 11.9 per cent fall in vegetable prices that followed favourable weather conditions. The management and co-ordination agency, in a preliminary report, said the recent strengthening of the yen will mean cheaper imported foods and fuels, while the easing of the labour market will limit increases in service charges. In the fiscal year to the end of this month, housing expenses are estimated to have risen 3.0 per cent, entertainment and medical expenses 2.7 per cent, and clothing and footwear 0.8 per cent. The agency also said household spending fell 2.1 per cent in January, as consumer confidence declined in tandem with the slowing of the economy. There was an 8.8 per cent decrease in purchases of furniture and other household goods and a 5.3 per cent fall in spending on recreation and leisure activities.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / IG Metall to assist unions in east Europe GERMANY'S IG Metall, the biggest and most powerful union in Europe, has announced a programme of assistance for the weak and divided unions of eastern Europe to support economic and social 'fair play' in those countries. The union has described the assistance programme as the biggest solidarity initiative in its history. With some assistance from the European Commission it will be spending about DM2m (Pounds 800,000) on support for trade unionists in Hungary, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of IG Metall, said that his union and the East European unions had a common interest in seeing the gap in the standard of living between western and eastern Europe closed as quickly as possible. 'We need to act together to stop governments and inward investors playing us off against each other,' he said. The first bilateral agreement has been signed between IG Metall and the Hungarian Metalworkers Union, Vasas, which provides for training Vasas officials, visits to Germany, and close German-Hungarian union co-operation when German multinationals set up plants in Hungary. The IG Metall initiative is also designed to reduce competition between reformed 'old' unions and new unions. In the Czech and Slovak republics the unions have broken completely with their past but in Hungary there is still tension between old and new unions.</p>

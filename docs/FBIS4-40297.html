"We  are ready for as much integration as our partners are",  announced Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on Thursday.    Speaking at a foreign policy council meeting devoted to the  further integration of the CIS countries and to Russian  interests, Kozyrev noted the appearance of a lot of far-reaching  ideas which "show the urge for closer integration". "At the same  time, we would like to avoid a situation in which the proposal  and discussion of such promising ideas hinders us in resolving  concrete pressing problems, or distracts our attention from  them", Kozyrev said.</p>

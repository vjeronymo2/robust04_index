According to statistics by the provincial financial  department, Guizhou attained 5.55 billion yuan of revenue in the  1993 fiscal year, surpassing the plan by 4.6 percent, an  increase of 18.25 percent over the previous year. Tax  collections amounted to more than 860 million yuan. The  province's financial expenditure amounted to more than 6.69  billion yuan, an increase of 10.35 percent over the previous  year. Due to a large-scale decrease in bank deposits last year,  province's revenue kept declining for more than eight months.  In this situation, leaders of party committees and government  at all levels throughout the province carefully discussed the  financial and economic situation and helped enterprises overcome  difficulties in production and tax payments. [passage omitted]    The provincial government also formed a leading group to  strengthen financial and taxation work. As a result of common  efforts in all circles, the province fulfilled the revenue and  expenditure plan.</p>

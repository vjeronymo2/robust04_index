			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Surveyors report housing 'spring' THE ROYAL Institution of Chartered Surveyors today reports what may be 'the first sign of spring flowers' for the housing market, with increased activity in late November continuing - against the seasonal norm - into December. Its survey of market conditions in England and Wales for the quarter to the end of November based on chartered surveyors who operate as estate agents says the trend may herald a return of confidence next year. Mr Peter Miller, the institution's residential-property spokesman, says: 'We now have the foundations on which, given some good economic news on output or retail sales, the recovery can be built.' Lending rates, the survey says, are now at their lowest for many years; the ratio between house prices and earnings is at its most favourable for at least 10 years; there is a big supply of keenly priced houses; and pent-up demand from first-time buyers is very high and 'just waiting' for improved confidence. Mr Miller says: 'If, as we expect, the first six months of 1993 witness increased levels of activity, underlying demand could be unleashed and actually outstrip supply, leading to price rises at the bottom end of the market. Increased demand will then move slowly up the housing ladder.' In spite of the survey's guarded optimism, it discloses the depths to which the housing market has sunk this year. The 150 agents who responded sold an average of just 19 properties in the past three months compared with an average of 159 secondhand houses and flats for which direct instructions were received. The survey also shows sharp contrasts on the effects of interest rate cuts. A Northampton agent said November saw a flurry of activity as a result of rate cuts and the belief that the bottom of the market might have been reached. In Bishop Auckland, Co Durham, however, there were few signs of the market moving. Housing Market, RICS, 12 Great George St, Parliament Sq, London SW1P 3AD. Free.</p>

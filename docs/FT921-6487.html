			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Peru urges policy shift in drug fight PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori of Peru yesterday called for a shift in US policy on drugs, claiming that repressive measures had been counter-productive and a waste of aid. The Peruvian president, speaking at a drugs summit attended by President George Bush and five Latin American presidents, said his government had to avoid an open 'Vietnam-style' war against the nation's 250,000 coca farmers. Instead, he suggested, US aid should be targeted at persuading them to produce other crops. Mr Fujimori acknowledged that there was corruption in Peru, but he claimed 'there is corruption at all levels, even in the US Drug Enforcement Agency', in a barbed reference that is unlikely to endear him to the US authorities. The Peruvian president made specific requests for US aid to buy helicopters, aircraft and radar and criticised the US Congress for cutting aid last year to just Dollars 9m. 'The assistance we need is not for Peru but the world,' he said. The US yesterday announced that it had stopped supplies of military hardware to the Colombian army, after years of criticism that the army was using the anti-drug aid to fight leftist rebels, Reuter reports from Bogota. Instead, the Dollars 38m destined for the Colombian army this year, will be transferred to Colombia's special narcotics police, the marines, the air force and the navy.</p>

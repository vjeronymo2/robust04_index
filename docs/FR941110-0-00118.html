			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters proposed minimizing the time between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification of remedies and imposition of remedies by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instituting deadlines in an expedited hearing process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These commenters proposed imposing time periods for filing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of documents by all parties, and mandatory deadlines for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions by hearing officers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters proposed allowing States to follow their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> own Administrative Procedure Act provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some submitted State license laws for our consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, under one State's license law, deficiencies are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified based on whether there is a substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probability of death or serious mental or physical harm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Class A), a direct threat to health, safety or welfare of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident (Class B), or no direct threat to health, safety or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> welfare of a resident (Class C). Class A violations require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate abatement, subject to a Court injunction for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure to abate; Class B or C violations require a plan of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction within 10 days (extendable to 30). Timeframes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are included, providing generally for requesting hearings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 10 days after notice, and providing hearings within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 days of request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are not accepting suggestions that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require pre-sanction hearings because we continue to believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that residents are best served if remedies are imposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promptly. The residents are the beneficiaries of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare and Medicaid programs, and their best interests are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the motivating force behind OBRA '87 and these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are not mandating post-remedy hearings. We are merely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not requiring a hearing to be completed before imposing any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanction but civil money penalties. Depending on the size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the case load and processing times, a State could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete a hearing prior to the imposition of a remedy, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be consistent with these regulations any hearing would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to be conducted and concluded very shortly after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance was identified. However, we acknowledge that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ability to provide a pre-sanction hearing would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult for most States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are not accepting the various proposals on timing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> events within the hearing process itself. With respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare, some of these time periods are established by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, as is true, for example, for the 60 day period in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to appeal. With respect to both Medicare and Medicaid,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearings are held by independent hearing officers who are in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a far better position than HCFA to determine how quickly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various hearings can be held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not believe that State license law is analogous to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements. As we stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, providers have entered into agreements with Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Medicaid in which they have agreed to comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal requirements, including the requirements applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to remedies for noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

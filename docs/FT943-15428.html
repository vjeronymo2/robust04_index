			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Record exports help trade gap fall to Pounds 803m The UK's visible trade deficit declined sharply to Pounds 803m in April, from Pounds 1.21bn in March, according to figures released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday. However half the reduction was due to an improvement in trade in erratic items, such as precious stones and aircraft. If oil and erratics are excluded, April's deficit was Pounds 1.46bn, only slightly down from March's Pounds 1.53bn. Exports rose by 2.5 per cent between March and April to reach a new record of Pounds 11.09bn, while imports fell 1 per cent to Pounds 11.89bn. Over the three months to April, the deficit was Pounds 2.93bn, compared with Pounds 3.7bn in the previous three months. The opening of new fields in the North Sea has boosted oil production in recent months and helped the UK achieve a Pounds 408m surplus in oil in April, the highest monthly figure since August 1987. Exports of food, beverages and tobacco and of fuels reached record levels in April. The CSO estimates that the trend in both exports and imports is a rise of 1 per cent a month, with the deficit narrowing. The trend in volume terms is favourable for the UK, with exports rising by 1 1/2 per cent per month, and imports by 1 per cent. Analysts gave the figures a cautious welcome. Mr Simon Whitehouse, of James Capel, said that while it was 'encouraging that the underlying deficit at least remained stable in April a marked deterioration is in prospect over the coming months as UK domestic demand growth continues to outpace that in our major European export markets'. The UK's trade figures are now compiled using two different methods. Trade with non-European Union countries is calculated from customs returns, as before. The figures for trade with non-EU countries in May have already been published. Trade with EU countries is gathered under the Intrastat system, based on value added tax returns, and takes longer to assemble. Hence yesterday's published figures for whole world trade relate only to April. Doubts have been raised about the accuracy of the Intrastat system, particularly when it comes to recording imports. The deficit with EU countries in April was Pounds 310m, down from a revised Pounds 527m in March. Exports to the EU in April were at record levels. The CSO said that growth was particularly strong in the Benelux countries. Imports from the EU fell in April. However, EU imports in the three months to April were 4.8 per cent higher than in the previous three months. The CSO said that about half of the recent growth in EU imports came from Germany. Revisions to figures in the first three months of the year increased the deficit with EU countries by Pounds 89m, the CSO said.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TRADE WITH COUNTRIES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE EU Balance of payments basis (Pounds m seasonally adjusted)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Exports                     Imports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Countries                     Countries           European    outside     Whole   European  outside     Whole              Union     the EU     world      Union   the EU     world  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992        60,365     46,682   107,047     64,022   56,431   120,453 1993        63,510     57,329   120,839     67,730   66,789   134,519 Q2          15,502     14,158    29,660     16,681   16,309    32,990 Q3          16,188     14,441    30,629     16,924   16,881    33,805 Q4          15,496     15,161    30,657     17,353   16,883    34,236 1994 Q1     16,922     15,303    32,225     17,954   17,429    35,383 1993 Dec     5,107      5,057    10,164      5,872    5,704    11,576 1994 Jan     5,684      5,065    10,749      5,928    5,848    11,776 Feb          5,501      5,173    10,674      5,762    5,830    11,592 Mar          5,737      5,065    10,802      6,264    5,751    12,015 Apr          5,885      5,206    11,091      6,195    5,699    11,894 May            n/a      5,080       n/a        n/a    5,847       n/a  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Visible balance               -----------------------------                          Countries               European     outside    Whole    Invisibles    Current                  Union      the EU    world       balance    balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992            -3,657      -9,749  -13,406         2,867    -10,539 1993            -4,220      -9,460  -13,680         2,799    -10,881 Q2              -1,179      -2,151   -3,330          -126     -3,456 Q3                -736      -2,440   -3,176         1,191     -1,985 Q4              -1,857      -1,722   -3,579         1,525     -2,054 1994 Q1         -1,032      -2,126   -3,158         2,402       -756 1993 Dec          -765        -647   -1,412           n/a        n/a 1994 Jan          -244        -783   -1,027           n/a        n/a Feb               -261        -657     -918           n/a        n/a Mar               -527        -686   -1,213           n/a        n/a Apr               -310        -493     -803           n/a        n/a May                n/a        -767      n/a           n/a        n/a  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source CSO  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

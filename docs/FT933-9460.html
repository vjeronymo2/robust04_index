			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Technology: Bruised but not beaten - Microsoft is giving mixed signals about its future prospects For Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, these are trying times. His company is under scrutiny for alleged anti-trust violations; Wall Street has soured on the stock; and after 18 years of spectacular growth Microsoft is planning for a 'bumpy' year ahead. Could Microsoft have lost the golden touch that has enabled it to become the largest software company in the world, made Gates, 37, the richest man in the US and created hundreds of millionaires among its employees? This is the sort of question that irritates Gates. From his perspective, Microsoft's achievements to date have nothing to do with a Midas charm, rather they reflect hard work and perseverance, long-term vision and commitment. He has no patience with 'simplistic analysis' that assumes Microsoft will inevitably be successful in anything the company turns its hand to. Or, as is now the case, that short-term expectations for slower growth may signal that Microsoft's glory days are coming to a close. Indeed, predicting the outlook for Microsoft is complicated by numerous issues. Not the least of these is whether Microsoft will face an anti-trust suit. The US Justice Department is currently reviewing documents from a three-and-a-half year investigation conducted by the US Federal Trade Commission. Other problems for Microsoft include a downward trend in software prices and a weak market environment in Europe, one of its largest markets. With no big operating system software product introductions planned for the next 12 months, Microsoft also faces an unusual dry spell. Revenues from the company's core business - software for office PCs - may grow less rapidly than in the past. Yet the company is driving ahead with ambitious plans to enter new markets such as programs for hand-held 'personal digital assistants,' software for children, multimedia products and software for the 'digital highways' of the future. Microsoft is also developing two new generations of personal computer operating systems; one for desktop PCs, codenamed Chicago, and a second, called Cairo, for computer networks (see below). But torn between blowing Microsoft's trumpet, to impress customers and investors, or highlighting its vulnerabilities, to appease Washington regulators, Gates and other Microsoft executives are delivering a mixed message about the company's future prospects. 'In looking at this industry and Microsoft's role in it, I am very optimistic,' Gates says. 'We are investing in a very optimistic way.' In the next breath, however, he is urging caution. 'A number of these investments may take a long time to pay off,' he says. 'If these new things kick in, then we will go back to higher growth. If we're wrong, then we won't ever advance beyond the level we are at today.' Microsoft's propensity to point out the risks associated with entering new markets, and that even its new PC software products could 'bomb', has contributed to Wall Street's uncertainties. 'That tone of conservatism is part of our culture. We expect good results, but prefer them to come as surprises,' Gates says. Yet veteran Microsoft watchers believe that the company's recent emphasis on potential problems is at least in part aimed at the ears of anti-trust regulators in Washington DC. For example, Microsoft is at pains to point out that it does have competitors. Executives even highlighted rival products in a presentation to financial analysts less than two weeks ago. And in an attempt to win political support, Gates reels off the benefits which the PC industry has provided to the US economy, such as growth in exports and the creation of jobs. 'Today's software business is thriving, and it is not just Microsoft,' says Gates. 'There are 750 software companies in the state of Washington alone and the majority of them write software (applications programs) for Microsoft Windows. Net employment went up by more than the size of Microsoft just in the last year. . .the incredible thing is how well the US has done in this business.' The Clinton administration would be foolish to do anything that threatened the future of Microsoft, Gates seems to be implying. Politics aside, the greatest challenges facing Microsoft lie in the development of a series of ground-breaking technologies. Gates is placing a big bet on software for 'digital highways' - which could deliver multimedia information services to millions of businesses and homes. His goal is to establish a software standard for the way people use information services, whether they be entertainment services on interactive television, public information services at a kiosk in a shopping centre or business information services in the office. Partnerships - with cable television companies, telephone companies and companies in the entertainment field - will be an important aspect of Microsoft's involvement in digital highways. While denying reports that Microsoft has already struck a deal, Gates acknowledges that Microsoft is talking to US West as well as other US telephone companies, and TCI and Time Warner, the two largest US cable television companies. The gold rush surrounding 'digital convergence' also has movie moguls, newspaper companies, AT&amp;T and IBM knocking on his door, Gates says. 'You will see us enter into all sorts of partnerships.' Some will merely be agreements to collaborate in trials of interactive television service. Others may be 'hard-core joint ventures'. Microsoft also plans to make minority equity investments in companies involved in digital highways. 'I am not aware of any other company that is making the kind of bet that we are on digital information highways,' Gates says. The company will spend 'many tens of millions of dollars' developing the technology, and 'won't get any revenue for at least three years. And it could all be wasted, but that is the name of the game'. The 'game' of spotting new technology directions and turning them into business opportunities is one at which Gates is a master and with Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in cash resources, Microsoft can even afford to lose a few rounds.</p>

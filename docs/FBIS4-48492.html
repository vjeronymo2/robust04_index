			<p>BFN     [Text] A study of the viability of the government's  economic program being carried out by an IMF technical mission  has concluded with strong indications of satisfaction, according  to head of the mission Sergio Leite, who was speaking in a news  conference today. Despite this positive observation, however,  Sergio Leite stressed the need to give priority to finer details  of the implementation.    [Begin Leite recording] I believe that if such economic  measures are implemented correctly, there will be a considerable  economic growth in Angola in the next few years. It is  possible, and it will happen if you continue implementing  coherent economic measures. [end recording]    There is still room for doubt, however, since many steps  need  to be taken to ensure success. Leite noted, however, that  Angola has considerable possibilities and resources for  adjusting its economy.    [Begin Leite recording] The armed conflict is obviously the  major obstacle to the economic development, but even within  these conditions, there is the need to oversee the adjustment.  Although many people are afraid of the economic adjustment,  this happened extensively in Angola in 1993 and was successful.  [end recording]    Severino de Morais, deputy planning and economic  coordination minister, said the new economic government team  intends to once again accomplish that goal and added that the  preliminary draft resulting from the work of the two technical  teams satisfies the intentions of both sides. Despite delays in  implementing particularly the foreign exchange policy, the  Angolan and international experts believe that it is still too  early to evaluate the situation. At the end of the meeting the  two teams bid farewell to each other. One is leaving for  Washington to present its report to the director's fund  committee, and the other remains here to fight for the  development of the Angolan economy.</p>

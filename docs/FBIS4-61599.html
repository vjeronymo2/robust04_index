			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (7 May) TURAN-- Over the past day there was  little fighting in the northeastern section of the front  (Terter-Geranboy), report military sources. According to  experts from Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry, the slow-down is a  result of failures by the Armenian Army in the north-eastern  direction. Beginning with 1 May approximately 250 Armenian  soldiers were killed and wounded and they also lost several  units of military hardware.    Having incurred many losses, Armenian troops have been  compelled to regroup and strategise as they await extra military  hardware as well as additional forces from Armenia.    In addition to this, diplomatic sources told Turan that the  Armenian Army is planning to launch a new large-scale offensive  towards the Geranboyskiy (northern), Terterskiy and Barda  (north-eastern) regions. The goal of attack is to occupy these  regions and to reach the city of Yevlakh. The same source  reports that Russian specialists are also involved in planning  the offensive. As before, the Russian troops located in Armenia  are expected to take part in the offensive. It is known that  the Russian party provides Armenia with military intelligence  from Azerbaijan. Some experts see this assistance as a reaction  by Moscow to Azerbaijan's signing of NATO's programme  "Partnership for the Sake of Peace" and the Azerbaijan's refusal  to sign the Bishkek document which was proposed by Russia.</p>

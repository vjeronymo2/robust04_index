			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPATRIATION OF BOAT PEOPLE  </P> <P> It is extremely regrettable that the government of Hong Kong decided to force  the repatriation of Vietnamese refugees. It is more shameful of the free world  to react lightly on this matter. But we cannot blame the people of Hong Kong  for being heartless because they have done more than their share of sheltering  the refugees.  </P> <P> While countries around the world are trying to come up with a solution and  accusing each other at the same time for not doing enough, they have overlooked  the main causes of the "boat people" problem. The first cause is the oppressive  and deceitful policies of the Viet Cong government. This unpopular regime is  the root of the "boat people" tragedy. To end this tragedy is to solve the Viet  Cong problem once and for all.  </P> <P> The "ex-refugees" themselves are the second cause. Former Vietnamese citizens  are returning to visit Vietnam in increasing numbers in spite of laws banning  travels by the government of the nations where they now reside. The U.S.  government, in particular, has looked the other way and allowed these illegal  travels to flourish.  </P> <P> Having returned to Vietnam and not having been persecuted by the Viet Cong  regime, these selfish, law-breaking tourists have falsely shown to the free  world and especially Vietnam's neighboring nations that there is no political  persecution in Vietnam. They have forgotten that the only reason the Viet Cong  let them come back is money. Money not for solving the economic crisis caused  by the regime's ignorance and economic mismanagement, but for clinging to  fading powers.  </P> <P> Sooner or later this unjust regime will be overthrown and replaced by a true  democratic government.  </P> <P> BINH VO  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

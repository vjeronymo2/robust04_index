			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert, May 23 (SNARK)--Arkadi Gukasyan,  Karabakh Foreign Minister, refuted the statements of the Baku  officials that the Karabakh Army destroyed the occupied towns,  villages, communications and historical monuments on the  threshold of the negotiations on the Karabakh conflict's  settlement.    In his interview to SNARK Mr. Gukasyan said such statements  aimed at displaying the Karabakh military forces as barbarous in  the face of the world community.    But the fact is that the Azeris themselves have bombarded  their towns and villages, said the Minister. Only in Agdam  there fell more than 300 shells since it has been under the  control of the Karabakh army.    Mr. Gukasyan consider the Azeris have shelled their own  towns  seeking to destroy the Karabakh military posts and barracks,  which they suppose are placed there.    Now, when the prospects of a long-termed armistice are very  real, the Azeri propaganda is trying to conceal its own sins and  to discredit Karabakh, which only complicates the process of  negotiations, said Arkadi Gukasyan.</p>

"Exchange rates are a reflection of economic fundamentals,  and therefore their stable movements are desirable," the top  government spokesman said at a news conference. But he declined  further comment, saying the matter should be up to the currency  market.    Citing the German mark's weakness vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar,  Takemura said the yen is not necessarily easing but the American  currency is firming.    Since the turn of the year, the dollar has been trading  above  113 yen in world currency markets. It opened Tokyo dealings on  Thursday at 113.33 yen, up 0.21 yen from Wednesday's close.</p>

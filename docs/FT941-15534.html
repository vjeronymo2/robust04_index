			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Which? made no comparison Sir, Mr Dowlen's imaginative interest (Letters, January 11) in greengrocers selling pots and pans rather than fruit and vegetables indicates that he has either not read the Which? report on insurance companies - or he simply missed the point. According to our investigation and letters to the Consumers' Association, some insurance companies are refusing to cover people they consider to be high risk for car or house insurance. The Which? report did not compare whether one type of car would be insured against another at all, as Mr Dowlen claims. We hope that the rest of the insurance industry adopts a more informed attitude. Sue Leggate, editorial director, Which? Magazine, Consumers' Association, 2 Marylebone Road, London NW1 4DF</p>

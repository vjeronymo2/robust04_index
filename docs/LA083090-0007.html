			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUBAN-AMERICANS  </P> <P> In response to "Cubans Look for Some Material Changes in Socialismo," by Murray  Fromson, and "The Futility of Nipping at Castro's Heels," by George Black,  Opinion, Aug. 5:  </P> <P> It's obvious that Fromson and Black are prejudiced against Cuban-Americans.  Fromson describes us as "paranoid"; Black says that we are the "radical right  wing of the Republican Party in south Florida."  </P> <P> Labeling an ethnic group is racist.  </P> <P> Black's irrational hatred is also obvious when he says: "And how can Castro be  expected to talk with exiles who dream openly of turning the island into a  dependency of Dade County and have a violent 30-year history of collusion with  the CIA?" The Cuban-American community is not responsible for the actions of  the CIA. This is an agency of the U.S. government.  </P> <P> The label of "violent" to a community of more than 1 million people is racist  and false. As for the allegation that we want to turn Cuba "into a dependency  of Dade County," as a Cuban, I have to tell you that we only want to see our  country free and democratic.  </P> <P> JUAN FREEMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

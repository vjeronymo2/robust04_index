			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Placing gives Enviromed Pounds 15.8m tag ENVIROMED, a biotechnology and healthcare group, is to float later this month via a placing that will value the company at Pounds 15.8m. The group designs and develops day care surgeries and makes and installs hospital operating theatres as well as applying biotechnology to monitor the environment. Its environmental sensor products are marketed and distributed through a subsidiary of Halma, the safety and environmental control group. Enviromed also tests the interaction between chemical products and the environment. It expects to make a profit of about Pounds 500,000 on sales of Pounds 5m in the year to September 30. Societe Generale is placing 3.73m shares at 110p. About 3.1m, of the 14.4m shares that will be in issue, are being placed on behalf of the company. This will raise Pounds 2.96m after expenses which will be used to consolidate group operations at one site in Milton Keynes and will provide about Pounds 2m of working capital for growth. Existing shareholders are raising about Pounds 680,000 which will be used to repay family and friends who have financed group development to date. Sir Geoffrey Allen, who was research and engineering director at Unilever until 1990 and a non-executive director of Courtaulds, will be non-executive chairman.</p>

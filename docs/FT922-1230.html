			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Rise in French jobless strains benefit system: Employers and unions are counting the costs FRANCE is the latest of several industrialised countries to find that rising joblessness has put its unemployment benefit system under serious financial strain. Employers and unions are haggling over how to prevent the collapse of their unemployment pay scheme, Unedic, the sole source of income for 1.7m jobless people. Two-thirds funded by employers and one third by workers, Unedic is FFr15bn (Pounds 1.52bn) in the red and the deficit is growing by FFr1bn per month. The Patronat employers' organisation which called the emergency talks, says that unless something is done, Unedic will run out of cash from October. The Unedic crisis comes at a time of parallel difficulties in other countries: the US and Sweden are debating how to meet growing demands on their benefit systems; Spanish plans to cut state benefits have provoked protest strikes; and the German system is under considerable strain. France stands out for being the country where the unemployment benefit system has come closest to financial collapse. Unedic was founded on a partnership principle sharing costs between companies and employees. It is not state-funded and, accordingly, Mrs Martine Aubry, the labour minister, has kept out of the talks beyond warning that the state cannot be expected to bail it out. The scheme was devised at a time when French unemployment was around 140,000, a fraction of today's 2.9m. Over the past year, an extra 200,000 people have signed on to Unedic, as companies cut costs. Unedic expects to spend FFr105bn in 1992, up from FFr94bn last year. The partners agreed a rise in contributions last December, but this proved not nearly enough. They face several options. First, the unions want employers' and workers' contributions raised to boost income. The Patronat argues that a further rise in France's already high social security costs is likely to worsen unemployment and increase the strain on Unedic. Mrs Aubry agrees. Employers and unions appear less far apart on other options, where they are arguing details rather than principles. One possibility is for Unedic to make cash flow savings by delaying payments. Recipients of assistance now get their money three days after losing their jobs. The Patronat estimates savings of FFr200m per year for every day of delayed payments. The unions are likely to accept a short delay. Another option is to reduce the amount of benefits per period of contribution. Currently, a worker who has been paying Unedic contributions for a year is entitled to 14 months of benefits, rising to five years of benefit for two years' contributions. When the Unedic benefits run out, the unemployed then claim state social security, already grappling with its own deficit. The Patronat argues that French unemployment entitlements should come closer into line with contributions. The final option, already being applied, is to increase the costs to companies of making redundancies among older workers. Around a quarter of Unedic's budget goes on benefits for those over 55, who have taken the brunt of the recent redundancies.</p>

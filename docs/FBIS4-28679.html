			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press statement issued by a spokesman for the Korean </F> People's Army Panmunjom Mission on 10 Jun --- read by announcer]    [Text] A spokesman for the Korean People's Army [KPA]  Panmunjom mission issued a press statement on 10 June,  denouncing the fact that the U.S. side has issued what is called  a statement by picking a quarrel with us.    A statement by a spokesman for the KPA Panmunjom Mission.    As has already been reported in its Foreign Ministry's  statement on 28 April, the DPRK Government proposed to the U.S.  side to hold negotiations on establishing a new peace  arrangement that can prevent arms buildup and the recurrence of  war on the Korean peninsula and practically guarantee solid  peace. As a practical step for its realization, it has newly  established a KPA mission in Panmunjom by recalling all members  of our side from the Military Armistice Commission [MAC], which  has failed to play its role in stabilizing the situation, as  well as preventing arms buildup on the Korean peninsula.    Such a step by our side is a realistic and timely one taken  to tide over the present situation in which the Korean Armistice  Agreement had been a mere scrap of paper and the MAC remained in  name only due to the unreasonable behavior of the U.S. side.    The U.S. side is aware of our such step. Even it has once  expressed the position that it would make contacts with members  of the KPA Panmunjom mission.    Nevertheless, the U.S. side on 6 June suddenly made a  proposal to hold a meeting of senior secretaries of the MAC,  which no longer exists. Regarding this, our side, reminding the  U.S. side of the fact that all the members of our side had been  recalled from the MAC, notified that an official of the KPA  Panmunjom mission might meet with the side of the U.S. Forces  [migunchuk].    Then, the U.S. side showed up at the conference room alone  and read a prearranged text and committed an act of issuing a  so-called statement indicating that our side's act was a  violation of the Armistice Agreement. Such an act by the U.S.  side was nothing but a ridiculous drama aimed at evading its  responsibility for destroying and systematically obliterating  the Armistice Agreement and the armistice organization.    In fact, the U.S. side, at this time, is neither qualified  nor has the face to talk about the violation of the Armistice  Agreement.    It is the U.S. side that in June 1956 forcibly expelled the  neutral nations inspection teams which had been supervising and  controlling the introduction [panip] and removal [panchul] of  military equipment by staying at appropriate entry ports of  South Korea in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 3, of the  Korean Armistice Agreement. It is also the U.S. side that  unilaterally proclaimed in June 1957 that it would renounce the  implementation of Subparagraph D of Paragraph 13 of the Korean  Armistice Agreement that stipulates the cessation of the  introduction of combat equipment into Korea.    It is the U.S. side that not only completely paralyzed the  armistice organization by appointing a general of the South  Korean Army, who has neither legal justification nor  qualification, as the senior member of its side, but also is now  beefing up the armed forces in South Korea.    It is preposterous for the U.S. side, which had unilaterally  wrecked the major articles of the Armistice Agreement and the  armistice organization, to talk about an agreement between the  two sides.    What are the MAC and the Neutral Nations Supervisory  Commission, which can no longer prevent arms buildup or the  recurrence of war because of the U.S. side's plot, needed for.    Whether or nor it accepts our new proposal will be a  touchstone determining the fundamental question of war or peace  [uriui saeroun cheanul chopsuhanunga anhanunga hanun kossun  chonjaenginya pyonghwanya hanun kunbonmunjelul karunun  sigumsoguro toenda].    It will be a wise behavior of the U.S. side to embark upon  the road of establishing a new peace arrangement that can  prevent the danger of war and definitely guarantee peace and  security, instead of trying to revive the armistice  organization, the function of which has been completely  paralyzed by it.    We will watch the future actions of the U.S. side.</p>

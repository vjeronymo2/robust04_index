European Parliament member and former French army  chief-of-staff Jeannou Lacaze told AFP the delegation would  strive for a lifting of the embargo slapped on Iraq four days  after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990.    General Lacaze, who described his talks with Iraqi officials  as "very positive," said the delegation would "present several  proposals reflecting the Iraqi viewpoint," but gave no details  on the issues to be raised.    He said his team supported an easing of restrictions,  notably  on medical products. The delegation had decided to donate five  tonnes of powdered milk to Iraqi infants, he added.    The French delegation, which leaves Monday for Amman, met  Sunday with Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn Khudayyir and  parliamentary speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih.    A French official said Friday the visit was "a personal  initiative and that it does not commit the French authorities"  or represent a change in policy towards Iraq.    He added that France was still for Iraq's implementation of  United Nations Security Council resolutions on disarmament.    Franco-Iraqi ties were severed at Baghdad's initiative  during  the Gulf crisis to protest France's participation in the  international coalition that ousted Iraq from Kuwait after seven  months of occupation.    Iraqi newspapers reported Friday that Deputy Prime Minister  Tariq 'Aziz had discussed the possibility of restoring  diplomatic ties between Baghdad and Paris with the lawmakers.    The delegation, which arrived Thursday, was led by Senator  Serge Mathieu, head of the Franco-Iraqi Friendship Association.    It also held talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad  Sa'id  al-Sahhaf.</p>

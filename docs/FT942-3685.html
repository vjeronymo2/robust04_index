			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Le Soir - Editorial Brussels and Wallonia must, from now on, live with an extreme right like that which Flanders and France has already suffered for several years. We thought that we would be preserved from this peril. Now it hits us with full force. . . These extremist tendencies cannot be eradicated in a few years. They are the result of an entrenched malaise that demands long-term work from the democratic parties. . . The vote for the extreme right is a cry from people who once believed in the remedies put forward by the Socialist party but who have been disappointed by the scandals that have cast opprobrium on the ruling parties. These voters, often in immigrant neighbourhoods, see 'others' as the scapegoat. The democratic parties must not sit back and comfort themselves simply by denouncing the real danger of the extreme right. They have to act by tackling the roots of the rot.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance Coordinator Gianfranco </F> Fini by Federico Bianchessi in Rome; date not given: "Fini: `A  Long Process'"]    [Text] [National Alliance Coordinator] Gianfranco Fini, the  gardener. Gardenias and geraniums are the hobby of the National  Alliance's secretary, who was roaming the lower house yesterday  with Rudolf Borchardt's book, The Enthusiastic  Gardener, under his arm.    [Bianchessi] The Senate to Forza Italia, the Lower House to  the League. Where are your roses going to bloom, Fini, in the  government?    [Fini] We did not propose any candidates for the  speakerships  because we wanted to make it easy for the majority to reach  agreement right from the outset, not as a give-and-take tactic  for the government. I give my word of honor that we have not  yet even begun to discuss this with [Forza Italia leader]  Berlusconi. Nevertheless, National Alliance will undoubtedly  have a high profile in the government.    [Bianchessi] Rather than smoothing the way for the majority,  one gets the impression that, once again, you wanted to leave  Berlusconi and [League leader] Bossi alone on stage to quarrel  with one another over appointments. Political astuteness?    [Fini] Well, I have been in politics for a long time....    [Bianchessi] But are you satisfied with the outcome?    [Fini] Entirely. Carlo Scognamiglio [Senate Speakership  candidate] has the right degree of authoritativeness to head the  Senate; he comes from the ranks of the Liberals and he has  experience. Irene Pivetti [Lower house speakership candidate]  is first and foremost a woman, and that counters the Right's  reputation for male chauvinism, and she is also the League  exponent closest to the world of Catholicism. Last but not  least, she is young.    [Bianchessi] Is youth a virtue?    [Fini] It has its importance. Moreover, this is Pivetti's  second term, and she is one of the few League deputies to make a  mark during the previous parliamentary term.    [Bianchessi] But do you not find this reversion to the  Cencelli handbook [power-distribution system] irritating?    [Fini] That is not how things stand. The Cencelli handbook  included the Senate and Lower House speakerships in the count  along with the ministries, and this has not happened: There has  been no parceling out of posts.    [Bianchessi] Leaving Cencelli aside, which for ministries  will you be going?    [Fini] The issues closest to our hearts are social and  welfare matters, but we shall not be making it a question of  portfolios. We regard all the ministries as being of equal  value. Labor and Public Works are interesting, but we have no  requests.    [Bianchessi] [Outgoing Senate speaker] Spadolini is still in  the running as speaker of the Senate. What if he wins?    [Fini] I do not think he will have sufficient votes. He has  sunk his own ship by presenting himself as the expression of the  old clubby ways.    [Bianchessi] Will you be celebrating 25 April [Liberation  Day] and 1 May [Labor Day]?    [Fini] Yes. I will celebrate 25 April giving it the meaning  indicated by [President] Scalfaro. The Left would be wrong to  get its own back for 27 March [general election]. It will be  nobody's revenge, not even ours. We have always celebrated 1  May. The trade union negotiation system is not open to  question. What matters is that the settlements should not lay a  burden on the taxpayer, as they have done in the past.    [Bianchessi] If the Left takes to the streets, what will  happen?    [Fini] If it is only the apparat, nothing, but if people  follow it, it will mean that the government is getting something  wrong, and we shall see if we can set it right. We shall  certainly not be setting up a police state. Street  demonstrations will only worry us if they are the sign of  discontent.    [Bianchessi] When will the government be finalized?    [Fini] I have no idea. It will certainly take longer than  the two weeks that some people have mentioned. It is best to  avoid undue haste.</p>

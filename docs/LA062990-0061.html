			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUNN SEES MILITARY ROLE IN AIDING ENVIRONMENT;  </P> <P> PENTAGON: HE SAYS DEFENSE DEPARTMENT ASSETS CAN HELP IN CLIMATE RESEARCH,  POLLUTION CLEANUP AND TOXIC AND RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL.  </P> <P> With defense cutbacks looming and environmental concerns soaring, the chairman  of the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday proposed a new strategic  program that would bring military assets to bear on environmental research and  pollution cleanup.  </P> <P> In a speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) endorsed using the  scientific expertise, supercomputers and other high-technology equipment of the  Defense Department and the Energy Department's nuclear weapons laboratories for  climate research, pollution cleanup, and disposal of radioactive and toxic  wastes.  </P> <P> Nunn, regarded as one of the Senate's most influential members, said that he  and other committee members will push for creation of a new Defense  Environmental Research Council when they meet next month to begin work on the  $295-billion defense authorization bill for 1991.  </P> <P> Referring to the disintegration of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe in  recent months, Nunn said that he is convinced "there is also a new and  different threat to our national security emerging -- the destruction of our  environment. The defense establishment has a clear stake in countering this  growing threat. I believe that one of our key national security objectives must  be to reverse the accelerating pace of environmental destruction around the  globe."  </P> <P> The concept of classifying environmental protection as a national strategic  objective was proposed by Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) in a 1989 speech to  the National Academy of Sciences.  </P> <P> Gore, a member of the Armed Services panel, joined Nunn in outlining ideas for  using defense resources for environmental work as part of a Strategic  Environmental Research Program.  </P> <P> Military aircraft and naval vessels, he said, "could be of invaluable  assistance" in collecting atmospheric and ocean data needed by scientists who  are constructing computer models used to study the greenhouse effect and global  climate change.  </P> <P> Gore said that he has had a series of conversations with officials involved  with the Strategic Defense Initiative about using its supercomputers for  climate modeling work. SDI already has been cut back dramatically from its  original concept as a continental missile defense system.  </P> <P> Nunn said that the first task of the new Defense Environmental Research Council  would be to develop a comprehensive five-year program for research affecting  the national security.  </P> <P> "Our real peace dividend will consist of the research talent that will be made  available as our defense establishment is reduced -- thousands of highly  trained and educated scientists, engineers and technicians," Nunn told the  Senate.  </P> <P> "As our defense requirements change, we have an opportunity to redirect this  tremendous national resource toward the environmental challenges we face in the  1990s: understanding what we are doing to the environment today, cleaning up  the damage we had done in the past and modernizing U.S. industries and  government to establish and maintain technological leadership in this critical  area in the future."  </P> <P> Specifically, Nunn said that he will propose to include in defense legislation  the authorization for the Pentagon and Energy Department to undertake programs  in the fields of data collection and analysis, development of alternative  energy technologies and environmental cleanup technologies.  </P> <P> The two agencies already have responsibility for some of the nation's most  staggering environmental cleanup problems -- radioactive pollution of nuclear  weapons sites belonging to the Energy Department and massive toxic pollution of  military bases about to be closed in the United States and Europe.  </P> <P> "U.S. technologies for more effective identification, treatment, and cleanup of  hazardous wastes will find ready markets in other countries, particularly in  the newly emerging democracies of Eastern Europe and in Third World countries,"  Nunn said.  </P> <P> "Development of these new technologies will also help DOD and DOE meet their  environmental cleanup and treatment obligations more quickly and more  efficiently and at lower cost."  </P></p>

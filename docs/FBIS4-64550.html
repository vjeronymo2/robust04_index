			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, May 2 (A.A.) -- The Turkish Journalists'  Union released a written statement on Monday [2 May] deploring  the police brutality that occurred during Sunday's May Day  demonstrations.    The statement said taking the film cassettes and hindering  television cameramen were direct obstruction of press  organizations.    The statement also said these incidents were not only  attacks  on journalists but at the same time limitations of the right to  receiving news.    Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP) deputy Salman Kaya  was  beaten by police during Sunday's May Day demonstrations.    In Ankara a demonstration by the `democratic platform' which  was organized by Turk-Is, DISK and Hak-Is unions, started  quietly at noon, but failed to end the same way when a group of  demonstrators refused to disperse afterward. Their refusals  triggered a clash during which the demonstrators divided into  two groups. One group started stoning cars. A man who fell  over the Sihhiye bridge during the clash with the police and who  was taken to hospital is not in critical condition.    Officials said a number of people have been detained for  `provocation of the people'.    May Day was celebrated by various rallies in Turkey as `the  day for international unity, solidarity and struggle.'    Economic rather that political slogans were spoken during  the  rallies.    The leaders of the Turkish Confederation of Trade Unions  (Turk-Is), the Confederation of Revolutionary Trade Unions  (DISK) and the Hak-Is confederation united under the democratic  platform in Istanbul.    Together with the three confederations, the syndicates of  public employees and democratic mass organizations also held  rallies in Izmir, Adana, Bursa, and Samsun.</p>

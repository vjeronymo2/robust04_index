			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> CONTAMINANT BLAMED FOR AILMENT  </P> <P> A contaminant found in mussels apparently caused an unusual and irreversible  long-term memory loss in 14 people in Canada in late 1987, scientists reported  last week. A toxin called domoic acid produced by a common seaweed appears to  have destroyed brain cells, leaving 13 of the victims permanently disabled.  </P> <P> While no other cases are believed to have occurred, the incident led to changes  in the way mussels are labeled and tested in Canada and prompted an extensive  testing program for domoic acid in Maine, which produces 85% of mussels in the  United States.  </P> <P> Domoic acid apparently creates hyperactivity in brain cells and "makes the  cells almost commit suicide," said Dr. Neil Cashman, a neurologist and  co-author of one of two studies on the mussel contamination published in the  New England Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> In one study, the toxin caused a variety of symptoms, including vomiting,  abdominal cramps, diarrhea and severe headaches; 25% of those affected suffered  short-term memory losses.  </P> <P> The research could have implications for understanding such devastating brain  disorders as Alzheimer's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease, which some  scientists suspect may involve a toxin, Cashman said.  </P></p>

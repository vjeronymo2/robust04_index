At that time we people's deputies of the  former USSR attended the first congress inspired and full of  hope. It seemed only necessary to be elementarily honest and to  learn how to expose society's diseases uncompromisingly, and our  life would change cardinally for the better. We were surrounded  by a halo of glory and honor on the part of the voters, and this  accounted for the euphoria with which we were overflowing.    Much has changed now. The times have changed, and our  perception of the world has changed. Mere slogans about  democracy are plainly insufficient to refashion life for the  better. We have realized how responsible the post of deputy of  the top organ of representative power nonetheless is. I will  name just one of the lessons which we must not forget: Holding  rallies and parliamentarianism are not one and the same thing.  We are going to the Duma not to ascertain political  predilections and sympathies but to get down to business. It is  important that all deputies -- both each individual deputy and  those united in groups, factions, and blocs -- advance to the  fore not personal ambitions or a desire for power but the  interests of Russia and its many millions of people.    We have no alternative but to seek accord. Our society was  paralyzed by political confrontation. Russia's former  parliament took virtually no steps to overcome political  confrontation. Now, I believe, everyone has realized that  destiny itself and life itself doom us to accord.    I hope that our work in the Duma will help to stabilize both  society and our economy. There is no alternative to reforms.  But a correction clearly must be made to the paths which they  will take. The social thrust of the reforms must be  strengthened. I absolutely agree with the president when he  says that we have tried the people's patience long enough, that  there is a limit to this patience. The reforms must be carried  out in the future not by means of lowering the people's living  standards. The opportunities for this now are broader than at  the time when we were only starting the reforms.    I believe that together with the president and together with  the government the deputies of the top legislative organ of  power will be able to find the solution to key problems in our  life. The "Russia's Choice" bloc is ready for this.    Konstantin Zatulin:    The consolidation of various parliamentary factions depends  on the reinstatement of the center, which is kicked around by  everyone. The center is the blue helmets who are capable of  keeping extreme forces away from confrontation. In the sphere  of creating a coalition the PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and  Accord] intends to orient itself toward groups of independent  deputies representing industrialists, entrepreneurs, and  autonomous entities. In particular, I am authorized by the  party to hold talks with a number of political movements.    Insisting on the reform option which will not cause  productive forces to be smothered, our faction will submit to  the lower chamber a number of new draft laws concerning  regulation in the budget-finance and tax spheres.    In the foreign policy sphere the party advocates Russia's  reorientation away from distant toward nearby foreign parts and  the creation of a confederation within the CIS framework. The  draft of such a treaty is one of the ideas which we will attempt  to get through the State Duma.    As the party of the provinces, we will devote many draft  laws  to regional policy. The powers and rights of the regions must  be clearly outlined.    The PRUA has always supported the Constitution and the  president and has been in favor of political stability and  against all sorts of early elections and impeachments. The  deputies of our faction are inclined to work for the whole term  allocated to them by law and to instill order in the country by  peaceful and legitimate means together with the president.</p>

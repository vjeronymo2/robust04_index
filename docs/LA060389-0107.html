			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO BULL, LAKERS GET PISTONS AGAIN;  </P> <P> AFTER SMOKE CLEARS, 'GANGSTERS' HAVE 103-94 VICTORY IN GAME 6  </P> <P> By evening's end, one Chicago Bull was in a hospital, the Chicago Bull had  re-aggravated a groin injury, the highest-scoring Detroit Piston had strained a  hamstring, two other Pistons had bloody mouths, and one particularly unpopular  Piston was being cussed out by Chicago's coach and called "a thug" and "a  gangster" by the Bulls' owner.  </P> <P> In war, there are casualties.  </P> <P> There also are victors, and spoils. The spoils in this case: Detroit, by virtue  of Friday night's 103-94 disposal of Chicago, wins the Eastern Conference  championship and gets to play the Lakers -- again -- for the National  Basketball Assn. title, beginning Tuesday night in Michigan.  </P> <P> Detroit is going for one in a row. It has never won the NBA title since the  franchise left Ft. Wayne, Ind., in the 1950s.  </P> <P> The Pistons spotted the Bulls a 12-point lead in the first period, then came on  like gangbusters -- or gangsters, in some eyes -- behind Isiah Thomas' 33  points to eliminate Michael Jordan and his gang in the best-of-seven series, 4  games to 2. Jordan went out with 32 points and a limp because of his groin  injury -- his bid to play the Lakers for the championship put on hold for at  least another year.  </P> <P> "It'll be the bad guys in the black hats, us, against the good guys in the  white hats, the Lakers," said Piston center Bill Laimbeer. "This time, let's  hope the bad guys win."  </P> <P> A bad guy is exactly what Laimbeer was being called after Friday's game.  </P> <P> "He's a thug. He's a gangster. He shouldn't be in the league," said Bull owner  Jerry Reinsdorf, not the only Laimbeer-hater in the crowd of 18,676 at Chicago  Stadium that booed the Piston player's every move.  </P> <P> It did not aid Chicago's cause that forward Scottie Pippen, the team's No. 2  scorer during the season, played only 62 seconds. Pippen caught an elbow to the  head -- "another cheap shot by that . . . Laimbeer," Bull Coach Doug Collins  said -- and was taken to a nearby hospital with a possible concussion.  </P> <P> Seldom-used Brad Sellers did an admirable job in Pippen's place, scoring 16  points, but once again, Chicago's offense was left up to Magic Michael.  </P> <P> Jordan this time took 26 shots -- not eight, as he did in Game 5 -- and made  one shot that will be shown on highlight shows for years to come. Did he stop  passing off? Not at all. Jordan also had 13 assists.  </P> <P> However, human being that he is, Jordan also committed eight turnovers, more  than half of Chicago's total. He also made only 5 of 12 free throws, did not  have an offensive rebound and was guilty of five fouls, which kept him from  being as aggressive as he might otherwise have been late in the game.  </P> <P> Collins took him out with 23 -- Jordan's number -- seconds left in the game, to  a thunderous ovation. The coach also used that moment to dash down to Detroit's  bench and give high-fives to everybody on it. Laimbeer was still in the game at  the time, so Collins did not have to be choosy about whose hands he slapped.  </P> <P> Jordan said: "We desperately wanted to go forward, but Detroit is a great team.  All I can say is, it was a great series and a great lesson to build on. We got  to this point, and there is nothing wrong with dreaming, so I'll just spend the  summer dreaming about next year."  </P> <P> Not blaming him a bit for thinking that way was Detroit Coach Chuck Daly, who  said: "The Bulls may be the team of the future. They may be the team to beat in  our division next year."  </P> <P> Intending to pull out all the stops to keep the series alive, Chicago brought  in everybody from Jordan's good friend, filmmaker Spike Lee, to an NBA  semi-legend, The Original (as he bills himself) Dancin' Harry, who long ago  provided timeout entertainment for the Washington Bullets and the New York  Knicks.  </P> <P> What the Bulls really needed was some of the offense that Detroit had been  denying them and everybody else. For a time, they had it going, but in the end,  the Pistons had kept an opponent under 100 points for the 15th straight game.  </P> <P> Chicago overcame the loss of Pippen to take a 16-6 lead, with Jordan supplying  two dunks, a beautiful assist to Horace Grant for a layup and a shot that will  stay in eyewitnesses' minds for a long, long time -- a twisting,  gravity-defying reverse layup over Laimbeer off a steal.  </P> <P> The Bulls went ahead by 26-14, with Sellers doing his part, scoring eight  points.  </P> <P> Jordan, with a dozen already, took a brief rest at this point with 2:36  remaining in the first period.  </P> <P> If only he never had to rest at all.  </P> <P> Detroit went right out and ran off 12 straight points, making the score 26-26,  and Chicago was never the same.  </P> <P> When Craig Hodges hit a three-point jump shot with 8:34 left in the half, it  was Chicago's first basket since the 3:58 mark in the first period. That's how  much the team's offense suffers without Jordan.  </P> <P> Hodges ended up with 15 points, while Horace Grant had 13 points and as many  rebounds. For Detroit, nobody came close to Thomas' 33 points, but Dennis  Rodman did his job on the boards, getting 15 rebounds.  </P> <P> Thomas suffered a pulled hamstring muscle in his right leg during the second  quarter, so neither he nor Jordan was at his best during the second half. And  still they easily led their teams in scoring.  </P> <P> Joe Dumars and John Salley of the Pistons each ended up with bloody mouths  during the course of a very physical, almost violent game, and James Edwards  was struck by a crumpled cup thrown by a fan. No one from Detroit was seriously  hurt.  </P> <P> Thomas had 21 of his points in the second half, giving Detroit an outside  attack to go with the dominating inside work of Rodman and Edwards. Daly moved  Thomas to No. 2 guard in the second half, something he does periodically, and  let Isiah shoot rather than quarterback the offense.  </P> <P> Detroit led by a basket at halftime, 49-47. In the third period, after Jordan  missed two free throws, Laimbeer threw in a rare hook shot -- sort of a ground  hook -- to give Detroit its largest lead to that moment, 62-57. By the end of  the third period, the Pistons had widened their lead to nine, even with only  one basket in the last 5 1/2 minutes.  </P> <P> The Bulls had a run left in them. Jordan completed a four-point play, two  lay-ups around a missed free throw, and John Paxson followed with a three-point  basket and a corner jumper for two. With 8:44 left, Chicago suddenly was within  striking distance at 81-79, and the NBA's loudest arena was rocking.  </P> <P> With a chance to tie, Jordan had his pocket picked by Dumars. The crowd settled  down, and one-time hometown favorite Thomas rattled off six straight points for  an 88-80 lead.  </P> <P> After that, Chicago never got closer than six.  </P> <P> Excited about another shot at a pro championship to go along with the national  college title he won at Indiana, Thomas said: "When we lost that last game of  the NBA Finals to the Lakers, people said: 'Don't worry, next year you're going  to have the best record in the NBA, you're going to get to the finals and  you're going to win.' Well, we've done two out of three.  </P> <P> Notes  </P> <P> Bill Laimbeer pleaded innocent to charges of causing Scottie Pippen's head  injury, claiming Pippen's teammate, Horace Grant, hit him. Replays were  inconclusive to some, but not to Chicago Coach Doug Collins, who said:  "Laimbeer hit him right in the face with his left elbow, and Scottie ends up in  the hospital."  </P> <P> </P> <P> EASTERN CONFERENCE SERIES AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> BULLS vs. PISTONS  </P> <P> Pistons win best-of-seven, 4-2  </P> <P> RESULTS  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.78IN:3.43IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Game 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Bulls 94, Pistons 88  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Game 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pistons 100, Bulls 91  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Game 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bulls 99, Pistons 97  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Game 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pistons 86, Bulls 80  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Game 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pistons 94, Bulls 85  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Game 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pistons 103, Bulls 94  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

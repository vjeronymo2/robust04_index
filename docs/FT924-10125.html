			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Letter: Decision on piggy-back freight ridiculous Sir, It is ridiculous that there will be no upgrading of rail lines to take 'ro-ro' piggy-back lorries and freight from tho continent on British tracks ('Rail switch for channel ruled out', October 28). This association was instrumental some years ago in putting forward evidence to the government that it would be preferable to have a twin-bored tunnel link with a sufficient bore to take such freight transport - and that this would be better than the proposed BR 'mouse-hole' with a single tunnel passenger train facility. This was in October 1980. Now, after 12 years, a main raison d'etre of the tunnel has been taken away at a stoke. There are reasons why lorry drivers may prefer ferries - mainly because it provides a rest period on the tachograph. The knock-on effect, however, will be to restrict benefits of the tunnel being expanded to areas of the country away from the metropolis and from the south-east; particularly economic help to the north-east, north-west, Tyneside, etc. Apart from unnecessary delays in decisions and their implementation, this news must be the last straw for many businesses which will now either move to north-east France or not move to our development areas, as the case may be. There are other reasons for transfer of freight to rail transport - particularly environmental ones such as preservation of fossil fuels. The tunnel links in all forms have been subject to short termism. We feel that the authorities should now look ahead over 20 and 30 years and more and look to a proper infrastructure. All this at a time when within two months the first train will be run through the tunnel. Alan R Titchener, chairman, Channel Tunnel Association, 44 Westbourne Terrace, Hyde Park, London W2 3UH</p>

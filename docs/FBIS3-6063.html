			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korean companies  are gearing up for serious advancement into China in time for  President Kim Yong-sam's state visit to Beijing later in the  month. Trade officials and industry sources said Saturday that  major Korean companies have high hopes as they prepare to jump  at wider Chinese investment opportunities created by the  momentum of the Seoul- Beijing summit.    Samsung Electronics Co. and Goldstar Telecommunications Co.  have their sights set on Beijing's three-phase communications  modernization plan, which is likely to adopt the Korean  telecommunications exchange system, time division exchange, for  its central communications network, and are poised to expand  production at their joint-venture factories in China.    Further encouragement comes from a recent visit to Beijing  by  a team of experts, who were assured by Chinese officials that  serious consideration will be given to the TDX system for use in  the communications network in the central mainland.    One trade official who went with the team said China is  disillusioned by the high cost of products from Japan's NEC and  France's Alcatel, which are currently used in the network. As a  result, they have tentatively decided to add the Korean system  due to its price and quality, and are currently conducting a  final screening, the official said.    Seoul and Beijing are also near agreement on holding a  large-  scale exhibition of Korean electronic products, sponsored by the  Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry and Electronics Industry  Association of Korea (EIAK), in China sometime before the summer.    Hyundai Group Chairman Chong Se-yong and Hyundai Motor Co.'s  vice president of exports, Paek Hyo-hi, visited China for four  days from Feb. 27 and discussed exports of completed cars and  possible joint ventures with senior Chinese officials.    Daewoo Group Chairman Kim U-chung, who already visited China  last fall, left on an American tour on Friday with automobile  executives to sound out opportunities there and will stop in  China for the same reason on their way home.    Beijing is currently talking about allowing Korean auto  exports in return for Korea purchasing Chinese auto parts: One  Korean automaker is reportedly near a deal on joint manufacture  of auto parts.    China, which had stuck to a policy of allowing just eight  foreign automakers access to its market to protect its own  industry, recently became more flexible by permitting local  joint-venture firms to acquire two or more foreign partners.  Industry experts predict Beijing may allow more foreign firms to  make inroads, citing recent plans to expand production of cars  to 2 million units and of commercial vehicles to 1 million by  2000.    Korean business leaders are expected to accompany President  Kim on his visit to China or go there beforehand to promote  their businesses.</p>

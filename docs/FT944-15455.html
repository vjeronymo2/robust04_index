			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Indosat ADSs set for launch in New York Trading is set to begin today in New York in the American Depositary Shares (ADSs) issued by Indosat, Indonesia's international telecommunications company, marking the launch of one of Asia's biggest international equity issues. The Indonesian government - which will reduce its stake by some 25 per cent  -has raised Dollars 721.13m through an issue of 22.5m ADSs and has an option to sell a further 3.4m. It is expected to raise a further Dollars 330m through an issue of new shares to local investors. Overall, the scale of the deal looks likely to surpass other large Asian issues such as Pakistan Telecommunications (Dollars 917.4m) and Morgan Stanley Asia Pacific (Dollars 802.5m), according to figures produced by IFR Securities in London. The ADSs (each representing 10 shares) were priced yesterday at Dollars 32.05 each. Roughly half have been directed to US investors. The new Indosat shares will be listed on the Jakarta and Surabaya bourses later this week. Merrill Lynch and the local brokerage house Danareksa Securities are joint global co-ordinators of the issue. Co-managers of the deal in the US are JP Morgan, Salomon Brothers, Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Smith Barney. Reportedly oversubscribed in both New York and Jakarta, it should raise the international image of the local market and boost the government's stalled plans to privatise a batch of state companies. The possible privatisation of more than 200 state firms, many of them poorly-managed and inefficient, has been mooted for some time. Garuda Indonesia, the airline, PT Telkom, the domestic telecommunications firm, and PLN, an electricity company, are the favourites to follow Indosat. The issue also confirms a trend for companies in emerging markets to raise capital through issues of either ADSs, American Depositary Receipts or Global Depositary Receipts, tradeable certificates which represent underlying shares. Earlier this month, a Citibank study showed that issuers from the emerging markets accounted for 61 per cent of ADR programmes launched in the first nine months of the year, compared with only 11 per cent in all of 1990. The total number of ADR shares traded on the US stock exchanges hit an all-time high of 5.2bn in the period, a 21 per cent increase on the year. The dollar volume of ADRs traded amounted to Dollars 184bn, a rise of 32 per cent. A total of 184 companies from 40 countries launched new ADR or GDR programmes, up from 96 companies in the comparable months of 1993. Depositary receipts were also used in 17 privatisations. Indian companies were the most active in the ADR market, with 29 issuing new depository receipt programmes in the period, followed by Hong Kong with 17 companies, Brazil and Mexico with 16, and South Africa with 10. India's Shiram Industrial Enterprises raised Dollars 40m through an issue of GDRs on Friday. Also last week, Banco Ganadero, one of Colombia's largest commercial banks, confirmed that it, too, intended to issue ADRs in New York.</p>

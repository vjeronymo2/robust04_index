Mr Nilek Sulaiman, also an executive member of the Islamic  Committee of Thailand, said the prime minister must not be  confused by developments in the area, which are "politically  motivated and have political implications."    Mr Nilek said he met Mr Chuan by chance on board a plane on  Friday while on his way to Pattani.    The Prime Minister was at the start of a three-day official  visit to the southern most provinces.    Mr Nilek said he told Mr Chuan that tension and confusion in  the area have been intentionally created.    Mr Nilek ruled out reports that the bombing in Hat Yai and  bombs found on the railway track in Songkhla's Chana District  are the work of separatists.    "They want to stir up more tension in the area, which no  doubt would have direct impact on the Government," he said.    "More tension will be created in the near future." Mr Nilek,  whose sister is married to Deputy Interior Minister Den Tomina,  said he thought tension in the area had been created by a group  of people who want to oust Minister Den.    "He has so many enemies in the area and as long as he  remains  in his post, tension will be whipped up to discredit him and the  interior minister," he said.    Mr Nilek said the Pattani municipality of which he is a  member has been put on full alert.    "We can't know when they will create more trouble in the  municipal area," he said.    The Muslim deputy rector of Islamic Studies at Prince of  Songkhla University (Pattani campus), Mr Worawit Balu shared Mr  Nilek's view.    Mr Worawit said he tended to believe that political motives  lay behind the area's tensions in the past month.    "I'm quite sure more trouble will be created in the area,"  he  said.    Many Muslim officials in the region do not believe that  separatists are directly responsible for tension created in Hat  Yai, he said.    "It may be part of a plot to destabilise the Government.  Without doubt, tension in the area is aimed at discrediting Gen  Chawalit and Mr Den," he said.    Fourth Army commander Lt-Gen Kitti Rattanachaya yesterday  briefed Prime Minister Chuan Likphai for 30 minutes on  counter-terrorism activities in the southernmost provinces.  Lt-Gen Kitti spoke of the peace talks with key members of  separatist movements in recent months. A source said Lt-Gen  Kitti complained of the red tape which prevents local officials  from taking prompt action when trouble occurs. The efficiency  of intelligence gathering among government officials was  discussed.    Mr Chuan later told reporters in Pattani that only a small  group of people are involved in attempts to create trouble in  the area. He said the situation in the southernmost region is  not as bad as the press makes out. He has urged local people to  help the Government tackle the area's problems.    Despite the peace talks, anti-terrorist operations will have  to continue, he said.</p>

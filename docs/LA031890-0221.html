			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'DR. CALIGARI' IS OUT OF CABINET AND ON ITS WAY;  </P> <P> LOW-BUDGET, LIMITED-RELEASE FILM MADE IN A FULLERTON WAREHOUSE IS ESTABLISHING  A LOYAL FOLLOWING ALONG THE CULT-MOVIE CIRCUIT  </P> <P> In the world of big-budget Hollywood movies, success or failure usually is  defined in millions of dollars, and pronounced within days of release.  </P> <P> "The Hunt for Red October," the Cold War submarine thriller, filled seats in  more than 1,600 theaters and did upwards of $37 million in business during its  first two weeks. Conversely, the cop flick "The Last of the Finest" sold less  than $600,000 in tickets its first weekend, and quickly was branded a bomb.  </P> <P> Cult movies reside at the opposite end of the film spectrum. Usually made for  less than it costs to advertise an average Hollywood release, these films  depend on word of mouth, limited art-house release and, in the best scenario,  extended runs as midnight movies. Success depends on attracting a loyal core of  fans, and builds slowly.  </P> <P> It is at this level of the film biz that the Fullerton-based makers of "Dr.  Caligari" believe they have found their niche. Having garnered some glowing  reviews at festivals and in a limited release in Orange County theaters (The  Times' Kevin Thomas called it "the work of true visionaries"), the movie has  started open-ended runs as a midnight movie in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Phoenix  and now Corona del Mar, as it gradually makes its way to art houses across the  country.  </P> <P> "Word of mouth is great. I would say it's reached the stage of being a cult  film already," says the movie's producer, Joseph Robertson, maker of such '60s  B-movie camp classics as "The Slime People" and "The Crawling Hand."  </P> <P> "Dr. Caligari," completed last year, is a kinky updating of the silent German  classic "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari." It stars Madeleine Reynal, a top  Argentine model in her American film debut, as the granddaughter of the asylum  owner in the 1919 original. The new Dr. Caligari runs the asylum now and  conducts bizarre hormonal experiments on her patients, who range from a  nymphomaniac housewife to a mass murderer who gets a sexual charge out of  electroshock therapy.  </P> <P> The movie is the brainchild of Gerald Steiner, an Anaheim Hills resident who  owns a Fullerton video duplication business. Deciding to make a movie of his  own, he financed the project out of his own pocket to the tune of $750,000, and  converted an empty warehouse at his business, next to the Fullerton Airport,  into a sound stage where the entire movie was filmed.  </P> <P> "I'm a horror buff," Steiner explains. "I've always loved the old films." One  of those old films was "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," and Steiner says he got  to wondering: "What if they made it today, with color?"  </P> <P> After connecting with Robertson, he approached Stephen Sayadian with an offer  to write and direct. Sayadian made his mark in cult-movie circles with "Cafe  Flesh," which mixed scenes of hard-core pornography with an offbeat premise  about a post-nuclear society where most of the survivors cannot enjoy intimacy  without becoming violently ill. So instead, they gather at the Cafe Flesh to  watch staged sex acts by the few remaining "sex-positives."  </P> <P> Made in 1982 for $90,000, the film foreshadowed the then-nascent AIDS epidemic  and was a big hit on the midnight-movie circuit, playing at the Nuart in Los  Angeles for three years. Sayadian, a Los Angeles resident, admits some surprise  at the Orange County connections in the evolution of his new film: "When I  think of Orange County," he says, "I think of the Meese Commission."  </P> <P> Sayadian says he was particularly taken aback by Steiner's decision to test  market the movie in Orange County malls. "To me, that was like handing out  vintage Motown records at a Klan rally," the director says with a laugh. "When  this movie doesn't work for an audience, it's painful to watch." He recalls  some screenings for studio executives that were met with stony silence: "It was  so quiet you could hear a career drop."  </P> <P> Steiner explains that he figured malls would help bolster the word-of-mouth  campaign -- and he claims that the movie didn't do badly. But its natural home,  he admits, is elsewhere: "It is a specialty film. It has to go to art houses.  It's not really a mall film."  </P> <P> Indeed, while the mall crowd has been conditioned by the splatter-flick likes  of the "Fridaythe 13th" and "Halloween" series, "Dr. Caligari" is a different  beast altogether. Its minimal sets, highly stylized dialogue and acting,  eccentric sexual fixations and overall outre approach probably would put off  hormone-driven teens in search of a good old-fashioned bloodletting. And the  older "Driving Miss Daisy" crowd would likely be totally baffled if not  offended.  </P> <P> When Sayadian got the "Dr. Caligari" assignment, he brought along Jerry Stahl,  his writing partner from "Cafe Flesh" and the stage play "Jackie Charge!," a  tale of voyeurism. Sayadian "does the pictures and I put the words to them,"  Stahl says. "It's like working with Salvador Dali."  </P> <P> Stahl's often obtuse dialogue helps give the film a clipped, angular rhythm  that matches its minimalist visual style. "When you have all interior (shots),  the only place you can go outside is in the dialogue," Stahl says.  </P> <P> Working on such projects as "Cafe Flesh" and "Dr. Caligari" gives Stahl an  opportunity to break with his "day job" -- television work on such shows as  "Moonlighting" (where he was a staff writer),"thirtysomething" and "ALF."  </P> <P> "It's a real chance to be schizophrenic, if you're writing 'Moonlighting' with  one hand and 'Dr. Caligari' with the other," says Stahl. "As far as I'm  concerned, writing 'Moonlighting' is surreal. Writing 'Caligari' is normal."  </P> <P> The "Caligari" script required intricate and fast-paced staging, triggered by  verbal cues. Rather than smooth, naturalistic acting, it called for an  exaggerated style -- and Sayadian came up with a series of distinct, rigid  poses. To save money (Sayadian had $300,000 of the total budget to actually  make the movie) the writer and director drew up detailed storyboards of each  scene before going into production.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Sayadian says, Steiner and Robertson were kept largely in the dark.  "I don't know if they knew exactly what they were getting until they got to the  set," he says. But Steiner "never stopped writing the checks, so I figured we  were still in business."  </P> <P> "We gave them carte blanche to do what they wanted to do," Steiner agrees.  </P> <P> While Sayadian selected his crew largely from past projects -- Mitchell Froom,  who did the music for "Cafe Flesh," repeated his role for "Dr. Caligari" -- the  casting was done through open auditions. Then there was a month of intense  rehearsal before the cameras started to roll. The film was shot in another  month -- August, 1988 -- entirely within Steiner's warehouse-turned-sound  stage.  </P> <P> After eight months of editing and other post-production tasks, the film was  ready for release but, Steiner admits, he wasn't sure how to go about that. One  studio expressed interest in the film, he says, but finally he decided to  distribute it himself.  </P> <P> While a wide release may have gained more money in a shorter time, opening the  film slowly in specialty houses has its advantages. Advertising costs are  minimized, and a limited number of prints is needed -- only a dozen copies of  "Dr. Caligari" exist.  </P> <P> The movie -- which landed a 13-page spread in the underground magazine Film  Threat -- already has been shown in a number of western cities and is set for  openings soon in San Francisco, Providence, R.I., Minneapolis, Chicago and  Washington. Scheduling a New York run is next on Steiner's list of priorities.  </P> <P> Steiner says he is close to completing a video distribution deal, with release  scheduled for Halloween. He says the film's limited theater release will help  recoup the film's costs; the video sale will account for any profits.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the film makers are moving on to new, separate projects.  </P> <P> "I think 'Caligari' is just scratching the surface," Sayadian says of what he  and Stahl want to do. They already have written their next movie and are  working to arrange the financing. The script is based loosely on their play,  "Jackie Charge!" Sayadian is hoping for a bigger budget this time around. "It  was fun doing this picture," he said of "Dr. Caligari," "but films of this low  budget, I don't think I have the stamina to do this anymore."  </P> <P> Steiner, who quotes even the few bad reviews of "Dr. Caligari" with glee, has  enjoyed his first taste of film making and is ready for his next one. He and  Robertson, too, have written a new film together and are nearing a deal to  finance it, with Robertson directing.  </P> <P> The project, to be done on Steiner's sound stage and on location in Anaheim, is  called "Auntie Lee's Meat Pies." Its dark humor is more than suggested by the  title. "I could never be part of a film that's lukewarm," says Steiner, whose  office is hung with props from his first film foray. "It has to be striking."  </P> <P>  "Dr. Caligari" is shown Saturdays at midnight at the Port Theater, 2905 E.  Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. Information: (714) 673-6260.  </P> <P> </P></p>

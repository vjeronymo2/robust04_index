Acting Prime Minister Yukhym  Zvyahilskyy will confirm a draft of the commission's work.    The commission is to examine the deficit of the new budget  until the end of the year (this budget is now being elaborated  by the Ministry of Finance), discuss the possibility of reducing  the expenditure part of the budget, and to submit proposals on  reducing the budget deficit in accordance with IMF demands,  which are also being adjusted.

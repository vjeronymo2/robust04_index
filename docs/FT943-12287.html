			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Voting against the means, not the end Sir, The European Parliament's rejection of the draft legislation to liberalise voice telephony was no 'Euro folly' (Editorial, July 21) at all. My colleagues and I were not voting against the opening up of this market, but against the way the Council had sent us a text which left subsequent amending legislation in the hands of technical committees meeting in secret. The Commission can now bring forward a virtually identical proposal which will meet this point of principle, and can be dealt with at speed without compromising the liberalisation timetable. Governments cannot run away from the logic of the Maastricht treaty. This, as the FT has explained on a number of occasions, changed the balance of power between the Council and parliament. Tom Spencer, chairman, Conservatives in the European parliament, Strasbourg From Mr Mel Read MEP. Sir, Your leader 'Euro Follies' gives a less than adequate analysis of the complex issues surrounding the European parliament's rejection of the Council's position on voice telephony liberalisation. The Parliament has made it absolutely clear that on the substance of voice telephony liberalisation there is broad agreement between Council, Commission and Parliament. On points of disagreement, considerable progress was made towards acceptable compromises during the conciliation procedure. On the dreaded question of comitology (the process by which European legislation is implemented and reviewed - the rough equivalent of statutory instruments in the UK), there was no compromise. Parliament is demanding equivalence of treatment: where Council has a second bite at legislation, so should the European Parliament. What the Council wants is exclusive control over implementing measures stemming from the directive. This principle is relevant to dozens of legislative proposals, and an urgent intra-institutional agreement is needed to settle the matter. As the rapporteur on voice telephony, I proposed an ad hoc solution on comitology and voice telephony, but Council would not budge. Your leader says: 'With luck, the telecommunications package can be reassembled soon'. I made it clear in the European Parliament that we will do all in our power to facilitate this. It is not the European Parliament setting its face against economic progress, as you allege, but the Council of Ministers' refusal to accept the democratic principles of the Maastricht treaty signed by the same Council.

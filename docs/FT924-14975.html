			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bell Canada joins GTE in services venture GTE and Bell Canada, respectively the biggest local telephone companies in the US and Canada, are to co-operate in selling their billing and other information services to telephone utilities in other countries. The two groups see lucrative opportunities in improving the billing systems of recently-privatised telephone companies whose customers have up to now received only rudimentary accounts with little information on individual calls. Mr Don Hayes, president of GTE Data Services, a subsidiary, said yesterday that government-owned utilities 'haven't been motivated to be responsive to the customer'. GTE Data Services already has contracts in the Netherlands, Denmark and Puerto Rico. Mr Hayes said the company was also in discussions with British Telecom, an Italian phone company, and the Mexican telephone utility. Bell, a subsidiary of BCE Inc of Montreal, has been looking for ways to forge links with foreign telecommunications companies as the domestic market becomes more competitive. Mr Hayes said GTE and Bell Canada saw 'a very nice fit' between their areas of expertise. GTE, which also provides information processing services to the US health care and insurance industries, has concentrated on billing, while Bell's strength is in order entry systems and in the recording and execution of service changes required by individual customers, known as 'provisioning'. Bell said the addition of the GTE system would allow it to tailor telephone bills not only to individual phone numbers, as is now the case, but also to itemise spending according to a business user's branches, geographical region or service.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Amr Nasif in Cairo] </F>   [Excerpt] An Arab political source in Cairo, who has asked  to remain anonymous, has told AL-SAFIR that Saudi Arabia and  Kuwait have recruited a large number of UN inspectors in Iraq to  work for their intelligence services.    The source said they have attracted key figures of the UN  Special Commission supervising the removal of Iraq's mass  destruction weapons.    The source emphasized that UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali has asked his top aides to conduct a secret inquiry  into alleged cooperation between UN experts and "Gulf security  agencies" and whether the experts have really informed those  agencies of the correct details of their inspections and of the  nature of Iraq's military and armament programs.    Early this month, the source said, Saudi Arabia paid  "checks"  worth $71 million to the UN Special Commission under the pretext  of covering the expenses of the UN inspection teams in Iraq.    The source added that Saudi Arabia will offer another $50  million for the same purpose.    The source said that Saudi Arabia exploited the  international  organization's bad finances and its failure to provide the  necessary cash to cover the wages and expenses of inspectors to  realize its political objectives in a way that makes the experts  feel indebted to Saudi Arabia. This is in addition to personal  bribes.    The source said that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait recruited  several experts to work on their behalf. The experts, the  source added, are reporting to Saudi and Kuwaiti intelligence on  their mission.    The source added: The recruitment was made in coordination  with the CIA's regional station in the Gulf. This station  enjoys high-level relations with Saudi and Kuwaiti intelligence  through Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN Special Commission, who is  also a CIA officer. [passage omitted]</p>

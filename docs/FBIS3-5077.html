			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sojaburo Okamatsu, deputy minister at the </F> Ministry of International Trade and Industry, by Tokyo Economic  News Department reporter Satoshi Tachibanadaka; place and date  not given]    [Text] [Tachibanadaka] The United States says Japanese  bureaucracy stands in the way of concluding the Japan-U.S.  framework talks. Do you agree?    [Okamatsu] I believe the United States has criticized the  Japanese bureaucracy for rejecting its demand that numerical  targets be set. Criticism of bureaucrats has grown in Japan  since 1993 and I think, perhaps, the United States mistakenly  believed that if it criticized bureaucrats in Japan it would be  able to crush opposition to the setting of numerical targets.    It appears there are some Americans in the government and in  the business community who see numerical targets and the  liberalization of beef and orange imports in the same light.  The liberalization of beef and orange imports has made it  possible for Japanese consumers to buy these products at lower  prices because there were import limits on them. The United  States says "Japanese consumers want to buy American-made cars,  but Japanese bureaucrats prevent them from buying those cars."  Japanese duty on imported cars is zero. American automakers  have failed to supply Japan with cars that Japanese consumers  like, and the United States does not understand this.  <H5>  Without Forgetting Bitter Experience </H5>   [Tachibanadaka] Japan went along with the United States on  its trade demands when former President Bush visited Japan with  American business leaders in 1992, but Japan has refused to meet  the Clinton administration's trade demands. How should the  United States see this?    [Okamatsu] Japan was careful in choosing the wording of its  voluntary plans to purchase American-made auto parts in 1992, to  prevent them from becoming numerical targets. It also announced  they were a "statement by the Japanese business community."    Nonetheless, the United States has pressed Japan to  implement  the plans after distortedly interpreting them as a "promise by  the Japanese Government." Japan will not repeat the same bitter  experience. The United States has persistently maintained that  "if numerical targets are not set, Japan will do nothing," while  at the same time hinting at "sanctions" against Japan. While  the U.S. takes such a stand against Japan no trade agreements  can be reached between the two.    [Tachibanadaka] Japan and the United States have failed to  break the deadlock at their framework talks on the issue of  numerical targets.    [Okamatsu] While the United States demanded Japan accept  numerical targets, Japan rejected the U.S. demand. The United  States has since said that no results have come from numerous  trade treaties concluded between the two countries, and has  repeated its demand that Japan set specific numerical targets  and work to meet them.    The U.S. position is that although setting any percentage  figure could lead to managed trade, the maintenance of past  import growth rates will not. Japan, though, does not agree.  <H5>  U.S. Urged To Understand Japan's Political Situation </H5>   [Tachibanadaka] Why has the United States stuck to its  demand  for numerical targets?    [Okamatsu] Perhaps because its more than $50 billion trade  deficit with Japan continues to grow. The Hosokawa government  is now promoting economic reforms, the centerpiece of which is  deregulation. It seems the United States has failed to fully  understand the changes taking place in Japan. New officials in  the U.S. Administration largely share the view of revisionists  and it appears that they have yet to purge themselves of the  revisionist view.    [Tachibanadaka] What does the United States expect of  Japan's  macroeconomic policy?    [Okamatsu] The United States has reportedly complained about  Japan's macroeconomic policy, but I had hoped it would have  understood a little better the political situation that forced  the Japanese Government to cut taxes for one year.    The United States praised the national welfare tax announced  by Prime Minister Hosokawa. The government later decided to cut  taxes by 6 trillion yen for one year, triggering complaints in  the United States. If the government had decided, however, to  cut taxes by 6 trillion yen for three years running, this  measure would have met a favorable response in the United States.  <H5>  Premature To Review Framework Talks </H5>   [Tachibanadaka] Japan and the United States agreed last  summer to hold the Japan-U.S. framework talks. Is there any  possibility the framework talks will be reviewed?    [Okamatsu] I believe it is premature to review the framework  talks. Since leaders of the two countries agreed to hold  framework talks, it has become unavoidable that Japan and the  United States would disagree. But Japan has no intention of  giving up the framework talks because of a dispute with the  United States over numerical targets. If the United States  sticks to its demand for numerical targets, the two countries  will be unable to settle the framework talks. Although we do  not know if the United States will agree to negotiate with Japan  at the framework talks after putting aside the issue of  numerical targets, we intend to look for areas of agreement.    [Tachibanadaka] How can the deadlock be broken?    [Okamatsu] We plan to look at how we can build a  relationship of trust with the United States. Japan is  proposing that the two countries promote industrial cooperation  in the automobile sector. Even if the United States refuses to  agree to the proposal, Japan intends to work to break the  deadlock in the framework talks by doing what it has promised to  do.</p>

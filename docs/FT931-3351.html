			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (24): A new strategy for small businesses ENTERPRISE AND HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT: LOCAL CAPACITY BUILDING by R J Bennett and A McCoshan Paul Chapman Publishing Pounds 39.95, 352 pages THE CONTRIBUTION of small businesses to the UK economy has been given increasing recognition over the past two decades. What has been only belatedly appreciated is the need for professional support for these businesses at the local level. Meeting the needs of the small firms which make up the bulk of the business population has important implications for policies towards enterprise, education and training, the authors of this ambitious study argue. Strong, locally-based networks of support will have a significant impact on the country's ability to generate wealth, they suggest. Yet local initiatives must form part of a common strategy. The reasons for Britain's relative economic failure have been exhaustively catalogued by previous commentators. So Bennett, professor of geography at the London School of Economics, and McCoshan, who works in local government, merely sketch in the economic background before moving on to a study of the agencies and programmes which exist. If Britain is to maintain and improve its standard of living it must not only do better than it has done in the past, they warn - it must do as well as or better than the best. In terms of business support this means creating a network at least as efficient as the best of the continental European chambers of commerce. The authors acknowledge that the business community will benefit from progress which has been made in the areas of both education and training but point to further improvements which are needed. In education, a better balance must still be found between vocational and academic needs. Improvements in the training system, meanwhile, will have to be maintained for a decade or more if there is to be a fundamental change in the attitudes of employers, employees, parents and trainers. But it is in the field of enterprise that most still needs to be done, the authors argue. At present business is served by a confusing welter of support organisations, including chambers of commerce, enterprise agencies and Training and Enterprise Councils (in Scotland, Local Enterprise Companies). The chambers' strength lies in the fact that they are membership organisations, but they lack resources. The enterprise agencies have done a good job helping start-ups but are for the most part narrowly specialised and also short of funds. The TECs have more money but frequently lack credibility because they were a government invention. The organisations which currently exist to back business locally are fragmented and lacking in resources. There are frequent overlaps, both geographical and in the programmes they run. In other respects, though, there are gaps in the provision of services. Rural areas are poorly provided for and while the very small business is well served the larger small company - employing between five and 100 people  -does not get as much help as it requires. Bennett and McCoshan believe there is a greater role for government as champion. Self-help alone is unlikely to fill the gaps in the support framework and there are signs that the limits of voluntary networks have been reached. Government should provide the core funding to the agencies which help small business and should help to simplify the present complexity. As it happens, the government is already taking action. It announced last autumn the launch of a network of business advice centres or 'one-stop shops,' intended to bring together existing support agencies. The first 15 or so are due to start operating next month The authors welcome this initiative but point to several weaknesses. The one-stop shops have been provided with just short-term government funding and since they are not membership organisations, face the same problem of legitimacy as the TECs. The TECs, which are leading the one-stop shop initiative, are subject to excessive official scrutiny of their spending programmes and are still top-heavy with civil servants. To become truly effective, the TECs/one-stop shops need to be given further powers and independence, Bennett and McCoshan say. They suggest that this could be achieved by the introduction of a compulsory registration system for businesses with a fee charged to all but the smallest firms. This would provide the one-stop shops with an income and also generate a wealth of information about business which has been lacking. The TECs/one-stop shops might even be given a stake in the proceeds of the uniform business rate. This would re-enfranchise business rate payers as well as providing an income. These steps would be radical but a stronger local partnership organisation is the only way of meeting the challenges of the next century, the authors argue. This is a well-informed and timely book which deserves a wide readership. At two-thirds the length and with a lighter, less academic style it might have reached out to more of the participants in the process of change its authors advocate.</p>

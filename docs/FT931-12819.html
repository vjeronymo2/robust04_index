			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Reduced interest charge lifts Dale 9% LOWER interest charges helped Dale Electric International, the power and lighting group, lift interim pre-tax profits by 9 per cent to Pounds 544,000. Mr Iain Dale, chairman, said the Yorkshire-based company had made progress on reducing debt during the first half. Gearing had fallen from 110 per cent at the year-end to 100 per cent, and was expected to fall substantially following the sale of four overseas businesses due for completion in April. The sale of five businesses in Nigeria and France were part of Dale's effort to refocus on power generation. Interest charges benefited from the steady decline in UK base rates, falling from Pounds 962,000 to Pounds 918,000. Operating profits for the six months to November 1 were static at Pounds 1.46m on sales 29 per cent ahead at Pounds 30.9m. That was partly because of the inflated value of sterling before September. Dale's export prices had been on average about 20 per cent higher than the previous year, said Mr Dale. That resulted in a sharp decline in the group's order book at the half-way stage from Pounds 31m to Pounds 22m. 'We are only now starting to rebuild the order book again,' Mr Dale said. However, he added: 'With the hole created by the over-valued pound in the first half, we will be short of some business in the second half.' Next year would be more encouraging, Mr Dale said. After an 'awful first half' the aerospace ground power division was beginning to show signs of life. Mr Dale said the restructuring begun in October had resulted in the loss of 12 per cent of the 680-strong workforce. The interim dividend is being maintained at 2p - last year's total was 5.1p  -while earnings improved from 2.79p to 3.02p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Embassy is upset that police released  information that a missing diplomat had fled to the United  States, police sources said.    "A Russian Embassy official rang up the police department  today to communicate its displeasure that police supplied  information about third secretary Igor Makeev's flight to the  United States,'' he said.    "This created a negative image of Russia," the source quoted  the embassy official as saying.    The source said police responsible for finding Makeev also  took Metropolitan Police Commissioner Chaisit Kanchanakit to  task for releasing the unconfirmed information.    "This is sensitive information, and in addition is still  unconfirmed," the source said.    Makeev, 39, left his apartment in Bangkok's Soi Saladaeng  with a laptop computer believed to contain secret embassy  information on March 22.    Deputy police chief Pol. Gen. Phong-amat Amattayakun  yesterday said the Russian Embassy had written to banking  institutions and business concerns asking they cancel Makeev's  credit card from March 25.    Phong-amat deplored the embassy's action: "The Russian  Embassy is withholding information that we need, making it hard  for us to locate Makeev."    Suspension of the credit card "makes it impossible for us to  find out where Makeev makes payments using his card."</p>

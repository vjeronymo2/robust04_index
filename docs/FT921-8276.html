			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Petrocon denies pursuit by Maxwell administrators PETROCON, the group making a hostile bid for James Wilkes, the Midlands engineering company, yesterday reacted angrily to the suggestion in a Sunday newspaper that administrators to company owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell had initiated legal action against Mr Colin Robinson, Petrocon's chairman. Petrocon's share price fell 11 per cent to 40p following the Independent on Sunday's story, reducing the value of its all share bid by 10 per cent to Pounds 31.8m. A solicitor for Mr Robinson said he was considering legal action against the newspaper. He said that the litigation against Mr Robinson and others had been started by Mr Maxwell in March 1990 and assumed by the administrators, Arthur Andersen, when Hollis Industries went into administration last December. Suggestions that administrators had launched the litigation, rather than inherited it, were potentially defamatory. They suggested that Mr Robinson faced a new and more serious case than the one begun by Mr Maxwell two years ago. The case revolves around the sale in 1988 of a license held by Locktronics, a subsidiary of Hollis Industries - which Mr Robinson and others controlled  -to Beverly, a company Mr Robinson also controlled. Mr Robinson said the 1988 sale had been included in board minutes but he had made a technical violation of the Companies Act by not having a resolution approving the sale voted on by shareholders. The row over Mr Maxwell's two year old case against Mr Robinson overshadowed the posting of Petrocon's offer document to Wilkes shareholders. Petrocon argues that it has the management team to sort out Wilkes's financial problems without having to resort to fire sales to deal with its high level of debt. Wilkes had gearing of 108 per cent at December 1990. Mr Robinson also believes the closure of Wilkes's country house head office and its helicopter company plus the removal of the current board will save Pounds 1.5m in expenses each year.</p>

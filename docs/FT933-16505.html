			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Pakistan's army gives Sharif an ultimatum PAKISTAN'S army, which has ruled the country for much of its 45-year history, has told Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to resolve his deadlock with the country's president or call fresh elections, Reuter reports from Islamabad. One minister said army chief Gen Abdul Waheed had given Mr Sharif two weeks in which to end the crisis or call elections. Diplomats and political analysts said that if Mr Sharif did not comply, Gen Waheed could ask the president to dissolve parliament. Gen Waheed has shuttled between Mr Sharif and President Ishaq Khan five times in a week to try to persuade the other two members of the powerful troika that rules Pakistan to end their confrontation, which has paralysed the administration for months. Gen Waheed's latest meeting with the prime minister followed a conference of corps commanders at army headquarters in Rawalpindi.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROUBLED TEENS  </P> <P> Although I agree with much of Richard Polanco's (D-Los Angeles) remarks ("Bad  Medicine for 'Troubled Teens,' " Op-Ed Page, May 7) regarding forced private  hospitalization for "troubled teen-agers," I believe he misses the real mark.  </P> <P> Troubled teen-agers come from troubled parents. Unless we "hospitalize" the  troubled parents we will never solve the problems of the troubled teen-ager.  But how can we ever expect such actions from the legal system when it  represents some of the worst troubled parents?  </P> <P> BENNY WASSERMAN  </P> <P> La Palma  </P></p>

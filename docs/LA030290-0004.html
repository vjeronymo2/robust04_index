			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDFLY SPRAYING  </P> <P> Thank you for your excellent editorial "The Governor and the Medfly" (Feb. 22).  However, as you suggest, it is probably too late for the governor to be able to  allay any fears over aerial spraying.  </P> <P> Moreover, it should not surprise our public officials if their words are met  with incredulity. After all, they have been lying to us regularly for so many  years that we scarely believe anything they say. And even I am capable of  reading the health warnings on the malathion spray I use for my own plants.  </P> <P> It will take more than one honest politician to set our country right. It will  take nothing less than an American-style perestroika, one which will sweep  every liar from office, to restore public confidence in our government. I can  hardly wait.  </P> <P> JOHN D. POYNTER  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

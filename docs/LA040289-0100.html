			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 INDIAN LEADERS WILL RETURN FOR NICARAGUA VOTE  </P> <P> Two leaders of ethnic Indian groups opposed to Nicaragua's Sandinista regime  will return to Managua from Honduras to take part in elections scheduled for  February, 1990, a spokesman for the group said Saturday.  </P> <P> Steadman Fagoth and Brooklyn Rivera head the Yatama Indian group, made up of  Miskitos, Sumos and Ramas who fought the Sandinista government along  Nicaragua's Caribbean coast.  </P> <P> The spokesman, Kendy Medina, said by telephone the two will return to Managua  in August. He said the war against the Sandinistas had failed and that the  Contras should take part in the political process in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> He said Fagoth and Rivera will lead a political group representing the  Caribbean coast area but will join a national coalition to contest the  Sandinistas in the vote.  </P> <P> "We want to form a common front, strong enough to defeat the Sandinistas in  elections," Medina said.  </P> <P> About 9,000 Nicaraguan Indians are presently in exile in Honduras, awaiting a  U.N. plan to repatriate them.  </P></p>

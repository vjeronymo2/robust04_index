			<p>BFN     [Text] Sevastopol, 20 May -- Leonid Hrach, head of the  Communist Party of Crimea, commenting on today's decision by the  Crimean Supreme Council to renew the operation of the autonomy's  Constitution in its 1992 form, called on the parliamentarians to  stop and not to let the decision, which was adopted, provoke a  military conflict in the Crimea. "If blood is spilled in the  Crimea, we will not be able to talk about conducting any kind of  reforms," he emphasized. Mr. Hrach addressed a proposal to  Yuriy Meshkov, the president of the autonomy, to begin talks and  consultations with Ukraine's leadership.    Incidentally, 69 out of 73 deputies (there are 98 deputies  in  Crimea's Supreme Council) voted to renew the Constitution of  Crimea in its 1992 form. The group of Crimean Tatars (14  persons) refused to take part in the voting.    The statement by the Crimean Supreme Council's press center,  which was disseminated today, says that the inclusion of this  issue on the session's agenda had been done "at the will of the  people of Crimea."</p>

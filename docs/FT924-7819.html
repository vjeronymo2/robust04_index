			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: Betty Carter - Jazz IT'S Not About The Melody, according to the title of jazz singer Betty Carter's new album on Verve (513870). Listening to Ms Carter's vocal technique, most people would surely agree that it is her distorting treatment of the melody which picks her out from the crowd. It was not always so. Carter came to notice in the 1950s with Lionel Hampton and later with Ray Charles in the the 1960s. Hampton nicknamed her Betty Bebop for her fragmented scatting style which, however, was considered too strong for a wider audience. Her own enterprise and arranging skills saw her through the leaner times which followed with the formation of Bet-Car Records and live work with classy piano trios. But tastes change and sticking to the formula of attentive accompaniment and an almost instrumental vocal delivery has paid off. Appearing at Ronnie's in London for two weeks, followed by a week at the Birmingham club, Betty Bebop is on song, if not entirely on the prescribed melody. A well meshed trio is in attendance, dominated by the large figure and vigorous runs of pianist Cyrus Chestnut and driven by Clarence Penn (drums) with Christopher Thomas (upright bass). What a difference attentive accompaniment makes to a singer. With hooded eyes and a velvet timbre which can resonate like a tenor sax, Carter slipped through a selection of originals and Cole Porter standards, her rubbery vocalese forcing melody and lyric out of shape. She walked the front of the stand and made pleading eye contact during emotional numbers like 'You're Mine, You'; she stretched and kneaded the otherwise familiar melody of 'Every Time We Say Goodbye", leaving the lyric wholly intact. This matured but mannered vocal style may yet be too rich for some mainstreamers, but set against the overdone facial contortions of new singers such as Rachelle Ferrell or the blandness of Sade say, it is a joyful thing. Ronnie Scott's London club until November 21</p>

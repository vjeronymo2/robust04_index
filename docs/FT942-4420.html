			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Swedish insurer turns in 15% rise Trygg-Hansa SPP, the Swedish insurer, recorded a SKr600m (Dollars 75.9m) operating profit in the first four months of the year, up 15 per cent from a year ago. The performance continues the 1993 recovery, when the group achieved a SKr1.72bn operating profit after a SKr5.2bn deficit a year earlier. However, the group sustained heavy losses after investing in Gota AB, two collapsed credit insurers, and Home Holdings, the US insurance group. Perstorp, the Swedish speciality chemicals and plastics group, advanced 83 per cent in the eight months to April 1994. Profits after financial items rose to SKr385m (Dollars 48.7m) from SKr210m in the same period a year ago, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm. The company said it expected full-year profits to reach SKr500m-SKr550m, an improvement of about 70 per cent over its last September-August fiscal year. The large profits increase was achieved despite a comparatively modest 18 per cent rise in sales to SKr6.76bn, compared with SKr5.7bn. Perstorp said it had been hit by increases in raw material prices which it had been unable to pass on. Nevertheless, rationalisation during the previous year had yielded higher margins which, combined with penetration of new markets and the introduction of products, had boosted profits. Perstorp said its three biggest divisions - surface materials, components and speciality chemicals - had achieved the biggest sales and earnings increases in the company. It added that its Biotec division had opened sales offices in the Ukraine and China where the big agriculture industries offered attractive markets.</p>

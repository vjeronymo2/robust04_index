			<p>BFN     [Text] The five-day study session for leading cadres of  Tianjin Municipal discipline inspection and supervision organs  successfully ended yesterday. Gao Dezhan travelled to the Party  School of the municipal party committee to visit all attendees  yesterday afternoon. He hoped that cadres of the municipal  discipline inspection and supervision organs across the  municipality will conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  submit themselves to and serve the overall situation of the  whole party's work, further strengthen party style and  administrative honesty, and make new contributions to reform,  opening up, and modernization.    While holding cordial talks with attendees of the study  session for discipline inspection and supervision organs, Gao  Dezhan first extended regards to comrades of the discipline  inspection and supervision departments at all levels across the  municipality. He said: In 1993, with the common efforts of the  broad masses of cadres of the discipline inspection and  supervision departments and all sectors, effective results were  achieved in Tianjin's discipline inspection and supervision  work. This contributed greatly to Tianjin's reform, opening up,  and economic construction and to the strengthening of party  style and administrative honesty. The second plenary session of  the sixth municipal party committee has worked out plans for  carrying out all fields of work of the municipality this year.  We must strengthen party style and administrative honesty,  deeply conduct anticorruption struggle, and further deepen and  develop this struggle on the basis of the expected results we  made. We must submit our discipline inspection and supervision  work to and serve the overall situation of the whole party's  work of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding  opening up, promoting development and maintaining stability,  further attend to party style and administrative honesty, and  create good conditions for promoting reform, opening up,  development, and stability in Tianjin.    Gao Dezhan said: It is good to hold this study session for  discipline inspection and supervision cadres. The attendees  have conscientiously studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and laid an  ideological foundation for this year's discipline inspection and  supervision work across the municipality. This work has been  grasped early and successfully, and the fundamental points have  been grasped. It is hoped that comrades on the discipline  inspection and supervision front will work hard to create a new  situation in discipline inspection and supervision work at their  own work posts, realistically strengthen self-development, and  make unceasing efforts to achieve new progress.    This study session organized 130 discipline inspection and  supervision leading cadres to devote a period of time to further  studying the guidelines of Volume No.3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, the party Central Committee's  "decision on several issues concerning the establishment of the  socialist market economic structure," and Comrade Jiang Zemin's  speech at the Spring Festival tea party for nonparty personages  on 4 February, and the guidelines of the second enlarged plenary  session of the sixth municipal party committee and of the  municipal economic work conference, use these guidelines to arm  their mind, unify thinking, and lay a good ideological  foundation for pushing this year's discipline inspection and  supervision work to a new height.    Liu Jinfeng, member of the standing committee of the  municipal party committee and secretary of the municipal  discipline inspection commission, gave a summing-up speech at  the end of yesterday's study session. He said: This study  session has some characteristics: The attendees have paid great  attention to this session, given prominence to the major points  of study, created a good study atmosphere, paid attention to  establishing ties with the reality, and achieved great results  in the study. In referring to the next step of study of the  discipline inspection and supervision departments, he said: This  study session is the beginning of theoretical study for the  discipline inspection and supervision departments at all levels.  Discipline inspection and supervision departments at all levels  should regard theoretical study as a major matter and grasp it  conscientiously. We must persist in studying theories with  unremitting efforts. Leading cadres should take the lead in  this aspect, pay attention to combining theory with practice and  with all fields of work, promote discipline inspection work  through study, raise this work to a new level, and make new  contributions to promoting reform, opening up, development, and  stability.</p>

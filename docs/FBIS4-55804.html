			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 21 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces  agreed Saturday to pull 150 armed policemen out of the eastern  town of Gorazde, a month after the expiry of a NATO deadline  ordering the complete withdrawal of Serb forces from the town.  Under the agreement, due to come into force at 6:00 p.m. (1600  GMT) Sunday, the armed Serbs will pull back from a UN-declared  three kilometre (two mile) exclusion zone around central  Gorazde, UNPROFOR spokesman Major Rob Annink said here.    "The Bosnian Serb forces have pledged to redeploy all armed  personnel outside the exclusion zone," Annink said. The Serbs  also agreed to "cease all hostilities around Gorazde" and  guaranteed UNPROFOR "complete freedom of movement" in the zone,  he said. UNPROFOR said 150 armed Serbs had remained in Gorazde  after the expiry of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  ultimatum at the end of April. Serb sources said the men had  remained as "policemen" to protect the town's Serb population.  Moslem sources said they were soldiers who had changed uniform.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At least seven policemen and soldiers were wounded  in Basilan last Saturday [22 January] in a series of firefights  with suspected members of the Moro National Liberation Front  (MNLF), the most serious breach of the interim cease fire agreed  on by the government and the rebel group.    Although there had been earlier reports of encounters since  the truce pact was forged, all of them were attributed either to  communist rebels, "Lost commands" of the MNLF or the Moro  Islamic Liberation Front. But belated reports reaching Camp  Aguinaldo yesterday named the MNLF, with whom the government is  holding peace talks to end two decades of secessionist  rebellion, as the group involved in the firefights.    The reports said the first firefight occurred around  lunchtime Saturday when troopers from the 11th Marine Battalion  Landing Team (MBLT), the 468th police Mobile Force Company and  the police Special Action Force were ambushed by about 50  alleged MNLF rebels.    The soldiers and policemen were reportedly "moving towards  Sitio [village district] Sapa Langay, Barangay [village]  Cabengbeng, Sumisip," in Basilan when they were waylaid by the  band.    A two-hour-long firefight ensued, resulting in the wounding  of Pfc. (private first class) Felix Catedrilla. The attackers  reportedly suffered an "undetermined" number of casualties.    The reports said the alleged rebels were led by Commanders  Barahama Salih and Indasil Sahili.    Four hours later, the same group of soldiers, now already in  Sitio Sapa Langay, were "harassed" by an "undetermined number of  MNLF (rebels) for about ten minutes."    Wounded in the attack was Police Inspector Deven Seriales  who  was evacuated via helicopter to the Armed Forces Southern  Command hospital.    A little over an hour later, the government troopers, still  occupying the same sitio, were again attacked, this time by  "heavily armed MNLF (rebels)" for about 15 minutes.    Wounded were Marine Corporal Leonardo Cuevas, PO (petty  officer) 3 Mutalib Hamnsiraji, PO3 Abdul Hadjack Radhi, PO3  Jesus Ramirez, and PO2 Eustaquio Ang. They were evacuated via  patrol boat to the Isabela Hospital two hours after the  gunbattle.    The 7 November interim cease fire agreement states that "the  forces of both parties shall remain in their respective places  and refrain from any provocative actions or any acts of  hostilities."    Reporters tried but failed to contact MNLF spokesman Zain  Jati, government chief negotiator Manuel Yan, and Southern  Command officials.    Brigadier General Guillermo Ruiz, commander of the Marines  in  the South and co-chairman of joint cease fire committee, has  said that "minor violations" on both sides had been reported,  and that these would be addressed by the committee.    Under the proposed guidelines and ground rules of the cease  fire agreement, the government and the MNLF will "mutually  identify the location and unit commanders of their respective  forces," which both sides agree will not be operated against by  their forces.    The mere movement of government troops into MNLF held areas  will constitute a violation. But the proposed guidelines have  yet to be signed by either Yan or MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari,  although the second draft has already been prepared and signed  by Ruiz and MNLF co-chairman, Major General Abdul Sahrin.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Environment ideas sought from City FINANCIAL institutions must find new ways to finance environmental improvements for industry and householders, Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, told a City audience last night. He also made clear that the introduction of a carbon tax on fossil fuels, which contribute to global warming, was still some way off. He said the environmental performance of British business and industry was 'disappointing' and that the UK was losing the battle for export markets for environmental equipment. Mr Heseltine urged an initiative to form a consortium, or two competing consortia, to provide a comprehensive package of energy-efficient products and services, finance and advice. The consortia might consist of financial institutions, energy utilities and equipment suppliers, offering a 'one-stop quality controlled package' to householders. The Department of the Environment said last night this would have an advantage over competing advice given when householders wish to install insulation or other energy-saving systems. It would encourage the public to be more conscious of energy conservation. Mr Heseltine called for innovative leasing arrangements to help small companies which find it difficult to meet the capital cost of pollution-control technology needed to comply with tougher 'green' regulations. There was room for a new package, put together by financial institutions and the suppliers of environmental technology, to help overcome these barriers to environmental standards and market growth. Mr Heseltine had in mind a system similar to the one under which aircraft are leased to airlines over a long period. On a carbon or energy tax he said the government was not opposed in principle to measures being proposed by the European Commission provided they were adopted by the UK's competitors. 'But there is still a great deal of work to be done before we know exactly what form such a tax might take,' he said.</p>

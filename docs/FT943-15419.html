			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: No future in analogue channel Sir, The most significant implication of the BBC white paper, 'The future of the BBC', is the recognition that the corporation has a central role to play in the introduction of digital terrestrial television broadcasting in 1997, ushering in the multi-media age. The white paper estimates that full digital use of the spectrum would generate a Pounds 5bn per annum business to 'UK plc'. Measures to unlock this value need to be expedited. Clearly this means that the white paper is inconsistent with the licensing of many further analogue television services, in particular Channel 5. Proposals for an analogue version of Channel 5 should be dropped. Dermot Nolan, Convergent Decisions Group, 1 The Mews, Putney Common, London SW15 1HL</p>

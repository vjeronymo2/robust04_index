			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 15 Jun (EFE) --  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria today refrained from  commenting on yesterday's speech by Cuban President Fidel Castro  during the opening session of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit  of heads of state and government. Gaviria stressed that here  "the people say what they feel."    Asked about Castro's speech during which he requested  respect  for his country's self-determination, the president, host of the  Fourth Ibero-American Summit being held in Cartagena de Indias,  said that "those are Fidel Castro's speeches, and I believe the  whole world has heard them."    "He said nothing new except for saying that he agrees with  the Miami meeting and hoped it will go well," the Colombian  president said when referring to the Cuban president's mention  of the Summit of the Americas to be held in December in the  United States. "I do not want to assess anyone's statements.  Not Castro's or anyone else's. I believe that what had to  happen happened at the meeting and that is that the talks were  forthright and everyone said what they felt."    Gaviria today invited the Central American (Costa Rica, El  Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama) presidents  to a working breakfast during which they discussed Colombia and  Venezuela's commercial integration with Central America. "It  was a meeting during which we studied the possibilities of  making progress on an agreement that is already being discussed  and which we hope will conclude shortly," the Colombian  president said.    President Gaviria added that his government asked "the  presidents, and their ministers, to try to ensure that political  will prevailed in the conclusion of the agreement which we hope  will be reached shortly." Gaviria said that they also talked  "about something that is already under way and that is,  Colombia's participation in the Central American Integration  Bank," as well as the importance of absorbing the various  processes of integration into one.    Gaviria, who met and lunched with the participants at the  Ibero-American Summit behind closed doors at the Convention  Center in Cartagena de Indias said that the presidents had made  "much progress" in their discussions. Gaviria said: "We have  made progress on topics that have to do with the position of  each country in light of the problems of Ibero-America. We are  going to make more progress with the agenda, and we are pleased  with the way the meeting is going."</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Polish students marched or rallied in at least six cities on the anniversary of  free speech riots in 1968. The demonstrations were remarkable for their  peacefulness and for the restraint shown by police. Brief disturbances broke  out at the end of marches in Wroclaw and Warsaw, but only members of radical  fringe groups were involved, and they were shrugged off as provocateurs by  fellow demonstrators. Contributing to the mood was the announcement Tuesday  that Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and other opposition negotiators have won  government agreement to legalize the Independent Students Assn. after a  seven-year ban. In Warsaw, police helped direct traffic around two separate  marches held with official permission.  </P></p>

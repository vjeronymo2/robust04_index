			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Birkby reveals Finlan's losses Birkby, which reversed into Finlan Group in August, yesterday announced that Finlan's pre-tax losses for the year to March 31 were Pounds 4.55m. Losses previously were Pounds 15.7m. Mr Michael Woodhead, the chairman, said that as the results covered the last full year of Finlan they bore little relation to the current group. He pointed out that Birkby was a profitable rental group and achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 600,000 for the year to July 31. It specialises in the provision of managed rental workspace mainly in converted mills along the M62 corridor, commercial vehicle hire and instalment credit. Finlan's turnover fell from Pounds 49.3m to Pounds 19.5m and the pre-tax result was after exceptional debits of Pounds 685,000 (Pounds 2.68m). Losses per share were 1.3p (7.1p).</p>

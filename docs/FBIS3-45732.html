			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342 7160)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- In light  of China's national conditions and the basic requirements of the  socialist market economic system, Vice President Rong Yiren said  today that China will continue to adopt the method of advancing  step by step and gradual transition for the next stage of  reform. While introducing any reform measure, we will fully  take into account the bearing capacity of the state and the  people and ensure that economic development and social stability  will be promoted through reform.    Rong Yiren gave an account of China's reform and opening up  while meeting today with a Romanian Government delegation led by  Mircea Cosea, minister of state and chairman of the Council for  Economy, Coordination, Strategy, and Reforms of Romania. Rong  stated that development is the target while reform is the motive  force and political and social stability serve as the guarantee.  We hope to seek development through reform. When the economy  has developed, the people's living standards will improve and  political and social stability will be maintained, which in turn  will promote reform. This is the experience China has gained  through reform over the past decade or so.    Another important factor of China's economic development  over  the past decade is opening up, Rong explained. In a large  country like China, we must rely on our own efforts. We cannot  rely on foreign countries for food and clothing. Nevertheless,  we must implement an open policy and develop economic exchanges  with other countries, which will be conducive to China's  economic development.    Sharing the same objective of China's, Cosea said, Romania  is  also undergoing economic development. Romania wants to develop  economic exchanges and cooperation with China and hopes that  China will offer assistance and support for its reform.    Cosea and his entourage came to China at the invitation of  China's State Commission for Restructuring the Economy. They  will leave for Guangdong, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai tomorrow to  observe and explore the achievements and experience of China's  reform and opening up.</p>

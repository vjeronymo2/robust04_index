			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Letter: Positive return would come from provision of child care Sir, Edward Balls ('The Double Bind for Working Parents', January 17) dismisses as 'wild claims' the findings of our analysis of Treasury savings from public investment in childcare contained in our report 'Child care in a Modern Welfare System'. Our study examined increased tax revenue from a growth in women's employment and higher levels of women's pay (through a reduction of the career break penalty) and from increased employment in childcare. It also identified substantial benefit savings through reduction of child and family poverty. We conclude that while the cost of providing childcare is high, it would provide a positive return in the medium and long term. We are somewhat confused by Mr Balls's arguments. We envisage an expansion of the female labour force by 1.5 to 17.3 per cent, and not as Mr Balls asserts of 33 to 150 per cent. Strangely, he seems to assume that the provision of childcare would result 'in a large influx of unskilled labour and that public subsidies for childcare would inevitably favour skilled women'. We have recommended a structure of services which would provide access to all families but which would facilitate an upgrading of skills and a reduction in skill wastage. It is widely recognised that the economy suffers from supply side constraints including skill shortages making it inflation-prone. We argue that the provision of childcare services would increase the skilled as well as the unskilled labour supply enabling the economy to be run at a higher level and still meet its inflation target. Our report details the strong social arguments which themselves make the case for the public funding of childcare. These include, in addition to those mentioned in the article, a substantial reduction in the unacceptably high levels of child poverty in this country. However, although we stress that our study is exploratory, we do believe that it demonstrates that the arguments for public funding of childcare are not just social but indeed economic. We would, however, agree with Mr Balls that it is important to ensure that public subsidies of childcare are in a form which is not distributionally regressive as with for example, tax allowances. Bronwen Cohen, Neil Fraser, Institute for Public Policy Research, 30-32 Southampton Street, London WC2 The article should have read: 'The report argues that the extra tax revenue, generated in part by an estimated 33-150 per cent rise in full-time equivalent employment of women with children under five, would more than pay for the scheme.'</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Government rejects Canary Wharf purchase THE GOVERNMENT has rejected the proposal from Canary Wharf's administrators that it should buy a building at the east London development to be used by civil servants, according to a financier with a close knowledge of the project. The Canary Wharf administrators, who have been running the project since it ran into financial difficulties in the spring, had been pinning their hopes for a rescue of the project on this sale proposal. They are nonetheless encouraged by a decision taken on Tuesday by the government to involve itself in a set of complex negotiations that may allow the building of the proposed extension of London Underground's Jubilee Line into the east of the capital. The decision is understood to have been taken at a meeting on Tuesday of a special cabinet sub-committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Wakeham, the Lord privy seal. The government is continuing its negotiations with the administrators on renting space for between 2,000 and 5,000 officials at Canary Wharf. It is insisting that rent should be at the market price, including a rent-free period for the first five years. The Treasury also remains adamant that the Jubilee Line will be built only if it receives a cast-iron assurance that the Pounds 170m private-sector contribution to the project - at today's prices  - will be made. The government has also told the administrators that it would be interested to receive a detailed proposal from them proving that if the government takes space at Canary Wharf, the private-sector contribution to the Jubilee Line would be made. That is the nearest the Government has come to admitting that its decision on whether to move to Canary Wharf could be influenced by whether the private-sector contribution to the Jubilee Line project is made. Canary Wharf's best chance of staying out of liquidation requires selling it to a new owner, likely to be a consortium of investors. Potential investors  -which include the UK conglomerate Hanson, the original developer of Canary Wharf Mr Paul Reichmann and the US media tycoon Mr Larry Tisch - have made clear that they will make a formal bid only if the government guarantees to take space at Canary Wharf and if the Jubilee Line is built. So those bidders must now present a complex proposal to the government, showing how they can guarantee that the Pounds 170m is paid for the Jubilee Line if the officials move to Canary Wharf. There is an effective deadline of mid September.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RADIO SHOW TROIKA RAISES MASSACHUSETTS PUBLIC DEBATE TO BOILING POINT;  </P> <P> POLITICS: SELF-STYLED 'GOVERNORS' ARE PRAISED AS VOICE OF THE PEOPLE OR  DENOUNCED AS 'HACKS, HOKUM AND HYPERBOLE.'  </P> <P> At the stroke of 4 on the studio clock, the theme music from "The Mod Squad" is  played, then a gavel bangs and the barbs start flying.  </P> <P> State officials and administrators are denounced as "greedy, shameless hacks."  The state's latest tax-hike plan is branded as "illegitimate." Gov. Michael S.  Dukakis becomes "Pee Wee," Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy "The Lady from the Wax  Museum" and rotund House Speaker George Keverian "The Democrat from Gino's  Pizza," while Boston Globe writers are tweaked as "bow-tied bum-kissers."  </P> <P> It is Tuesday afternoon at WRKO Radio, and for the next two hours, nothing and  nobody in Massachusett's liberal Democratic Establishment is safe from attack  by the self-styled "governors of the commonwealth" -- acerbic talk-show host  Jerry Williams, muckraking Boston Herald columnist Howie Carr and fervent  anti-tax crusader Barbara Anderson.  </P> <P> Williams, Carr and Anderson have formed an on-the-air troika that has raised  political debate in this state to new heights -- or taken it to new depths,  depending on your view.  </P> <P> Supporters praise them as the voice of the people, defenders of the underdog,  champions of the average taxpayers. Critics -- particularly those most often on  the receiving end of their barbs -- denounce them as an example of "trash"  radio at its worst. "Two hours of hacks, hokum and hyperbole," wrote a Boston  Globe reporter recently.  </P> <P> What is certain is that the three are no garden-variety radio gabfesters.  Massachusetts is in the throes of a monumental budget crisis that has forced  the governor and the Democratic leadership in the Massachusetts Statehouse to  cover. Last week Standard &amp; Poors made the state's credit rating the lowest  in the country, citing a poor economy and a "paralyzed budgetary process."  </P> <P> Into the leadership vacuum has stepped this unlikely trio, who by most accounts  are driving the debate on how the state should deal with its problems.  </P> <P> Their tirades against bloated state payrolls, high taxes, ballooning budget  deficits, official corruption, cronyism and incompetence in government have  become the stuff of almost daily political discourse in the Bay State.  </P> <P> "They represent a frustration that we all feel in the commonwealth," said Alan  Macdonald, executive director of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable, an  association of chief executive officers from the state's major corporations.  "There's a majority (of Massachusetts residents) that's totally frustrated by  the state's lack of ability to get spending in line with normal revenue  growth."  </P> <P> Their clout is often awesome. On several occasions during budget debates last  summer, for example, Statehouse switchboards were overloaded for hours with  calls generated by their over-the-air suggestions to voters to express their  displeasure to their representatives.  </P> <P> The radio triumvirate's opposition also was instrumental in the scuttling last  month of a $1.2-billion tax package that called for a 40% sales tax hike, a 50%  increase on capital gains and a near doubling of the 11-cents-a-gallon gasoline  tax. The plan was looked on by many House leaders as their last best hope to  combat a state budget deficit that has swollen to more than $825 million.  </P> <P> "They are devastating," said four-term Rep. Eleanor Myerson, a Democrat from  the fashionable Boston suburb of Brookline. "They get on the radio and scream  and holler and give out the names and phone numbers of legislators and say:  'Never vote for them again.' We can tell they're effective. The callers all say  the same thing."  </P> <P> Also effective are their ceaseless assaults -- usually spearheaded by Carr, the  Herald columnist -- on the "hacks" in state government: people on the public  payroll who are related by blood or marriage and purportedly gained their  lucrative jobs only because of their family or political connections.  </P> <P> "If you are in this building," Boston Democratic Rep. Mark Roosevelt told a  Globe reporter recently, referring to the Statehouse, "you hear more and more  people talking about getting out. . . . The long-term effect is a nastiness and  vindictiveness that poisons the body politic."  </P> <P> Dukakis, who has become increasingly embattled since his failed presidential  campaign last year and as the state's fiscal ills have worsened, has publicly  alluded to the troika's pervasive influence. Last July, for example, in a  lengthy speech defending his legacy as the state's longest-serving chief  executive, he spoke of the "talkmasters and columnists" whom he claimed had  given politics and public service a bad name.  </P> <P> "As long as things were going well," he said, referring to the vaunted economic  prosperity the state enjoyed during much of this decade, "they were kind of  gnats." But now, he added: "We've got to take them on."  </P> <P> Even before the three joined together as a radio team, they were each  individually forces to be reckoned with on the Massachusetts political scene.  </P> <P> Williams, 66, the "dean" of talk-show radio hosts in Boston, who  </P> <P> was a passionate on-the-air advocate for civil rights and American withdrawal  from Vietnam in the '60s and '70s, was widely credited for the repeal three  years ago of Massachusett's automobile seat-belt law.  </P> <P> Carr, 37, whose column appears thrice weekly in the Herald, a tabloid owned by  Australian-born press lord Rupert Murdoch, had become the scourge of state  government with his "hack family of the week" reports -- the ones that now  often are the source of his on-the-air attacks.  </P> <P> Anderson, 46, executive director of the 10,000-member Citizens For Limited  Taxation, engineered passage in 1980 of a measure known as Proposition 2 1/2  that, among other things, put stiff caps on increases in property taxes, the  major source of local government funding. She often is referred to as the  "Howard Jarvis of Massachusetts," an allusion to the architect of California's  1970s tax-slashing Proposition 13.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, their voices had become among the most strident in  opposition to tax increases and other Democratic-proposed measures to combat  the state's mounting deficit.  </P> <P> "This state has been so dominated by Democratic politics for the past 25 years  that it's somewhat like what was going on in Eastern Europe," said Williams,  whose afternoon talk show airs Monday through Friday from 2 to 6 p.m.  </P> <P> Then in April, Ron Doyle, a columnist for the Middlesex News in Framingham,  wrote a column in which he described them as "an unlikely tag-team of political  bomb throwers" who had emerged as "the all-powerful, unholy trinity of state  politics." He questioned rhetorically who had appointed them as governors.  </P> <P> That was all it took for Williams to call Carr and Anderson and propose that  the three of them go on the air as the "governors" for two hours a week as part  of his regular show.  </P> <P> "I do feel like I've created a Frankenstein monster," Doyle recently lamented.  "They're out of control, and I don't see any end in sight."  </P> <P> After the opening theme is played each Tuesday, Williams bangs a homemade gavel  that was sent to the group as a gift and calls the session to order. He then  asks for reports from the other two.  </P> <P> Carr usually announces his "hack family of the week," although in the most  recent show, his chief topic was a report in his newspaper about the two state  revenue department employees who had been suspended in connection with an audit  of his income taxes.  </P> <P> Carr, a constant critic of Dukakis, charged that the audit was politically  motivated. The audit, which was launched earlier this year, has been  discontinued.  </P> <P> Anderson, who usually does not indulge in the name-calling and high-voltage  attacks of the other two, usually gives a report on the status of tax  legislation and government spending.  </P> <P> Then the floor is opened for other business. Mock resolutions often are  debated. In addition, state officials are frequently "fired" or state agencies  "abolished." Votes are most always unanimous.  </P> <P> To some Bostonians, the show is nothing more than harmless political satire.  </P> <P> Not so, however, to the Boston Globe, the state's biggest newspaper and  frequent target of the "governors" -- particularly Williams and Carr.  </P> <P> Last month it published a four-part series titled "Poisoned Politics" that came  down hard on the talk-show trio, pointing out their inaccuracies and tendency  to descend into personal attacks. "Cynicism is the Hallmark of 'Governors on  the Airwaves,' " read one of the headlines over the second of the four  articles, which was devoted exclusively to a report on Williams, Carr and  Anderson.  </P> <P> In addition, Globe columnist Alan Lupo has referred to Carr as the "last  surviving member of the Borgia family," while Editorial Page Editor Martin  Nolan has compared him to Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels.  </P> <P> Globe Editor John R. Driscoll denies that the series was prompted by fears over  the growing influence of the trio. "The series is just part of a whole lot of  coverage we've been giving on the atmosphere in Massachusetts," he said.  </P> <P> But Mark Jurkowitz, a media critic for the Boston Phoenix, said in a recent  article that the Globe's "new aggressiveness" may reflect a deep concern.  </P> <P> "For years -- while Dukakis values held sway and the Globe was the official  organ of those values -- folks like Williams and Carr were merely small voices  in the wilderness, with a hard-core but disenfranchised following. Suddenly,  however, a rushing tide of anti-government anger has lifted their boats and  carried them into the mainstream."  </P> <P> The triumvirate has perhaps no bigger boosters in Boston than the Republican  Party, long the invisible crowd in Democratic-dominated Massachusetts. At a  recent state party conference, GOP officials presented Williams with a  community service award.  </P> <P> "Republicans are being registered at twice the rate of Democrats," said Ray  Shamie, state Republican chairman. "All of these things have stirred up people  to the point where they want to throw the bums out."  </P> <P> How long the "governors" will stay in office on the radio is a question they  are often asked. With Dukakis off the political stage after next year's  elections, the focus of much of the public anger they have tapped into will be  gone.  </P> <P> But Carr is philosophical: "There'll still be lots to talk about. And if we're  not around, at least we'll be a big part of Boston radio history."  </P> <P> Times researcher Lisa Romaine in New York contributed to this story.  </P></p>

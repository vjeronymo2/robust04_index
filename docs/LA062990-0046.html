			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHTS PANEL BACKS JOBS BILL, WARNS OF QUOTAS  </P> <P> The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, in a sharp break with its conservative  recent past, Thursday announced its endorsement of pending civil rights  legislation.  </P> <P> "More, not less, needs to be done to provide redress to victims of employment  discrimination and to reduce the amount of discrimination in employment," it  said.  </P> <P> At the same time, the panel said it had some concerns -- shared by the Bush  Administration -- that one section of the bill could lead to encouraging the  use of "illegal quotas" by employers.  </P> <P> The commission urged Congress to adopt language to make clear that in the  absence of a finding or order by the courts, the controversial section of the  bill is "not intended to promote employment quotas, nor will the use of quotas  be condoned as a means of avoiding liability under this section."  </P> <P> At issue is a section of the bill overturning a Supreme Court decision that  said employers no longer had to show a "business necessity" for their hiring  practices that resulted in a "disparate impact" on women and minorities.  </P></p>

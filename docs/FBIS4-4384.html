			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Fuji Photo Film Co. on  Thursday [31 March] criticized the U.S. Government's decision to  impose stiff penalty tariffs on its color photographic paper  sold in the United States.    Washington imposed tariffs of 360.95 percent Wednesday,  based  on a preliminary ruling by the Commerce Department that Fuji  Photo Film was selling the products in the U.S. at less than  fair market value. The decision stems from a petition filed by  Eastman Kodak Co. of the U.S., charging the Japanese company  with selling photographic paper in the U.S. at only a quarter of  the prices it charges for identical products in Japan.    A Fuji Photo Film executive said, "it is Eastman Kodak that  can decide prices in the U.S. market and we cannot understand  the allegation that Fuji is dumping its products to harm the  U.S. industry." Regarding the huge margin of the penalty  tariffs, he said the way they were calculated was not clear.    As reasons for the lower prices of the products in the U.S.,  the official cited the yen's appreciation against the dollar,  sales incentive rewards, and costs of other services for  processing laboratories in Japan.</p>

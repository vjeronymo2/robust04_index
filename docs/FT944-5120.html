			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week): Another milestone for Canadian bank - Other companies Royal Bank of Canada will report fiscal 1994 earnings on Tuesday, and is expected to be the first Canadian financial institution to post annual profits of more than CDollars 1bn (USDollars 727m). Royal's results are likely to follow the same pattern of declining loan losses, stronger credit demand and rising income from fee-related businesses reported by other Canadian banks over the past two weeks. Another common theme is that the year ahead will probably be even more profitable as business activity in North America continues to quicken. Royal is passing another milestone, with Allan Taylor, its chief executive, retiring to make way for the more assertive (and considerably younger) John Cleghorn.</p>

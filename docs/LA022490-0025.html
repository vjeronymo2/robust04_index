			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXASPERATED FANS: TIME TO PLAY BALL, NOT GAMES WITH NATIONAL PASTIME  </P> <P> If there is any lockout or job action that interferes with the baseball season,  I will not attend any games for the rest of the year. And although I will watch  and listen to games on TV and radio, I will not buy the products advertised.  This may not mean much to principals in our national pastime, but I can't think  of anything else I can do.  </P> <P> GINO LAMARCA, Ridgecrest  </P></p>

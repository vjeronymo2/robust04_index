			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Zil drives back from brink: State and free market come to carmaker's aid Zil, Russia's best known and most prestigious car-maker, is being saved from bankruptcy by a unique mixture of state support and free market principles. The restructuring envisages cost-cutting, diversification and international co-operation. The saving of the company, the 'father of the Russian motor industry', is akin to the government bail-out of Chrysler in the US in the 1980s or the nationalisation of Rolls Royce in Britain in the 1960s. It shows a government determined to preserve its engineering heartlands - at heavy cost to the budget and even to the extent of changing policy by raising tariffs on foreign imports to protect its market. However, it also shows that the company has entered into agreements with foreign partners and is cutting the workforce, particularly among administrators. It has shed a conservative top management and is trying to create a new, young management team. It is even trying to attract Mr Lee Iacocca, former head of Chrysler, or another senior retired car executive, to come to Russia to advise the new management on how to rescue a sinking company - as Mr Iacocca did with Chrysler. Zil, which makes trucks and buses, limousines, refrigerators and other white goods and engineering products, had virtually collapsed earlier this year under a massive load of debts, as its state orders for its vehicles fell to a fraction of their former volume. It currently produces 15 to 20 limousines a year and under 100,000 lorries, from 300,000 at full capacity. Its 120,000 workforce began to desert as pay fell or was not delivered. Management efforts to pressure the government with demonstrations produced no response. In May, the shareholders - among which the most powerful are Moscow City Council and two big financial groups - elected a new president of the board in Mr Alexander Vladislyavlev, deputy head of the Russian Industrialists Union and a prominent centrist political figure. The board last month appointed a new chief director, Mr Valery Saikin, who replaced Mr Yevgenny Brakov, demoted to vice president in charge of forming a new finance group. Mr Brakov had been best known for running as the official Communist party candidate against Mr Boris Yeltsin for a seat in the old Supreme Soviet in 1990. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Vladislyavlev said Zil was seeking, or had reached, joint venture agreements with the US companies Caterpillar, Paccar, General Motors and the French group Renault for the production of trucks, buses and engines. The government had placed orders for 24 new Zil limousines a year from now on and promised Rbs26bn and Dollars 35m for research and development of the upgraded model. The company is pressing the government to erect high tariff walls to protect its products - and with them, other products of the Russian automotive industry. Mr Vladislyavlev, who said he was confident that the government would agree, said: 'We must close the market to protect its development - but within that market, we want foreign companies to operate and to sell the products they make with us.' The company overall is being radically restructured into a holding company with separate product groups, in some of which the holding company may have only a minority share. In the longer term, Mr Vladislyavlev says it will offer some 10 per cent of its shares to foreign investors, at a price set at Dollars 60m (Pounds 39.4m).</p>

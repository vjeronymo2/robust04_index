He called for placing the Jerusalem and the  al-Aqsa Mosque issues on the list of urgent and essential issues  that require a speedy solution. He appealed to the Islamic  world, which is passing through one of its worst stages,  particularly in Afghanistan and Somalia, to close ranks and  stand up to preserve its standing and prestige. This statement  was made at a popular rally held in the village of al-Sama'inah  in Faqus District in al-Sharqiyah Governorate last evening. He  noted that the goal of his tours of Egyptian governorates is to  explain the facts to the people and to enlighten them about the  dangers facing Egypt and threatening its security and stability.  He noted that Egypt's stability ensures the stability of the  Arab world, as Egypt is the safeguard of security and peace of  the Islamic world.</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUILDING A RETAINING WALL WITH RAILROAD TIES;  </P> <P> CONSTRUCTION: TIES ARE EASIER TO HANDLE FOR THE DO-IT-YOURSELFER THAN MANY  OTHER MATERIALS.  </P> <P> Of all the ways to build a retaining wall, working with landscaping timbers or  railroad ties is certainly the easiest. It requires nowhere near the skill nor  the actual physical effort involved in working with alternatives such as stone,  concrete block or brick.  </P> <P> Even so, the job has to be done correctly or you'll discover that in a few  years the wall may begin to rot, shift, bulge or actually topple under the  pressure of the soil behind it. This is especially true in areas with lots of  rainfall and a freezing climate.  </P> <P> The technique described here work well for walls up to about three feet high.  Beyond this height, it's not a bad idea to have the wall designed by an  engineer, or to have it built by a pro.  </P> <P> The ties. Landscaping timbers come in a variety of sizes, but the best for  walls are 5-x-5, 5-x-6 and 6-x-6. The 5-x-6 size is a good compromise. Laid on  edge, it builds as fast as the 6-x-6 but costs less.  </P> <P> Whatever size you choose, make sure it is pressure-treated with CCA. This  treatment gives much greater rot protection than you'll ever get in any other  way. And CCA-treated wood will not harm nearby landscaping as wood treated with  some other preservatives might.  </P> <P> Cutting. The best way to cut timbers is with a chain saw. If you don't have  one, you can rent. It pays to get one bigger than you think you'll need, and to  make sure it is sharp. Dull, underpowered saws tend to bog down, wander and  produce sloppy cuts.  </P> <P> Lay out your line of cut on the top, the face and the rear edge of the timber  with a clear, dark line (I use a black felt marking pen). Then make your cut  facing the rear of the timber. This will put any chipping and splintering of  the back of the wall out of sight.  </P> <P> Foundation. You should start your wall on a firm base of packed soil or gravel,  one full tie below ground level. This means you'll have to dig a trench. If  your soil is firm and drains well, dig about six inches, level and tamp firmly.  If drainage or soft soil is a problem, dig down a foot, fill six inches with  pea gravel and tamp down firmly. Make sure this base is firm and level.  </P> <P> Lay out your first course of ties, make sure they are firmly bedded and level,  and then pin them to the ground for extra stability. The easiest way to do this  is with three-inch lengths of concrete reinforcing bar (rebar), sold at masonry  supply houses. Prebore for these with a half-inch bit, about 20 inches from the  ends of each tie, and then drive them in place with a sledge. Recheck for level  and adjust as necessary.  </P> <P> Now you can start building in earnest. This is pretty much like playing with  big, long blocks. Stagger all joints at least two feet, and overlap corners as  shown in the sketch. Fasten each course to the one below it with 3/8-by-12-inch  spikes. Space these six inches from the ends of each tie, and 24 inches apart  along the length of each tie.  </P> <P> Whenever one tie overlaps a joint in the course below it, drive a pair of  spikes down through the top tie into the two below, about 10 inches back from  the joint. To prevent splitting, it's a good idea to predrill with a  quarter-inch bit, especially for spikes near the ends of timbers. This also  makes it easier to drive the spikes home, and helps prevent them from wandering  off course.  </P> <P> Deadmen. To help prevent the wall from bowing or tipping under the pressure of  the earth behind it, you need some kind of anchoring device. If you can find  earth anchors (long steel shafts with augers at the end) they are a good  choice. You can just twist these two into the soil like a giant drill, and then  fasten them to the ties with a pair of spikes driven into the eye at the other  end.  </P> <P> An alternative is to build a deadman like the one in the sketch. Make this like  a "T" with a 40-inch stem and a 24-inch top. Spike it together and spike it to  the wall, and bury it with firmly packed soil.  </P> <P> Whichever anchor you use, you'll need one for every eight feet of wall. Center  it left to right and place it one course down from the top of the wall. Your  wall also needs to be anchored at the ends. Normally you'll do this by means of  an intersecting wall as shown in the sketch. But if the retaining wall butts up  against your foundation (as a driveway retaining wall often does), you can  anchor that end of the wall with another deadman. In this case, tip the "T" on  edge so the top runs vertically instead of horizontally.  </P> <P> Fill. If drainage may be a problem, it's best to fill the area just behind the  wall with a band of gravel about a foot wide. You can also run perforated  plastic pipe along the bottom of the gravel fill, leading it out to the ends of  the wall. Then continue filling behind the wall, placing and packing the soil  in layers to avoid future settling. It pays to fill right up to the top of the  wall so any heavy rains can simply run right over the wall.  </P> <P> 1990, Los Angeles Times Syndicate.  </P></p>

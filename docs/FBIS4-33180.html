			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina </F> in Cairo, Egypt, by Roberto Gili in Havana -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Gili] We would like to know what the Cuban  delegation to the Ibero-American Summit -- to be held on 14-15  June in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia -- expects to achieve.    [Robaina] These summits continue to be special occasions  when  we can meet without being ordered to do so by the Empire. The  Ibero-American Summit, specifically, is already threatened by  the Miami hemispheric summit, convened by the U.S. Government  for the clear purpose of discrediting it. I believe that in  light of such a maneuver, it is important for the Cartagena  summit to be stronger than ever in terms of its development.    I have no doubt that, independent of their efforts, the  Latin  American peoples are increasingly more independent and will  continue to find their own path. We need to see how the rest of  America responds, but I have confidence in Colombia's readiness  and the peoples' response. I believe this will be an important  forum for discussion and that Colombia would like it to become a  stage for debate, discussion, and unrehearsed speeches. I hope  it will be a summit for action rather than intentions.    [Gili] Thank you minister.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARCOS STILL SEMI-COMATOSE AFTER OPERATION  </P> <P> Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos remained semi-comatose and on a  dialysis machine Friday after removal of a malfunctioning transplanted kidney,  a hospital official said.  </P> <P> "The condition has not worsened since yesterday (Thursday). He remains  semi-comatose, but is responding to pain, but not command," Eugene Tiwanak, St.  Francis Medical Center assistant administrator, said.  </P> <P> Doctors Thursday removed the kidney -- which Marcos received in a transplant in  1984 -- because his body had begun rejecting the organ. They hoped the  operation would clear the massive infection that has gripped the ailing, exiled  leader.  </P> <P> Marcos' temperature was down to about 100 degrees, which Tiwanak called a  favorable sign. It had been as high as 104 degrees before the operation.  </P> <P> Marcos, 71, will have to undergo dialysis daily, said Tiwanak. Marcos remains  on a respirator in the hospital's intensive care unit.  </P></p>

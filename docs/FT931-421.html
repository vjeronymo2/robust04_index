			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Inchcape rises 28% to Pounds 250m on sales growth ACQUISITIONS and strong organic growth helped Inchcape, the UK-based motor and business services group, increase annual pre-tax profits by 28 per cent to Pounds 250m. Sales rose 39 per cent to Pounds 5.04bn in the year to December 31, boosted by a 10-month contribution from Tozer Kemsley and Millbourn, the motor trader it bought for Pounds 383m. Although TKM contributed Pounds 48.3m to total operating profits of Pounds 293m, Inchcape said its underlying businesses showed organic profits growth of 10 per cent. Sir David Plastow, chairman, said: 'Generally around the world the economic environment in 1992 was tough but despite this, the group was able to produce good results. Many of Inchcape's businesses are in those economies which have grown well during the year, while in weaker markets most of our operations have still managed to succeed.' Earnings per share rose 3.7 per cent to 31p. Sir David said the benefit the group gained from Budget changes in advance corporation tax had been one of the factors behind the decision to raise the final dividend to 8.35p (from 7p), giving a total of 13.75p (up from 11.75p), an increase of 17 per cent. As well as adopting the new FRS 3 accounting standard, Inchcape calculated 'normalised' pre-tax profits and earnings, excluding items which had been accounted as extraordinary under the old standard. Under these figures, including gains on disposals of properties and investments, earnings per share rose 18 per cent to 31.6p and pre-tax profits by 36 per cent to Pounds 252m. Sir David said: 'The motors business grew strongly, quite apart from the added impetus of the acquisition of TKM. All of our franchises in Hong Kong had an outstanding year. Toyota (GB) also enjoyed a good year and will benefit increasingly in 1993 from the newly-opened Toyota manufacturing plant at Burnaston.' The marketing business side improved profits, due mainly to the Pounds 32m acquisition of Spinneys, a group of marketing and retail companies. Fastest growth was in the Middle East, organically as well as by acquisition, with good results from South America, Singapore and Thailand. In the service business stream, shipping greatly increased its turnover, but profits fell mainly because of lower Japanese activity. Insurance offset the lower reinsurance market with solid growth by Bain Clarkson's core UK retail business. Lex, Page 24</p>

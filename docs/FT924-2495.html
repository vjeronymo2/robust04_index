			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Stag tale gains European currency - Summit Diary JOHN MAJOR managed to start the summit with an auspicious anecdote on its imposing venue, Holyrood Palace. It was founded, quoth he, by David the First in 1128, after he had been attacked by an 'enraged stag' in the nearby park, on the feast of the exaltation of the cross. Legend has it that he was saved by the providential appearance of a cross between the stag's antlers. But Mr Major was able to reveal that the story had actually been filched from another legend, concerning St Hubert, the eighth-century Bishop of - yes, you guessed it - Maastricht. It remains to be seen whether this historical link between a British institution and the Dutch city will trump a later one. Guy Fawkes, the only man ever to enter the Houses of Parliament with honourable intentions as the refrain goes, is also said to have been resident in Maastricht some 10 years before he conceived his incendiary plot. ***** President Francois Mitterrand is also legendary, particularly for turning up at summits late and last, to underline his grandeur as sole head of state in the EC's heads of government club. Not this time, since he had an eve-of-summit dinner appointment with Mr Major. This, UK and French officials said, went very well, but Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime minister, may be regretting Mr Mitterrand's punctuality, as well as wondering what time the dinner ended. For at 4.10am yesterday, Mr Reynolds had to leap out of his bed, being rained on from an overflowing bath in the room above - Mr Mitterrand's. ***** The citizens of Edinburgh have been treated to a bewildering display of Euro-demonstrations - quite apart from the more familiar Scottish National Party rally planned for midday today. A hundred Greek mayors filing behind a banner proclaiming 'Alexander the Great was Greek not Slav' did not appear to have any obvious relation to the sort of nationalism Scots are used to. It was but one of a swirl of protests across the city by Greeks against recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia by that name. This was in Prince's Street. Across on Carlton Hill, the GMB trade union was organising a procession of 11 horses and a mule - to highlight Mr Major's government's stubborn, two-speed opting out of the EC's Social Charter. The pro-Europeans weren't having it all their own way, however. In Frederick Street, the Consumers' Association opened a 'Delors Deli', displaying food with two price tags, one with the real cost to the consumer as a result of the Common Agricultural Policy, the other at cheaper world prices. ***** The Royal Bank of Scotland, one of the three Scottish note issuing banks, was doing a roaring trade in its commemorative issue of Euro-Scottish pound notes. The bank, which has printed 2m of the special bits of paper, came up with the ultimate Euro-gift for the 13 main summit participants (including Jacques Delors): paperweights made up of notes with the numbers 1992001 up to 1992013. It is also selling 50,000 'collectors' packs' at Pounds 3 a time. The bank dislikes the description 'gimmick', preferring to call the promotion 'unusual but appropriate'.</p>

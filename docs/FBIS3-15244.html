			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Borisenko] </F>   [Text] Washington, 2 March -- A Russian delegation that is  in the United States at the invitation of the State Department  has, along with the American side, signed a memorandum on  understanding aimed at regulating cooperation in the area of  organizing electronic and postal communications.    "We are implementing contacts with the United States on  matters relating to the supply of modern equipment to Russia,"  Russian Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak, who is in the  United States, said in an interview with an ITAR-TASS  correspondent. "The situation is complicated by the continuing  existence of eight Cocom [Coordinating Committee for  Multilateral Export Controls] restrictions on deliveries of this  kind of equipment." A paradoxical situation is emerging:  although Cocom is due to formally go out of existence on 31  March of this year, the restrictions on trade in modern  technology that it has introduced will remain in force.    "Once again we would like to recall that discrimination in  trade has," V. Bulgak said, "a negative affect on our relations."    On the whole, the minister said, cooperation in the area of  communications between the two countries is constantly  expanding. The number of telephone channels through which our  countries can communicate has grown from 80 to 670. As early as  1995 there will be 1,500 of them and in two years' time there  will be 3,000.    As regards the development of a communications system in  Russia, the main aim, in the words of the minister, is to  attract foreign capital. American capital investments in this  province have amounted to $40 million over two years, while,  last year alone, the total amount of Western investment in  Russia's communications system reached $250 million. The  question of what was hindering the growth of American  investments was discussed at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of  Commerce Ronald Brown. "The main barriers on the road to a  growth in investments are psychological ones," the Russian  minister said. "And Cocom still has influence, too."    If we take a look at the very near future, V. Bulgak  continued, then once the appropriate digital communications  networks are set up, Russians will have access to the  "information superhighway" -- a high-speed international  computer communications system. "Here we need to solve the  so-called `50 by 50 problem,'" V. Bulgak said. "We're talking  about setting up 50 new telephone stations and the laying of 50  thousand km of new networks. The project is estimated to take  10 years and it will cost $40 billion to carry it out."</p>

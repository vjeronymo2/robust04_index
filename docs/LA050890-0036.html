			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE NICKNAME PLOY  </P> <P> I have just received my sample ballot for the upcoming (June 5) election. In  reviewing the various candidates I note that entirely too many of them have  cute little nicknames in parentheses.  </P> <P> Perhaps it is old-fashioned to run for public office using your proper name.  </P> <P> If the individuals in question were known better by the nickname it might be  acceptable. However, in most cases the individuals have simply included the  common informal name, i.e., Robert -- "Bob" or John -- "Jack." If this is a  current ploy to win elections, I, for one, will not fall for it.  </P> <P> If these individuals really think this will help voter recognition, I question  their intelligence. I will vote for the "less cute" candidate and/or the one  with the less placards attached to utility poles.  </P> <P> FREDERICK J. (FRED) RICHARDS  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Domingo Cavallo has taken the first step in a  campaign to encourage exports in order to reduce the trade  balance deficit. Yesterday, the minister announced new credit  lines to finance exports by small- and medium-sized companies.  The amount available is $100 million at an annual interest rate  of between 8 and 10 percent.    The minister used a meeting of the Argentine Industrial  Union  [UIA] to announce the plan. UIA President Jorge Blanco Villegas  took advantage of the opportunity to lash out at bankers, who  were absent from yesterday's meeting. He said they were "one of  the main sectors missing from government economic reorganization  programs."    The loans will be channeled through the Bank of Investment  and Foreign Trade (BICE), which is presided over by Horacio  Alvarez Rivero. The main points of this new credit line are:     -  The loan will finance up to 85 percent of the FOB value of  capital good exports of national origin and up to 10 percent of  the FOB value of spare parts and accessories.    -  The minimum loan  is $20,000 and the maximum is $2.5 million per year.    -  The  interest rate varies from 8 percent a year for shorter terms  (from six months to two years) to 10 percent for longer terms  (three to five years).    -  All financial institutions that operate  trade internationally with the authorization of the BICE may  play the role of commercial banks. The banks will get a maximum  profit, or spread [preceding word in English] of 1.5 percent,  which is already included in the rate.    -  The guarantees can be  presented through an export credit insurance against special  risks and regular commercial risks. The endorsement of foreign  banks approved by the BICE can also be used.    Alvarez Rivero also presented a second line of credit to  finance Argentine companies participation in international fairs  and congresses. The idea is to cover up to 70 percent of the  cost of renting stands, publishing catalogs, and paying for  trips and hotels.    With this package -- in addition to the Competitivity Plan  to  be disclosed next week -- Cavallo seeks to stimulate exports.  The 1993 trade deficit was over $3.5 billion.    Cavallo said: "We want all 1995 foreign trade activities to  enjoy international financing."    Blanco Villegas, who is also the president of Philco, was  skeptical about Cavallo's promises. He said: "I believe the  financial sector has not made enough effort. We must exert  pressure and stimulation to broaden credit and to reduce  production costs."    The few businessmen who are members of the APYME [Small and  Medium Enterprises Association] who came to hear the  announcement were disappointed. One said: "This is not the  first time we have heard announcements of this type." Workers  of the INTI [National Institute of Industrial Technology] were  also disappointed. They gathered outside to wait for the  secretary of industry to protest the reorganization of this  secretariat, but Carlos Magarinos did not attend the meeting  because he is touring the country.</p>

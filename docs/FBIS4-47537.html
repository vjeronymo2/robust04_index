Engelgardt, Moscow; UDC 577.21]    [Abstract] The high volume of asparagine family amino acid  production in the biotechnology industry--estimated in billions  of dollars--and the lack of a vector-host system for molecular  gene cloning in corynebacteria which held back the use of  genetic engineering methods for developing corynebacterial  producing strains prompted attempts to clone the lysC gene from  Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 1302, a gene which  encodes aspartokinase--a key enzyme in the lysin biosynthesis in  corynebacteria--due to the higher activity of this wild type of  enzyme compared to the enzyme encoded by the mutant gene which  had been cloned earlier. In so doing, a novel version of a  bireplicon vector for corynebacteria and E. coli was  engineered in order to ensure a higher lysC gene expression  level in the corynebacterial cells. This bireplicon vector was  constructed on the basis of the pUC19 plasmid and the pBO1  corynebacterial cryptic plasmid. Encloned gene amplification on  the new vector increase the aspartokinase activity by sixfold  compared to the enzyme activity in the nonplasmid wild type  strain cells. The novel engineered bireplicon vector is capable  of not only replicating in corynebacterial cells but is also of  maintaining effective expression of the gene cloned on it.

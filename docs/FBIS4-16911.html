			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 19 (TANJUG) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin assessed on Tuesday evening that forceful measures  should be taken towards the resolving of the conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and again suggested a top-level meeting  between the United States and the European Union, with the  participation of the United Nations.    Yeltsin said that the meeting should be well-prepared and  that instructions in that sense had been given to the Foreign  Ministry in Moscow.    Yeltsin assessed that the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina  was  facing a dangerous escalation and that the strong measures taken  by Russia together with some other countries and the U.N. had  not been helpful.    He underscored that the Bosnian Serb leadership had to  fulfill their obligations given to Russia, to cease combat  activities and withdraw from the area of Gorazde, which has been  declared a safe area.    Conditions must also be created for the arrival of U.N.  troops to Gorazde and the U.N. staff in Bosnia-Herzegovina must  be allowed freedom of movement, the Russian president said.    Moslem and Serb forces have been fighting around Gorazde, a  Moslem enclave in southeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, for three  weeks.    Instead of demilitarization, more than 10,000 Moslem troops  concentrated in this enclave, from where they launched a heavy  offensive on Serb territories in late March.    Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic on Sunday agreed an  immediate ceasefire around Gorazde with UNPROFOR head Yasushi  Akashi, but Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic rejected the  agreement.    The Bosnian Serb army announced that Moslem forces from  Gorazde on Tuesday continued heavy attacks on Serb positions in  order to cause larger-scale conflicts for which the Serb side  would then be blamed and a foreign intervention provoked.    NATO-assigned U.S. planes on Sunday and Monday bombed  Bosnian  Serb positions around Gorazde, allegedly to protect UNPROFOR  members who were actually British special units in charge of  guiding the NATO planes to the Serb targets.    The Bosnian Serb army also on Tuesday pointed out that  Moslem  forces were using buildings where representatives of the U.N.  and international humanitarian organizations were housed for  their attacks.    Karadzic underscored on Tuesday that he was receiving hourly  reports on the situation in Gorazde and that they showed that  the Moslem forces would not cease fire and were attacking Serbs  on the right bank of the Drina in boat landing operations.    Bosnian Serbs could have entered Gorazde, Karadzic said, but  wished to make a safe area of the town. It must be  demilitarized and UNPROFOR members should be deployed along a  3-km belt on the left bank of the Drina, where the Moslem part  is, Karadzic said, adding that this could be realized  immediately as far as the Serb side was concerned.</p>

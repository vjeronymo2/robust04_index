			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: A listing in the time of calamity - Hanover Re has a lot riding on its partial float The first stock market listing of a German reinsurance company for 33 years  -that of Hanover Re, to raise DM530m (Dollars 353m) - comes at a time of more frequent natural disasters, higher premiums and a more selective approach in the industry to new business. The issue is also one of the first with shares in nominal DM5 units instead of the usual DM50. These are now allowed under regulations aimed at encouraging private investors to buy more shares. Next to Switzerland, shares in Germany are the most expensive in Europe. With its sister company, Eisen und Stahl Ruckversicherung, Hanover Re is Germany's second largest and the world's fifth largest reinsurance concern. The new issue, in which 25 per cent of the capital is being sold, is the seventh largest in Germany since 1983. Hanover Re and the issuing consortium, headed by Commerzbank, hope to convince German and foreign investors that the company's policy of forgoing growth in premium income in high-risk areas and concentrating on profitability will continue to pay off. In deference to some analysts who thought the issue price might be too high for many investors, especially foreigners, the voting shares are offered at DM75 each for subscription from November 18 to 22. Some initial estimates were nearer DM90. Mr Erich Coenen, a Commerzbank director, said yesterday the issue price was attractive, both 'optically' compared with the high price of other reinsurance groups - Munich Re stood at DM2,750 - and 'analytically': the price-earnings ratio of 15.8 based on expected 1995 earnings is well under the German sector average. With Eisen und Stahl, which is more domestically-oriented than Hanover Re, gross premium income last year was DM5.3bn, a rise of 30 per cent. The underwriting loss fell to DM122m from DM263m and net profits shot up by nearly 200 per cent to DM125m. Group investments totalled DM10.3bn. Mr Michael Reischel, Hanover Re's chief executive, does not expect growth to be as spectacular this year or next. 'We have grown enormously over the past three years,' he said. But the group had resisted the temptation to expand liability levels - risks are simply too high in certain areas. 'So we expect lower growth over the next few years. We are cutting back where necessary,' says Mr Reischel. The message is the same as that last week from Munich Re, the world's biggest reinsurance concern. Because disasters such as earthquakes, floods and typhoons have become more frequent, premiums have escalated. 'Assets are more highly concentrated,' said Mr Reischel. 'Fifteen years ago, Hurricane Andrew in Florida would have caused a lot less damage.' The hurricane was the largest disaster, in terms of insured damage, to have hit the industry. January's earthquake near Los Angeles was the second worst. As an example of risk areas where premiums have tended to rise steeply, Mr Reischel cites Japan where Typhoon Mireille caused heavy damage in 1991. 'The trend for natural disasters seems to be on the rise,' says Mr Reischel. More damage and more insurance payouts are definitely to be expected. Because the industry spreads its exposure internationally, this trend affects premiums in all sectors, not just those where the risk is severest. 'Insurance customers, whether private or corporate, have to pay more if they want cover,' says Mr Reischel. 'The reinsurance industry can't create money by magic.' In the five years to 1993, premiums paid for worldwide catastrophe risks totalled nearly Dollars 20bn, says Mr Herbert Haas, a director of Hanover Re. Damage payouts totalled just over Dollars 18bn, but brokerage, interest and other costs pushed this up to Dollars 25bn, leaving the industry with an overall deficit. Thus, many reinsurers and primary insurance companies have pulled out or been forced out of the reinsurance business. Mr Reischel puts the figure at more than 100 since 1990. New reinsurance capacity is available from Bermuda, but Mr Reischel sees this as positive - 'since new investors are only looking for returns, they will hopefully prevent a rates war'. Because it was founded as recently as 1966, he says Hanover Re has been spared some of the worst calamities, such as claims on asbestos or pollution liability. It has also kept out of the over-crowded London and Singapore reinsurance markets. However, it is raising its presence in Asia and Australia, where growth is high. The company has no acquisitions in mind after buying NRG Victory Australia Life Reinsurance last year. Hanover Re will use its DM230m share of the issue proceeds to lift its 4 per cent stake in Eisen und Stahl, with which it does business on a group basis, to a 53.9 per cent majority holding. The remainder will go to its parent, Haftpflichtverband der Deutschen Industrie (HDI), a mutually-owned insurer.</p>

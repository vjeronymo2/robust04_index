			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Albania forced to back down on Kosovo THE Albanian government, facing domestic problems this winter because of severe shortages of food and fuel, is diluting its traditional support for ethnic Albanians in the neighbouring Serbian province of Kosovo. Mr Sali Berisha, the Albanian president, no longer speaks of Kosovo as 'the other half' of Albania, although he still backs the Kosovo Albanians' demands for autonomy from Serbia. Albanian officials claim the government is not committed to providing military support for the Kosovo Albanians if fighting breaks out there. The next flashpoint is likely to be the Serbian elections on December 20 which the Albanian majority in Kosovo has vowed to boycott. 'The Albanian army is not in a position to intervene against the Serbians. We don't have enough weapons or equipment. All we can hope to do if there is conflict is to guard our own border,' said one official. Nevertheless, officials accept that young Albanians would cross the border in large numbers to join local militias or help protect relatives. Attempts to reorganise Albania's 100,000-strong conscript army in the past few months have included concentrating troops close to the northern and eastern borders with Kosovo. Mr Berisha has called for military action by Nato and the West European Union against Serb forces who have seized most of Bosnia. The Albanian government has also accumulated small stockpiles of food and medical supplies in northern towns in case refugees from Kosovo start to arrive. However, Albania would be unable to accommodate more than a few thousand refugees, given the government's continuing difficulties in providing basic food supplies. Despite being granted a Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.5m) stand-by loan from the IMF earlier this year, intended for importing raw materials for the food processing industry, Albania will again be dependent on European Community food aid to get through the winter. The EC ships flour and rice to Albania from Italy and Greece. But bread is rationed, together with other staple foods sold at state shops, while food prices at private shops are prohibitively high.</p>

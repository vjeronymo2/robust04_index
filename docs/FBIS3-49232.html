Among other things, the  document says that they discussed ways in which the economic  interests of the Hungarian ethnic minority could be protected  and agreed to elaborate the rules according to which the UDMR's  economic council is to function. To avoid ethnic discrimination  within the privatization process of the state property, it was  assessed that a first step would be seeing to it that experts of  that ethnic minority are also represented among the dignitaries  of the State Property Fund who are to be appointed by the  government.    The UDMR Executive Presidium also discussed the agenda of  the  conference that is to be held with the chairmen of the UDMR  county branches on 8 January in Miercurea Ciuc, as well as a  report on the preparations made in view of the conference that  will concentrate on the issue of self-government, scheduled to  take place on 15 January in Odorheiul Secuiesc.    Learning about President Ion Iliescu's assessments of the  1989 events in Romania and the ethnic conflict that took place  in March 1990 in Tirgu Mures -- which were published in the  [Iliescu's] memoirs -- the UDMR Executive Presidium considers  them unacceptable, as they represent the falsification of  history owing to political considerations. The need to  establish the historic truth compels the UDMR Executive  Presidium to urgently publish the critique based on sound  arguments of that booklet [brosura], the communique released by  the UDMR press bureau says, adding in conclusion that the  presidium has sent a telegram saluting the conference on the  self-government of the ethnic Hungarians living in Slovakia,  scheduled for 8 January in Komarno. The presidium considers  that event as an important step made in the spirit of current  European processes, and not merely in view of the maintenance of  the national identity of the Hungarian community living in  Slovakia, but also that of all other Hungarian communities with  a minority status.</p>

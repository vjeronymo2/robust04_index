			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / OECD Economic Outlook: Sweden bottom of the growth league SWEDEN'S conservative-led government yesterday responded to the indignity of falling to the bottom of the OECD's growth table by stressing the improvement it expects in the recession-hit economy next year, including a big downward revision of its inflation forecast, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm. The predicted fall of 2 per cent in Swedish GNP this year is the worst performance among the OECD's 24 members. A forecast budget deficit equivalent to 13 per cent of GNP was no less painful. But the government took some comfort in the OECD's forecasts for 1994, when export growth and the effects of budget cuts are expected to start taking effect. The OECD predicts GNP growth of 1.4 per cent next year, compared with the government's forecast of 1.2 per cent. The government's inflation forecast for 1993 is cut to 4.6 per cent from 5 per cent, and for 1994 to 2.8 per cent from 3.3 per cent.</p>

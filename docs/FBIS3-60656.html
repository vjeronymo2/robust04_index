			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Dr. Conrado Seminario, the Peruvian Institute of  Nuclear Energy (IPEN) executive director, reported on 18  November that IPEN has exported radioactive material produced in  the "Racso" [Oscar Miro Quesada de la Guerra] Nuclear Center in  Huarangal to the United States and, more recently, to Ecuador.    Seminario pointed out that the Huarangal center has enough  production capabilities, but its main duty is to promote  research and development among Peruvian University professors  and students.    Seminario said IPEN does not have any mortgage obligations  or  indebtedness to Argentina, whose technicians installed the  "Racso" Nuclear Center. The current debt is between governments  and is handled normally. [passage omitted]    Concerning the Santa Anita irradiation plant, Seminario said  65 percent of the infrastructure has been completed. The  equipment's arrival will be authorized when 85 percent of the  infrastructure has been completed.    A 1.7 billion-sole appropriation is required to complete the  infrastructure and purchase the complementary equipment. The  plant's main equipment is under construction in Russia. It will  cost $1.2 million. This equipment will be donated by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    The IAEA also has sent a purchase order for $160,000 for the  cobalt-60 the plant will require.    Perishable foodstuffs will be irradiated at the plant in  order to preserve them for export. Roots, for example, may be  preserved for eight months without spoiling. According to their  natural properties, fruits have different preservative lives.</p>

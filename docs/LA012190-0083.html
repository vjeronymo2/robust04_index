			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZAN THOMPSON: FILLMORE: DEFINITELY NOT FORGOTTEN  </P> <P> It is possible that with the recent rain and the launching of the new year, you  may have missed one of the most significant celebrations to come our way  recently. This was the meeting of the Western States Millard G. Fillmore  Appreciation Society in the town of Fillmore to the north of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> This society was founded by a gentleman named Bob Coop as a bit of whimsy. But  it has taken hold of the minds and hearts of Americans everywhere, culminating  in this series of events in Fillmore.  </P> <P> One of the outstanding members, who always stands to be counted when they are  breaking out the banners for our 13th President, is Robert H. Finch, friend of  Bob Coop, former lieutenant governor of California, former Secretary of Health,  Education and Welfare and former presidential counselor.  </P> <P> Perhaps it will be easier for you to understand the magnitude of this event by  reading an amazing set of documents sent to me by Finch.  </P> <P> First, from the the society's trivia newsletter for November, 1989:  </P> <P> "Exciting news regarding our society: While at a cocktail party in the  Adriatic, your president bestowed an honorary membership upon Delores I. Day,  mayor of the city of Fillmore, even though her city is not named for Millard.  </P> <P> "Out of gratitude for this significant honor, Delores has invited us all to a  gala celebration on our hero's birthday, Sunday, Jan. 7, 1990.  </P> <P> "We hope that many of you will come. Sunday will be filled with exciting  events, which will include a luncheon featuring cuisine of the region and a  long nap in the afternoon.  </P> <P> "We have been getting some flak lately from a few malcontents who have had the  temerity to question the society's expenditures and have wondered why they  didn't get more for their measly two bucks. All of you have received an  exquisite embossed certificate suitable for framing or sticking on your  refrigerator door, a trivia newsletter, and my undying gratitude. What do you  want for two bucks a year?  </P> <P> "Will we see you in Fillmore on Jan. 7? We hope so. Bob Coop."  </P> <P> This was an answer to the invitation from Mayor Day and her city staff, who  seem to have only the iffiest grasp on the general thinking that city business  should be grim, dull and curmudgeonly.  </P> <P> Here's their invitation:  </P> <P> "My dear Mr. Coop: It is with deep appreciation and gratitude that I accept  your bribe to host the first annual Western States Millard G. Fillmore  Appreciation Society reunion in our bristling-with-anticipation city. This will  be the most exciting event since the retirement luncheon we threw for Bert when  he retired from his UPS route after 33 years. Even as I write this, our local  McDonald's restaurant is furiously endeavoring to perfect their McMillard  souffle -- a big cheese with nothing inside.  </P> <P> "I have pow-wowed with our City Manager Roy (I love a parade) Payne and  Councilmen John (over-40 softball team member) Murphy, Roger (may I say a few  words) Campbell, Scott Lee and Mike (how much will it cost) McMahan, and our  consensus is that the gala should be held in our city on Jan. 7, 1990,  Millard's 190th birthday. Available activities will include: musical chaise  lounges, re-count of the 1856 election (we think he won two states), limbo  dancing, snail races.  </P> <P> "Our entire staff is extremely apathetic about the festivities. City Clerk  Noreen (you'll need a permit for that) Withers will be coordinating the  activities when she feels like it. Kindest personal regards, Delores I. Day."  </P> <P> Robert Hutchison Finch attended the gala as a member in good standing of the  society and had a wonderful time. He says that the entire city staff attended  the full weekend's events, including the eucalyptus tree planting.  </P> <P> I will look forward to the annual Millard G. Fillmore Appreciation Day in  January, 1991. Perhaps we can all go to Fillmore together.  </P></p>

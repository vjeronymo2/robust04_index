			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] WELLINGTON, Feb 3 (AFP) -- The cheap British sale of  six second-hand navy frigates to Pakistan illustrated that New  Zealand was committed to a "dud deal" in having to buy two  expensive new frigates from Australia, a government member of  parliament, Nick Smith, claimed here Thursday.    A previous Labour government committed New Zealand to buying  two Australian-built frigates at around 600 million New Zealand  dollars (334 million US) apiece. There is also an option on a  third vessel to replace the four aging frigates which make up  the navy's front line.    Smith earlier said the Royal Navy had sold six Type 21  Amazon  frigates to Pakistan at a cost of only one million pounds  sterling (668,000 US dollars) each. "This shows what a dud deal  we are getting in paying over 600 million dollars each for the  Anzac frigates," he said.    But Defence Minister Warren Cooper said Smith's comments  showed "all the brilliance of hindsight. When the decision was  taken in the late 1980s to go ahead with the Australia-New  Zealand frigates project, there were no suitable ships being  offered, including those now sold to Pakistan. "There is little  to be gained by claims of Rolls Royce solutions when second-hand  ships were simply not on the market back then," Cooper said.    He noted the Australian deal was signed by the  administration  of Prime Minister David Lange which had also cut military ties  with the United States through its ban on nuclear armed or  powered warships. "We've got a ship in the New Zealand Navy that  was given to us by the Americans. If we had a better  relationship with the Americans they would replace that ship for  nothing. We know that. We've cut off our options," Cooper told  Radio New Zealand.    He said if second-hand ships were considered it was  necessary  to know what was on them. "While I've been Minister of Defence  I've had at least six people come to me as agents for what we  could call grid military equipment. They've been acting out of  Russia, particularly because the Russians seem to have all that  equipment.    "They've wanted to sell us helicopters and aircraft  carriers,  and I had to be pretty careful that I wasn't in the situation  where I had to ask the taxpayer to pay for big capital works  programmes when we could find things that were available off the  shelf, maybe a few years old, so we could put them in the  defence forces. I made absolutely certain there weren't bargains  out there that we could use that we were denying ourselves,"  Cooper said.</p>

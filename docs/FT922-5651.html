			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Repsol may stretch bond issue to Pta50bn A Pta25bn (Dollars 250m) convertible bond offering by Repsol, Spain's state-controlled oil, gas and chemicals group, has been oversubscribed and the corporation will extend the issue to Pta50bn. The investor response to the three-year, 10 per cent bonds is likely to encourage Repsol into making an international placement of shares for institutional investors this autumn. Repsol officials say that the placement is under consideration but that no decision has yet been made. In 1989 Repsol raised Pta130bn when the state sold a 26.5 per cent stake in the group. The convertible bonds were priced at Pta10,000 and investors were limited to buying a maximum of 800 for Pta8m. Officials believe that the average investment has been some Pta200,000. Most of the bond holders are expected to convert at the first opportunity, which will be in the last week of September, in order to take advantage of an 8 per cent discount on the share price. Should all the Pta50bn worth of bonds be converted to shares, the state holding in Repsol will be reduced by about 6 per cent 58.4 per cent. Repsol could therefore place a further 8 per cent of itself and still comply with its charter, which demands majority public ownership. An 8 per cent shareholding in Repsol has a stock market value of Pta75bn. However, legislation before parliament is due to abolish the ruling on majority public ownership. Mr Oscar Fanjul, the group's chairman, has indicated he would welcome that. The government is understood to favour privatisations in order to reduce the budget deficit in accordance with Spain's convergence plan for economic and monetary union within Europe. Spain has disclosed capital market expansion plans in an attempt to diversify the sources and lengthen the maturity of government debt, Reuter reports from Madrid. Treasury officials aim to issue securities in the European Community's Ecu currency, to open up the market in 'matador' peseta-denominated, foreign bonds, and to ease the tax burden borne by foreign investors.</p>

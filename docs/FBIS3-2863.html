			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Beijing is not backing away from its commitment to  reform its state-run enterprise sector despite the decision to  bail out loss-making industries this year, a leading official  said yesterday.    In his work report to the NPC, premier Li Peng announced  that  the Government would be providing special funds to large and  medium- scale state-run enterprises and would exempt them from  contributions to budgetary funds and energy and transport  projects.    But Wang Guoquan, a leading industrialist and a member of  the  standing committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, said such financial privileges were  only temporary measures designed to ensure stability in a  transitional period.    If enterprises continued to lose money for long periods of  time and failed to improve their economic efficiency, Mr. Wang  said the Government would have no choice but to let them go  bankrupt.    "Enterprises which solely rely on the Government's  preferential policies without deepening their own reform will  definitely sink and the Government will not keep providing them  with aid," Mr. Wang told a specially convened press conference  in Beijing. Mr. Wang said there was no contradiction between  encouraging enterprises to take care of themselves on the one  hand and continuing to provide them with subsidies on the other.    "What premier Li meant (in his work report) is that  enterprises should mainly rely on their own efforts to deepen  reform of their operational mechanism but before that, in the  transitional period, the Government has no choice but to offer  them some preferential treatment so that we can ensure the  livelihood of their workers."    "These are only temporary measures," he stressed. However,  independent analysts said "temporary" in this context could mean  several years.    A Western diplomat in Beijing said: "The social disorder  which would result from have 30 million or 40 million workers  laid off is enough to make anyone nervous and so it is  understandable the Government wants to shore up these  enterprises for the time being. And with one third of these  enterprises loosing huge amounts of money, it will take several  years before the state sector is finally ready to take the  plunge," she said.    Other observers said the Government's decision to provide  additional funds to the state sector this year had been prompted  by a wave of worker unrest over the past year.    A local economist said: "The Government has clearly been  rattled by the increase in strikes and disruptions to production  caused by workers' protests."    However, Mr. Wang said reports of numerous strikes in China  had been exaggerated.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS: 'IT'S AMAZING WHAT LITTLE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION  ON THESE KIDS'  </P> <P> It's something akin to love that makes Monroe (Bookie) Clark spend most of his  time and energy volunteering at his alma mater, Hoover High School. While he  could be quietly enjoying his retirement from the insurance business, the  64-year-old Talmadge resident is instead "getting pumped up," calling out the  scores at the school's basketball games, or helping a foreign student learn to  read, or ferrying a teen-ager to and from a summer job. Clark, who graduated  from Hoover in 1943, insists he's just doing what anyone could do if they had  the time. He says it's astonishing what a difference volunteering a couple of  hours a week can make. Times staff writer Caroline Lemke interviewed Clark, and  Bob Grieser photographed him.  </P> <P> </P> <P> I was born and raised here in San Diego. When I was 9 years old, my folks built  a home out in Talmadge, and I've lived there ever since. In fact, I don't think  there's anybody who's lived in their house continuously like I have since 1936.  </P> <P> I had polio as a kid. I walked better then than I do now. I went to Woodrow  Wilson Junior High, and I thought I had died and gone to heaven. They usually  wouldn't let handicapped kids go to public school. In those days, they didn't  have any facilities. Someone on crutches, well, you never saw anybody on  crutches.  </P> <P> If you were handicapped in those days, in the '30s, they had a school called  the Sunshine School you went to.  </P> <P> My first exposure to regular school was at Sacred Heart Grammar School. I went  there in sixth grade. Then the next year, the principal at Woodrow Wilson said,  "Hey, we'll take Monroe in." My folks had to sign a waiver in case I got hurt.  I was the only crippled kid in the school.  </P> <P> And then I went to Hoover. That really expanded my getting around and doing  things. In those days, in 1940, Hoover was one of only two highs schools.  Hoover was the focal point of everything out there in East San Diego.  </P> <P> The war was on. Everybody had this great feeling for their country, their  school, everything. When I went to Hoover, there were only two black kids, and  one Japanese boy, and I can't remember any Mexicans. We had a lot of loyalty;  there was no race prejudice there.  </P> <P> I've only really been volunteering probably less than a year, but through the  Kiwanis Club I've been involved in Hoover since 1953. The Kiwanis sponsor the  Key Club at school, and we sold things at the football games. Now, I announce  the basketball games, and I love it! It's fun being around the kids.  </P> <P> I started thinking, "What can an individual do?" A teacher at Hoover said to  me, 'Well, Bookie, you ought to come over here and get involved in our computer  lab.' When I went in there, there was this little girl sitting there, reading  with the help of a teacher's aide. I said, 'How could a clown like me help a  young girl like that to read?'  </P> <P> The teacher said, 'Just give me two hours.' I like a challenge. I said, 'You're  on.' Now, a couple hours a week isn't enough for me. I go in, and by the end of  the day, I am so pumped up. It's exciting that a fourth-grade Vietnamese girl  wants to read to me.  </P> <P> I see a great need for the community to get involved and do things. Why don't  people who are sitting around volunteer a couple of hours a week at a school?  Anybody could help. If a person would get involved, it's extremely interesting.  </P> <P> The thing I'm interested in is getting other Hoover people to do little things.  It's amazing what little things you can do to make an impression on these kids.  </P> <P> I have a ton of friends who are getting ready to retire and are bored with  life. I'm so doggone busy. . . . I consider myself the luckiest guy in the  whole world. I can't walk nearly as good as I walked five years ago, and I feel  like I'm doing 10 times as much as I did five years ago.  </P></p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Observer: Expert advice There should be more charities around like the Rowntree Foundation, which is behind yesterday's damning report on the government's mortgage rescue scheme. It has probably made a bigger contribution to solving Britain's housing crisis by researching it in a dispassionate way rather than trying to relieve the problem by giving all its money to good causes. In terms of research, the Pounds 6m a year it spends on looking into housing and other social issues is a lot of money, whereas it would not build many houses. Under Richard Best, who took over as director after Robin Guthrie left to be chief charity commissioner, it has made a big push to disseminate its views more widely. As a former director of the National Federation of Housing Associations, Best has the sort of background which commands respect from all sides of the housing debate.</p>

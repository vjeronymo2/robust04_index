			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Major rejects US view on Bosnia MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday re-opened the transatlantic war of words over the west's approach to Bosnia by rejecting demands from Washington for a lifting of the arms embargo, Philip Stephens writes. In a brusque dismissal of recent public criticism by the US of Britain's stance, the prime minister directly contradicted comments by President Bill Clinton. Mr Major denied he had told Mr Clinton that he would find it impossible to sustain his government if he acceded to US requests to allow the resumption of arms sales to the Bosnian Moslems. Instead he had simply pointed out there was no political support for the idea in the UK. Displaying some irritation, the prime minister suggested that criticism by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, of Europe's role in preserving international peace reflected the US administration's domestic problems. He said on BBC Television that a resumption of arms supplies to the warring factions in the former Yugoslav province would add to the bloodshed. It would also end the humanitarian aid effort. He added: 'I believe the policy we are adopting in Bosnia is the right one. I know it is controversial. That does not mean it is wrong. We have done more in Bosnia than any other great nation and we will continue.' Mr Major rejected suggestions that the difference over Bosnia had damaged irreparably Britain's relationship with the Clinton administration.</p>

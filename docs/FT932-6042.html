			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Buses may run on rail tracks after privatisation SOME companies preparing to bid for rail franchises after the privatisation of British Rail are drawing up plans to concrete over the tracks and run buses instead of trains. The controversial idea is likely to add to fears that the government's plans for privatising the railways, due to start in April next year, will lead to the loss of parts of the network. One company - Selab Holdings, a Jersey-based shipping and stevedoring company - has held talks with the Department of Transport about taking over two routes: the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend line running out of London's Fenchurch Street station, and the Chiltern line from London Marylebone to Aylesbury, Bucks. If it wins the franchises to operate the lines, it plans to convert them into guided busways - concrete roads with guide rails at the sides which allow specially built buses to travel at high speeds without needing to be steered by the driver. The Department of Transport confirmed that it had held talks with Selab. It also acknowledged that it had discussed rail conversion schemes with other potential franchisers, but would not identify them. 'Nothing is ruled out,' the department said. 'The intention is that the passenger services should be franchised out as rail services, not on the basis that they would be replaced by something else, but it will be up to the franchising director to consider bids when they are presented to him.' Guided buses are a new form of public transport intended to combine the flexibility of buses with the speed and safety of rail. Buses are driven on conventional roads to pick up and set down passengers at each end of the journey, but use the concrete tracks for the high-speed part of the journey in between. Systems have been introduced in Adelaide, Australia, and Essen, Germany. The privately owned Badgerline bus group has proposed setting up a network in Bristol. Mr Roger Bale, Selab's owner, said he had chosen the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend line and Chiltern line because they were relatively self-contained parts of the railway so conversion would not interfere with other rail traffic. Buses would pick up passengers from residential areas in the suburbs and switch to the guided busways for the run into central London, where they would switch back to ordinary roads for a circuit around the city. Mr Bale said busways provided higher capacity than railways because they did not require signalling and could run more often. 'The aim is to make the journey more convenient and less costly, which in the end will make profit for the operator and attract more clients.'</p>

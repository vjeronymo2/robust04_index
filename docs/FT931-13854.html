			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Bosnian Serbs ratify peace plan: Moslems agree ceasefire with Croatian allies after mediators intervene BOSNIA'S Serbs yesterday approved by an unexpectedly large majority the first stage of an international peace plan, which their leader, Dr Radovan Karadzic, accepted in Geneva last week under extreme duress. Their hands raised in the Serbian Orthodox three-fingered salute, 55 deputies of the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament voted in favour of the constitutional principles for a future state of Bosnia-Hercegovina, with 15 against. The result was deceptive, achieved after two days of fierce debate during which most deputies attacked the international community and pledged never to forego 'holy Serbian goals'. The vote coincided with agreement by Bosnia's Moslem leaders to an immediate ceasefire after recent clashes with their nominal Croatian allies. This followed the intervention of international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. The co-chairmen of the Geneva peace conference on former Yugoslavia had flown to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, yesterday for talks with President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and his prime minister, Mile Akmedzic. Earlier, Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader, had ordered his troops to stop fighting Moslems over disputed territory. After the vote by Bosnian Serbs and the Moslem-Croat truce, it was announced that peace talks would be resumed in Geneva on Saturday. Although the Bosnian Serbs have formally accepted the constitutional framework for Bosnia-Hercegovina, providing for a unitary state divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, it was clear that most deputies were still deeply opposed. 'We have to choose between war and peace,' Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, the hardline speaker of the Bosnian assembly, said. 'The decision was taken under international pressure and threats of isolation.' His statement was a clear reference to the pressure to which Mr Karadzic and the deputies had been subjected by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, anxious to see an end to the conflict and international sanctions against Serbia. At the assembly meeting in a converted canteen, Serbian leaders assured deputies they were not renouncing the creation of a separate Bosnian Serbian republic. They emphasised that the most vital part of the Geneva peace process still lay ahead - talks on the detailed map of the provinces into which the country would be divided. Croatia and Slovenia were yesterday admitted to the International Monetary Fund, allowing them to join the World Bank and giving them access to IMF loans, writes George Graham in Washington. Croatia can expect a quota of SDR261.6m (Pounds 237.5m), while Slovenia's quota will be SDR150.5m. Danish minister angers Greek MEPs, Page 2 Rifkind cautious on military role, Page 9</p>

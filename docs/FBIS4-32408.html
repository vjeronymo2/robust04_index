			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 23 (CTK) -- The National Democratic  Party (NDS) Executive Committee, at its meeting today, expressed  full support for Slovak Privatization Minister Milan Janicina,  an NDS member.    An NDS statement given to CTK says that the growing attacks  on the minister, who is also NDS deputy chairman, from the  Democratic Left Party (SDL), an NDS coalition partner, were  unjustified and contradicted the ethics of coalition cooperation.    Statements by SDL Chairman Peter Weiss, Chairman of the SDL  deputies' group Milan Ftacnik and some other deputies about  Janicina's giving unjustified preference to the coupon method of  privatization compared with other methods are not qualified and  substantiated, the statement says.    The NDS considers it "natural and moral that citizens,  through coupon privatization, receive their share in the  property which they have been creating in the past," the  statement says. The NDS Executive Committee believes that "the  coalition government will meet its commitments and offer  citizens property worth at least 88 billion Slovak crowns (some  3 billion USD)," it adds.    Following unsuccessful attempts by the opposition Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) to dismiss Janicina there have  been calls for a change of privatization minister. It is  primarily the coalition SDL which raises objections towards  Janicina's performance. There has long been speculation about  controversies between Janicina and Economy Minister Petr Magvasi  concerning the concept of privatization.</p>

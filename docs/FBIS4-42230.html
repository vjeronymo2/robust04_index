			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["sm" report: "Bonn Waives Individual Permits"] </F>   [Excerpts] Bonn -- Exports to third countries of weapons  that have been coproduced by Germany and a second country will  no longer have to be approved by the Federal Security Council,  according to new government rules announced by Economics  Minister Guenter Rexrodt. [passage omitted]    These rules do not apply to nuclear, biological, and  chemical  weapons, nor to carrier technologies. These will be assessed on  a case-by-case basis. Rexrodt said that the new rule imposes  greater accountability on enterprises, but does not represent a  departure from the government's existing policy concerning the  granting of permits.</p>

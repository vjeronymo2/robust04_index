			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary from the "Opinion" page: "New Silk Road"] </F>   [Text] Premier Li Peng has just concluded a trip of four  Central Asian nations -- Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrzstan,  Kazakhstan and Mongolia.    This is the first trip ever made by a top Chinese leader to  these neighbouring nations.    Owing to the historical Silk Road, friendly relations have  long existed between China and the Central Asian countries.    Mongolia and China have long enjoyed good relations. And  after the establishment of diplomatic relations in the last few  years, ties between China and the four Central Asian countries  have been expanding rapidly.    The leaders of these five countries have all been to China  in  the last few years for visits which promoted mutual  understanding and strengthened cooperation.    Premier Li's return visit to these five nations is not meant  only as a friendly gesture. It represents China's genuine  desire to further develop mutually beneficial relations with its  neighbouring states.    In Tashkent, Uzbekistan's capital, Li made a candid, sincere  and comprehensive policy statement on China's relations with the  Central Asian countries.    And Li's speech was repeatedly punctuated by applause. The  applause was especially strong when he said, "We cherish  goodwill and friendly sentiment towards the people of Central  Asian countries. We will always be your good friend and  neighbour."    When Li arrived in Kyrgyzstan, on the third leg of his  tour,President Askar Akayev said Li's warm words in Tashkent had  in the space of a few days become household words in the Central  Asian nations.    This shows that Li's statement reflected a common wish of  all  the people in the region and as a result his words touched their  hearts.    China and its neighbours in the northwest are developing  nations who need a peaceful and stable domestic and  international environment to develop their economies.    And the friendship advocated by Li, constitutes the best  guarantee for such an environment.    Trade and economic cooperation between China and its  northwestern neighbours have made much progress in recent years.    However, there is still great potential for further  development. Exchanges in the past have shown that the economies  are complementary. And closer cooperation in economic matters  will be to the advantage of all parties.    Li was accompanied on his tour by a group of Chinese  entrepreneurs.    And on each leg of the premier's tour, these businessmen  held  talks with their counterparts and struck many deals. This was  an effective way of speeding up economic cooperation.    Li also discussed other projects with his hosts. The  building of the Turkmenistan-China-Japan gas pipeline is just  one example.    Li's trip has deepened understanding and promoted goodwill  with the five northwestern nations and has created conditions  for further economic cooperation and cultural exchange.    And it is expected that the new Silk Road will bring greater  prosperity China and our northwest neighbours in the future.</p>

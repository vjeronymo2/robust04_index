			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Media statement issued by the Ministry of Constitutional </F> Development and of Communication on the SAPA PR Wire Service on  28 March]    [Text] Delegations of the South African Government, kwaZulu  government, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the African National  Congress [ANC] met in Pretoria today. The delegations were led  by Minister Roelf Meyer, Dr Ben Ngubane, Mr Joe Matthews and Mr  Cyril Ramaphosa.    The delegations agreed to make the following proposal to  their respective principals:    That a meeting between the state president, Mr F. W. de  Klerk, the king of the Zulu nation, King Goodwill Zwelithini,  Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi of kwaZulu and the president  of the ANC, Mr Nelson Mandela should as a matter of extreme  urgency take place on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning  (30 - 31 March 1993) to address the following:    -- The current escalation of violence and the appalling  killing    of people in our country;    -- The necessity of creating a climate under which free  and fair    elections can take place; and    -- The need to find urgent solutions to the political  differences    which underlie the current tensions such as the position of    King Goodwill Zwelithini under the new constitutional    dispensation.    The meeting was appalled by the killings which occurred in  Johannesburg today and call for an immediate cessation of  violence and a commitment to lawful and democratic means of  solving problems.</p>

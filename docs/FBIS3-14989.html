Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Monday, Samsonov  said that the troops will be reinforced by additional  contingents of CIS states which are providing peace-keeping  assistance to the republic under inter-state agreements.    The decision to this effect was adopted by the CIS defence  ministers at their two-day meeting in Moscow last week.    Samsonov stressed that the decision on measures to stabilise  the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border adopted by the defence  ministers will be transformed into a law at the upcoming session  of the CIS heads of state.    Under the existing agreements, Kyrgyzstan will reinforce its  contingent in Tajikistan and Kazakhstan will send in a battalion  in the near future.    If Afghan mujahideen and the Tajik opposition launch a  large-scale offensive on the border in the spring or summer,  "the available peace-keeping troops will not be enough to repel  it," Samsonov said.    Asked about disagreements between the military delegations  of  CIS states, Samsonov said that the decision on the stabilisation  of the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border was signed by all  delegations, except Belarus.</p>

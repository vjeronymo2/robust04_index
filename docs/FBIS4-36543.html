			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The effective beginning of the period following  the accord on rescheduling the public debt seems to be  characterized by the government's control of available data and  by drawing the main lines of the strategy in order to avoid as  much as possible any negative repercussions -- all while  eliminating any possible difficulty in the postagreement period.    All this transpires before highlighting the positive effect  of the agreement, which often emerges in the long run. The  statement by Finance Minister Ahmed Benbitour falls within this  context. Benbitou stressed that the most important thing was the  speed with which the loans obtained up to date from the IMF, in  accordance with the agreement, will be used. Bachir Hedibel  reports:    [Hedibel] During the period following the Paris Club  agreement, which is the same period preceded by the transitional  agreement with the IMF, the government will work to focus its  efforts on reducing the budget deficit, so the latter will reach  3.2 percent next year. This is the content of the statement  made by the finance minister.    Benbitour hopes today for a speedy use of the loans granted  to Algeria by the IMF or other financial institutions, or in  accordance with the agreement with Paris Club. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Quayle rejects policy shift after Californian riots THE Bush administration's response to disturbances in Los Angeles will be based on the principles of 'law enforcement, opportunity and values', according to Mr Dan Quayle, US vice-president. Mr Quayle yesterday said President George Bush had told him on Saturday that the most important message he had picked up on his two-day tour of the riot-stricken city last week was the respect that people had for the Los Angeles Police Department and for those who had come in to restore law and order. 'We are going to stand up for the law abiding, tax-paying Americans who contribute to the community,' Mr Quayle insisted. The vice-president promised a more activist administration approach, but no new programmes. Gun control, for example, was not part of the solution, he said. 'Many of the Koreans in Los Angeles were glad they had guns,' he said in a television interview. He reiterated existing administration policies - including the creation of enterprise zones, wider home ownership and choice in education - as the correct response to inner-city problems. Most of these had been low on the White House political agenda before the Los Angeles disturbances, but Mr Quayle urged Congress to act on them swiftly. Mr Bush is travelling to Philadelphia today presumably to deliver a similar message, although perhaps without the harder, more conservative edge associated with his vice-president. He has scheduled a meeting with congressional leaders tomorrow to discuss legislative action. The president's political advisers are conscious of the risk, in an election year, of being too passive in responding to events in Los Angeles. However, the administration is patently divided between orthodox conservative philosophy, represented by Mr Quayle and emphasising law and order, and the more interventionist policy ideas advocated by Mr Jack Kemp, housing secretary, for the last three years without much success. This internal tension explains why Mr Bush's own responses over the past 10 days have been so variable. These have ranged from a near acceptance that the acquittal of the policemen accused of beating Mr Rodney King was a miscarriage of justice to blaming inner-city problems on the liberal Great Society programmes enacted in the 1960s. Mr Kemp said yesterday that the 'Great Society did not cause the Los Angeles riots'. He said it had provided 'the net below which people should not fall, but not the ladder by which they could climb'.</p>

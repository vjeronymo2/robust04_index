			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman, today received brother Lakhdar  Brahimi, personal envoy of UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus  Butrus-Ghali. During the meeting, the two sides discussed  issues related to Lakhdar Ibrahimi's fact-finding mission in our  country.    The president welcomed the UN secretary general's envoy. He  reiterated our country's compliance with UN Security Council  Resolution No. 924 on the situation in the Republic of Yemen,  and its readiness to extend all possible support to guarantee  the success of the mission of the UN secretary general's envoy.    The Presidential Council chairman also stressed that the  forces of unity and legitimacy are fully abiding by the  cease-fire, but the gang of rebellion and secession deliberately  refuses to respond to and violates UN Security Council  Resolution No. 924 in an attempt to internationalize the  internal crisis in our country. He pointed out that the only  thing that could prove the gang of rebellion and secession has  responded to the resolution is for it to stop firing artillery  shells at the positions of our Armed Forces at the entrances of  the city of Aden, and pledge not to use what remains of the  warplanes this secessionist gang has used to bombard the forces  of unity and legitimacy along all axes.    The brother president said he has instructed our Armed  Forces  to observe a cease-fire as of 1800 [1500 GMT] today in  implementation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 924, and to  give a third chance to the rebellious and secessionist gang,  hoping that this gang will not repeat its violations of the  cease-fire, and will not continue its aggression against our  Armed Forces. He emphasized that the forces of unity and  legitimacy will fully and decisively comply with the cease-fire  at all axes.    Brother Lakhdar Brahimi has expressed appreciation for the  cooperation of the brother president and the officials in our  country, for their care to make his mission a success, for  complying with UN Security Council Resolution No. 924, and for  doing all that will restore stability and security to Yemen.    Attending the meeting were Muhammad Salim Basindwah,  minister  of foreign affairs, and ambassador Muhammad Hadi, director of  the Arab Department at the Foreign Ministry.</p>

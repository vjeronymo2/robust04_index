			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Control Data up sharply CONTROL DATA, the US computer manufacturer, reported stronger than expected first-quarter results, boosted by a one-time restructuring gain. The company warned, however, that it did not expect to be able to maintain this pace of recovery, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco. First-quarter net earnings were Dollars 7m, or 16 cents per share, compared with Dollars 6.8m, or 16 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues fell to Dollars 405.8m from Dollars 421.6m in the first quarter of 1990. First-quarter earnings per share from operations were 6 cents per share, compared with 3 cents per share in 1990. Revenues in the 1990 period included contributions from several operations that have since been sold or discontinued. Mr Lawrence Perlman, president and chief executive, said: 'We do not expect the company's operations to sustain the pace of improvement recorded in the first quarter. However, we remain optimistic that Control Data can achieve better results in 1991 than it did in 1990.' In 1990, Control Data reported earnings of Dollars 2.7m, or 6 cents per share, on revenues of Dollars 1.69bn. Net earnings in the 1991 first quarter include a net pre-tax restructuring gain of Dollars 5.4m. The gain resulted in part from the sale of an equity stake in Seagate Technology, but was balanced by restructuring charges of Dollars 40.9m.</p>

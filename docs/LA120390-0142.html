			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> JAY THOMAS SAVORS HIS VARIETY  </P> <P> "Guest star to the world" is how Jay Thomas, the abrasive tabloid-TV host Jerry  Gold on "Murphy Brown," describes his career.  </P> <P> "It's almost like I have this fit for three hours every morning -- and then go  to work," Thomas said in the Dec. 8 issue of TV Guide.  </P> <P> Los Angeles radio listeners know Thomas as "The Morning Zoo" host on radio  station KPWR-FM. On his weekday "nothing is sacred" show, he trashes  everything, including his Emmy nomination for "Murphy Brown."  </P> <P> Then it's off to the set of his current show -- "Married People" -- as Russell  Meyers, a yuppie writer and househusband. Thomas also plays hockey goalie Eddie  LeBec on "Cheers" and was deli owner Remo DaVinci on "Mork &amp; Mindy."  </P></p>

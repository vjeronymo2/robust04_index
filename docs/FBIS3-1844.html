			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Hu Angang (5170 7254 6921), and Kang Xiaoguang (1660 </F> 2556 0342) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences National  Conditions Analysis Group: "Creating New Systems To Eradicate  Corruption Once and For All (Part One of Three)"]    [Text] Editor's note: This is a "report on national  conditions," which has already been submitted to the CPC top  echelon.    Hu Angang, and Kang Xiaoguang, two young or middle-aged  scholars from mainland China recently presented this updated  "report on national conditions," which focuses on analyzing the  current corruption issue and sets out the original idea of  creating new systems to eradicate corruption.    Last year, the report on national conditions set out by Hu  Angang and Wang Shaoguang [3769 4801 0342] dealt with augmenting  the central government's guidance in the conversion of the  market economy and many of their suggestions in the report have  been adopted by the CPC top echelon and became the contents in  the plan for improvement, of which the most popular was the  "tax-sharing system."    Likewise, the new report on national conditions aims at the  malpractice of the day, by making in-depth and incisive  analysis, and embodies the courage and vision of intellectuals  of a new generation on the mainland. In their analysis, the 4  June incident was under reexamination.    It has not been long since the report was presented and the  reaction by the CPC top echelon is still unknown; however, when  some intellectuals read the report in question, they shared the  "heavy hearts" of the authors in their reaction.    Beginning today, this paper will carry excerpts of this  report in three installments. The report analyzes the present  conditions and causes of corruption, and boldly explores  measures to achieve a radical cure. The academic discussions  are deleted because of a limit in space without the authors  permission. [end editor's note]  <H3>  The Extent of Corruption Has Become Cancerous </H3> It is not exaggerating to say that the extent of corruption in  mainland China has already become cancerous and is rapidly  spreading throughout the society. Any government whcih is  incapable of fighting corruption will be an incompetent one.  All such governments are destined to collapse. It is  impossible for a corrupt and incompetent government to carry out  modernization. The inevitable ending is that the people will  overthrow the corrupt government. It does not matter whether or  not the government collapses; nevertheless, modernization will  vanish like soap bubbles and the goal of catching up with the  world advanced countries, for which several generations have  strived, will be out of the question.    This report proceeds from the institutional factor to  analyze  the root cause of corruption in China and to explore and discuss  the channels for eradicating corruption. A basic viewpoint of  this report is that it is imperative to create new systems to  eradicate corruption and to guarantee reform, opening up, and  development by fighting corruption. The report comprises of  five parts. The authors devote the first part to analyzing the  institutional root cause of corruption during the period of  conversion to the market economy. The authors define corruption  as being rent-seeking [xun zu 1416 4436] activity. The essence  of corruption in China is precisely the fact that officials from  the top down are vying for acting as ones seeking leases and  motivated by personal gain under the role of stimulating  mechanism. In the second part, the authors brief on several  kinds of the most common rent-seeking activities, including the  dual-price system, special economic privileges, high tariffs,  and import quotas, and the "preferential policies" for some  regions or groups. The authors believe that the government's  excessive intervention and a distorted market will provide  monopoly for particular interest groups and the cause for  rent-seeking activities taking on a vicious cycle. The third  part sets out the concept that "development is the last word as  is fighting corruption" [fa zhan si yin dao li, fan fu bai ye  si yin dao li 4099 1455 2508 4289 6670 3810 0646 5201 2408 0048  2508 4289 6670 3810] and indicate the imperativeness of holding  aloft the banner of reform and opening and the banner of  fighting corruption simultaneously, to create new systems to  eradicate corruption and guarantee reform and opening by  fighting corruption. The fourth part sets out the concept that  creating new systems is the basic channel for fighting  corruption; it is necessary to do away with or cut back rent [zu  jin 4436 6855] and restrict rent-seekers as well as special  privilege groups through institutions. In creating new systems,  it is unnecessary to launch mass campaigns to avoid  anticorruption struggle evolving into a "Great Cultural  Revolution." And the last part focuses on designing major  measures for creating new systems to eradicate corruption, such  as lifting controls over loan interest rates, while including  them on the track of the market interest rates, and advocating  the concept of "everyone being equal before interest rates";  lifting control over foreign exchange rates, while merging them  with the market exchange rates; removing nontariff trade walls  and lowering tariff rates by a wide margin; publicly auctioning  import licenses and delegating the powers of direct imports and  exports to enterprises in various categories; abolishing  industrial administrative departments and commissions and  establishing trades associations; strictly restricting monopoly  and unfair competition and guaranteeing enterprises in all  categories can freely join or withdraw from the trade to  participate in competition; strictly banning party and  government organizations from running companies, reducing the  scope of administrative officials, raising their salaries by a  wide margin, while "supporting the government with normal  taxes"; and, at the same time, strictly banning the Army from  participating in business, while "supporting the Army with  normal taxes" to increase military expenditure by a wide margin.   <H3>    I. The Institutional Root Cause of Corruption:  Economic Rent </H3>   True, the atmosphere of corruption in society is related to  the ideology, morals, and style of some party and government  cadres. However, should the atmosphere of corruption remain  despite repeated banning and rage with ever greater ferocity,  that must be highly connected with the system. Today, our  anticorruption struggle is to a large extent a moral practice;  in actual fact, the corruption today is mainly institutional  corruption. The major root cause of the phenomena of corruption  lies chiefly in institutional shortcomings, namely, the  institutional shortcomings in the period of converting to the  market economy. With such a system, even those straight and  honest people would soon degenerate and join the rank and file  of corruption, becoming captives of institutional corruption as  soon as they have power in their hands.  <H5>  Rent-Seeking Activities Lead To Worsening of Corruption </H5>   Let us take a look at an example of "lobbying a ministry for  allotment of funds." Suppose a certain central department has  10 million yuan of financial allotment of funds or for project  investment and 10 provinces would like to acquire the monetary  resources. Because of the limitation in funds, it is impossible  for every province to get them, thus competition between them  takes shape. The representative of every province is ready to  spend 1 million yuan to openly, or semi-openly, "bribe" the  department in question in order to obtain a monetary resource  that is 10 times the cost of the bribe. Suppose some province  has succeeded in obtaining the allotment with a bribery cost  greater than 1 million yuan. When the present value of the  monopoly after discount is 10 million yuan, with the general  volume of the resource remaining unchanged, the resource will  flow from nine losers to one successful province. This is like  gambling, with many people buying lottery tickets and only one  or two lucky ones hitting the jackpot.    Rent-seeking activities have exemplary effects which lead to  the worsening of corruption. Because rent-seekers can easily  obtain huge or super high profits without going through market  competition and technical renovation, this provides a strong  stimulation to them while attracting more people to participate  in rent-seeking activities, resulting in the spread of  corruption on a still wider scope. Rent-seeking does not lead  to an increase in social wealth; on the contrary, it leads to  low efficiency in resource allocation and a grave waste of  resources.  <H3>  To Find a Radical Cure for Corruption, the "Rent" Must Be  Abolished </H3>   In the course of converting to the market economy, the  dual-price system is the root cause leading to extensive  rent-seeking activities. Economic rent equates the difference  between the market and official prices. Here, prices are  referred to in a broad sense, including commodity prices,  capital prices (interest rates), foreign exchange prices  (exchange rates), and prices for imports (quotas and permits.)  So long as the two-track price system exists, economic rent  will surface, stimulating officials with power and rent-seekers  with money to participate and share the economic rent and the  phenomena of corruption will grow increasingly serious. That is  precisely the institutional root cause for the phenomena of  corruption in China. In reality, officials are economic bodies  and have motives of personal gain. Under certain restrictions,  (such as institutional and moral restrictions) their behavioral  criterion is to seek their own maximum interest. It is not  abnormal for officials to have motives of personal gain. In  China, an official's objective function can possibly be: The  expansion of the economic strength of his own unit or locality,  an expression to his accomplishments in government, his  promotion, increase in actual or invisible income, a say in  distributing resources, and consideration for his children,  friends, and relatives. Because officials have motives of  personal gain, they must be restricted with institutions. The  crux lies in the system that shapes the "economic rent." When  someone has "something for rent," people will bribe him for that  something and will he turn down the bribe when there is no  institutional restriction? Whoever is in that position will  have the chance to seek something for rent and be stimulated by  such rent-seeking activities. So long as such "rents" exist in  the system, corruption will be bred. The only solution to it is  to create new systems, build new-type modern systems, abolish  such "rents," and create new systems to eradicate corruption.  <H5>  II. The Most Common Rent-Seeking Activities </H5>   Rent-seeking activities are connected with the government's  excessive intervention in the market; without such intervention,  and the particular monopoly provided by such intervention, there  would be no way to seek such rent. Here, a point needs be  explained, namely, there are two sides to government's  intervention in the market economy. When the government's  intervention creates conditions for fair competition in the  market economy, implements the unified taxation system and tax  rates, builds a unified market system to prevent the shaping of  monopoly by some interest groups, such intervention is effective  and falls in the category of proper intervention. When the  government's intervention results in a distorted market,  jeopardizing the fairness in market competition while providing  some interest groups with preferential policies and implementing  discriminatory policies for other interest groups, such  intervention will be ineffective and fall in the category of  excessive intervention. This being the case, the excessive  government intervention has provided legitimacy for rent-seeking  activities, whereas many rent-seekers have conveniently found  grounds for legitimate rent-seeking from government policies,  institutions, and regulations. That is the fundamental cause  for the worsening of rent-seeking activities.   <H3>    Worsening of Rent-seeking Activities Because of  Intervention </H3>   In the course of converting to the market economy, the most  common rent-seeking activities are:    First, the dual-price system. Excessive government  intervention results in price distortion. For example, when the  government controls the prices of certain commodities, because  of great demand, market prices are far higher than official  prices and the price differences shape into economic rent. For  another example, the government controls the volume of bank  loans and interest rates and the market interest rates are twice  the official interest rates. The bank directors, clerks in  charge of loans, and the rent-seekers share the "interest rent."  Take still another example, the government controls the volume  of foreign exchange as well as exchange rates, with the market  exchange rates far higher than official ones. Those officials  who have the power to examine and approve foreign exchanges are  those who enjoy the "exchange rate rent."    Here, a point that needs be explained is that since reform,  the degree of marketization in China has rapidly expanded and  the dual- price system tends to transit in the direction of the  one-track market price system. Presently, prices of farm and  sideline produce, retail prices of commodities in society, and  prices for production materials under the state's direct control  or planning guidance account for a very small proportion.  Although the rent in this area remains, it is taking on a  tendency to wane or disappear. Likewise, the dual-track system  of foreign exchange rates is moving toward a merger between the  two and the bulk of foreign exchanges are transacted according  to the market exchange rates. Likewise, rent in this area is  waning or disappearing. Presently, the largest rent comes from  the banks loans and interest rates. The government continues to  intervene in bulk in the volume of loans and compulsively  stipulates interest rates. Although the official interest rates  have risen somewhat they are still far lower than the market  interest rates. With a special permit from the state, the bank,  this particular interest group, shares the greatest rent by  monopolizing the use of the rarest resource--capital. A glance  at the most luxurious bank buildings that have risen up in many  large cities, including many counties and towns, serves as  evidence to prove this point. They are just part of the rent  and have a very close resemblance to the external characteristic  of major banks all over the United States.    Second, special economic privileges. Primarily this refers  to privileges beyond the law and institutions and second, it  refers to special economic permits which have violated the  principle of fair competition and which the law and institutions  have failed to restrict. For example, the trade's monopoly in  operation, allowing only state-owned enterprises the power to  monopolize the operation in some trades, while barring  enterprises in other categories to freely enter and participate  in competition; protecting the essential income of a small  number of state-owned enterprises which is higher than the  essential income of other industries. A typical example is the  petrochemical industry, with the entire industry monopolized by  a single company. Consequently, this special interest group  enjoys the economic rent all by itself. Take for another  example, the special permit for producing or marketing certain  categories of commodities. The exclusive possession of the  trade in tobacco, or in the operation of telephone and telegram  services are on lease with a special permit issued by the  government. When those enterprises acquire the monopoly, they  willreceive monopolized profits, namely profits exceeding the  normal level.    When the government allows some special interest groups to  have an industrial monopoly and a special permit in operation,  the unhealthy atmosphere in the trade will remain stubbornly  despite repeated bans. On the other hand, those interest groups  will draw a portion from their monopolized profits to bribe  government officials so that the latter can come out in the open  to intervene and impede other enterprises from participating in  competition to protect their monopoly status and guarantee that  their industrial economic rent will not be expanded and shared  by others. This being the case, to abolish those special  economic privileges and allow other enterprises to participate  in fair competition is the way to radically cure the unhealthy  atmosphere in trades.    Third, high tariffs for imports and import quotas. There are  both advantages and disadvantages in high tariffs to the  development of national industry. From the angle of advantages,  high tariffs serve to protect the infantile national industry  from international competition and enable it to develop rapidly.  From the angle of disadvantages, when the industry is to  transcend the infantile phase and is monopolized by a small  number of enterprises, those enterprises will give up their  efforts to improve technology and quality and augment their  market competitiveness with the protection of high tariffs.  They enjoy the same essential income far higher than other  industries.    The control over import quotas and import permits has become  the major source, as well as chief characteristic, of  rent-seeking by foreign trade departments and companies. A  foreign trade company general manager said publicly: "If we  delegate power of imports and exports to enterprises, who then  will support us?" Obviously, to artificially set up a tariff  wall, implementoing an operational monopoly in foreign trade is  actually protecting the vested interests of those government-run  organizations and monopoly groups under the pretext of  protecting national interest.    And fourth, the government's "preferential policies" for  certain regions or groups. Everyone knows that "preferential  policy" is not a mere scrap of paper but has a great content of  gold, which equates providing certain monopoly to a certain  province or trade. For example, regarding the implementation of  "tax reduction or exemption" over a certain province, the  conversion of resources takes the form of handing over less  taxes to the state; the province or trade that succeeds in  acquiring such "preferential policy" is always the one that pays  the least tax (referring to ratio), and which equates with  enjoying a "blood transfusion" from other provinces and regions,  thus indirectly acquiring a sort of economic rent.  <H5>  Special Groups Monopolize Huge Profits </H5>   Aside from the aforesaid rent-seeking activities, there are  stil other types of such activities which, in essence, are all  utilizing institutional shortcomings and enabling a small number  of special interest groups to resort to means of unfair  competition to acquire tremendous profits through monopoly.    In a nutshell, the government's excessive intervention has  shifted market distortion which, in turn, gives rise to economic  rent and stimulates rent-seekers' corruption. The greater the  extent of the government's excessive intervention, the more  obvious is market extortion and the higher the economic rent  will be. That is the main cause for the increasingly intense  corruption in Chinese society today. However, there are two  sides in government intervention. If government intervention is  capable of readjusting and correcting market distortion,  economic rent will be reduced, as will the phenomena of  corruption. Obviously, such intervention does not mean to  change the market economic mechanism and restore the planned  economic structure; on the contrary, it is to make full use of  the market economic mechanism and cure corruption through  creating new systems.  <H5>  III. Development Is the Last Word, As Is Anticorruption </H5>   "Development is the last word." Without development, there  would be no way out for China. Development has always been  China's most important economic goal. However, development  involves some conditions and corruption should not be the price  nor the lubricant for development. To engage in corruption is  doubtlessly suicidal and is sure to jeopardize development, lose  opportunities, and interrupt the process of modernization in  China.    The "4 June" incident is a typical example that gave us much  food for thought. In analyzing the causes of the incident, Deng  Xiaoping said: "One of the causes is the breeding of corruption  phenomena which has made some of the masses lose faith in the  party and government." In addition, he said: "No slogans on  opposing reform and opening have surfaced in the recent incident  and the slogans focused on fighting corruption. Of course, to  some people, such slogans are just a background and aimed at  bewildering people's minds with anticorruption." That showed  the breeding of corruption had roused complaints from the broad  masses, which was an important cause that sparked the "4 June"  incident. Otherwise, there would not have been a million people  taking to the street demonstrating in Beijing. History is our  best teacher. However, times have passed and circumstances  changed and few people would think today: What suddenly sparked  the "4 June" incident? And still fewer people would care:  Would such an incident repeat itself from now on? Nevertheless,  should a nation lack profound reviewing and serious  understanding such an incident, it could hardly avoid a  repetition of the historical tragedy.  <H5>  Five Types of Periodical Shock and Social Instability </H5>   Reviewing the more than 40 year's historical progress, we  find two outstanding characteristics in the social development  of China: First, a considerably high economic growth rate; and  second, the instability of economic and social development,  accompanied by five types of periodical shock, namely, periods  of economic fluctuations, structural change, political struggle,  mass campaigns, and student movements. Such instability finds  root in the economic system within the Chinese Government.  Despite the fact that great changes have taken place in various  systems in China since reform, such instability can still be  very keenly felt. Regarding the relations and causes for these  five types of cycles, the authors will discuss this further in  another article. Here we shall do some analysis centering  around the issue of the rise of corruption and anticorruption.    The CPC as a party in office since the PRC's founding has  controlled the bulk of economic resources of the whole society,  with a huge state organ controlling those resources.  (Explanation: The words bureaucrat and bureaucracy are used  neutrally in the following.) Simultaneously, two issues  surface; first, the flooding of bureaucratism and low work  efficiency and second, the malpractice of acting the high and  mighty official and corruption. Because of the lack of an  external force to restrict power, as well as an independent  supervising system, those two issues have always awaited a  solution and perplexed the leading members. Mao Zedong's way  was precisely to frequently unfold political struggles and  launch mass campaigns. The movement against the three evils  [corruption, waste, and bureaucracy], the movement against the  five evils [bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property,  cheating on government contracts, and stealing economic  information as practiced by owners of private industrial and  commercial enterprises], and also the "four clean-up movements"  were all to conduct periodical purges of corrupt elements and  the opposition inside the bureaucratic system; however, he  believed that all those movements had failed to resolve the  problems. Hence, the imperativeness of the "Great Cultural  Revolution," namely, relying on the masses outside the  bureaucratic system to launch a noninstitutional purge on a  still wider scope. During the period of the "Cultural  Revolution," Mao Zedong landed himself in a "dilemma": On the  one hand, he wanted to do all he could to destroy the huge  bureaucratic organ which he had personally founded; on the  other, he had to rebuild another bureaucratic organ, which a  modern country must rely on for its operation. However, he  refused to resign to such a situation and, before he passed  away, he was determined to carry the "Great Cultural Revolution"  through to the end. The tragedy of Mao Zedong in his later  years was very complicated. We have to acknowledge that his  stubbornness in fighting bureaucratism and corruption  represented the aspirations of the broadest masses;  nevertheless, when he resorted to noninstitutional means (such  as class struggle, political struggle, and mass campaign,) we  cannot evade the fact that he committed fatal mistakes and  eventually dragged the entire nation into an abyss of turmoil.    In the course of rebuilding the state bureaucratic organ  since reform, the planned economic structure characterized by  centralization has gradually been broken up, with the market  economic mechanism characterized by decentralization in  decisionmaking; at the same time, organizations of legislation,  supervision, and law enforcement have gradually been set up,  completed, and perfected. This shows that China has made  substantial progress in the development toward marketization  economically and legalization socially. However, the issues of  bureaucratism and corruption have not been settled, because of  the aforesaid cause of institutional shortcomings and the  surfacing of special interest groups, which will be discussed  later in this article, corruption has become the greatest social  pollution in China in the conversion to the market economy and  is continuously worsening the social environment.  <H5>  Corruption Inside the Party Might Interrupt Reform </H5>   Corruption has always been the gravedigger for the  government.    We are anxious that the vicious corruption inside the party  is the most likely factor which will interrupt the course of  reform and modernization from now on. The man in the street  outspokenly refers to some cadres as "corrupt officials" and  "local tyrants and evil gentry." Inner-party corruption will  lead to the Communist Party and its government losing the  foundation of their legitimacy, namely, the people's approval of  the party and government is reducing. That is one of the  expressions that the national strength of Chain is universally  waning. Some scholars have noticed that corruption has  politically endangered the prestige and strength of the party  and the state political power, resulting in the people's doubts  about the political authority of the Communist Party and the  state. The corruption of the rank and file of cadres of the  party and state will eventually shake the foundations of the  party and state power as well as the entire social system, hence  social instability.    "Water may allow a vessel to float on it and it can also  upset it." Should we allow corruption to spread unchecked,  while failing to thoroughly resolve corruption, especially, the  high-ranking tier inside the party, it is not impossible for the  Communist Party to collapse because of institutional corruption.  In actual fact, the party leaders are aware of this possibility.</p>

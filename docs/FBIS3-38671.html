			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl  has called on the West to pay closer attention to the social  effects of the reforms in the countries in East Europe,  particularly in the states of the former Soviet Union. This was  one of the most important conclusions to be drawn from the  election results in Russia, the chancellor said today at a  conference on security policy in Munich. A further opening of  western markets to goods from the reformist countries is of  "strategic importance." More open markets would lead to  problems and strains, but are ultimately cheaper than "isolation  and a fortress mentality," the chancellor said. At the same  time, he called for a more equal distribution of financial  burdens in the stabilization of economic and social conditions  in Central and East Europe. Germany has reached the limit of  its capacity.    It was right for the West not to give the Central and East  European states any unequivocal promises regarding admission,  Kohl said. This would only have led to new divisions and thus  new tensions in Europe. The deeply rooted fear of encirclement  and isolation in Russia must be taken seriously. At the same  time, Kohl spoke in favor of letting the reformist states know,  "through quite practical steps" that they are welcome in the  European Union [EU]. Kohl suggested inviting the government  heads of these states to an EU summit once a year.    Kohl warned against viewing the EU solely as "a glorified  free trade zone." The Germans in particular need political  union to prevent relapses into political circumstances like  those at the beginning of the 20th century. Political union is  the precondition for peace and freedom in Europe in the 21st  century, the chancellor underlined.    Kohl said it is "indispensable" for Germany to take part in  "peacekeeping and peacemaking measures" of the international  community. Not least for this reason, Germany needs a  Bundeswehr capable of meeting the "new demands" and equipped  accordingly. This does not mean the militarization of German  foreign policy. Kohl rejected sending German soldiers to the  civil war area in former Yugoslavia, however, "in view of recent  history."</p>

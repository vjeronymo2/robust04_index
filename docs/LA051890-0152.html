			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION SOFTBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> STRONG PITCHING KEYS KENNEDY, GARDEN GROVE  </P> <P> This year's Southern Section 4-A softball final just might be an all-Garden  Grove League affair. Orange County powers Kennedy, the 4-A division's  second-seeded team, and fourth-seeded Garden Grove could meet in the  championship game.  </P> <P> First-round 4-A games are scheduled for 3 p.m. today, with Kennedy (21-3-1) at  home against La Habra (15-11) and Garden Grove (21-4-1) at home against Sunny  Hills (11-12).  </P> <P> Kennedy and Garden Grove, co-champions of the Garden Grove League, are evenly  matched as evidenced by a 20-inning, 1-1 tie in their first meeting. Kennedy  won the second game, 1-0, in 11 innings.  </P> <P> Kennedy won the division title two years ago and lost to Western in the  semifinals last year. Both years, pitcher Cheryl Longeway helped the Fighting  Irish advance. Longeway, now a junior, is 16-2-1 with 159 strikeouts and an  0.22 earned-run average.  </P> <P> Garden Grove has Orange County's strikeout leader, senior Stephanie (Smitty)  Smith, who has struck out 282, a school record. She is 21-4-1 with an 0.07 ERA.  </P> <P> Another 4-A contender is third-seeded Buena Park (16-3-2). The Coyotes won  their first Freeway League championship since 1976. Buena Park is led by senior  pitcher Shannon Akau (16-3), who has an 0.16 ERA with 176 strikeouts, and  senior catcher Kari Escobedo, a .417 hitter.  </P> <P> The top three teams in the Orange League -- Savanna (23-7), Valencia (20-9) and  Western (13-18) -- don't appear to have the pitching to contend with Kennedy or  Garden Grove.  </P> <P> The Century League entrants might have a little better luck. Canyon (21-6)  ranked fifth in the final county coaches' poll and shared the Century League  championship with Villa Park (13-10-1).  </P> <P> Rounding out the county entrants in 4-A are Pacifica (12-8) and Sunny Hills.  </P> <P> In the 1-A division, Santa Margarita (14-3) travels to Huntington Park to meet  St. Matthias (5-6-1) and Calvary Chapel travels to Los Angeles to take on Notre  Dame Academy (12-7).  </P> <P> In the small schools division, Liberty Christian (17-4) is at home against  Providence (9-4-1).  </P> <P> In Division 4-A play Thursday:  </P> <P> Villa Park 3, Fontana 0 -- Munique Hernandez (12-4) pitched a three-hitter,  struck out six and walked one to lead host Villa Park (14-10-1). Fontana is  13-9.Michele D'Amato had one hit, one RBI and Robyn Kerfoot had two hits and  scored a run for Villa Park.  </P></p>

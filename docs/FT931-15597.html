			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Sweden There is something disconcerting about watching Sweden grapple with its economic problems from the vantage point of the UK. Both countries tried in vain to control inflation by linking their currencies to the D-Mark. Both are grappling with the consequences: deep recession, a surging budget deficit and debilitating bad debt problems in the financial sector. Problems are markedly worse in Sweden's case. But its efforts to extricate itself, exemplified in yesterday's budget, may hold some lessons for the UK. Sweden has little room for higher taxes. Raising VAT would only add to the upward pressures on prices from last year's devaluation. As in the UK, the chances of seriously cutting the budget deficit may depend on harsh decisions on benefits. This is hard in a recession. Yesterday's spending cuts, though in line with expectations, still gave markets pause for thought about whether they were adequate. Next year's projected deficit of SKr162bn assumes an optimistic growth expectation of 1.6 per cent. The question is how such deficits can be financed. One answer, doubly seductive because it might bring export-led recovery, could be to encourage capital inflows by allowing the krona to depreciate further. The central bank worries about the inflationary consequences, but this approach would allow lower short-term interest rates which, at over 10 per cent, are still an impediment to recovery. If the budget deficit proves truly intractable, Sweden may have no choice. Ultimately the same could turn out true of the UK. In which case arguments about the PSBR undermining equity prices would take on a very different tone.</p>

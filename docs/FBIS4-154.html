			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shaun Johnson and Esther Waugh] </F>   [Text] A memorandum bluntly stating that free elections in  KwaZulu/Natal were impossible without direct political  intervention was the primary catalyst for the eventual  declaration of this week's state of emergency there. The  confidential three-page memorandum, with 15 pages of supporting  documentation, was presented by Independent Electoral Commission  [IEC] chairman Judge Johann Kriegler to President F W de Klerk  and ANC leader Nelson Mandela in Pretoria on March 24. An  edited version was released to the media the same day. The  state of emergency was declared on March 31.    Appended to the original document -- a copy of which has  been  seen by WEEKEND STAR -- was a nine-point memorandum from the IEC  to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, setting out the guarantees the  IEC wanted from Ulundi regarding co-operation in allowing the  election to take place in KwaZulu/Natal.    It was the reaction to this memorandum by Buthelezi, King  Goodwill Zwelithini, several KwaZulu Ministers and members of  the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly that led the IEC to give its  own ultimatum to De Klerk the following day.  <H5>  List of Demands </H5>   In the memorandum to Buthelezi dated March 23, the IEC  proposed that in order to "execute its mandate of conducting an  election within the territory of KwaZulu", it requested that  Buthelezi "cause instructions to be given forthwith that":     -  The KwaZulu Department of Education make schools available  for use as polling stations.    -  Principals give telephone technicians access to their  schools.    -  KwaZulu government buildings, including tribal authority and  magistrates' offices, be made available for election purposes.    -  The KwaZulu Department of the Interior cooperate with the IEC  on matters including the issuing of identity documents and  seconding staff.    -  The KwaZulu Department of Justice make facilities available  for  the IEC Adjudication Secretariat.    -  Amakhosi [chiefs] and other KwaZulu officials and authorities  assist the IEC and observer groups.    -  The KwaZulu departments of Health and of Pensions and Welfare  co-operate with the IEC in facilitating special votes.    -  The KwaZulu Police provide security for IEC staff and secure  the election process, as well as participate fully with other  groups in security planning.   <H5>    `Operation Access' </H5>   The IEC memorandum to Buthelezi also proposed the  establishment of a working committee, and informed the KwaZulu  authorities that the IEC intended to launch "Operation Access"  in the region soon.    The response of the KwaZulu authorities to the IEC  delegation  was subsequently described in the IEC's document to De Klerk and  Mandela as "stage-managed to humiliate the IEC". Describing the  atmosphere as "confrontational and aggressive," the IEC  concluded that the requisite assurances sought from the KwaZulu  authorities had not been given.    In the final paragraph of the confidential memorandum  presented to De Klerk and Mandela, the IEC stated: "In order  for the IEC to conduct free and fair elections in KwaZulu/Natal,  the requisite degree of stability and co-operation has to be  established in the province as a matter of urgency.    "How that is to be achieved is not for the IEC to determine.  Nor will it be in a position to advise whether substantially  free and fair elections can be conducted in KwaZulu/Natal unless  and until such stability and co-operation have been attained."</p>

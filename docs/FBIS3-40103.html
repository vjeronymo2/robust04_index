			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Comprehensive news report by Zhang Yunqing (1728 0061 </F> 7230), Yang Guanjin (2799 0385 6511), and Liu Linglan (0491 7227  5695): "What Do Peasants Think About When They First Enter the  Market?"]    [Text] Centering on the special topic "Characteristics of  Peasants' Attitude and Behavior on First Entering the Market,"  the Henan Provincial Rural Socioeconomic Survey Team, a few days  ago, in the form of a written questionnaire, conducted a special  survey of 1,200 peasants in 41 counties. The targets of the  survey were either heads of households or the persons who decide  family economic behavior, and among them 67.6 percent had a  junior middle school education or higher. The results of the  final collection and summing up reflected the typical attitudes  and real opinions of these peasant households after they first  entered the market.    When asked for their attitude to the putting into practice  of  the market economy in the rural areas, 67.8 percent of the  peasants approved, but 35 percent took an indifferent attitude,  the main reason being because they didn't know what the market  economy was and also did not know, in the final analysis, what  economic system would be most advantageous for them; 34 percent  of the peasants thought that it was a matter of indifference  whether or not contract orders were placed for grain, cotton,  and edible oil, because contracts only had a binding force on  the peasants; 26.1 percent of the peasants thought that it was a  matter of indifference whether or not the purchasing prices of  grain, cotton, and edible oil were released or not, because the  existing market prices are very little different from the  state's fixed purchasing prices, and in any case both are fairly  low.    With regard to the main ways that peasants now get  information on production and management, the survey (multiple  choice) showed: In first place was television (74.3 percent),  next came radio (60.7 percent), and in third place was  information passed on by relatives and friends (38.4 percent);  the rest in descending order were newspapers (27.7 percent),  rumors (21.9 percent), wired broadcasting (20.7 percent),  meetings (11.5 percent), and local information service  organizations accounted for only 3.6 percent.    This year was the first one in which Henan Province  completely abolished the command-type planting plan, so on what  arrangements for production did the peasants depend? In the  course of the survey, 29 percent of the peasants estimated what  agricultural products after being harvested would sell well and  then, reckoning up the prices, planted them; 28 percent of the  peasants arranged their planting according to the market  quotations before sowing and the market quotations in the  previous year; 20.5 percent of the peasants planted by habit;  19.1 percent of the peasants followed the mainstream by planting  what they saw other peasants planting; and only 2.3 percent of  the peasants planted in accordance with the contracts they had  signed with the relevant departments.    Among the "vexations" reported by the surveyed peasants in  chief place was that there were many witholdings and  apportionments, which made their burdens heavy and hard to bear  (81.8 percent); next was that the agricultural funds market was  disorderly, with false goods being sold and prices being raised  arbitrarily (80 percent); in third place was that public order  was bad (68.1 percent); in fourth place was a lack of  information, with the peasants not knowing what to plant and  what to do to make money (65.9 percent); and in fifth place was  that it was thought that rural cadres took wages and subsidies,  but provided the peasansts with few services (50.5 percent).    With regard to the peasants' expectations for government,  the  survey results showed that 90.1 percent of the peasants strongly  demanded that the government crack down severely on enterprises  and individuals that manufacture and sell fake, false, bogus, or  inferior pesticides and chemical fertilizers; 80.2 percent of  the peasants hoped for stable policy that would let the peasants  "take a pill that sets the mind at ease"; 66.7 percent of the  peasants hoped that technicians would be enlisted to go into the  countryside and popularize advanced techniques in agricultural  production; 56 percent of the peasants hoped that there would be  a severe crackdown on crime and that public order would be  maintained in the rural areas; and 49.9 percent of the peasants  hoped that a feasible measure would be formulated to prevent  bedrock low prices from harming the peasants and soaring  agricultural funds from harming agiculture.</p>

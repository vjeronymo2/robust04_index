			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Announcer Tatyana Khudobina] Today, probably for  the first time, we go on the air without knowing who is able to  watch our program. Transmission of TV programs ceased in  Krasnoyarsk, Barnaul, Khabarovsk, Krasnodar, Irkutsk, St.  Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, Penza, Tver, Kostroma, and  Belgorod after the morning news from Moscow. Islanders on  Sakhalin and the Kurils have also been cut off from Russia's  information network. No doubt the list will have increased by  the end of the day. Valeriy Belyayev, the managing director of  the Sakhalin TV and Radio Company, says the artificial creation  of an information vacuum could have serious political  consequences, when viewed against the background of the oblast  Duma election campaign underway on the islands.    The strike has gone ahead despite the urgent meeting held  yesterday evening with Russian Federation Communications  Minister Vladimir Bulgak and Aleksandr Yakovlev, the head of the  VGTRK [All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting  Company] and Ostankino, during which Viktor Chernomyrdin, the  chairman of the Russian Government, instructed the Finance  Ministry to find funds for stage-by-stage repayment of the  80-billion debts owed by the state TV and radio companies to  transmission enterprises. In spite of this, the  telecommunications workers have acted on their threats.    Can one really restore order in a country where the prime  minister's word means nothing, and the roost is ruled by the  person whose finger is closest to the off button? I feel that  this subject will provide serious food for thought throughout  the day. Meanwhile, we continue "Vesti" for those viewers who  can still see and hear us.</p>

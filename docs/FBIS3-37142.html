			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We begin our news bulletin with a report from  Norway. Correspondent Saulius [name indistinct] reports:    [Correspondent] The Lithuanian president stopped in Oslo  yesterday evening on his way to the Lillehammer Olympic Games.  In the Norwegian capital, Algirdas Brazauskas met Norwegian  Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, Foreign Minister Bjoern  Tore Godal, and members of the Storting Foreign Affairs  Committee.    In his conversation with the Norwegian prime minister,  Brazauskas expressed gratitude to the Nordic states for their  constant concern and support for Lithuania and for ever closer  contacts linking the Nordic Council and the Baltic states. It  was noted that it is useful for Lithuania--which wishes to sign  a free trade treaty with the European Union, is preparing to  join the European Union, and is negotiating with the European  Community--to get acquainted with Norway's experience.  Lithuania has expressed its wish to become a NATO member and  has signed the Partnership for Peace document. Norway, which  has already joined that organization, could help Lithuania to  become full member.    Satisfaction was expressed at the developing cooperation in  economics, science, and culture. During the meeting with the  parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee members, relations  between the Seimas and the Storting were discussed. A great  deal of attention was devoted to Lithuania's relations with  Russia and their prospects. The Norwegians were interested in  our relations with our closest neighbors, Belarus and Ukraine.  It was noted that the relations of great states and their  diktat to the smaller states are not correct and [passage  indistinct].    A similar discussion took place at the Norwegian Foreign  Ministry with Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal, who was  interested in the results of the negotiations with Ukraine and  how relations with Belarus will develop.    Brazauskas arrived in Lillehammer late at night. The  Lithuanian president will meet Norwegian King Harald V today and  will attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.</p>

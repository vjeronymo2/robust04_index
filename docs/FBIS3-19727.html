In a statement after his meeting with  President Glavkos Kliridhis at the Presidential Palace this  afternoon, Mr. Joe Clark avoided giving a direct answer as to  whether the Greek Cypriot side has accepted the three basic  principles set by the United Nations on the CBM's  implementation. However, he expressed the hope that there will  be an agreement between the two sides.    Mr. Clark noted: Today, I presented the UN's final proposal  on the CBM's to both leaders and they asked for time to study  it. Mr. Clark further said that he will meet separately with  the two leaders tomorrow and expressed the conviction that then  he will have a clearer idea of where things stand.    Asked if there was any reaction by the Greek Cypriot side to  the plans, Mr. Clark said that he established there is a  willingness to study the plan before any answer is given.  Responding to a question whether he expects an answer tomorrow,  Mr. Clark said that everybody knows that the UN secretary  general must submit a report to the Security Council at the end  of March and the report will either refer to an agreement or to  the failure of the talks. Mr. Clark added that Mr. Butrus-Ghali  will also have to give the reasons for a possible failure and  noted that the end of the month is not far away.    Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that the Greek  Cypriot side will study the whole document, which constitutes an  amended version of the previous document with more detailed  references, and adopt a position tomorrow in light of the  positions taken by the Turkish Cypriot side and the UN secretary  general's representatives.    The spokesman further stressed that the Greek Cypriot side  does not intend to endlessly exchange documents and demands that  the Turkish Cypriot side take a clear position on the documents.    At his meeting with Rauf Denktas this morning, Mr. Clark  said  that the three principles of the new document refer to:    First, the acceptance of the need for the existence of a UN  administration, which should exist because of an agreement  between the leaders of the two communities.    Second, the authority of this administration must be based  on  the same system being followed at the United Nations, according  to which the authority and jurisdictions of the secretary  general and his envoys stem from the Security Council.    Third, there must be clear benefits for both sides.</p>

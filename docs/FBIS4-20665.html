You were the coordinator of the first  large plutonium shipment from France on the Seishin Maru  (arriving before dawn on 15 November 1984) and were in charge of  the plutonium shipment on the Akatsuki Maru that attracted world  attention from last fall through 5 January. As "Plutonium Man,"  what do you make of the nuclear non-proliferation trend in the  world today?    Ishiwatari: I myself was not really aware of it,  but I gladly accept the title "Plutonium Man." Your question is  wide-ranging and difficult. Let me answer from the standpoint of  a person who deals with atomic energy development in Japan.    Today, we must evaluate what the existence of the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which has aroused such public  interest, has meant to Japan. Japan signed the treaty on 3  February 1970, but it took six years for the National Diet to  ratify it. The NPT forms the basis for the world's present  nuclear non-proliferation structure. And one major factor  lurking behind the scenes with this treaty was the Cold War. At  that time the "nuclear parity" between the U.S. and the Soviet  Union formed the basis for world order. In one way of thinking,  the NPT mechanism has developed as an attempt to solidify this  structure, and therefore, bring about the most favorable outcome  for the whole world. However, Japan knows that this structure  has its own problems. That is why we have a history of six years  of debate in the Diet before we finally ratified the treaty on 8  June 1976.    At that time, there were three major subjects of debate in  Japan. The first was a concern over the design of the treaty  because for countries like Japan without nuclear weapons this  was an "unfair" agreement, and in a sense granted special  privileges to nations with nuclear weapons. The second was  concern that the agreement might interfere with the peaceful  utilization of atomic energy, which Japan was vigorously  pursuing. The third point is probably not important today, but  it was the view that we should leave the door open for Japan to  choose to have nuclear weapons in the future and that "nuclear  detonations for peaceful purposes" should be permitted. The  treaty was ratified only after these issues were discussed at  length.    Directly after ratification, PNC gained experience on its  own  in Japan-U.S. negotiations over the operation of the Tokai  reprocessing plant. By successfully concluding those  negotiations and continuing up to the present, PNC can make its  own evaluations of the issues that were discussed at that time,  and those evaluations will likely reflect those of Japan as a  nation. Personally, we wanted all the countries with nuclear  weapons to proceed with nuclear disarmament, but because the  negotiations were conducted under an atmosphere of  confrontation, the fact is that we did not press the issue too  strongly. Recently we have seen progress in the form of the end  of the Cold War, so I think we can judge what happened in light  of that.    Let us look at what kinds of problems there were and what  kinds of problems remain today. Japan prides herself as being in  "faithful compliance" with the NPT, but when we look at the rest  of the world, there are still some nations that have not signed  the treaty. Many of these nations have taken the position that  they will not sign the treaty because it is "unfair." We also  suspect that some nations are developing their own nuclear  weapons. And some nations do not comply faithfully with the  treaty even though they have signed it. These kinds of problems  have been revealed. And with this revelation, the question  arises whether the treaty is functioning sufficiently in its  present form. Already the debate has begun. These concerns will  surely have a major effect on the extension of the treaty that  is coming up in 1995.    Well-informed persons have been discussing the question of  how Japan should respond to the extension issue, and today it is  widely discussed. Opinions are gradually converging that Japan  should agree to an "unlimited extension" as a major premise. If  we do so, then we will face the problem of whether the IAEA  nuclear non-proliferation structure is acceptable in its present  form. I think it is commonly held worldwide that the present  form is not perfect, and Japan must figue out how to respond to  the kinds of problems I have described.    Of course, we must realize that Japan is in a special  position because we are a country without nuclear weapons, but  by adopting the course of reprocessing and plutonium utilization  we end up on the far right of the political spectrum. In the  past, Japan and the former West Germany were together on this,  but Germany has withdrawn slightly from that path, whereas Japan  is attempting to hold fast. We are concerned with how this will  affect public opinion worldwide, and I think it is a very  important problem.  <H5>  Contribution of Peaceful Utilization Technology </H5>   Sakai: The Japanese Government should emphasize  Article 4 of the NPT that recognizes the right of countries  without nuclear weapons to utilize atomic energy for peaceful  purposes; in other words, excessive restrictions shall not be  placed on peaceful utilization. After all, PNC has already made  a major contribution to the world in technological development  for the peaceful utilization of atomic energy with the TASTEX  (Advanced Safeguard Technology Demonstrations [literal]) Project  that included Japan, France, and four IAEA members conducted at  the Tokai Reprocessing Plant at the beginning of President  Carter's nuclear non-proliferation policy in 1977, the JASPAS  (Japan Support Program for Agency Safeguards) Project, etc.    Ishiwatari: Just as you have pointed out, we plan  to continue along this path in the future. A minute ago you said  that Japan has a special position as a nation that does not  possess nuclear weapons but is pursuing reprocessing and  plutonium utilization. That is the position we have to take.  Japan is the most appropriate nation in the world for pursuing  this policy, and if Japan does not do so on her own, we will  find ourselves in an untenable situation, so I think we ought to  put much more effort into this than we have in the past.    Not only that, there are nations that are not part of the  IAEA structure and other nations that do belong, but raise our  suspicions because they conceal what they are doing. Technology  cannot deal with these cases, and the basis for progress must be  international diplomacy. I think that Japan ought to do her part  on this front as well, and I expect that it will become an issue  in the future.    In retrospect, the PNC team did not realize until 1977 that  there are so many technological problems to be solved to achieve  non-proliferation. At that point we became deeply aware of this  kind of important technological development, and since that time  we have worked very hard on it. You also pointed out that in the  future we should use another one of our "weapons," the fruit of  our efforts since 1977 (see accompanying table) for emphasizing  Japan's position in the future. I agree with you completely and  would like to see this done.

Ishiwatari: I recognize that this problem should  be discussed from the standpoint of government rather than PNC.  Because I am involved somewhat I have made a few observations,  and basically I believe that the plutonium problems accompanying  nuclear disarmament should be solved by countries with nuclear  weapons in disarmament negotiations.    Many plans have come about as a result of these discussions.  There are issues such as where the plutonium should be stored  temporarily, what measures should be taken so that it cannot be  reused for weapons, and looking farther down the road, whether  it should be converted to peaceful uses. The debate has not yet  begun, but at this stage a proposal for converting plutonium  from dismantled nuclear weapons to peaceful uses has been  circulated, and that proposal touches upon the peaceful  utilization policy that Japan is presently pursuing. One point  of contact will be through technology, and we must also deal  with the problem of whether this additional plutonium will upset  the balance of total plutonium supply and demand.    My own feeling is that the plutonium supply and demand  balance will not be upset in the near future even if we add the  plutonium removed from dismantled weapons. Weapon dismantling  will not proceed all at once, so the plutonium used in those  weapons will probably appear a little bit at a time under the  guise of "excess plutonium." Therefore, I think it will be  impossible for a large amount of plutonium from dismantled  weapons to flood the peaceful utilization market all at once. In  any event, if we do proceed with peaceful utilization, I expect  that as a nation pursuing the peaceful utilization of plutonium  we will end up cooperating with other nations in terms of  technology and the market. I think that the technological  developments we have made thus far will be sufficiently helpful.    Sakai: Early last year the media reported on a  plan to provide cooperation in design technology for  construction of a dedicated combustion reactor (FR) to burn  plutonium in the former Soviet Union.    Ishiwatari: In fact, that may be possible, but a  major premise is that the main framework will be determined in  discussions between the two nuclear superpowers, and if they  approve a policy of converting plutonium from dismantled weapons  to peaceful uses, then we will have an opportunity to make a  contribution.  <H5>  New Long Term Plan Hearings and 25 Years of FBR Development </H5>   Sakai: Turning to domestic problems, let us begin  with the Atomic Energy Commission's hearings to revise the Long  Term Plan. The hearings formally began on 2 September last year,  but the report by the FBR Expert Subcommittee, upon which the  plan is contingent, has fallen far behind the reports in other  fields. More than a year has passed and finally it appears this  report will be submitted to the Long Term Plan Expert  Subcommittee. It seems that the role of FBR commercialization  R&amp;D and its obligations will become very great.    Sakai: I worked on the Long Term Plan revision in  1987, so I think I am well aware of the differences between then  and now in the discussions. I sense a "change in the air"  between the discussions then and those today. Essentially, each  time has its own major trends, and we must make decisions based  on what we believe at the present time.    You mentioned the role of PNC, so let me explain it this  way.  A pendulum swings back and forth over the course of time, and if  you look at the bob from the side it has swung away from, it  appears very far away, but if you look at it from a fixed point  in the center, you note that it is merely swinging back and  forth. The discussions will not make any progress if all the  people involved do not acknowledge this. They should proceed  with discussions well aware of where today's fixed point is and  move toward a conclusion.    With this idea in mind, I can explain the role that the  organization called PNC should play. When I was involved in the  revision, the government's part meant PNC's part. We all  recognize that PNC is still the major player today as well. As  long as we proceed along the path of recycling and utilization  of plutonium, PNC will take on the job of R&amp;D to establish  the  FBR system and prepare for its future commercialization.  Therefore, we would find it odd if PNC's role has changed  substantially or in some way behind the scenes. It would be  strange to think that things are that much different today. PNC  should understand that Japan has been swinging back and forth  around the fixed axis in the center. By looking at the big  picture, PNC can accurately recognize its role and determine its  position.    PNC itself has changed greatly since 1987. Monju has been  completed, and we are approaching criticality in the near  future. The prototype reactor built with Japanese technology  will soon reach criticality and full-fledged operational status  is drawing near. During this period, PNC has compiled a large  amount of technology. If we present our position to the  committee based on these accomplishments, I believe the role  that PNC should play will be determined automatically from those  discussions.    Sakai: There is also the problem of criticality at  Monju being delayed until next spring. When we consider the  trouble with the fuel pellet continuous sintering furnace that  occurred this June, I think that nuclear power industry should  accept it as a lesson from the school of hard knocks that truly  reveals the reactor and the fuel cycle as two sides of the same  coin.    Ishiwatari: I must admit that in the past the  orders to make a certain kind of fuel were dictated by the  reactor design, and the fuel cycle was considered merely  something that went along with it. Recently, however, the fuel  cycle has also come to dictate specifications, and we have felt  for some time that the best situation is to deal with the system  as a whole. Each area proceeds with its R&amp;D under this  premise.  We all thought we were moving along the same path, but the  trouble with the sintering furnace has sent a clear message and  made us doubly aware of what can happen. Although the reactor  still occupies the central position in the whole cycle, our  R&amp;D  must take the approach that the system must proceed as a whole.  Naturally, this should be the case with commercialization as  well, and we must hold fast to this approach in the future.    Sakai: One of our reporters recently toured Monju,  and after he returned he said that what impressed him the most  was a total of 160 people for operation and maintenance, 80 from  the electric power industry and 80 from PNC, were making  preparations to begin operation. Although people from the  electric power industry may be there on temporary assignment, 10  of them have been at Monju for more than four years, and they  are bursting with pioneer spirit.    Ishiwatari: Basically, we finished construction on  the Monju facility and have been running various kinds of tests  since the end of last year to prepare for criticality. In the  past there were many people from the electric power industry who  worked with us at the O-arai Engineering Center and at the Monju  construction site. Everyone was happy because reports indicated  that this relationship was working out very well. I am deeply  moved when people from the power industry say to me, "As an  engineer, that was the best time of my life." We held a big  get-together for the people from the electric power industry and  let them tour Monju. Of course, I am not suggesting that they  are not happy in their present assignments, but it is  heart-warming to hear those words from the mouths of career  engineers.  <H5>  Japanese Approach to High Level Waste Disposal </H5>   Sakai: Moving on to the question of policies to  dispose of high-level radioactive waste, the Expert Subcommittee  Report issued last summer clearly separated disposal into R&amp;D  and an "implementation organization." I think that the  Geological Disposal Basic Research Facility that was recently  completed at Tokai Village should be used not only for R&amp;D,  but  also for the benefit of society.    Ishiwatari: Japan's policy is geological disposal,  and PNC has been tabbed as the core organization for R&amp;D in  that  field. We must conduct research on the layers of the earth's  crust. We must also do research on natural and artificial  barriers. Psychologically, Japanese people have a lingering  mistrust of the earth's crust far below the surface where they  live. And not without reason, because we have suffered through a  long history of destructive earthquakes, and if you dig down a  little, the water just gushes out. Therefore, our perception is  particularly strong that we are living on top of a very unstable  crust, and most people carry that image around in the back of  their minds.    On the other hand, when we look at countries like Canada,  Sweden, and Switzerland where geological disposal is proceeding  smoothly, one thing the people have in common is a feeling of  trust toward the earth's crust underneath their dwellings.  Because they believe that they are living on a firm foundation  of bedrock, they genuinely feel that burying waste deep in the  strong crust of the earth is safe. I am deeply aware of the  disparity between Japan and other countries.    Although it is not true for all of Japan, there are parts of  the earth's crust in Japan as well that will be stable for the  next 10,000 or 100,000 years. We must find these places and  demonstrate with scientific proof that they are stable. We must  build a foundation by first doing the research, then  demonstrating that there are dependable areas of the earth's  crust under Japan where we can dispose of the waste.    The new facility at Tokai Village can adequately carry out  the R&amp;D, and with this in mind we have also made a provision  in  our budget for changing the title of the Chubu Works division,  which has been doing research on the earth's crust under Japan,  to the Tono Center. Geological disposal is something for the  distant future, but sound research on the basics will occupy a  central position. We will build a recreation of the earth's  crust above ground at Tokai Village to reflect this data and  proceed with various kinds of research. These two interconnected  R&amp;D projects will form the foundation for the future. After  that  we plan to move on to more specific projects.    We are talking now about many years in the future, but we  want to proceed with R&amp;D in the fields PNC is responsible  for so  that we are ready when the time comes to implement geological  disposal, and I think we can make it. When the time comes for  implementation and we begin to ask whether there is any good  location for geological disposal or not, the whole issue will be  moot without reliable data.    Sakai: As you have just suggested, I think it will  be extremely persuasive if you compile various data and process  it with a supercomputer, display the results on a large screen,  highlight the "disposal sites" on the large screen, and indicate  whatever problems, etc., might be encountered.    Ishiwatari: We constructed the new facility at  Tokai Village with the approach that geological disposal could  not be built on chance, and had to be put together bit by bit  from the ground up if we were to obtain consensus. More  specifically, since the true mission of the facility is R&amp;D,  it  must perform that well. I think that based on its achievements,  it will be called on later to act as the "implementation  organization" that will actually be in charge of geological  disposal.  <H5>  Expectations for Atomic Energy Commission and Interpreting </H5> U.S. Government Policy    Sakai: Finally, it appears that the electric power  industry is beginning to consider building a domestic production  system for the MOX fuels needed for plutonium utilization and  plutonium thermal use.    Ishiwatari: After the reprocessing plant at  Rokkasho Village starts up, we definitely must have MOX  processing equipment to act as a "receiver" for the plutonium  that it produces. This is a job for the electric power industry,  but it is only natural that they turn to PNC for the technology,  and I believe we must respond to their expectations. We had  quite a struggle making fuel for Fugen, Joyo, and Monju, but  through that hard work and experience we have reached a rather  high level, technologically speaking.    Although the building has already been completed for the new  ATR line, I am sorry to say that the inside is not ready. This  is due to its relationship with the site for the Electric Power  Development Company's "Oma Reactor." Because the No. 2  Development Lab ATR line is getting rather old, instead of  renovating it we have a provision in next year's budget to  replace it with the ATR line in the No. 3 Development Lab on the  same scale. After it starts up we will abandon the No. 2  Development Lab, and the ATR line in the No. 3 Development Lab  will begin operation, albeit on a small scale. In the meantime,  if there is progress with the Electric Power Development  Company's ATR demonstration reactor project (Oma Reactor), we  will expand the line.    Another advantage will be that if, for example, the electric  power industry looks at this line as a site for technology  transfer so they can manufacture MOX fuel for plutonium  utilization, we will also be ready to respond. In any event, we  have requested a budget to set up the No. 3 Development Lab ATR  line with these kinds of future prospects in mind. It will be on  a small scale of about 10 tons, but we definitely want to go  through with it. If the No. 2 Development Lab line breaks down,  we will not be able to make fuel for Fugen. So we have this  practical problem to deal with, and we are in the process of  solving it.    In the area of fuels we have already transferred enrichment  technology to the electric power industry. We are also  transferring reprocessing technology in a variety of forms, but  speaking from these experiences, transfer of fuel manufacturing  technology will be more complex, and we expect it to take a lot  of time and effort. Therefore, we must discuss this thoroughly  with the electric power industry to arrange for a long-term,  "systematic transfer of technology" and a mechanism for doing so.    Sakai: When we look at the track record of the  Atomic Energy Commission, Japan finally joined the NPT in 1976  after six years of debate. Looking back over the way government  policy has unfolded during the last 37 years with the Japan-U.S.  reprocessing negotiations in 1977, and the "riot" caused by  bringing in the CANDU (Canadian-made deuterium reactor),  thereafter, the Atomic Energy Commission has undergone "a  baptism by fire." Because the new Long Term Plan must be  formulated in the midst of a very fluid international situation,  this will also be a "baptism by fire." Since you were once in  their shoes, what are your hopes and expectations for the Atomic  Energy Commission and the Long Term Plan Expert Subcommittee?    Ishiwatari: Times have changed, and on a large  scale the government itself is undergoing a lot of change. A  certain powerful political leader has stated emphatically that  in this kind of situation it may be dangerous to demonstrate  leadership, but it is even more dangerous not to, and I  completely agree with him. Therefore, I hope they will take my  opinions under consideration.    Sakai: That is the final wish of professor Hiromi  Arisawa, who passed away on 7 March 1988. He was constantly  seeking leadership in saying, "At any specific time people on  the Atomic Energy Commission should approach their job with the  attitude that they `carry their resignation letter in their  pocket.'"    Ishiwatari: I hate to change the subject, but I  would like to say one thing about plutonium from dismantled  weapons. In the U.S. they refer to it as "excess plutonium," and  a person near the top of the executive branch of the U.S.  Government said they would like to study a little more what the  phrase "excess plutonium" means. I thought a lot about what he  implied, and one way of interpreting it, although it may be my  personal bias, is that plutonium intended for peaceful  utilization "is not excess plutonium because it has a use." The  U.S. government clearly considers plutonium from dismantled  weapons to be excess plutonium. However, there is a chance we  will have an excess of plutonium in the field of peaceful  utilization as well. That has already happened to some extent in  the UK, and I have gradually come to understand that somehow or  other those in charge of nuclear non-proliferation in the U.S.  Government feel that an excess of plutonium might crop up here  too.    Japan must understand that people in the U.S. Government  view  themselves as "guardians of the world against nuclear  proliferation." If we invite misunderstanding and debate whether  the total amount of plutonium we possess might contain an excess  if we consider all the plutonium together, it will be a policy  disaster. We must review things when we reach the stage where we  are ready to mix it into the fuel. If, from the start, we debate  whether all the plutonium should all be taken together, we will  just invite confusion. We must carefully study what we should  include and in what manner when we reach the stage of mixing it  into fuel. If we do not, it will be a great obstacle to  executing government policy in Japan. Recently, this has really  struck home with me.    Sakai: Thank you very much for talking with us  today.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Economic Viewpoint: The folly of fussing about UK deficit Those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad. Any god observing the so-called UK economic debate will conclude that the self-destructive wish is intense. Fortunately for the British economy its performance depends much less on politicians and commentators than often supposed. The merchants of gloom have enjoyed some genuine bad news in the Industrial Production Index. It is best to take the manufacturing sector alone - simply to remove the vagaries of North Sea oil output. Clearly, manufacturing production in the three months to August was well down on the previous few months. Its behaviour lends credence to much slighter signs from out-of-date and unreliable trade figures that UK exports are being seriously hit by the European recession. Even if the UK recovery is still continuing, it has lost some of its wind. What, however, would someone from Olympus think if, in the face of these contractionary pressures, the British government depressed home demand further by tax increases in the sacred name of cutting the budget deficit? Other governments are being given the same advice. We thus could be on the verge of a vicious circle of insanity, in which country A raises taxes or cuts government spending because of its budget or balance of payments deficit, thereby aggravating the deficits of countries B, C and D which make cuts in their turn. Am I the only Keynesian left to perceive the folly of this process? (My own break with Keynesian orthodoxy came on very different issues.) Nor is the folly confined to the tax side. The one common theme of all UK assessments is how precarious any recovery still is in building and construction. Yet the Treasury apparently regards the sector as a soft target and is choosing this moment to try to withdraw concessions on local authority and housing corporation expenditure. Is there no one prepared to say that the analogy between the national budget and a family one is more wrong than right, and that the function of a national budget is precisely to offset the bias of private households and companies: namely to move into surplus when the private sector is in a spending mood and to go into deficit when the private sector is in a saving one? The time horizon over which the public sector needs to come to an appropriate balance - which is not zero - stretches over many more years than would apply to a family or company. The Treasury response would be that if tax increases proved too contractionary, they could always be offset by interest rate cuts. The real paperback memoirs just published (Nigel Lawson's) show that the official Treasury's instinct has been to go for too low interest rates and too high taxes. The leopard has not changed its spots. The danger of cutting interest rates is that it might depress the exchange rate - depending on what else was happening in the world. The Treasury does not have freedom to do just what it likes on the interest rate front. Anyone who thinks that the long-term ties linking world inflation, the exchange rate and British inflation have been severed by leaving the European exchange rate mechanism, has a shock coming. A necessary reminder has been provided by the less favourable inflation indicators, which should not be in the least bit surprising except to those who were misled by the headline figures of the Retail Prices Index. Producer output inflation (excluding foodstuffs) has risen for five consecutive months, and now stands at 3 per cent compared with a year ago. The RPI, excluding mortgage interest payments, now stands at 3.3 per cent compared with a year ago. These are still astonishingly low figures after a 12 per cent devaluation of sterling and are only possible because of the world recessionary climate and the pressure on UK pay and productivity resulting from two years of ERM membership. The most encouraging factor is that, as the Treasury points out, wage costs have fallen by the largest amount since records began in 1960. Why put all this at risk with extra indirect tax increases, which will come on top of the nearly 1 per cent addition to the Retail Prices Index already in the pipeline next year from Norman Lamont's deferred tax rises? It may at this stage be too late to advise Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to rethink his tax increasing plans. So much political capital has been invested in them that the markets might well take it as a weakness if they were shelved. The longer term It is refreshing to move from these follies to a memorandum obtainable from the Department of Trade and Industry. This has the unfortunate title of Competitiveness but is in reality a survey of UK long-term performance. A few of its charts are reproduced here. They refute much of the widespread gloom and doom. Productivity for each hour worked is only slightly higher in Germany than in the UK. In Japan, it is a good deal lower. Only in the US - where there is also much gloom-mongering - is productivity decisively higher. It is true that the UK lags more in manufacturing, which accounts for a fifth of the total economy. Business investment, for which the economic establishment has been crying out for so long, is in fact as high as in the US and Germany. The gap here is only with Japan, which is not necessarily a model. The fall in the share of UK manufacturing exports in world trade dwindled to a trickle in the mid-1970s (just when the Labour government was castigated for going 'cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund'). It came to an end in the early 1980s - which is one reason for taking the balance of payments problem with a pinch of salt. The UK has also obtained the lion's share of inward investment, not only from Japan but the US as well. There has been no space for another chart showing the collapse of the strike weapon in the British workplace. Perhaps most important of all, and some evidence of the Thatcher government's supply-side reforms, is that the return on capital has improved so much; even in the current recession it is almost as high as it was in the boom of the late 1970s. Interestingly enough, the main weakness which emerges from the DTI paper is one where the Treasury may be presumed to have had an influence. Inflation was not only higher in the UK in the 30 years to 1990 than in all main partner countries except Italy; but the year-to-year variation in inflation was higher as well. This is demonstrated in more detail by a Bank of England Working Paper.* Fluctuations in output, due to demand shocks, were also greater in Britain than in most other countries, if one accepts the Bank authors' analysis. Whether the switch-back developments represent official stop-go or hyperactive efforts to avoid stop-go is impossible to say. In any case, such fluctuations were, together with inflation, the main preoccupation of the British economic talking classes (mea culpa) for most of this time. Perhaps one should end with Adam Smith's observation: 'There is an awful lot of ruin in a nation,' which means that a country can put up with a great deal of folly in its short-term management. *No. 13, Temporary Cycles or Volatile Trends? by G Sterne and T Bayoumi</p>

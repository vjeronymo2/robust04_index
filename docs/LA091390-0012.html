			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> NATION'S JUDGES FEAR SPECTRE OF DREAD 5TH VOTE;  </P> <P> IF ROE V. WADE IS OVERTURNED, COURTS WILL FACE TOUGH ABORTION CASES-AND VOTER  WRATH.  </P> <P>  The careers of Judge David H. Souter of New Hampshire and Chief Justice  Leander Shaw Jr. of the Florida Supreme Court have much in common -- both were  rising judicial stars in their states, and both were appointed to their state's  highest courts in 1983. But while Souter will almost certainly become a justice  of the U.S. Supreme Court, Shaw's career is likely to come to a crashing end in  a retention election contest in November.  </P> <P> The abortion issue has much to do with both scenarios, and will have even more  to do with the future of every judge in America.  </P> <P> Souter sat as a lower court judge in New Hampshire from 1978 to 1983. During  this time, the New Hampshire Legislature considered a law that would have  required judges to approve abortions for minors if parental consent was  unavailable. On behalf of his fellow judges, who were not eager to assume this  task, Souter successfully urged defeat of the measure. And after his elevation  to the state Supreme Court, he never once had to rule on the controversial  issue of abortion rights. If he had, he certainly wouldn't have been nominated  for the U.S. Supreme Court.  </P> <P> At least he would have had job security, as New Hampshire judgeships are  permanent until a mandatory retirement age of 70. Florida, on the other hand,  is one of 16 states that, like California, subject Supreme Court justices to  retention elections. Many other states subject justices to contested elections.  In Florida, justices face the voters every six years. Shaw, the first black to  sit on Florida's high court, was easily confirmed the first time and faced  every prospect of an easy reconfirmation this November. The 59-year-old judge  was even promoted to chief justice this year.  </P> <P> But unlike New Hampshire, the Florida Legislature did pass a statute requiring  minors to obtain the consent of a parent or a judge before an abortion could be  performed. The constitutionality of that law was challenged by a pregnant  15-year-old whose case came before the Florida Supreme Court after the U.S.  Supreme Court decided last June to broaden allowable restrictions on abortion.  The girl's lawyers argued that her right to choice was preserved under the  constitution of the state of Florida, which, like California, Alaska and  Montana, has an explicit guarantee of the right of privacy. The Florida Supreme  Court agreed with the argument and Shaw wrote the majority opinion last  October.  </P> <P> That ruling turned Shaw's retention election into a referendum on abortion,  with the anti-abortion forces calling for his scalp. Shaw is busily raising  campaign funds, attempting to keep his seat. But the anti-abortion movement  succeeded in electing a governor opposed to abortion and wields significant  political clout in Florida.  </P> <P> If, as the anti-abortion forces fervently hope, Souter's confirmation provides  the fifth vote to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the landmark decision that gives  constitutional protection to a woman's right to choose abortion, it will become  increasingly difficult for judges to avoid deciding abortion cases. Since few  states give judges the security of lifetime appointments, the Florida scenario  has the potential for replay everywhere in America. Regardless of how judges  decide abortion cases, there will be a deeply offended political constituency  ready to be mobilized to unseat them. The prospect is an insidious threat to  judicial independence: Will judges decide abortion cases by gauging the latest  shifts in the winds that rage around this issue?  </P> <P> There's another irony in the inevitability of the dilemma. For years,  conservative critics of "judicial activism" have been chuckling up their  sleeves, suggesting that the judges subjected to political attacks brought  these attacks on themselves by sticking their judicial noses where they didn't  belong. But even judges who were put on the bench because of their commitment  to "judicial restraint" will find no escape from the issues that abortion laws  present.  </P> <P> Souter's elevation warmed the hearts of every judge in America. The elevation  to the pinnacle of an obscure jurist whose main qualifications are that he's  smart and works hard offers hope that it could happen to anyone. At the same  time, the fate of Chief Justice Shaw will send a cold shiver down the spine of  every judge in America. And judges with shivering spines are not what America  needs in the 1990s.  </P></p>

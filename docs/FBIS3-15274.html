The amnestied themselves also expressed their views concerning  the State Duma decision. Interfax's correspondent Vyacheslav  Terekhov interviewed the last USSR President, Mikhail Gorbachev,  in this connection.    Corr.: What is your attitude to the State Duma decision on  dropping legal proceedings against those who plotted the August  1991 coup, those responsible for last May's bloodshed, and the  leaders of last October's disturbances in Moscow?    Mikhail Gorbachev: In my view, it was not too easy for the  State Duma to take such a decision. Nevertheless it's  noteworthy that three-fourths of the deputies in the lower house  of Russia's parliament voted for it. As a matter of fact, each  of the Duma members realized that the voting will not be secret,  and that the stand taken by each of them will become known to  the public -- the names of all of them will be mentioned.  Seeking to be unbiased, I cannot disregard this fact.    Nevertheless, my attitude to this problem is ambivalent. In  the first place, the amnesty concerned a group of people  involved in the events connected with the attempted coup of 1991  -- people whose actions led to breaking up the country. As for  the events of last September and October, when Russia's Supreme  Council was abolished, Moscow was virtually bathed in blood.  These two issues should be clearly distinguished.    As for my own attitude, I have always stood for carrying the  trial of those who plotted the 1991 coup through, and with  maximal openness. Otherwise the country will learn no lesson  from that sad experience.    Corr.: Pointing to the need to observe openness in the  coverage of the trial, you evidently wish to be absolved from  the charges that you were aware of the plotters' plans, and  shared their intention to impose a state of emergency in the  USSR, as some of the plotters claim?    M.G.: Indeed, during the trial some initiators of the coup  came out with such charges against me at the advice of their  lawyers. I have repeatedly refuted them, in interviews with  journalists also.    Another issue I would like to draw attention to concerns the  conduct of Ivan Rybkin (Interfax's note: the chairman of  Russia's State Duma). I am not acquainted with him, I have  never met him. However my impression is that he is a tactfull  and reserved man, who can control his own emotions. I would not  say that he is prone to extremism.    I saw Rybkin act rather sharply for the first time precisely  when he was upholding the need to grant political amnesty to  those who had taken part in the 1991 and 1993 events, which was  supported by a majority of Duma members. Some considerations  prompted me to conclude that the resoluteness of his actions  could be explained by the circumstance that the speaker of the  lower house of parliament had settled this issue with Russia's  president...    Corr.: But a majority of political analysts do not share  this viewpoint.    M.G.: I expressed my own opinion. I believe that the  resolution on political amnesty Rybkin was "pushing through" the  Duma was too serious not to have been discussed with the Russian  president preliminarily. The circumstance that Boris Yeltsin  paid no attention to this topic and seemed to distance himself  from it when the amnestied were released, while the presidential  team reacted to the amnesty as if it were a kind of coup d'etat,  must delude no one.    Please believe me, that I cannot get rid of the thought that  all these steps had been agreed with the president, since the  commission for investigating the October 3-4 events set up under  the Duma, and the very trial of those who plotted the 1991 coup,  are questions too serious to be resolved without discussing them  with the head of state.    I would like to draw attention to the fact that this  involves  an amnesty, not full pardon. In other words, in legal terms  these issues have not been finally settled. No one has  cancelled the criminal cases instituted against some defendants  and the verdicts pronounced against other participants in the  events of August 1991, last May and last September-October.  That is amnesty does not signify rehabilitation.    Corr.: But the main thing is that the legal proceedings are  stopped, isn't it?    M.G.: No one calls this fact in question. What really  matters is this -- lawyers believe that not only those who have  already been convicted can be granted amnesty. I am a jurist  myself, and that is why I believe that this amnesty, which is a  constitutional prerogative of the State Duma, spreads to those  who are already serving their sentences, to those whose cases  are being considered by courts of law, and to those who are  under investigation. The amnesty "closes" all these cases.    Therefore the jurists -- they even include professors -- who  maintain that the State Duma resolution is unlawful are not  right. In my opinion, from the legal point of view it's hard to  describe the resolution issued by the lower house of parliament  as faulty.    However the main problem does not lie in this, but in the  motives for announcing this amnesty. If its goal was to promote  national reconciliation, it can only be welcomed. Russia is on  the brink of an abyss now -- disintegration is threatening it.  Time has come to put all quarrels aside and save the state and  the people from discord and strife. This is how the  consequences of the civil war in Spain were liquidated under  Franco.    In August of 1991 irreparable damage was done to the country  -- I mean the Soviet Union. The coup affected myself directly.  But I place the interests of Russia and Russians above my own,  provided that the amnesty will really help to preserve the  country's integrity.    But the amnesty will bring only a disaster, if  representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party or communists  begin to declare that the amnesty is their victory over the  democrats, if Russian Choice starts to urge people to take to  the streets and call for dissolving the Duma.    However I am an optimist by nature, and I hope that  political  accord in the country will be gained; at least I wish very much  that this would happen. Russia can be saved from disaster only  on this condition. But if the conflicting sides begin once  again to look for winners and losers and revert to mutual  threats, then the chairman of the State Duma's defence  committee, Sergey Yushenkov, who said that to adopt that amnesty  was a step toward a civil war, will prove to be right.    Corr.: Don't you think that there is a third way to cope  with the situation -- to hush it up and pretend that nothing  important has happened?    M.G.: In my view, such manner of behavior would create  conditions for continuing to topple presidents, dissolve  legislatures and shoot parliaments with impunity. This should  be openly explained to the people, since a precedent for  disbanding a constitutional organ with impunity must not be  created -- this would be very bad for the country and for the  Russian people. However I hope that history will put everything  in its proper place.</p>

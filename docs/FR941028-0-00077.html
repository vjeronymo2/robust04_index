			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, under the provisions of the proposed regulation, challengers would only have to present proof with respect to factual issues which are relevant to the invocation of the presumption of ownership or control. If the presumption turns upon certain key factual issues, these are the issues upon which the challenge will focus. Challengers will not be required to disprove irrelevant facts which may have been included in the administrative record of the agency which initially established the presumption of ownership or control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The industry commenters further objected to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.26 which provides that a person seeking to challenge a presumption could demonstrate that he or she did not have authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which surface coal mining operations were conducted. The commenters questioned whether the requirement that a person prove that he or she did not have such indirect authority was an attempt by OSM to impermissibly extend the reach of the ownership or control regulations to cover persons remote from surface coal mining operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM denies that the proposed provision represents an attempt to impermissibly extend the reach of the ownership or control regulations. In fact, the proposed standard was taken from currently operative ownership and control regulations. The provisions of paragraph (b) of 30 CFR 773.5, which have been effective since November 2, 1988, state that a person subject to one or more of the presumptions contained in paragraph (b) of that regulation is presumed to be an owner or controller unless there is a demonstration that ``the person subject to the presumption does not in fact have the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> authority directly or indirectly <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to determine the manner in which the relevant surface coal mining operation is conducted.'' (Emphasis added.) This is the same standard which is also contained in paragraph (a)(3) of 30 CFR 773.5. The purpose of this standard is to enable: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> the regulatory authority *&blank;*&blank;* [to] examine any relationships and the facts surrounding them, such as informal agreements, personal relationships, and the mining history of the parties in question to determine if the relationship results in control over a surface coal mining operation. The regulatory authority may also consider any of the circumstances surrounding a surface coal mining operation to determine control. Such circumstances might include, for example, the fact that a person has financed the operation, or owns the equipment or the rights to the coal, or directs on-site operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38870 (October 3, 1988). Further, whether a person is ``remote'' in a corporate chain of command is not the issue under the standard. The issue is whether the totality of the circumstances indicate that the person had the authority to exercise control over the relevant surface coal mining operation. Such ``authority'' includes control or the power to control.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Id.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> at pages 38870&hyph;38871. The resolution of such issues is necessary for the regulatory authority's analysis of an ownership or control challenge. Accordingly, requiring a person challenging a presumption of ownership or control to make such demonstration is appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Industry commenters proposed that paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26 be modified to provide that a person challenging the presumption be able to prove that the agency relied upon incorrect facts to support its determination of ownership or control; that the person subject to the presumption did not have knowledge of the violation, did not authorize the activity that led to the violation, or did not have direct authority to determine the manner in which surface coal mining operations were conducted; or that the ownership or control link has been severed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM appreciates the commenters' proposal. Nevertheless, OSM will not adopt the commenters' proposed modifications for the following reasons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of proposed &sect;773.26 already contain language providing for a challenger's proof that the facts relied upon by regulatory authority to make a determination of ownership or control did not or do not exist. Such language is inclusive of the commenters' proposal that a challenger be allowed to submit proof that the agency relied upon incorrect facts to support its determination of ownership or control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Pressure over BR sell-off reversal THERE WERE several strong calls yesterday for the government to reverse its recent humiliating defeat on a central element of its plans to privatise British Rail. But Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, stopped short of saying that the government would try to reverse an amendment to the rail privatisation bill passed by the House of Lords in July. The amendment seeks to give BR a greater role in bidding for the new franchises. In July parliament's upper chamber insisted that BR should be allowed to bid for rail franchises after privatisation alongside other groups. Proposers of the amendment argued that BR managers should have an opportunity to bid for the privatised net-work. Mr Robin Morris (Morecambe and Lunesdale Conservatives), opening the transport debate, claimed that the amendment was contrary to the aims of rail privatisation. '(The amendment) allows BR, financed by taxpayers' money, to compete against its own management,' he said. He claimed that rail restructuring would bring about smaller and more manageable units and provide new opportunities. In his speech Mr MacGregor carefully avoided mentioning the Lords' amendment. In recent days, ministers have privately acknowledged that it would be difficult to defeat the amendment in the Commons because it has the support of some Conservative MPs. Mr MacGregor confined himself to saying that this matter would be considered when the House came back from its recess. 'The original bill was right,' he said. Mr MacGregor said that the government had given a commitment to the Lords that it would re-examine the arguments contained in their amendment. But he was concerned that it might discourage the enthusiasm of BR's regional managers to bid for franchises. 'There are some 30 management buy-outs in the offing for British rail,' he said. 'A lot of regional managers are ready to get up and go.' Touching on road policy in his speech, Mr MacGregor had said that the government had not yet decided whether to ask motorists to pay more directly for use of motorways. But responses to a recent green paper on motorway tolling revealed majority support among the organisations concerned for some form of charging if it led to more resources being spent on roads. He also reported that electronic tolling was much preferred to the introduction of permits, for which there was little support.</p>

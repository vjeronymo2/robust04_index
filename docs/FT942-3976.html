			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Securicor Cellnet has consistently underperformed Vodafone in market share, profits and cash flow since both won their licences in the mid 1980s. But it is hard to believe that Cellnet is worth only 45 per cent as much as its stronger rival. Yet that is the implication from the way the market values Securicor and Security Services, which together own 40 per cent of Cellnet. Securicor, which owns 13 per cent of Cellnet plus 51 per cent of Security Services, is valued at Pounds 830m. The 49 per cent of Security Services not owned by Securicor is valued at Pounds 380m. That gives a grand total of Pounds 1.21bn. On top of their stakes in Cellnet, the two companies have a range of other businesses worth perhaps Pounds 270m. So the implied market value of their 40 per cent Cellnet stakes is Pounds 940m, giving a value of Pounds 2.35bn for the whole company. Vodafone's market capitalisation is Pounds 5.2bn. These relative values seem misjudged not merely because Cellnet's cash flow is currently half Vodafone's and looks likely to rise faster. The probability that BT, which owns 60 per cent of Cellnet, will eventually want to take full control further enhances its value. Though BT is currently prevented from doing so by regulation, little political capital has been invested in maintaining the ban. And if BT were able to buy Cellnet, the chances are that it would pay a premium because of the benefits from integrating mobile services with its fixed network. All this leaves open the question of whether Securicor is undervalued or Vodafone overvalued. Investors could play safe by buying the former and selling the latter.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EQUIFAX TO BUY TELECREDIT FOR $577 MILLION  </P> <P> Telecredit, a Los Angeles-based check guarantee firm, said Thursday it agreed  to be acquired by Equifax, a provider of consumer credit ratings and financial  information.  </P> <P> Analysts hailed the tax-free stock-swap deal, valued at about $577 million  based on Thursday's closing market prices, as one that would produce a faster  growing, more competitive financial information company with revenues of more  than $1 billion.  </P> <P> "The deal makes an enormous amount of sense," said analyst Jackson Spears at  Chicago Corp., a securities firm. "This is a good fit."  </P> <P> Investors, however, were disappointed in the terms of the agreement, perhaps  hoping that Telecredit might fetch a higher price. Telecredit closed at $50.75,  down $2.50 in over-the-counter trading Thursday. Shares of Atlanta-based  Equifax fell $2.625 to close at $19.50 in New York Stock Exchange trading.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, Telecredit stockholders would have the right to trade each  of their shares for 2.69 common shares of Equifax. The companies have yet to  set a date for the swap.  </P> <P> Based on Thursday's closing prices, 2.69 shares of Equifax were worth $52.45,  or $577 million for the entire company. That's below the $660 million -- or $60  a share -- analysts had estimated Telecredit would fetch. Telecredit shares had  been trading at about $43 last week, just before it announced merger talks with  several unidentified firms.  </P> <P> Company executives were enthusiastic about the deal.  </P> <P> "What makes us so excited about merging with Equifax is that our businesses are  extremely complementary," said Telecredit Chairman Lee A. Ault III, who will  remain with the firm after the merger. "There is virtually no duplication."  </P> <P> Ault said he was uncertain if the merger would trigger any layoffs of the  company's 1,200 employees, or if Telecredit's operations would remain  independent or be integrated into Equifax's. He said he expected the firm would  be "substantially held intact" in the short term.  </P> <P> "Over time, this is going to create opportunities for employees," Ault said.  </P> <P> Telecredit guarantees $7 billion worth of checks a year for merchants. It also  processes credit card transactions for credit unions and small- to medium-sized  banks and savings and loans. Equifax sells information to insurance companies,  operates collection agencies and ranks as one of the nation's largest consumer  credit reporting firms.  </P> <P> Spears said the merger would boost the fortunes of both firms, which have  experienced slower growth in recent years. He noted that some of Telecredit's  retail and financial customers might be interested in using Equifax's  collection and credit rating services. Both firms also sell different types of  marketing research information.  </P> <P> Telecredit is "looking for ways to accelerate growth and improve marketing,"  said Spears. "Equifax is in a mature business. This was a good thing for them,  too."  </P> <P> "It gives Equifax the capability of offering more services to its customers,"  said information industry analyst J. Kendrick Noble Jr. at Paine Webber.  </P> <P> In a move to discourage last-minute bidders, Equifax may also receive an option  to purchase 19.5% of Telecredit's stock under the agreement. "That will give  Equifax some protection in case somebody else should come in," Ault said.  </P> <P> EQUIFAX AT A GLANCE  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.22IN:2.33IN:2.33IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year ended  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Sales  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Net income  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Dec. 31  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> in millions  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> in millions  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $840.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $35.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 743.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 39.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 670.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 30.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> For year ended Dec. 31, 1989:  </P> <P> Assets: $551.1 million  </P> <P> Employees: 12,714  </P> <P> Shares: 49.1 million  </P> <P> 12-month range: $22.375-$13.75  </P> <P> Thursday close: $19.50  </P> <P> </P> <P> TELECREDIT AT A GLANCE  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.33IN:2.33IN:2.99IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year ended  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Sales  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Net income (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> April 30  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> in millions  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> in millions  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $154.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $24.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 139.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> (6.9)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 121.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> For year ended April 30, 1989  </P> <P> Assets: $106.0 million  </P> <P> Employees: 1,200  </P> <P> Shares: 11 million  </P> <P> 12-month range: $54.25-$32.50  </P> <P> Thursday's close: $50.75  </P></p>

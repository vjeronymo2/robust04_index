			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Norwegian bank back in black at nine-month stage SPAREBANKEN Nor, Norway's third biggest bank in asset terms, yesterday disclosed it had returned to the black in the first nine months of this year, posting a pre-tax profit of NKr1.034bn (Dollars 14m), against a NKr210m loss last year. The sharp improvement was helped by substantial gains on securities, lower interest rates, and a decline in loan losses. The bank, known internationally as Union Bank of Norway, increased net interest income by NKr315m to NKr2.29bn in the nine-month period as other operating income - gains on securities and foreign exchange - more than doubled to NKr1.55bn from NKr671m. 'About half the improvement is due to gains on securities,' Sparebanken Nor said. Group operating expenses rose slightly by NKr84m to NKr1.85bn as operating profit, before credit losses and writedowns, more than doubled to NKr1.99bn, or 2.82 per cent of average assets, from NKr875m. Losses on loans and guarantees were cut by NKr124m to NKr944m.</p>

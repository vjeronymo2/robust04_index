			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Rise of right spreads to Slovenia THE rise of the extreme right in parts of Europe has spread to Slovenia, which votes tomorrow for the first time since the former Yugoslav republic declared independence in June 1991. The campaign success of an ultra-nationalist politician, Mr Zmago Jelincic, has surprised many Slovenes. With the slogan of 'Slovenia for the Slovenes', he has denounced some 100,000 guest workers from the former Yugoslavia for taking jobs from Slovenes. Mr Jelincic, who heads the Slovene National Party, has accused the 100,000 Bosnian refugees in Slovenia of having fled economic deprivation rather than war. 'They should be sent back. This is not their country. It is a different state,' he said in an interview yesterday. 'Jelincic stepped in with a clear right-wing message that could be understood by everybody,' says Mr Ervin Hladnik, a journalist of the independent weekly Mladina. The candidate could capture about 10 per cent of the parliamentary vote, which is likely to be split among the Christian Democratic Party, the United Left, a coalition which includes the reformed communists, and the centrist Liberal Democrats. The refugees, and an unemployment rate of 11.5 per cent, appear to have provided Mr Jelincic with plenty to protest about. A drop in living standards after the loss of Yugoslav export markets has also fostered the rise of nationalism in the tiny north-western republic, which borders Austria, Italy and Hungary. Mr Milan Kucan, the current president and strong favourite in the simultaneous presidential race, sees 'the intolerance as part of the 'Rostock syndrome' which is spreading across Germany.' It is due to a 'lack of perspective for young people,' says Mr Kucan. Over one million voters in Slovenia will go to the polls tomorrow. The parliamentary and presidential elections, follow a campaign marked by the absence of such issues as the economy and the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Instead, a jumble of political parties sought to forge their identity in the elections, which were called after the collapse of Demos, the broadly based ruling coalition. Under the guidance of reformed communists, Slovenia broke away from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia after a ten-day war in June 1991.</p>

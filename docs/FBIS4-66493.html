			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article with no byline] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Two-Ton Class Satellite in Geostationary Orbit </H5>   The H2 launch vehicle, which Japanese space technology  groups  have waited so long for, is finally going to liftoff in February  1994. It will be the first flight of the launcher, a vehicle  that is based completely on the domestically developed  technologies for the purpose of launching large geostationary  satellites.    All the Japanese launch vehicles in the past, beginning with  the N1, which was developed in 1974, and going to the N2 and H1,  which were used for launching communications, broadcasting,  weather, and earth-observation satellites were developed on the  basis of the Delta rocket technology imported from the United  States. The successful second-stage liquid oxygen/liquid  hydrogen engine, LE5, and the stable platform-type  inertial-guidance technology applied in the H1 launch vehicle  helped Japanese satellite-launching technology rise to the  highest level of the world.    As for the H2 launch vehicle, the research and development  of  the first-stage LOX/LH rocket engine, LE7, has been successfully  completed; the inaugural launching this time will be the final  confirmation of the development. The H2 is 49 meters high,  weighs 260 tons when fully equipped for launching a  geostationary satellite, and is capable of launching a two-ton  satellite into geostationary orbit.    The main features of the H2 launch vehicle are the latest  technologies employed in the first-stage engine, LE7, and the  inertial-guidance system. The LE7 is a two-stage  combustion-cycle high-pressure engine (main combustion chamber  pressure: 130 atm).  <H5>  LE7 -- Low-Pressure Design </H5>   The two most well-known LOX/LH high-pressure  high-performance  rocket engines based on the same cycle as LE7 are the SSME (200  atm), the main engine of the U.S. Space Shuttle, and the RD-120  (166 atm), the main engine of Energiya, Russia's giant rocket.  The ED-170, the engine of Energiya's SL-17/K-1 auxiliary rocket,  consumes liquid oxygen and kerosine as fuels, and its combustion  pressure is 250 atm. The SL-16, one of the launch vehicles that  Russia is planning to use as its entry vehicle into the world  commercial-satellite business, is equipped with the RD-170 in  the first stage and the RD-120 in the second stage.    The SSME of the United States was originally developed to be  re-used (the original plan was to use it 50 times), on the same  level as aircraft engines; in reality, however, it requires  substantial repairs each time. Since it is a high-pressure  engine, both the oxygen and hydrogen systems consist of two  system, i.e., low-pressure and high-pressure pump systems.  Because of the inherent problems of high-pressure oxygen-pump  system, the SSME is plagued with low reliability. Since the  Japanese LE7 is designed to operate at a much lower combustion  pressure, it has not experienced such problems.  <H5>  Laser Gyro </H5>   Russia's RD-170 uses the highest combustion pressure in the  world; consequently, it is attracting the attention of engine  builders all over the world. Although hot engine spots of the  SSME and LE7 are cooled by hydrogen, such spots in the RD-170  are cooled by oxygen, which may well be the new direction in the  future.    The strap-down method used in the H2 for the guidance and  navigational system is the latest technology. Different from the  platform method, in which the local level is maintained in the  vehicle irrespective of the motion of the vehicle, the  strap-down method uses the onboard computer to calculate the  attitude, position, and velocity vector of the vehicle to guide  it to the target. Since it does not have any mechanical moving  parts, a high reliability is expected to be achieved. The H2 is  also equipped with a laser gyro, a Japanese cutting-edge  electronics technology.    The H2 launch vehicle will gain for Japan the status of a  full-fledged player in the world's commercial satellite business  when it succeeds in launching Engineering Test Satellite 6 in  the summer of 1994. The test launching in February 1994 is the  first step toward that goal to bring about a successful launch.</p>

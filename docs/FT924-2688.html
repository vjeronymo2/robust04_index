			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Directors face ban over safety BUSINESS CHIEFS who flout health and safety law may be banned from being company directors and face heavy fines, the Health and Safety Executive warned yesterday. Lewes Crown Court, sitting at Hove, East Sussex, disqualified Mr Rodney Chapman, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, from being a company director for two years and fined him Pounds 5,000 in a prosecution brought by the executive earlier this year. It was the first time a director has been banned under the 1986 Company Directors Disqualification Act for breaching health and safety law. The Health and Safety Commission's annual report, published yesterday, shows that accidents and ill health at work are costing employers up to Pounds 9bn a year.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Brooke Tool cuts losses to Pounds 390,000 Reduced overheads and improved gross margins helped Brooke Tool Engineering (Holdings), the components, cutting tools and springs company, return to the black at the operating level. However, interest charges of Pounds 421,000 (Pounds 811,000) pushed the pre-tax figure into losses of Pounds 390,000 (Pounds 4.06m) for the year to end-September. Mr John Dashper, chairman, described the outcome as 'encouraging against a background of only marginal improvement in activity levels'. Turnover from continuing operations was Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 15.6m).</p>

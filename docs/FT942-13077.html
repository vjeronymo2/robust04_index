			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / World Trade News: US, Canada edge towards farm curbs The US and Canada, pressed by their farm lobbies, will soon begin negotiations that could undo, at least in the short term, much of the agriculture trade liberalisation so painfully negotiated under the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Even as the trade ministers in Marrakesh were signing the Uruguay Round deal, US and Canadian negotiators were in another room negotiating deals to protect their farmers. Mr Mike Espy, the US agriculture secretary, said talks in Marrakesh broke down over Canada's refusal to increase US market access for dairy, poultry and eggs, and its insistence on maintaining wheat exports at current levels. Unable to reach agreement, the US on Friday said it would act in 90 days to limit grain imports under Article 28 of Gatt. Canada has responded by threatening reprisals against apples, bourbon, bread, chicken, rice, tomato products and wine. Besides Canada's restrictions on dairy, poultry and eggs, the US is complaining about Canadian exports of peanuts, sugar and sugar-containing products. At the root of the disputes - as has long been the case - is the similarity of farm production in the two neighbouring countries. Neither government is ready to let freer trade take its course. What could result from the current stand-off is a far-reaching deal across sectors which could limit access to the Canadian market for dairy and poultry while curbing sugar and grain imports to the US. A deal to change tariffs would have to get US congressional approval. That ordinarily would be attached to the Uruguay Round implementing legislation, but the Clinton administration has yet to find the money in the budget to compensate for the lower tariffs agreed in the round. Furthermore, the administration, which has been forced to act on earlier promises to prairie state senators, is now finding new opposition. Eighteen senators from states producing pasta and poultry have threatened to block adoption of a deal. To the disgust of its farm lobby, US officials are determined to act on Canada's grain imports under Gatt's multilateral rules, instead of acting unilaterally under a US law which allows the US to impose tariffs or quotas if imports are having a negative impact on the US farm programme. Mr Mace Thornton, spokesman for the American Farm Bureau, said the US has repeatedly opposed the use of Article 28 - by the EU for example - and threatened retaliation if it were used. For the US to use it and at the same time withdraw tariff reduction commitments negotiated under Nafta would 'set a bad precedent'. The Farm Bureau, the most ardent supporter of the Uruguay Round, wants the administration to delay action until completion of a study by the International Trade Commission on the effects of imports on the US price support programme. If this finds negative impact, it wants action under US law. The US could then avoid paying compensation, but would risk a full-blown trade war with its biggest trading partner.</p>

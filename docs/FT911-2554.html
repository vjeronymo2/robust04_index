			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Tootal forecasts 40% rise TOOTAL Group has issued a profits forecast which it says demonstrates conclusively that the Pounds 194m hostile bid from textiles rival Coats Viyella seriously undervalues the company. Tootal is forecasting a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to about Pounds 32.5m in the year to January 31 1992. It also expects earnings per share to be about 8p, an increase of 90 per cent, because of a much lower tax charge than last year. Mr John Craven, chairman, said: 'Our profit forecast and the specific projects which will benefit profitability next year are evidence of the transformation which has taken place in Tootal.' The stock market now expects Coats, which owns 29.4 per cent of Tootal, to increase its original cash offer of 65p per share. Tootal shares closed on Friday 1p up at 77p. Coats shares were 2p higher at 142p. Most of the improvement in Tootal's results is expected to come from the UK after action to eliminate losses, reduce overheads and improve cash management. Last year's tax charge was pushed up to 44.4 per cent by a large amount of unrelieved advanced corporation tax. However, Tootal forecasts that tax in the current year will be only 25.5 per cent. Mr Craven said: 'Coats' offer woefully undervalues Tootal's prospects, representing only 7.8 times Tootal's forecast earnings.' Coats countered the statement by saying the forecast tax charge was exceptionally low and it did not believe that Tootal could sustain this level in future years.</p>

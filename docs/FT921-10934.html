			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Securiguard confounds City expectations SECURIGUARD confounded City expectations with a 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profits and a sharp reduction in debt that sparked a 17p jump in the share price to 136p. Pre-tax profits for the year to November 3 1991 rose from Pounds 3.86m to Pounds 5.03m on sales up 7.5 per cent at Pounds 161.6m. Mr Alan Baldwin, chairman, said debt had been cut from Pounds 17.2m to Pounds 12.7m after payment of a Pounds 1.9m installment for the acquisition of Madison Building Services group, increasing interest cover to over three times. Most of this reduction came from reducing the level of debtor days as management focused more time on existing businesses rather than new acquisitions. The core security and cleaning activities in the UK grew strongly. Trading profits expanded 22 per cent to Pounds 3.8m for security services, while cleaning rose 16 per cent to Pounds 1.62m. In the US, where the company was suffering from a more serious recession, trading profits fell 18 per cent to Pounds 1.8m on sales 24 per cent higher at Pounds 49.6m. A reorganised overnight parcel delivery service increased its profits on reduced sales as the volume of 'next-day' deliveries carried by City Link networks grew by more than 40 per cent. The weak link remained the personnel service division where losses were slightly reduced to Pounds 700,000 following cost cutting, but on sales down from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 12.9m. Mr Baldwin said contracts won in Europe would reduce the losses to under Pounds 500,000 this year, a level that justified the decision not to close the division. Earnings per share rose 21 per cent to 17p (14p) and the final dividend is raised to 5.3p, giving a total up from 8p to 8.5p. COMMENT Securiguard has incurred its share of City wrath in the last couple of years for letting debt rise too high and for surprising the market with profits warnings. Last year's sharp reduction in debt will go a long way towards regaining confidence. Even though it will be difficult to repeat the debt reduction by further squeezing working capital, fewer acquisitions should mean interest cover can again increase. Concerns remain about the the personnel services sector where the only signs of improvement come from additional contracts in Europe rather than an upturn in the industry. Nevertheless, estimates of pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.7m for 1991 seem conservative. This would give earnings per share of 19.2p and a prospective multiple still languishing at a modest 7. The stock may not, however, be fully priced until bridges are fully rebuilt with the City.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPOINTMENT BOOKS RANGE FROM MERELY TRENDY TO HIGH TECH  </P> <P> As briefcases have become more varied and complex to appeal to a greater  variety of people, so too has another piece of business gear: the appointment  book.  </P> <P> Once a simple affair -- sporting perhaps a calendar and a pen holder -- some  appointment books have become as large as briefcases and as complicated as  computers.  </P> <P> Casio Inc., a big Japanese consumer electronics company, has a new device they  call the B.O.S.S. (for business organizing scheduling system). The B.O.S.S.,  which is about the size of a checkbook, can electronically list appointments,  write memos, exchange data with a personal computer and sound an electronic  alarm that reminds the busy executive that he or she has another appointment.  </P> <P> Yet bells and whistles aren't confined to electronic products. Ordinary  paper-based appointment books are sprouting new twists also.  </P> <P> Culver City-based Day Runner Inc., a leading maker of appointment books and  scheduling aids, says the market for such products has changed dramatically  since the company was founded in 1980.  </P> <P> Demand has cooled for the company's original product: bright red, green or blue  vinyl appointment books that included a simple calendar and note pad and closed  with a Velcro strap.  </P> <P> But sales of the company's more conservative -- and costlier -- black- and  burgundy-leather covered books have increased so much that the company no  longer sells the original vinyl product.  </P> <P> "We had to tone them down, then get rid of them completely," Hope Neiman, vice  president-marketing, said in reference to the bright-colored appointment books.  </P> <P> "What happened," she continued, "was that (our original) trendy female-oriented  item, became a business tool for men and women. And people wanted to look  businesslike." So they opted for the leather books, which combined listings for  telephone numbers, appointments, memos and other notes.  </P> <P> Although Day Runner sells appointment books for as little as $10, its top of  the line model, the $250 "Entrepreneur," is as large and expensive as some  briefcases.  </P> <P> "I don't think we are going to deceive ourselves and say that this is the only  thing an executive needs to carry," Neiman said of the portfolio-sized  organizer, which has retractable handles to make it easier to carry. "There are  still things they are going to need a briefcase for."  </P> <P> As for competition from electronic scheduling organizers such as Casio's,  Neiman said: "I'm not terribly concerned. People still operate mostly on a  paper-based systems."  </P></p>

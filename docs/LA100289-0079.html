			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE'S ENERGY SUPPLY FACES GREATER SQUEEZE;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS, DWINDLING RESERVES WILL HIKE PRICES, ANALYSTS SAY  </P> <P> Off the coast of Santa Barbara sit three oil platforms, part of a 10-year-old,  $2-billion investment in California's energy future. In all that time, they  have yet to produce a drop of oil -- and it's anyone's guess when they will.  </P> <P> In 1979, Chevron Corp. and a consortium of oil companies paid more than $500  million for the rights to develop the Point Arguello field, an undersea  reservoir of oil and gas estimated at between 300 million to 500 million  barrels. It is one of the most significant finds since the vast North Slope  field in Alaska, company officials said.  </P> <P> The companies already have built three platforms, 26 miles of pipelines and  sizeable onshore facilities. But regulatory, environmental and community  challenges have kept the project on hold, consuming $500,000 a day in interest  alone.  </P> <P> In August, the California Coastal Commission handed the project its latest  setback, denying a request to use tankers to transport crude to onshore  processing plants, arguing that Chevron had not sufficiently explored the use  of environmentally safer pipelines.  </P> <P> "We've been after this thing for 10 years now, and we may well be another year  away from doing it. . . . To say it's difficult is an understatement," said  Richard J. Harris, general manager of the Western region land department for  Chevron.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conflicting Forces  </P> <P> The project exemplifies two forces in California: those that want to develop  the state's energy supplies and those that want to control that development. As  California relies increasingly on dwindling energy reserves both at home and in  Alaska, those forces will come more into conflict, exacerbated by the state's  energy isolation from the rest of the country, observers said.  </P> <P> "There is going to be a big contradiction or clash between the economic public  good and the environmental public good, and it will be more pronounced in  California than anywhere else in the world," said Fereidun Fesharaki, head of  the energy program at the East-West Center in Honolulu, a nonprofit research  center funded by the federal government.  </P> <P> For the average consumer, the long-term outlook could mean either limited  supply, higher prices, or both.  </P> <P> "We're going to be worse off than the rest of the country in that respect,"  said H. D. Maxwell, president of Unocal Corp.'s oil and gas division.  </P> <P> In many ways, California is a unique and isolated energy market. It is defined  on the north and east by mountain ranges and on the west by the Pacific. No  major pipelines bring crude or refined products into the state from other parts  of the country.  </P> <P> Any outside oil -- even from the Gulf of Mexico -- must come in by tanker.  </P> <P> Similarly, there are only a couple of major pipelines bringing natural gas into  the state, mainly from the Southwest, though several projects have been  proposed.  </P> <P> None of which has mattered much recently. California exports oil to other parts  of the country. It ranks fourth among the states in oil production, second in  production from the outer continental shelf, according to state estimates. It  is practically the sole source of refined product for Arizona and Nevada,  according to the California Energy Commission.  </P> <P> But the state's comfortable supply situation may change in the long run. For  one thing, California remains increasingly dependent on just two sources of  oil: its own fields and those on the North Slope of Alaska.  </P> <P> California can handle short-term disruptions in supply, such as the Exxon  Valdez oil spill in March, although such interruptions mean higher prices.  "There's enough elasticity in the world petroleum market and on the spot market  that shortages could be made up over a short period of time," said Charles R.  Imbrecht, chairman of the California Energy Commission. The commission has put  together a detailed plan to meet such contingencies, ranging all the way up to  a major disaster that shuts off the Alaskan spigot entirely.  </P> <P> But in the long term, "I certainly have to say that over the next 20 years, we  face the dilemma of having to depend on foreign imports," he said.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most important factor is the decline of the Alaska reservoir, which  provided 43.2% of the 708.8 million barrels of crude received by state  refineries in 1988, according to Energy Commission figures. The rest was  supplied by state fields, 51.5%, and foreign imports mainly from Indonesia,  about 5.2%. In the first half of 1989, Alaska accounted for 46.8% of California  refinery crude.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unusual Decline  </P> <P> Production of oil, natural gas and condensates from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay fields  began to decline in 1988 from a peak of 1.6 million barrels per day, with this  year's production expected to amount to only 1.4 million barrels, said Albert  Greenstein, a spokesman for Atlantic Richfield Co. in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> This year's sharp decline is unusual and partly attributable to warmer weather  and the Exxon spill, both of which reduced production. But Greenstein said Arco  expects Alaskan production to continue to fall at an average annual rate of 4%  to 5%.  </P> <P> State reserves remain promising, both offshore and inland, particularly from  the century-old fields in Kern County.  </P> <P> But development of those resources may be restricted by a number of things.  </P> <P> Air quality restrictions are limiting the amount that oil companies can expand  plants to generate the steam necessary to extract thick oil from Kern County  fields. The restrictions also require the plants to burn more natural gas to  generate the steam.  </P> <P> But natural gas needed by these so-called enhanced oil recovery projects is  limited by available pipeline capacity. A number of competing pipelines are now  vying for approvals and customers to bring such gas into Kern County from  Canada, the Southwest and the Rocky Mountains, but none has been built.  </P> <P> Plans to develop offshore oil reserves have been stymied in the wake of the  disastrous Valdez spill. Eleven new offshore platforms and six man-made islands  are proposed or under construction in state and federal waters offshore, to be  added to the current 29, according to the Coastal Commission.  </P> <P> But in July, Congress passed two versions of a one-year moratorium on drilling  off most areas of the U.S. coast. A moratorium would postpone until at least  October, 1990, any pre-lease activity on proposed lease sales off the  California coast.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Report Due Soon  </P> <P> The moratorium could affect the proposed sales of three major lease areas:  Lease Sale 91 off Northern California, scheduled this month; Lease Sale 95 off  Southern California, scheduled for April, 1990, and Lease Sale 119 off Central  California, proposed for March, 1991.  </P> <P> Earlier, President Bush indefinitely postponed the leasing of 91 and 95 while a  task force studied environmental issues. The task force is scheduled to make  its report by Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the California Coastal Commission has voted its objections to the  three lease sales, citing what it considers unacceptable risks of oil spills,  air pollution, visual blight and conflicts with the fishing and tourism  industries.  </P> <P> In any case, the commission estimates that total production in the Santa  Barbara Channel and the Santa Maria Basin, the most productive areas of the  outer continental shelf off Southern California, could peak in 1999 at 247,600  barrels of oil per day.  </P> <P> No one disputes the need for environmental care, particularly given  California's smog problems and the destruction from the Exxon oil spill. But  that doesn't lessen the frustration of executives such as Maxwell. "I'm not  implying that we shouldn't do these things, but the result will be a lower  supply of California crude and a greater dependence on imported crude," he  said.  </P> <P> Of course, environmentalists and others argue that the simple solution is to  reduce demand. "I think the issue here is one of looking at both the demand  side as well as the supply side issues," said David Goldstein, senior staff  scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council's San Francisco office.  "If there's a restriction on refinery construction, that means either you've  got to build more refineries (somewhere else), or reduce demand to the  capability of existing ones . . . and from an economic viewpoint, it's easier  to reduce demand than to increase supply."  </P> <P> So far, however, demand for refined products in California continues to  increase, rising to 565.8 million barrels in 1988 from 502.1 million in 1984,  the Energy Commission reported. Yet it's been nearly 20 years since the last  refinery was built in California.  </P> <P> Squeezed margins prompted refiners here and around the country to close  marginally efficient refineries in the early 1980s -- removing about 13% of the  state's refining capacity, according to one estimate. California ranked second  in refining capacity among the states in 1988, accounting for about 16% of  total capacity, according to state figures.  </P> <P> Tighter state and federal emissions regulations and increasing demand for  higher grades of gasoline meant that refineries needed more crude to produce  the same volume of gasoline. Refiners were able to keep up by increasing plant  efficiency and "debottlenecking" operations.  </P> <P> But as prices fell and demand increased, refineries found the need to run at  much higher rates, many over 90% for much of this summer.  </P> <P> Still, there is little incentive to build new refineries. It would cost about  $2 billion to build a new 235,000-barrel-per-day refinery in California -- and  that's provided a refiner could get the necessary permits, hardly a sure thing  in an era of increased environmental awareness.  </P> <P> If there were to be a major disruption in the supply of gasoline or refined  product, they would have to be imported by tanker -- there are no major  pipelines to bring such products into the state.  </P> <P> That could take weeks to arrange. Among other things, gasolines would have to  meet California's strict emissions standards.  </P> <P> All of which could mean a sharp spike in prices, as evidenced by the fallout  from the Exxon Valdez spill.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Risk Increases  </P> <P> The tightness of the market was again demonstrated by a fire last month at a  Shell Oil Co. refinery in the San Francisco Bay Area, which caused prices for  future gasoline contracts to jump more than a penny a gallon in one day.  </P> <P> The surprising thing about the Shell fire was not that it occurred, but that it  hadn't occurred sooner or in a bigger way, observers said. "Obviously, with  mechanical equipment, there is some greater risk whenever the equipment is  pushed harder," said Robert Cunningham, a vice president with the Dallas  consulting firm of Turner, Mason &amp; Co. "If you drive your automobile across  country at high speed, rather than just across Los Angeles, you have a greater  chance of mechanical breakdown, particularly if you're doing it for hours in a  row," he said.  </P> <P> "You add those things up, and it adds up to tighter product availability and  higher prices, and the only thing that can overcome the (problem) is the  incentive to make the investment to make the product available -- which again  means higher prices . . . or building capacity overseas," said Dennis Lamb, a  manager of planning at Unocal. "We're virtually being forced offshore," he  said.  </P> <P> "There is a fundamental contradiction in California's approach to (energy)  problems," said Richard Gordon, director of market analysis with the Petroleum  Finance Co. Ltd. in Washington. "They are simultaneously restricting supply --  and that's what's happening, whether you're talking about restrictions on  refiners or delays in bringing supply into the market. . . . At the same time,  though, there are a number of key factors -- growth in California,  demographics, economic demand -- saying we need more supply. . . . That's not a  sustainable situation."  </P></p>

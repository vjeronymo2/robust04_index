			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> Yaron Enosh; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Enosh] We have just heard that the PLO has  decided to recall its representatives to the talks with Israel  in Cairo, Paris, and Washington for consultations in Tunis. We  want your reaction, sir.    [Peres] I do not know this for a fact, and I would not rush  to react. There are always rumors and decisions reported, and I  would rather wait for the most official announcement before I  make any comment. There is no doubt in my mind, however, that  what happened in Hebron yesterday greatly complicates the  negotiations. This madman brought a moral disgrace upon our  people. It also caused a deterioration in our political  standing, and I do not take this lightly at all. This will not  only speed up the negotiations, it will make them more  complicated, more difficult; this is clear as day. We cannot  turn this entire country into a madhouse, even if there are a  few madmen. Madmen should be put away.    [Enosh] We have heard remarks from people who support the  act.    [Peres] You should not have broadcasted them. It is a  shame, a disgrace. Their remarks are shameful.    [Enosh] This could mean, however, that we are dealing with  more than just an individual; perhaps a large group of people  who support him?    [Peres] Look, whoever does not meet the criteria set by the  law, should be outlawed. One cannot shoot and murder people and  come up with stories. That group of people who justify the act  are no angels from heaven, nor do they represent the people of  Israel. They have no authority, and they should not brag. They  gave the Jewish people a very sad day, a moral disgrace, and  with all due respect for the Cave of Patriarchs, the Ten  Commandments are not less sacred. There it says: Thou shalt  not kill; and they have killed.    [Enosh] Are you saying that measures should be taken against  these people?    [Peres] I believe that people who do not respect the law,  should be outlawed.    [Enosh] Yesterday's cabinet meeting discussed some of the  measures. What more do you believe should be done to prevent  such things from recurring and such remarks from being uttered?    [Peres] We decided that we will make resolutions tomorrow.  I will be at tomorrow's cabinet session, and speak there. I  will state, however, that there is no doubt that the harshest  and clearest measures must be taken to prevent the fire of  hatred from bursting out of this place and prevent the violation  of all human norms. The Jewish people are a humanitarian  nation. It is not a nation of murderers who shoot innocent  people. None of them has a right to justify this shameful act.    [Enosh] I would like to move on to the political issues,  in view of the loathsome murders in Hebron. Israel has, in  fact, reneged on one of the principles it insisted on for quite  a long time, and agreed to moving the security talks with PLO  out of the region, out of Taba.    [Peres] There is no doubt that at this stage we must save  the negotiations. Certainly, yesterday's incident places an  enormous burden on us. There is no point in playing down the  crime or the damage it caused. Certainly it made our standing  more difficult, and certainly we are no longer free to do  whatever we want. Israel is greatly interested today in  demonstrating that indeed it means peace; real peace, not the  peace of madmen.    [Enosh] We have heard that political sources in Jerusalem  said that this will speed up....    [Peres, interrupting] I do not know who those sources are,  and I do not know what they said. It is absolutely clear that  matters are very complicated now. We scored no achievement nor  half an achievement, and there is no point in portraying this as  such. The incident harmed us and caused us damage despite the  fact that it was done by a single madman who feeds on a larger  madness.    [Enosh] The PLO, through its UN representative, is currently  demanding that an international force be placed in the area  because, it claims, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the  State of Israel are unable to maintain order in the territories.  This is a very complicated call from our point of view, but do  you believe such a resolution could ever pass?    [Peres] Absolutely not. We have seen multinational forces  in Somalia and Bosnia. Such a force cannot bring about peace.  Peace is the business of politicians. Regrettably, a  multinational force has never succeeded in its task, be it in  Angola, Somalia, Bosnia, or Lebanon.</p>

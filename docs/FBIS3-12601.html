			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] In its editorial headlined "The Peace Process Is at  a Crucial Turning Point," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: Yitzhaq  Rabin's statements these days are of no use to the peace  process. Rabin tells settlers that there will be no Palestinian  state, that the settlements illegally established in the  occupied territories will not be dismantled, that there will be  no withdrawal from occupied Jerusalem, that Israel will not  abandon its racism, and that Israel will not recognize the  Palestinian people's national rights.    AL-BA'TH adds: At the same time, Rabin is being generous to  the world public opinion by giving it some analgesics by saying  that 1994 will be the year of achieving peace in the Middle East.    AL-BA'TH says: Rabin came with his party majority to the  Knesset under the banner of peace to replace Shamir, who  obstructed, hampered, and froze the peace process, and brought  tension to U.S.- Israeli relations with his crude rejection of  U.S. proposals. It is known that the most important promises  Rabin gave to Israeli voters -- who are sick of the policy of  wars, military invasions, occupation of others' land, rebellion  against international legitimacy, and rejection of several  initiatives to establish peace in the region -- was his  commitment to deviate from Shamir's method and to cooperate with  the United States to reactivate the peace process and to enable  it to achieve its objectives.    The paper says: Had it not been for the Geneva meeting  between President Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton and its  positive results which paved the way for embarking on new  attempts to resume the peace talks, these talks would have  remained frozen, not to say halted.    The paper clarifies: Every time Syria removes an Israeli  mine from the road of peace, Rabin's government plants new  mines. Every time Syria makes a step to push the peace process  forward, Israel takes several steps backward. These steps have  forced it to leave the peace process and its talks in Washington  for the corridors of secret talks in Oslo.    The paper holds Rabin and his government fully responsible  for obstructing and foiling the peace talks in Washington and  for planting mines on their road.    Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Unless the Israeli obstacles are  seriously and decisively surmounted, the peace process will  continue to be exposed to further erosion, destruction, and  collapse, and the talk about peace, stability, and security in  the region will be sheer imagination and deception.    The newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: Israeli officials often  resort to making provocative and skeptical statements to play  down the importance of the peace process and to give pessimistic  impressions about the possibility of reaching a just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East. They try to draw a very  dark and melancholic picture for the future of the peace process  in order to achieve their objective of making others believe  that peace can only be achieved in accordance with the Israeli  concept, namely, that the Arabs should relinquish their land and  rights and accept partial solutions and separate deals tailored  in accordance with Israel's expansionist objectives. The paper  quotes a recent statement by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin in Madrid in which he described the peace talks as being a  bazaar and a commercial deal.    AL-THAWRAH says: If this is Yitzhaq Rabin's concept of the  talks, no one can be optimistic about the approach of peace.  Neither can anyone claim the peace talks are proceeding in the  right direction.    The paper clarifies: Peace, in its humanitarian sense,  cannot be compared with a commercial deal that is subject to  compromise and blackmail and which can take place at the expense  of one party. Such a description shows a backward mentality that  is not in harmony with the contemporary international trend that  considers peace a pressing need necessitated by security,  stability, and justice in the world.    Concluding, the paper says: If Rabin attacks Syria due to  its insistence on the need for a just and comprehensive peace in  the Middle East, due to its rejection of partial solutions and  separate deals, and due to its commitment to restoring the  occupied Arab territories in full, he should realize that  Syria's policy will continue to be clear and firm, and that no  one can divert it from its objectives and principles.</p>

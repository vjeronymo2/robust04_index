			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Raine cuts dividend despite rise to Pounds 10.8m RAINE, the housebuilder and contractor, made a greater than expected cut in its final dividend yesterday after reporting a modest 8 per cent increase in pre-tax profits. The group is paying a 1p final, down from 4p, halving the total for the year to the end of June to 3p. Earnings per share increased from 3.73p to 4.34p, but this included an exceptional gain of Pounds 3.42m, mainly from foreign exchange gains and a Pounds 2.1m provision for closure of its Plumb joinery operation. Raine's shares fell only 6p to 84p on the unexpectedly large dividend cut. But the shares are now 12 per cent below the 95p rights issue price in March 1992 when Raine paid Pounds 33.5m in shares for Walter Lawrence. The profits increase from Pounds 10m to Pounds 10.8m came on sales up 23 per cent at Pounds 446m. The group also made a further Pounds 3.5m provision - directly against reserves - to cover a reduction in value of land bought in Kent and Hampshire as part of the Walter Lawrence acquisition. Strong cash generation, partly from sale of stock acquired with Walter Lawrence, helped reduce gearing from 35 per cent to 22.3 per cent on net debt of Pounds 26.2m. Mr Peter Parkin, chairman, said housebuilding was becoming an increasingly important part of group profits. The group increased the number of homes built from 2,442 in 1992 to 3,337 and had enjoyed an increase in visitor and reservation levels in the spring. Mr Parkin said economic conditions for West Venture, the southern Californian housebuilding business, were similar to those in the UK but without the benefit of the increased spring activity. With no sign of economic recovery in southern California, 'profit margins may come under increasing pressure,' he said. Mr Parkin said West Venture, which is tying up Dollars 57m (Pounds 38m) of gross assets, was up for sale but that there was no pressure for a quick sale. COMMENT Raine's greater than expected dividend cut is hardly surprising. Underlying earnings stripped of such funnies as the unrepeatable foreign exchange gains just cover the new total of 3p, giving the group a sound base from which to resume dividend growth in a couple of years. But there was much in yesterday's results to explain why Raine trades at a discount to its peers. There is, so far, little sign of additional profits from the Walter Lawrence acquisition 18 months ago - and the group made further provisions against the value of the business, bypassing the p&amp;l account to boot. There was also the foreign exchange gain that had little to do with cash or profit. Nor is Raine as pure a UK housing play as Barratt or Wimpey, weighed down as it is by its contracting side, and its distant Californian business. Add to that the fact that like other housebuilders, Raine is hostage to a good budget in November - in its terms, few VAT increases and further cuts in interest rates - and Raine at a prospective multiple of about 20 on pre-tax profits this year of Pounds 13m, deserves to be approached with some caution.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Audrius Baciulis from Brussels] </F>   [Excerpt] President Algirdas Brazauskas signed the  documents of a new NATO program--an invitation and a declaration  on the Partnership for Peace---in Brussels today.    According to this act, Lithuania has the right to take part  in all the events and projects of the Partnership for Peace  program. Lithuania has become the second Eastern European state  to join this NATO program. The documents of Partnership for  Peace were signed by the Romanian foreign minister yesterday.    Brazauskas arrived in Brussels today from Holland, together  with Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys and Minister of National  Defense Linas Linkevicius. At noon Lithuanian time, he was  welcomed at the entrance to the NATO headquarters in Brussels by  Ambassador Amadeo de Franchis, acting NATO general secretary,  and Adolfas Venckus, Lithuanian ambassador at the European  Union. After a brief conversation with de Franchis, Brazauskas  went to the oval NATO hall, where 16 NATO members were waiting.    In his welcoming speech, de Franchis said that NATO was  pleased at this decision by Lithuania and stressed that Article  8 of the Partnership for Peace provides that, if there is a  threat to the state taking part in the Partnership for Peace  program, to the security and independence of that state, NATO  would begin intensive consultations with that state. Active  participation by Lithuania in the Partnership for Peace program  would step up its rapprochement to NATO. The ambassador of  Belgium--which represents Lithuania's interests in  NATO--(?Gering) said that the idea that Lithuania should come  closer to NATO emerged in this organization as early as  September of 1992, after a speech by Vytautas Landsbergis at the  North Atlantic Assembly. The Danish ambassador stressed that  the Partnership for Peace has been created, not in place of NATO  membership, but as a direct path to it. NATO, for its part,  will do everything to see that this process develops  successfully.    In a reply speech, delivered in English, Brazauskas stressed  that Lithuania's security is indivisible from European security.  It is best ensured by joining European structures--above all,  the European Union and NATO. Lithuania will strive to become a  member of these organizations. Lithuania welcomes the  Partnership for Peace program, but Brazauskas thought that it  did not satisfy the requirements of states striving to become  NATO members. This is a compromise solution oriented toward the  future. He stressed that Lithuania, as already stated in a  letter to Manfred Woerner, is striving to become a full NATO  member. Lithuania supports common aims by the Baltic states to  integrate in Europe and will do everything for the further  integration of the Baltic states.    Brazauskas also stressed that Lithuania, according to  international standards, demands a complete and unconditional  withdrawal of the Russian Army from the Baltic states. Russia's  statements about the near abroad and about its rights to  maintain peace on the former Soviet Union's territory have  nothing in common with the international law and the Partnership  for Peace program.    Brazauskas expressed his belief, in conclusion, that a day  will come when the Lithuanian president will sign in this hall a  document stating that Lithuania has become a full NATO member.

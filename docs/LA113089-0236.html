			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STRANGE TIES THE COURSE RECORD IN MELBOURNE  </P> <P> U.S. Open champion Curtis Strange shot a 7-under-par 65 today to tie the course  record and grab a one-stroke lead after the first round of the Australian Open  championship.  </P> <P> Strange carded two eagles, five birdies and two bogeys on the par-72,  6,847-yard Kingston Heath course to tie the record set by Gary Player in 1970  and tied by Ronan Rafferty of Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> "A course record is very nice, but it doesn't mean you have the tournament  won," Strange said.  </P> <P> "I'm very pleased. It's always nice to get off to a good start. I drove well  today and made some nice putts."  </P> <P> The highlight of Strange's round came when he sank a 9-iron from 140 yards for  an eagle at the 365 yards par-4 second hole.  </P> <P> Australian PGA champion Peter Senior and three of his compatriots, Lucien  Tinkler, Brett Ogle and Jeff Woodland, had rounds of 66 to keep the pressure on  Strange.  </P> <P> British Open champion Mark Calcavecchia was one shot further back at 67, tied  with Australians Tony Wolsey and Steven Bann, after beginning a roller-coaster  round with a bogey at the first hole.  </P> <P> He had two other bogeys on his card but also shot eight birdies, including five  in six holes from the fourth to the ninth.  </P> <P> Masters champion Nick Faldo of Britain was three shots off the lead after a 68,  four better than three-time champion Greg Norman, who had a disastrous  triple-bogey in his round of 72.  </P> <P> Defending champion Calcavecchia was angered by slow play in near-perfect  conditions.  </P> <P> Many players took more than five hours to complete the 18 holes.  </P> <P> "I couldn't believe it," Calcavecchia said. "If it had been windy, it would  have taken six hours.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Myroslav Popovych, corresponding member of </F> the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, doctor of philosophical  studies, by Maryana Oliynyk; place and date not given: "There Is  No Place To Retreat -- Behind Us Lies Moscow"]    [Text] Myroslav Volodymyrovych, in analyzing the results of  the recent elections to the Supreme Soviet, some say: how  wonderful that our people have demonstrated their political  awareness by expressing their will in such large numbers.  Others, on the other hand, say: how terrible that our people  elected Lord knows whom. Which view do you support?    [Popovych] This is one and the same phenomenon. The fact  that  people took such an active part in the elections and the fact  that they sometimes did not vote for the people they should have  voted for -- these are two sides of the same coin. This means  that the public is uneasy, in an aggressive mood, and does not  know what to do... The political culture of the general masses  is exactly what one would expect it to be in a region where  people have lived only a few years in a parliamentary republic.  e live in a free country -- you can't deny that. However, under  normal circumstances, people are somewhat less politically  active than what we are seeing here. In the West, towards which  we constantly look, a 50-60 percent turnout is considered  wonderful, because it is natural for people to be more involved  in other things than politics. Obviously, the turnout has to be  large enough to ensure that the elections are valid. But if  everyone runs to the polls in a parliamentary republic, this is  a sign of an unhealthy situation. It means that the society is  ill, that it is running a fever. It means that the political  structure is ailing. This explains the high turnout at the polls  as well as what I would call such a radical voting pattern.  Moreover, there were people among those who were first to cross  the finish line in the election marathon who had no constructive  program in their heart of hearts. Strictly speaking, neither the  radical-communists, nor the radical-nationalists had any  intention of presenting any plans for overcoming the economic  crisis. All they wanted was a tribune from which to be heard.  Why -- to destabilize the situation? To assume power?    A weak political center is a symptom of the same disease.    [Oliynyk] Incidentally, how do you explain the defeat of the  centrist political forces in the elections to the Supreme  Council? From time to time, one party or another announced its  intention to take a position in the center. One had the  impression that there was no more room there, and yet...    [Popovych] One reason for this is the objective cirumstance  that centrist ideas are unpopular in the conditions in which we  live today. But if we were to conduct a comprehensive  sociological survey to determine what it is that people really  want... In fact, we did just that, and we took into account the  results of such studies when working out the program of the  Democratic Center [Demtsentr], an alliance of centrist  politicians formed shortly before the parliamentary elections. I  was one of the authors of this program. The surveys show that  the people really want centrist methods of solving the different  problems. Methods that only the centrist parties can offer these  days. But these centrists parties were left, as the Russians  say, "unclaimed." Largely because the majority of our country's  intelligentsia has remained outside all political parties. And  the parties that do exist are losing members. It is, after all,  difficult to carry on an enormous amount of preelection work,  virtually for nothing and in one's own valuable free time. What  is more, the intelligentsia takes an ironic view of political  parties, a suspicious view, which, in my opinion, is a grave sin  on its part. The fact that ordinary people, so to speak, also  look at parties askance, is a consequence of the former.  Meanwhile, our intelligentsia, particularly our technical  intelligentsia, has enormous potential! Heads of gold and hands  of gold!.    That is why the political center proved to have absolutely  no  rganizational backing in the elections.    In addition, there exists a uniquely Ukrainian  interpretation  of the term "center." For some reason, when we say "center," we  mean some sort of outer edge [kray], as in the proverb: "my  house stands at the edge [of the village], I know nothing"  [i.e., I am neutral in this matter]. And so this center is  forming on this very principle. The center is perceived as that  political group that is expected to "quell" all the convulsions  coming from the flanks. In reality, the center is where optimal  decisions are made. This is a first-aid station, a  social-therapy station. It has a well-defined political  countenance!    In general, our society is like a rider at a crossroads torn  in three different directions trying to find a solution to its  problems. The first direction points to the national solution.  We are standing on the threshhold -- although we have not yet  crossed it -- of a situation in which our national orientators  could turn into a policy oriented towards Ukrainian ethnic  origins, a policy of restricting the human rights of those not  of Ukrainian descent. As yet, we have no Zhirinovsky-style  nationalism in our country, and thank God for that. The few  newly elected people's deputies to the Supreme Council who can  be described as extreme nationalists have so far not proclaimed  such a policy publicly, although we know that such sentiments  exist. Nevertheless, all our social, economic, and political  problems are viewed by certain political forces through the  prism of national concerns. For instance, it was enough for  Leonid Kuchma to enter into the political arena -- let me stress  that I do not wish to discuss Mr. Kuchma at this time and that I  am merely stating a fact -- it was enough for him to enter into  the political arena and announce that he did not want to  exacerbate Ukraine's relations with Russia for the  national-democratic forces to write him off. They have even  proclaimed his Interregional Reform Bloc [MBR] to be the number  one enemy. This kind of unhealthy reaction is a sign of  political obtuseness and one-sidedness. In fact, the public mood  is the same in eastern and western Ukraine; the only difference  is that these moods form in different ways.    The second direction consists of solving socioeconomic  problems. In other words, the sausage direction. I do not use  this as a derisive expression --there is nothing comical about  people wanting sausage, which even academicians cannot always  afford these days. Obviously, many of the ontradictions in our  society come to a head on this "sausage" level. But even in this  sphere things are not as simple as they may appear. For example  -- a journalist friend of mine told me this story -- there is a  businessman in Kharkiv who every day fed a hundred impoverished  old people at a restaurant. He ran as a candidate to the Supreme  Council. Following the first round of the elections, the  businessman asked the people he had been taking care of: who did  you vote for? "What do you mean, who?" -- they asked. "For the  communists, of course!" In other words, they depended on him to  feed them, but voted for the communists. It probably all boils  down to the genetic changes in the psychological makeup of  people that have occurred over the last seven decades.    But there is no return to this life. I do not believe that  Ukraine is in danger of losing her independence, but Russia's  imperialistic policy will remain imperialistic. Unfortunately,  it will also continue to be chauvinistic, inasmuch as both  Russia's centrists and liberals are unable to resist the  pressure of Russian nationalists, particularly in their attitude  towards Ukraine.    The third course is a political one. I have in mind  democratic changes. There are countless problems, including some  that we forget about for some reason. Who will own the land? Who  will control resources? Municipalities? Councils? Which  councils? Everything will depend on how these issues are  settled. And what about our so-called public and social life --  the helplessness of our political parties, the inanition of our  press?..    Our society today is reminiscent of what Mussolini dreamed  of  once --corporativism. It is broken up into corporations. The  miner does not strike against those who exploit him, but --  together with the mine director -- against another sector. There  is solidarity where no solidarity should exist. There is no  labor movement. That is why every political endeavor comes to  nothing, like rings in the water: many rocks on the bottom, yet  the surface of the water remains smooth...    [Oliynyk] In your view, is polarization, the clash of  opposing views, the greatest danger threatening our parliament?    [Popovych] I do not think that this poses a danger. All  these  things will sort themselves out, and a process of regrouping  will occur... To the best of my knowledge, at least two-thirds  of the newly elected deputies from the Communist Party are  workers rather than hardened politicos. Albeit with a definite  political orientation. I do not excuse their views -- it is  disgraceful that after decades of years of the filth in which we  lived, there are still people who stake their hopes on this form  of existence. But what can we do? Nonetheless, I am convinced  that these people are different, and when they sit down in the  sessions hall and face the need to solve the burning issues of  the day, they will think quite differently.    What is absolutely unproductive is recalling what this or  that politician did during the era of Soviet power. As far as I  know, there are some problems in this respect even among the  Ukrainian Self-Defense Forces [UNSO]. The past is not what we  should be thinking about; we all share the same past. Except for  those who hurled themselves headlong against the wall and were  fortunate enough to survive. But there are not many such people.    Strictly speaking, we all have a general idea of what needs  to be done. We need to divide our enterprises into three  categories: those that the state has to support no matter what,  those that must be allowed to make their own way, and those that  have to be closed down. If, as they say, the Black Sea Fleet  consumes as much as all of our science and scholarship, we have  to decide what is more important to us. I believe that culture  and science must come first, otherwise our state is threatened  by paralysis of its central nervous system. We must conduct  conversion. [We must] set optimum tax rates rather than trying  to squeeze out as much as we can by grabbing people by the  throat. The problem is not what to do, but how to do it in such  a way as to ensure that we move a step ahead every day and to  ensure that every step increases effective demand. Only then  will we see reforms happen. There is no place to retreat --  behind us lies Moscow, and the pressure it exerts is palpable.    [Oliynyk] Myroslav Volodymyrovych, do you agree with the  currently very fashionable claim that alleges that the office of  the presidency is alien to the Ukrainian mentality?    [Popovych] I take a very ironic approach to all this talk of  a Ukrainian mentality. What does it mean? Where did we unearth  this notion? No doubt about it, this is a very convenient way of  explaining and justifying just about anything -- you see, it's  not part of our mentality.    Whereas the characteristic features of the Ukrainian state  are that this is a country in which one-third of the population  lives in villages and two-thirds live in cities. Half of those  living in cities are first or second-generation urban dwellers.  Most of these people work in highly advanced technical sectors;  they are the elite of the world's technical civilization. his is  precisely the culture -- that of a military-technical colossus  -- that the Bolsheviks created and did so deliberately. But the  humanitarian core of all this is very weak. We have huge muscles  and a very small brain. That, if you will, is our mentality. But  to say that the office of the presidency is an impediment --  forgive me, but... However, the institution of presidential  representatives has some negative features. Without even giving  the local councils a chance to begin feeling accountable to the  people, the state administration began to meddle in local  affairs. Now, when the buses run badly, the people berate  Kravchuk. Such a system is fine for a country with established  bureaucratic traditions -- a country like France, for example.    owever, on the whole, we need the presidency and firm  authority. Obviously, the powers of the president have to be  clearly defined. In the United States, for example, the states  and cities have a high degree of independence, and therefore the  American president can have full powers. Here, the situation is  different.    [Oliynyk] And what do you think about the presidential  election in June?    [Popovych] The choice will not be easy. There is no ideal  candidate. In general, the decision to hold early elections to  the Supreme Council and of the president, which the former  parliament passed under pressure from the miners' strikes, was  illegitimate and capitulatory. This was the wrong thing to do.  But inasmuch as this decision was made, and parliament has been  elected, we must finish resolving these issues. We gain nothing  by putting off settling this matter until the fall. Having said  "a," we have to say "b." My only hope is that whoever is elected  president will have to move forward with reforms.</p>

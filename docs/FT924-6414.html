			<p>921121 FT  21 NOV 92 / Contracting-out attack rejected FOR the second time in two days, the government yesterday denied that its Pounds 1.5bn programme of contracting out government services was in disarray over new EC regulations protecting pay and conditions of workers when they transfer to the private sector. A document sent to government departments by Mr Don Brereton, head of the cabinet office efficiency unit, said it was 'nonsense to suggest that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office or any other department has had to suspend its programme of contracting out'. SLATER MARTIN, an accountancy firm based in Northampton, has been fined Pounds 250 by the disciplinary committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales for handling investment business client's money when not authorised to do so.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRAND BOULEVARD REVIVAL RAISING GLENDALE SKYLINE  </P> <P> The long-awaited revival of Glendale's Brand Boulevard is under way, but the  ground-hugging street of the past is being transformed into a high-rise  corridor.  </P> <P> Construction has started on what will be the city's tallest building, as well  as a mid-rise office/retail/entertainment complex near the massive Glendale  Galleria. The long-vacant 4-acre site north of the Galleria will be home to a  twin-tower complex being developed by a unit of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Just about the only remnant of Brand's previous life as the city's major  north-south retail street will be its distinctive diagonal parking.  </P> <P> This spurt of construction activity should reinforce Glendale's position as the  third-ranking financial center in California, behind Los Angeles and San  Francisco, according to William R. Boyd of the Glendale office of Coldwell  Banker Commercial Real Estate Services.  </P> <P> "Financial service companies, including thrifts and insurance companies, occupy  about 40% of the 3.14 million square feet of office space in Glendale," Boyd  said. "An additional 40% is taken by service businesses, including law firms  and accountants."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vacant Lot Question  </P> <P> Last week's approval of Glendale City Center by the Glendale Redevelopment  Agency answers those who had wondered: "What's going to be built in that vacant  lot north of the Glendale Galleria?"  </P> <P> The more than $150-million, 790,000-square-foot office/retail project will be  constructed, beginning in September, in the block bounded by Brand Boulevard on  the east, Broadway on the south, Orange Street on the west and Wilson Avenue on  the north.  </P> <P> A project of Homart Development Co., a subsidiary of Sears, Glendale City  Center will feature twin office towers separated by an elaborate landscaped  courtyard, according to Gino Rossetti, president of Rossetti Associates, Santa  Monica, the architects.  </P> <P> An 18-story tower will be built in the first phase atop a parking/retail  structure, followed by a 22-story tower north of it in the second phase,  Rossetti said. The leasing agent for Glendale City Center is the Glendale  office of Coldwell Banker.  </P> <P> Across the street from Glendale City Center, construction has started on Brand  Passage, the first of two elements of The Exchange, a $50-million mixed-use.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 22-Story Building  </P> <P> The Exchange, designed by the Feola/Deenihan Partnership AIA, Glendale,  occupies two blocks bounded by Brand Boulevard, Wilson Avenue, Louise Street  and Broadway.  </P> <P> About three blocks north of The Exchange, construction is under way with a May,  1990, completion on 500 N. Brand, a 22-story, 423,000-square-foot office tower  by a joint venture of the Glendale-based Howard-Platz Group, Glendale  Properties and General Electric Investment Corp.  </P> <P> The $110-million 500 N. Brand is reportedly the largest 100% speculative office  building under construction in the Southland, according to Richard Dunn of the  Charles Dunn Co., the leasing agent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 20% Vacancy Level  </P> <P> "In an office market running at a 20% vacancy level, Glendale is now  approaching the single-digit range," Dunn added.  </P> <P> Designed by Ellerbe Beckett, Santa Monica, the 332-foot-high granite-clad tower  at Brand Boulevard and Milford Street will be Glendale's tallest building.  </P> <P> The building will have 18,500 square feet of retail space in a two-story  pavilion. There will be three levels of below-grade parking, along with five  levels above ground.  </P> <P> Scheduled for completion in December, Brand Passage by the Howard-Platz Group  is a four-story building at 130 N. Brand Blvd. with about 15,000 square feet of  retail space, 40,000 square feet of offices and an 8,500-square-foot multilevel  courtyard. The mixed-use development will extend street to street from Brand  east to Maryland Avenue. The leasing agent is Dorn Platz &amp; Co., Glendale.  The contractor is Rowland Constructors, Phoenix, with tenant improvements by  Howard Building Corp.  </P> <P> Construction is scheduled to begin in mid-May on the second increment of The  Exchange, an eight-screen Mann Theater complex by Brand Development Co. at 130  N. Maryland Ave. The three-level complex will be highlighted -- literally -- by  a 22-foot diameter antique, lighted glass dome that will be visible from many  locations in downtown Glendale.  </P> <P> Each of the eight auditoriums will have a Lucas THX sound system, and several  will be have 70-mm. projection systems. The complex is scheduled for a  first-quarter 1990 opening.  </P> <P> The Glendale Redevelopment Agency is building a 742-space parking structure --  scheduled for completion in June -- adjacent to The Exchange, according to a  spokeswoman for the agency. Feola/Deenihan is the architect for the structure.  </P></p>

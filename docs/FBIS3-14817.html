			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb -- Assessing the degree of risk from  the release of the Lefortovo prisoners, presidential aide  Georgiy Satarov noted at today's Kremlin briefing that there are  two ways to ensure that destabilizing developments are averted.  First, according to Satarov, "the president of Russia is  inclined to minimize the potential harm inflicted by the  political amnesty decision." With this aim in mind Boris  Yeltsin will, in the near future, possibly today, address the  citizens of the country in defense of human rights and with an  assessment of the act of political amnesty.    Second, Georgiy Satarov remarked, State Duma chairman Ivan  Rybkin and the deputies have recognized that they have "become  the hostages of their own decision and of the future behavior of  those whom they have set free." Therefore, the president's aide  thinks, "whether from considerations of self-preservation or  arising out of a wish for accord and reconciliation" the  deputies will try not to allow a new round of extremism in  society.    Another participant in the briefing -- Aleksandr Yakovlev,  the president's plenipotentiary representative in the Federal  Assembly -- voiced a warning in connection with the fact that 1  May 1994 might repeat the "fresh and painful experience of last  year's May Day." The lawyer reminded his listeners that the law  does not provide for a second act of amnesty in relation to one  and the same group of persons.    Unlike his colleagues in the presidential administration,  Yuriy Baturin, the president's national security aide, sees from  his viewpoint the greatest danger for society as being in the  split among the democrats. He pointed out that there is now a  strategy for uniting democratic forces, laid down in the  president's message.    Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent on how  Boris Yeltsin reacted to the two aides' efforts to suspend the  political amnesty, Georgiy Satarov answered: "We have not been  asked to resign. His reaction was a balanced one."    Although the members of the the presidential apparatus  intended to devote the briefing to the president's message,  journalists changed the theme of the meeting with questions  like: "How was it that the situation with the political amnesty  caught you unawares?"    In their answers Aleksandr Yakovlev, Georgiy Satarov, and  Yuriy Baturin repeated their already well-known arguments on the  imperfect nature of the legislation, the dual position of the  procuracy, and the need to observe the law.</p>

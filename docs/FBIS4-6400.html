			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Japan should alter its  tactics in stalled trade talks with the United States to  persuade Washington it is serious about rectifying the bilateral  trade gap, a chief Japanese trade envoy said Wednesday.    Nobuo Matsunaga, the Japanese Government's representative  for  external economic affairs, said in a speech in Tokyo that Japan  should avoid reaching agreement under the threat of trade  sanctions, as in the case of a mobile phone trade agreement last  month.    Matsunaga, a former Japanese ambassador to the U.S., met  U.S.  Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Washington earlier this  month in an effort to break an impasse in the so-called  bilateral framework talks.    Matsunaga said Kantor told him there will be no chance of  improving bilateral economic relations unless Japan takes  measures, such as tax cuts, to maintain economic growth led by  domestic demand.    Matsunaga said a new Japanese Government has to hammer out  tax and other pump-priming measures by June before the summit of  the Group of Seven industrial nations in July in Naples, where  the new Japanese prime minister will meet U.S. President Bill  Clinton. But Matsunaga expressed concern that things will not  go smoothly because the new government would first be required  to deal with the overdue fiscal 1994 budget.    The new Tokyo government is expected to be inaugurated as  early as Thursday following Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  announcement April 8 that he would step down over shady  financial deals involving his office.</p>

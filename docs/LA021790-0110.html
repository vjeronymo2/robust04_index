			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WORLDWIDE;  </P> <P> '89 TERRORISM DOWN OVERALL, REPORT SAYS  </P> <P> Incidents of international terrorism declined about 25% in 1989, in part  because of a decrease in Palestinian activity, but attacks by Iranian-sponsored  Shiite groups rose, a U.S. official said. "Iran believes terrorism is a  legitimate part of foreign policy," the unidentified official said. Preliminary  figures compiled by the State Department for its annual report on terrorism to  be issued next month also show a decline of about 27% in the number of  fatalities from terrorist acts -- from 600 to 485.  </P></p>

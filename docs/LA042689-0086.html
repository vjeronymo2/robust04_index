			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Arson destroyed a truck parked in front of the Orange County offices of the  Vietnamese-language Nguoi Viet Daily News, Westminster Fire Marshal Glen Hines  said. A threat, written on a wall in Vietnamese, said, "Nguoi Viet, if you are  VC (Viet Cong). We kill." Hines said the newspaper's publisher, Do Ngoc Yen,  attributed the incident to a news segment mistakenly broadcast Saturday by the  TV studio that shares the editorial offices. The program, "Truyen Hinh  Vietnam," apparently offended some ardently anti-Communist members of the  Vietnamese community when it showed the Communist flag of Vietnam and Ho Chi  Minh's mausoleum in Hanoi as a visual background for a Vietnamese entertainer's  song. The publisher, who co-owns the studio, said he will publish an apology to  the Vietnamese community today.  </P></p>

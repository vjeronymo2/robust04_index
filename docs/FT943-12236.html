The agreement reflects the strategy of both companies of seeking partnerships in specific product lines and technologies to reduce the cost of vehicle development. Under the terms of the accord, Renault and Iveco will jointly develop cabs and cab components, with an expected annual production volume of 120,000 units. Renault will receive part of Iveco's stamped welded output in return for technology from the French group. According to a joint statement, the cabs will be fitted on future Iveco Daily vehicles and on a new Renault light commercial vehicle range. The different cabs will be assembled in Iveco's Italian plants in Brescia and Suzzara, and at its Valladolid plant in Spain, while Renault will assemble the cabs at its Batilly site in France. The co-operation in cabs follows existing agreements between Renault and Iveco in vehicle components.</p>

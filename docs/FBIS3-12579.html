Referring to  Indian claims on Kashmir, the spokesman said that such  unilateral claims by India is tantamount to depriving Kashmiris  of their inalienable right to self-determination. The spokesman  called upon the Indian Government to settle this very important  issue by ending the oppressive activities being carried out by  its security forces in occupied Kashmir.</p>

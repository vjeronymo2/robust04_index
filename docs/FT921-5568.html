			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Takeover talks at Dalepak DALEPAK FOODS said yesterday that it was in preliminary discussions to sell part, or all, of the company. The announcement was prompted by a 71p increase to 433p in the company's share price. Stockbrokers de Zoete &amp; Bevan have approached a number of possible buyers following the decision by Mr Jonathan Ropner, Dalepak chairman, to sell his 20 per cent shareholding. .The five other executive directors own just under 30 per cent of the group. The sale is likely to make multi-millionaires out of the directors as the group is valued at about Pounds 50m. Although de Zoete &amp; Bevan stressed that the talks were at a 'very, very preliminary stage', the group is expected to be sold to one buyer. Dalepak made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.02m for the year to end-April and analysts are forecasting continued profits growth over the next two years.</p>

The main part of  Mechyslaw Hryb's speech was devoted to his opinions on  constitutional reform. The Supreme Soviet chairman noted that  152 articles of the Constitution have already been adopted, and  now, the parliament has to adopt the Constitution as a whole, as  well as legislation on implementing it. In the opinion of the  speaker, draft legislation on presidential elections and  amendments to the law on Supreme Soviet elections should be  examined after the Constitution is adopted.    "If the Constitution is passed, we can hold presidential  elections on 26 June," Mechyslaw Hryb said. He also assured  that "there will be many candidates," but did not reveal any  specific names.    In the speaker's opinion, other ways of reforming the  authorities are inadmissible, since the Republic could end up  without any leadership. Mechyslaw Hryb also stated that he  opposes the idea of dismissing the current government and  establishing a coalition government of people's accord. In his  opinion, "the government should protect the interests of  grass-roots society." Mechyslaw Hryb admitted that the  Communist Party is the largest party in the Republic.    The Supreme Soviet chairman pointed out that the current  economic crisis can be overcome by signing an agreement with  Russia on economic union and ruble zone. According to him, this  will allow for an equalization of prices for energy resources in  Belarus and Russia, which will make it possible for Belarusian  producers to compete with Russia on a parity basis. Mechyslaw  Hryb argued that it would be better if Russia did not lower  prices for energy sources for Belarus to the internal Russian  level, but on the contrary, raised prices for its consumers,  since one day it will be necessary to adjust those prices to the  world level anyway.    According to Mechyslaw Hryb, Belarusian industrialists are  tired of the uncertainty over the unification of monetary  systems. The speaker had met with directors of Minsk factories  on the eve of his visit to Zhlobin, and they demanded that the  final decision on the unification be made by the end of March.    Mechyslaw Hryb said that Russian experts have put forward  new  conditions for unifying the Belarusian and Russian monetary  systems: To establish a common budget, to close the National  Bank of Belarus, and to open a branch of the Central Bank of  Russia in Minsk. In the speaker's opinion, these proposals  "question the sovereignty of our people and our country."    The Supreme Soviet chairman suggested that if Russia refuses  to establish the ruble zone, new ways will have to be found. In  the opinion of Mechyslaw Hryb, the economic union could be  established gradually. Abolishment of customs barriers could  become the first step in this direction.    The speaker indicated that the economic situation is being  complicated by the fact that profitable enterprises are actually  financing loss-making factories. As Mechyslaw Hryb believes, it  would be better to close those factories, and pay people until  they find another job.    Responding to questions from workers', Mechyslaw Hryb said  that it is possible to use the Interior Ministry Troops for  patrolling streets to protect people against crime.    One of the workers asked the speaker about his opinion on  the  statement made by [former Supreme Soviet Chairman] Stanislaw  Shushkevich in an interview with the Mir television company, in  which the latter had claimed that the government is leading the  Republic toward a dead end, and that the ruble zone will give us  nothing. "If the ruble union is not concluded, strikes will  wipe out the Kebich government," the worker said. Hryb replied  that nobody had prevented Shushkevich from coming forward with  proposals when the latter had been in power, but he, however,  had supported the ruble zone at that time.    In general, the itinerary of Mechyslaw Hryb's working visit  was the same as the same trip made last year by Stanislaw  Shushkevich. After the Zhlobin metallurgical plant, the speaker  visited the Klimavichy rayon center in Mahilyow Oblast. There,  he inspected a cement plant, polyclinic, kindergarten, dairy,  and the Muravelle settlement, where he met and spoke with people  resettled from Chernobyl. The Supreme Soviet chairman was  accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Stanislaw Bryl and the  leadership of Homel and Mahilyow Oblasts.</p>

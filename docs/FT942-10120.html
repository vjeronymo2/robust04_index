			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / People: Salaried Leith 'I find to my surprise that I like being an employee,' says Prue Leith, the restaurateur and cookery writer who once took it upon herself to uncurl the British Rail sandwich. Last summer she sold her empire, with an annual turnover of Pounds 17m, to Eurest International, part of the French Accor group and the biggest contract caterer in Europe. This week her husband Rayne Kruger conducted his last board meeting as chairman of Leith's, retiring at the age of 72. He has been her business partner and chairman for 30 years. Kruger, 15 years older than his wife, will be retreating to his study to pursue his passionate interest in ancient Chinese history. Leith will be combining the role of managing director and chairman from next month. She claims that since selling the business, which she started from an Earls Court bedsit in 1962, she has been devoting more time to it. She is looking forward to Eurest's plans to expand the company by moving further into the tough contract catering market, where it will be competing with Compass and Gardner Merchant. However, closer involvement with Leith's over the past year has not precluded her other activities - she is on the boards of Argyll Group and Leeds Permanent Building Society, is chairman of the Restaurateurs' Association of Great Britain and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.</p>

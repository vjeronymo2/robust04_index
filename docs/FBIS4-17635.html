			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- The Federation Council has  assigned its chairman Vladimir Shumeyko to sign the treaty on  civic concord. The council discussed today the draft treaty,  submitted by the president.    Deputies to the Federation Council agreed, in general, with  the decision of the Federation Council Committee for  Constitutional Legislation about the topicality of raising the  problem of establishing civic concord. In the opinion of the  committee, the treaty is a "political document, which will not  be a substitute to the Constitution." The obligations of the  upper chamber of parliament, recorded in the treaty, "do not go  beyond its constitutional prerogatives." The committee decided  that the Federation Council may take part in the signing of the  document. Chairman of the Committee Isa Kostoyev called  attention to the fact that "the concluding of the political  agreement is the result of the initiative of the president's  side, which means that it no longer claims the monopoly on state  power."</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Attwoods in Israeli joint venture Attwoods, the waste management group, yesterday announced a joint venture with Koor Industries, Israel's largest company, to tap the estimated Dollars 250m (Pounds 168m) market which is expected to result from that country's privatisation programme. The group also announced a 42 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the first three months. However, the return had been depressed by currency gains of Pounds 175,000 against Pounds 4.48m in the first quarter of last year. Sales rose 19 per cent to Pounds 92m. Mr Ken Foreman, chairman, said he was resigned to prospects for the first six months, expecting Attwoods to return a flat performance. Europe had proved particularly difficult, although Mr Foreman said he thought the decline had 'bottomed out'. Trading had been strongest in the UK and US, where sales improved by 15 and 3 per cent respectively. Profits were hit in the US, however, by competition in higher margin businesses.</p>

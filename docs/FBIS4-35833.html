			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Arabic Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, </F> head of the judiciary, on 3 June; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  Muslim brothers and sisters all over the world, a quick glance  at the situation of the Islamic countries, the governments  dominating them, international relations, and the big powers'  treatment of the Muslims, particularly the Third World  countries, raises a question. The question is: Has this  situation been caused by Islam and the divine system and  teachings or because of Muslims' conduct, most of which is not  acceptable to Islam?    The propaganda of Islam's enemies openly attributes this to  Islam and says that Islam is the cause of the backwardness and  degradation at intellectual, cultural, and industrial levels of  these countries that have been controlled by foreigners. But  examining the Islamic intellectual resources and practical  conduct of the noble Prophet and the infallible imams,  salutations be upon them, clearly indicates that this is  propaganda from the arrogant powers' agents who have infiltrated  and affected the Muslims' thinking. It has even infiltrated and  affected leaders and clergymen who believed that Islam, like  Christianity, has no effect on worldly affairs, politics, and  social life and that Muslims should turn to worship and not  interfere with political and social issues.    This is what has created a favorable atmosphere for the  foreigners' hegemony. Islam is the religion of both this world  and the world hereafter, the religion of politics and  administration, the religion of independence and freedom far  from the foreigners' domination. Turning the reigns of power  over to infidels, polytheists, and foreigners is a great sin.  We believe that Muslims should know Islam well and realize its  truth. Had the Muslim countries realized the true Islam, Islam  would have dominated the government and (?judiciary) and rulers  would have been compelled to keep in line with Islam and Muslims  or relinquish power. Clashes being seen between governments and  peoples in some Islamic countries form a picture of this  phenomenon. Had this been the case, Muslims would have realized  that the rulers' behavior in these countries was not Islamic and  would have naturally demanded that Islamic laws be respected.    The religion is one of politics, prudence, progress,  independence, and freedom, not a religion of shackles,  servility, and surrender to foreigners' hegemony.    Muslim brothers and sisters, this issue has proved that  Islam  passed the test of viability in the days of early Islam. Today  our country has managed to rid itself of the foreigners'  domination and establish an Islamic government amid Islam's laws  under the leadership of the founder of the Islamic Republic in  Iran, the late Imam Khomeyni.    Such a success cannot be achieved without the awareness of  the public. We should explain the spirit of Islam more than  before to restore to Islam its former strength in the hope that  Islam and Muslims will achieve their desired strength and  greatness so that Islamic rule will dominate the Muslims, God  willing. I ask God's forgiveness for you and myself.</p>

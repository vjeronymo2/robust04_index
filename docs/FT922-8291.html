			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Industry assails 'flaws' in treaty THE SOCIAL chapter of the European Community's Maastricht treaty is badly flawed, according to Unice, the European industrial and employers' confederation. Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, the organisation's secretary general, told an FT conference on the impact of EC law and policy that allowing Britain to opt out of the social chapter had set a precedent which could lead to abandonment of the 'one Community' principle . However, what concerns Unice more is the extension of qualified majority voting to issues involving working conditions, and information and consultation processes. Six member states acting together would be enough to push a measure through, given the weighted voting system. 'You will have six states determining social policy for 18 countries of Europe - a long way from the requirement for greater democracy,' said Mr Tyszkiewicz. The problem was made worse because some EC governments were unable to stand firm, even against their better judgment, in the social field. Unice cited the working time directive, which it said many governments had described as expensive and hindering flexible use of working time. The organisation expressed its pleasure with some aspects of the new social chapter, such as the statutory obligation for the Commission to consult the social partners (employers and unions) on social policy measures, but Mr Tyszkiewicz warned the Commission against attempting to legislate where it was not satisfied with an agreement negotiated by the social partners. 'We cannot do the job with the Commission breathing down our necks. That must be made plain,' he said. Dr Claus-Dieter Ehlermann, director general for competition at the Commission, told the conference that 'a reinforced competition policy' was needed to underpin the creation of the internal market, but there would be greater emphasis on curbing state aid and on deregulation. In the telecommunications field, a review of the voice monopoly would be undertaken this year. 'The Commission cannot ignore the fact that (telephone) calls between member states are two to three times more expensive than the equivalent distance calls inside member states. This constitutes a surcharge on trade and a block to the internal market process,' he said.</p>

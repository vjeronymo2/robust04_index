			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bisharah Shirbil: "Libyan Salvation Front </F> Dissidents Announce New Organization"]    [Text] London -- Those who have split from the National  Front for the Salvation of Libya announced yesterday a new  organization called the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform  [al-harakah al-libiyah littaghyyir al-islah]. Abrik al-Suwaysi  was chosen as official spokesman for the organization's  constituent committee.    The committee included in its founding statement its overall  intellectual and political view of the situation in Libya and  possibilities for change. It stressed that it will continue its  contacts to convene the constituent conference to form  organizational institutions. It also pointed out that its  mission ends with the convening of the constituent assembly and  that its framework is open to all Libyans who agree with the  principles it announced.    Al-Suwaysi told AL-HAYAH that "the announcement of the  statement from Geneva has no political significance. We had  hoped to announce the organization from a neighboring state, but  current circumstances did not permit." He expressed his hope  that the constituent conference will be held within four or five  months. "The constituent committee is preparing for it and has  not set a particular date for it, because we are still at the  beginning."    He said that "the Libyan National Army, which is led by  Staff  Colonel Khalifah Haftar, is an integral part of the  organization, as it consists of our comrades who decided to  separate from the Salvation Front for the same reasons that  prompted us to break away. Col. Haftar is a founding member of  the political organization and has both the political and  military capacity. However, the Army will not be confined to  those who join the organization, but will be open to all Libyans  wishing to make sacrifices. We do not make it a condition that  membership of the organization be confined to those who want to  participate in its military program."</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> J. P. MORGAN PROFIT DROPS 36%; HIGHER INTEREST RATES BLAMED  </P> <P> J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. became the first big U.S. money center bank to announce  first-quarter earnings Wednesday when it reported a 36% drop in profit due to  rising interest rates.  </P> <P> It said earnings in the first quarter fell to $180 million from $281 million in  the year-earlier quarter, which contained a $43-million tax refund.  </P> <P> "Interest rates have risen significantly over the past 12 months, and recently  the yield curves in the United States and other markets have either flattened  or inverted, limiting the opportunities for profitable repositioning of  interest rate exposures," the company said. J. P. Morgan said these  circumstances were also unfavorable for trading and other income-earning  opportunities.  </P> <P> J. P. Morgan, which owns Morgan Guaranty Bank, also expects to receive  permission to underwrite and deal in corporate debt soon, President Dennis  Weatherstone told shareholders at the annual meeting.  </P> <P> "We shortly expect to have final authority to underwrite and deal in corporate  debt in this country," he said.  </P> <P> Commercial banks have been excluded from participating in securities  underwriting activities in the United States since the 1930s. However the  Federal Reserve Board this year allowed commercial banks to underwrite and deal  in commercial paper, municipal revenue bonds and mortgage-backed securities.  </P></p>

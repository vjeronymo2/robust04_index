			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Arts: The Brahms Experience - Weekend music in London QUEEN ELIZABETH HALL Sponsored by National Westminster Bank The choice of Brahms as the focus for this latest of Roger Norrington's 'Experience' weekends worked out surprisingly well. The composer himself was well aware of his own musical sources, and so there was plenty of background material on which the intellect could feed, while the aural experience of hearing his music on period instruments is still new enough to seem a novelty. The two-day programme followed the customary pattern. Under Norrington's watchful eye a mixture of lectures and short recitals alternated, culminating on Sunday night in a performance of Brahms's German Requiem; the atmosphere was pleasantly relaxed rather than didactic. All the musical events were given on instruments of Brahms's own time. Some work has of course already been done in this area, notably by Roger Norrington himself, who has made a start on the symphonies; but there is still much to learn, notably when it comes to hearing the chamber music in a new light. The first afternoon brought contrasting successes and failures in this respect. The short programme of songs by Olaf Bar and John Toll brought a pleasingly light touch to what can all too easily seem lugubrious music, Bar's graceful and somewhat carefully produced baritone being well complemented by the clear tones of the fortepiano. But the reverse side of period instruments then showed itself, when the following chamber recital for strings brought an uncomfortable display of scratchy tone and poor intonation. That, presumably, is all part of the 'experience'. Most interesting of all was the Saturday evening programme, in which a potted history of Brahms's interest in earlier choral music was linked to the forthcoming performance of his Requiem. That the composer was an admirer of Schutz and Bach is well known. To hear a Benedictus by Gabrieli, however, performed according to the expressive markings with which Brahms annotated his own score, is another matter entirely and one pregnant with possibilities for the future. It was the Schutz Choir of London which had worked with Norrington to perfect all the smallest dynamic shadings and emphases there, and the same singers, though increased in number, who joined the London Classical Players for the main evening concert on Sunday. Lynne Dawson was the bright soprano and Bar returned as a most expressive baritone to complete the forces for the German Requiem. As befits a week-end course of this kind, it was a performance in which all the strands of scholarship were brought together. For this was music-making of considerable intensity and learning, every phrase thought about and consciously shaped in much the way that the Gabrieli under Brahms's own instructions had been the evening before. The recording that will ensue should repay long study: the tangible product from an enterprise of which one hopes we have not heard the last.</p>

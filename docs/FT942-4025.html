			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Dividend is missing I hold 337 Type 1 shares and 67 Type 2 shares in CESC Ltd, Calcutta, India, on which a dividend of 20 per cent was declared on September 21 1992. Despite numerous air mail letters, I have received nothing in respect of this dividend. It appears that I am unable to sell these shares through a bank or building society as they do not deal in Indian securities. Since I am precluded from the receipt of dividends or the sale of the security, will the Inland Revenue accept this as a capital loss for capital gains tax purposes? You should write to your local inspector of taxes at the Inland Revenue to ask if your holding in CESC is available as a capital loss to offset your gains elsewhere.

All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

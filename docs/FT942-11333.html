			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Treasury takes risks to back dollar: US will be heavily exposed if this week's intervention proves insufficient This week's massive concerted intervention by central banks around the world to stop the fall of the US dollar has pushed the US Treasury a long way out on a somewhat fragile limb. In an effort to break the financial markets' perception that the US, to increase its leverage in trade negotiations with Japan, is actively pushing or passively permitting the dollar's slide against the yen, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, said the Clinton administration saw 'no advantage in an undervalued currency'. 'Recent movements in exchange markets have gone beyond what is justified by economic fundamentals,' Mr Bentsen said. But that bold statement leaves the US heavily exposed if Wednesday's central bank purchases of dollars turn out to be insufficient to turn the foreign exchange markets. Currency intervention has worked on many occasions in the past, especially when, as now, it is intended not so much to defend a particular currency level as to send a more general message to the markets about policy. It has failed just as often, however, particularly when governments tried to fly in the teeth of economic reality. 'The key criterion is whether intervention is moving in the same direction as the underlying fundamentals would suggest, or is trying to buck them,' said Mr Fred Bergsten, a senior Treasury official in the Carter administration, who now heads the Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank. An examination of the US economy, which continues to grow steadily and much faster than either Japan or continental Europe, lends considerable weight to the administration's analysis of fundamentals. In addition, the general direction of US interest rates is widely perceived to be upwards, as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten monetary policy to choke off any signs of inflation that may emerge with the recovery. Although Japanese interest rates are not thought to have any more room to move downwards, continental Europe is still expected to see further cuts in interest rates. The relative trends of interest rates should, therefore, make the dollar more attractive to investors. But currency markets' expectations are built not just on the relative strengths of different economies, but on changes in those relative strengths. Forecasts of US growth are now lower than they were at the beginning of the year, while the German economy, though still much weaker than the US, is now thought to be a little stronger than it was. That, in turn, could mean that the Fed will not raise its interest rates as much, and the Bundesbank not lower its rates as much, as markets previously expected. In either event, the Clinton administration is virtually powerless to do much about this. It does not want to stimulate an economy which it views as growing quite satisfactorily, without overheating; and it certainly does not want the Fed to raise rates further to defend the currency. The question is whether the US is equally impotent to dispel the markets' expectations of a further dollar depreciation against the yen. Senior Treasury officials believe their actions and statements should now have dispelled the markets' perception that the US was pursuing a policy of depreciating the dollar, whether actively or through benign neglect. Mr Bergsten argues, however, that the benign neglect is not American but Japanese. He says the only way to redress Japan's large and growing current account surplus not just with the US but with the rest of the world is through stimulating the domestic economy, lowering barriers to its markets or a further appreciation of the yen. The US has been urging the first two policies for some time, in vain. Its chances of success have not been improved by the recent change in the Japanese government.</p>

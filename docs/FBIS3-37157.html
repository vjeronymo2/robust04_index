			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Bykovskiy "Observer's Comments": "A Propos the </F> Cold"]    [Text] When the current political elite began its ascent  of the Mount Olympus of Russian politics at the end of the  eighties it on the whole justly criticized many practices which  existed in the Soviet Union. Amongst the most often cited sins  in this regard was the absolute secrecy surrounding the personal  life of the country's top officials, their health...    Since then only six or seven years have passed. But how much  has changed! (Admittedly, we won't specify here in which  direction this has been). However, the changes have scarcely  really affected the aforementioned "delicate" question. People  may object to this by saying that only last week the Russian  president's administration reported that the president was  working in his out-of-town residence because he was suffering  from a cold.    All true: A report was issued and requisite explanation  furnished. But this can hardly be regarded as adequate or  exhaustive in a situation where the head of state is involved,  particularly as we Russians have been continually urged by top  officials in recent years to follow the example of "civilized"  countries. Let's look at how such questions are resolved over  there in the West and the United States, in particular.    The president's health, I read in an publicity handout  specially prepared for President Clinton's visit to Moscow, is a  significant indicator to Americans. When they vote in elections  for a particular candidate they want to see not just that the  future head of state's election manifesto meets their interests,  they also want to see, the authors of the publicity handout  specially stress this, a new White House incumbent who is  vigorous, active, and undoubtedly healthy.    It is not surprising when the U.S. president is ill that  journalists lay siege to the physicians who are treating him.  And they answer numerous questions. Experts on American life  claim that medical confidentiality does not exist in this  instance.    However, while citing the American example I have no doubt  at  all that in a matter of days Boris Yeltsin's health will be  restored and he will be delivering a message to the deputies of  the Federal Assembly. So there would seem to be no special need  to blow up the topic of the Russian president's suffering from a  cold, there wouldn't be but for a radio report: Speaking to  journalists, the American president complained that for some  unknown technical reasons he had been unable to speak to Boris  Yeltsin by telephone for two days.    The conversation between the presidents did, as you will  know, eventually take place. However, it was somewhat late, in  my opinion: After all, just a few days ago Bill Clinton was  still wondering whether it was worthwhile for NATO to bomb  Serbian positions near Sarajevo, while now it seems he is ready  to support the NATO decision.    And the question is a really crucial one. If NATO starts  bombing the Serbs, this will inevitably lead to heavy civilian  casualties. Many military specialists, including Russian ones,  have pointed out this danger. Moreover, there are serious fears  that the possible bombing could be the start of World War III...    Incidentally, the (U.S.) White House press secretary already  knows by 0800 hours the president's whole schedule for the next  24 hours and can comment on much that is of interest to  journalists.    And I have no doubt that if circumstances forced Clinton to  leave for his out-of-town residence at Camp David, his press  secretary would promptly and as fully as possible satisfy the  far-from-idle interest in this event on the part of the mass  media.    But what about in our country? In Russia we are beset by a  very grave socioeconomic crisis; the number of strikes is  growing; miners, gas, communications, agricultural workers and  representatives of other sectors are demanding that the  government settle its debts; conflicts are blazing in danagerous  proximity to our country -- and we have silence! No one in the  president's large administration takes the trouble to explain  whether these questions come within the president's purview or  whether they are being resolved.</p>

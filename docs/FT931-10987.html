			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Council wants pledge over rail franchise STRATHCLYDE regional council, which funds the railway network in the Greater Glasgow area, yesterday suspended new investment worth Pounds 52m in trains and tracks because of uncertainty about the network's future under the government's railway privatisation plans. Mr Malcolm Waugh, chairman of the council's transport committee, said it wanted firm commitments from the government that the Strathclyde passenger transport executive would be involved in the franchising of ScotRail, British Rail's Scottish operation, and that fares would remain subsidised. On Tuesday Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, announced that ScotRail would be one of the first British Rail areas to be managed autonomously as a prelude to being franchised to private operators after April 1994. Strathclyde passenger transport executive (PTE) makes decisions about rail services in its area and is the largest PTE in Britain. ScotRail operates the trains, and the regional council puts in an annual subsidy of Pounds 30m, investing Pounds 150m over the past 10 years. The committee's decision means that the award of a contract for 23 new diesel multiple units worth about Pounds 1m, due to be made in the next two months, will be delayed. Three railway manufacturers have tendered for the work. In addition, no contracts will be awarded for a Pounds 28m rail link joining the electric railway networks of north and south Glasgow, and work worth between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m on a new suburban line from central Glasgow to Milngavie will not go ahead. A Pounds 4.5m project to convert a freight line between Rutherglen and Coatbridge into a passenger line with six new stations is also to be frozen. All these projects are being partly financed with the use of European Community structural funds. Mr Waugh said he met Mr MacGregor and Mr Roger Freeman, the railways minister, last week, and they assured him that Strathclyde PTE would be consulted after the House of Commons statement. 'Consultation is very nice but I want an assurance that the benefits of our investment will go to the people of Strathclyde and not to the private sector,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonivert Claude, governor of the Central Bank of  Haiti, denied the allegation that General Raoul Cedras withdrew  $500,000. THE WASHINGTON POST had asserted that the head of the  Haitian Army, Gen. Cedras, had withdrawn $500,000 from whatever  strong currency remains in the Haitian central bank. Quoting  government officials and members of Haitian banking circles, the  newspaper explained that the reasons for this withdrawal were  not clear. Claude exclaims: This is impossible! The general does  not have an account at the Central Bank. Claude further pointed  out that the bank is concerned with the currency problem  affecting the Haitian financial system, and looks for a quick  solution to this problem.</p>

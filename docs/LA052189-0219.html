			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANDY LEWIS: GRASS-ROOTS HERITAGE;  </P> <P> NEW ORLEANS HAS MORE IN THE WAY OF DOWN-HOME CULTURE BUT ORANGE COUNTY IS  CATCHING UP. IN A COUPLE HUNDRED YEARS . . .  </P> <P> In many ways, Orange County couldn't be farther removed from New Orleans if it  was on Pluto. For instance, in New Orleans there are dozens of great blues,  jazz, rock and R&amp;B clubs within walking distance or a short ride from one  another. It quickly becomes apparent that no place worth going is more than a  $3 cab fare away.  </P> <P> Even without the bonanza of acts that trekked to the Crescent City specifically  for last week's 20th annual Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival (another thing Orange  County doesn't have), New Orleans sees more great pop music in an average  weekend than we get in a year.  </P> <P> But that's to be expected: New Orleans, the Fertile Crescent of American music,  has a couple of centuries' jump on us as a hotbed of activity, culturally  speaking.  </P> <P> Still, you can't help but be overwhelmed at the bounty. In a single night --  and a Sunday at that -- I was able to see R&amp;B great Irma Thomas in one  club, zip across town to see Charmaine Neville at Muddy Water's, walk down the  street to Jimmy's and catch Cyril Neville &amp; the Uptown All-Stars  alternating with brother Art Neville and his band. From there, we hopped back  to the 711 Club in the French Quarter to find old-time jazz crooner Al  Broussard at the piano, jauntily spinning out requests as daylight crept up  Bourbon Street.  </P> <P> Back here, the only thing you're likely to find hopping all night long on a  Sunday is the popcorn machine at 7-Eleven.  </P> <P> Still, what struck me this year when I went to New Orleans for the fest weren't  the glaringly apparent differences. For the first time, I started noticing some  similarities.  </P> <P> And not just the easy ones, like the omnipresence of corporate America a la  Wendy's, Burger King and Thom McAn.  </P> <P> One of the more pleasing parallels: I realized that the tough choices I faced  there ("Hmm, do I go see Dr. John or Ironin' Board Sam; John Hiatt or Katie  Webster; Richard Thompson or Queen Ida?") wouldn't necessarily end once I got  back home.  </P> <P> That's a "problem" that didn't exist even 5 years ago.  </P> <P> The planning calendar I carry has room for a dozen entries under each day, and  periodically I find myself running out of room. Just this weekend I can point  to no fewer than 36 events taking place right here in Orange County, and that  doesn't include a plethora of ongoing art exhibits.  </P> <P> The variety extends from some of the same musical folk I just saw in New  Orleans -- the Robert Cray Band at the Pacific Jazz Festival today at the  Pacific Amphitheatre -- to poetry readings, a performance of Benjamin Britten's  epic "War Requiem" at the Performing Arts Center and a performance-art  presentation at the Newport Harbor Art Museum.  </P> <P> Sure, that doesn't make us New Orleans. But at least we're heading in the right  direction.  </P> <P> At least one big difference remains, though.  </P> <P> Notice how upwardly mobile the vast majority of our cultural choices are? One  of the greatest things about New Orleans is that, as the birthplace of jazz and  all, it treats folk culture with the same respect as any of the so-called "high  arts." (Perhaps even more, if the financial difficulties plaguing the New  Orleans Symphony in recent years are any indication.)  </P> <P> That distinction hit home during a rare lull that occurred only because a  tornado knocked out one day of festival activities. That day, I hopped the  Canal Street ferry -- which must be the last free ride of its kind -- over to  Algiers on the opposite shore of the Mississippi River.  </P> <P> Despite its being a stone's throw (well, for Dave Winfield maybe) from the  hustle-bustle tourist haven of the New Orleans French Quarter and its nonstop  night life, potpourri of restaurants, tacky souvenir stands and peep shows,  Algiers is a world away.  </P> <P> In that respect, Algiers reminded me of Santa Ana, which also borders an area  (Costa Mesa) where cultural opportunities abound. Furthermore, both Algiers and  Santa Ana are cities with pockets of great beauty and some magnificent old  homes located just blocks from neighborhoods that are decaying.  </P> <P> Searching for a homey neighborhood joint where I might find a decent plate of  red beans and rice, I found instead countless "For Sale" or "For Rent" signs.  Suffering a dearth of eateries or thriving businesses, Algiers is home -- not  coincidentally -- to an equally large number of street-side liquor stores and  neighborhood churches, each offering its own brand of escape, comfort and  relief from the squalor.  </P> <P> On the half-hour, electronic bells of the Trinity Lutheran Church echoed Bach's  "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" through deserted streets, sounding like the Good  Humor Truck of Salvation.  </P> <P> It was precisely this sort of abject poverty that gave rise to some of the  greatest music we have: blues, jazz and gospel. And here, we well might find  parallels in the mariachi and conjunto music of Santa Ana's Latino community,  the bar-band blues of the struggling factory worker in Anaheim, the Southeast  Asian folk music of thousands of Vietnamese immigrants in Garden Grove and  Westminster.  </P> <P> Perhaps instead of working so hard to zone these sorts of neighborhoods out of  existence, we ought to look to them for the non-materialistic riches they can  offer. The presence of a "Salsa '89" festival today at the Orange County  Fairgrounds is a perfect example because it places Mexican music, dance, food  and other components of this community's cultural soul in a well-deserved  spotlight.  </P> <P> Let's see more of that red carpet, so often reserved for 19th-Century classical  European arts, extended to the grass-roots cultures of our own back yard, like  they do way down yonder in New Orleans.  </P> <P> How about a good, earthy all-night blues bar for starters?  </P></p>

I think my current visit to China was a meaningful  opportunity to upgrade the substantial cooperation between our  two countries a step further.    I very sincerely and extensively exchanged views on matters  of common interest between our two countries with the Chinese  leaders. In particular, President Jiang Zemin and I met again,  four months after we met in Seattle last November. He and I  talked in a very intimate atmosphere this time. I invited  President Jiang Zemin to visit the ROK soon [kakkaun siil nae],  and President Jiang willingly [kikkoi] accepted my invitation.    The ROK and China established diplomatic relations one and a  half years ago. This was an action that our two countries took  after actively responding [nungdongjoguro taeung] to the  establishment of a new international order of reconciliation and  cooperation.    The two countries know well each other's potential and  realize a need to promote cooperation for the sake of each  country's national development. The world has been undergoing  great political and economic change. In the midst of this  change, a discussion has been under way to invigorate a regional  economic cooperation system for common prosperity in this  region. We reached an agreement that it is necessary for the  ROK and China to build a more in-depth and multisided [poda  simchungjogigo tawonjogin] cooperation system in step with such  an international trend.    Domestic and foreign reporters: Our two countries share the  view that the tension on the Korean peninsula surrounding the  North Korean nuclear issue is not beneficial to either country.  President Jiang Zemin and I again confirmed this during our  summit talks. We have so far cooperated to resolve this issue  through dialogue and persuasion and will not give up our efforts  for dialogue.    The ROK and China share the same interest in the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, stability there, and  peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia.    I expect North Korea will become a responsible member of the  international community and join in the tide of world history,  which is reform and openness.    When North and South Korea have substantial dialogue and  cooperation and, ultimately, achieve North-South Korea  reunification, genuine peace will be achieved on the Korean  peninsula and Northeast Asia.    It is necessary for the ROK and China to develop long-term  relations of cooperation, looking forward to such North-South  dialogue and cooperation and a reunified Korea in the future. I  stressed this point to the Chinese leaders during my current  visit to China.    We were of the same opinion that a reunified Korea will be  greatly beneficial to not only to the Korean people but to China  and other neighboring countries of ours.    Since it began to carry out the policy of reform and  openness, China has continuously maintained an alarming economic  growth. Since they established diplomatic relations, our two  countries have learned the other's good points and promoted  cooperation. In this course, our two countries have gained much  reciprocal benefits.    The two countries have reached a point at which they must  widen a systematic basis [chedojok kiban] to further accelerate  economic exchanges. To this end, an ROK-China industrial  cooperation committee was inaugurated as a result of my visit to  China. I am pleased about this.    We will promote industrial cooperation in the production of  automobiles, electronic telephone switchboard systems, aircraft,  and various other fields. The double taxation prevention  agreement that was signed this time will accelerate economic  exchange between the two countries.    We extensively discussed the expansion of bilateral economic  cooperation and the invigoration [hwalsonghwa] of the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. We will closely cooperate to  build an open, free Asia-Pacific economic order.    China has promulgated various laws and eased restrictions  and  taken various other measures to enter GATT. The ROK assesses  that these measures by China would contribute to strengthening  the multilateral trade system. We will positively extend  cooperation to ensure that China enters the GATT system.    Since the ROK and China established diplomatic relations,  the  exchange of people between the two countries has significantly  increased. Over 150,000 people of the ROK and China visited  each other's country last year. I have significantly simplified  the procedures necessary for our people's visits to China. We  opened a ROK consulate general in Shanghai last year and will  open one in Qingdao. The expansion of the exchange of the  people between the two countries will greatly contribute to  promoting a mutual understanding and friendship.    Our two countries will promote more intimate relations of  cooperation based on their historically and geographically close  relations. We, as genuine neighbors who need each other, will  consolidate friendship in all fields.    Cherishing deep in my heart the Chinese people's friendship,  I will depart for Seoul tomorrow. Before leaving for Seoul, I  will go to Tianjin to visit a place where the people of our two  countries are working together for common prosperity. I express  deep thanks to the Chinese leaders and all Chinese people who  warmly welcomed me and my delegation and extended warm  hospitality to us. Thank you.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that where  negotiations with Syria are concerned, Israel is demanding that  no Israeli settlements be removed in the first stage of  withdrawal on the Golan Heights.    Briefing the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee  today, Rabin at the same time warned that if there is no peace  agreement between Israel and Syria in the next two or three  years, he will recommend injecting large sums of money into the  Army to prepare for the possibility of war. From the Knesset,  David Ze'ev reports:    [Begin recording] [Ze'ev] On his way out of the Foreign  Affairs and Defense Committee, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  downplayed the Syrian arms buildup. [passage omitted]    But, according to a Knesset official inside the closed-door  meeting, the premier sounded a totally different note there.  Said Rabin: Since the end of last year, I cannot remember such  a large quantity of arms reaching Syria, and of the most  advanced type: hundreds of T-72 tanks; not an insignificant  number of mobile artillery; and Rabin referred to Russian  President Boris Yeltsin saying that Moscow will continue to  supply spare military parts to Damascus -- due to the Russian  commitment -- and that if the Syrians kept up to their payment  schedule of paying off an $11 billion debt, the Russians would  supply surface-to-surface SA-10 missiles as well.    Rabin also sounded a more ominous note than in last week's  statement on a possible war with Syria in the coming years, if  there is no peace agreement. Rabin told the Foreign Affairs and  Defense Committee -- following criticism from the opposition on  the committee -- that if there is no agreement in two to three  years, I would recommend injecting huge amounts of money into  the Israel Defense Forces to allow the IDF to prepare for the  possibility of war.    The prime minister also justified the delay of the donor  countries in sending money to the PLO to fund self-rule  operations until they know how the moneies will be supervised  and to where they will be going. But he hoped for progress when  he meets PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Paris next week.  [passage omitted]    Rabin said he had not invited 'Arafat to visit the Jerusalem  holy shrines in his newspaper interviews last weekend, only that  he was repeating the policy of previous Israeli Governments of  freedom of access to all Muslims and Christians. [end recording]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 28 June  adds: "Yitzhaq Rabin said today that the government is looking  into ways to expand the Jewish population in Jerusalem, but  there are difficulties in locating land. The government, he  said, is willing to confiscate land to this end, but it is  awaiting a ruling by the High Court of Justice on several  petitions regarding matters of land in Jerusalem. Our  correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that the prime minister was  speaking at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee."]</p>

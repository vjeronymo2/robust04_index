			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Comptoirs Modernes up 9.6% against retail trend COMPTOIRS Modernes, one of France's larger food retailing groups, last year bucked the trend in the French retail sector to increase net consolidated profits by 9.6 per cent to FFr335m in 1992, from FFr306m in 1991 The group, which owns the Stoc supermarket chain and Commod food stores, saw sales rise by 6.8 per cent to FFr22.6bn in 1992, from FFr21.2bn in 1991, and operating profits increase by 20.6 per cent to FFr623m, from FFr516m over the same period. Mr Jean-Claude Plassart, chairman, said he was confident about the group's prospects for 1993, despite the difficult economic environment. Comptoirs Modernes plans to continue its strategy of opening new stores and modernising old outlets. It plans to invest in its distribution system. It is also developing the Merca Plus hypermarket chain in Spain, where it opened three new stores last year. The latest candidate in French retailing for acquisition is Prisunic, a large chain of supermarkets owned by the Pinault-Printemps retail group.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 2: Coping with the challenge of Gatt - Bjorn Westh, the minister of agriculture, talks to Hilary Barnes Denmark has a position of strength in food production which offers opportunities for development, says Mr Bjorn Westh, the minister of agriculture who is sometimes tipped to become his country's next EU Commissioner. 'We do not think there is anything old-fashioned about producing food,' he declares in an interview. 'The food industry gives rise to 25 per cent of all employment in Danish industry. It brings in about DKr55bn (Pounds 5.7bn) a year in export revenues, and export revenues are required to keep the welfare state going. If we want to develop the welfare state we must have jobs in industries which earn foreign currency, and in the food industry we have a position of strength that we must utilise.' This might seem a bold commitment at a time when European agriculture is being forced by reforms of the common agricultural policy and the Gatt deal to curb production and exports. Mr Westh does not dispute the fact that the future of Danish agriculture and its related export industries is dependent on how the European Union reacts to the Gatt. On the other hand, he does not have much time for calculations which show that Danish farm incomes will be cut by DKr2bn or so - 7 or 8 per cent of gross factor income - by Gatt. 'They don't take into account the new market opportunities, so they are unhelpful, static calculations. The world does not stand still, and Denmark is not standing still. 'On our part, we want the European Council, in connection with this year's price negotiations, to approve a declaration calling on the Commission to work out a strategy by which the European countries can utilise the new market opportunities which the Gatt will provide.' Mr Westh is referring to the obligation of Gatt signatories to allow at least 3 per cent of their food supplies to be imported, rising to 5 per cent after five years. 'We see Gatt as a challenge, and we must go on the offensive. We must ensure that we are active and that it is not the Americans, the New Zealanders or the Cairns Group countries who run away with everything,' he says. As the Gatt calls for a reduction in exports of subsidised products, 'we want to put the Commission to work to see if we cannot abolish or reduce export subsidies. 'The EU corn price is still 10-15 per cent above the world market price. If we can bring it down to the world market price, corn exports would not be subject to export subsidies, and neither would products based on corn, such as pigmeat and poultry. A side-effect of this would be that we would no longer need obligatory set-aside policies.' This view finds support in the UK and France, he says, but other EU countries will resist it. However, he points out that if the EU does not succeed in adopting policies which allow exports to third (ie, non-EU) countries, Denmark will have to sell large quantities of dairy and pigmeat products in Europe, with a painful impact on prices. 'I think this argument will mean that some countries will begin to listen to what we are saying.' As Mr Westh sees it, Danish food exports will not compete with exports from developing countries, at least not directly. 'We shall compete in markets where there are consumers who want high quality products and have the means to pay, especially markets in south-east Asia, such as Japan, Korea, Singapore, some south American markets and the Nordic market. 'Danish agriculture will try to live up to this strategy through an aggressive, broad quality policy, from conditions on the farm through processing to transport  .. Quality is having control over environmental problems, over the surroundings in which animals live, and not only the product itself.' As an example, he points out that a major effort is being made at the moment to eliminate salmonella from infecting pigs on the farm or at any stage of processing. Mr Westh is on the whole an optimist. Last year Danish pig production passed 20m for the first time. 'I don't see why we shouldn't produce 25m pigs by the year 2000, and perhaps more milk than we do today as well,' he says. 'If I am relatively optimistic it is also because when you look around the world you see the environmental issues coming into focus. We have a good chance of handling these problems successfully, not only because we started to tackle them early on but because we have a structure which makes the problems easier to tackle. You only have to look at a big food producer like Holland, which has twice as many animals and three times as many people in an area a third the size of Denmark.' Legislation which restricts the number of farms that one farmer may own or lease, and regulates the number of animals per hectare of land, will prevent the establishment of gigantic pig farms, however. 'We do not want individual units to be too big. There are veterinary and health dangers in very big units. In return we have told the farmers that they can own and lease more units. 'This goes together with our quality approach. We do not want a policy which encourages the use of medicines, and we want the farmers to be able to keep an eye on the health of the animals,' he says.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Fashion: A feel for the rhythm - How the catwalk designs make their way into the real world If you were an indefatigable fashion-watcher you could have sat through more than 150 shows in the three cities - Milan, London and Paris - which have so far held their spring collections. If, that is, you could put up with the long waits for the shows to start, the rude security men, the hassle of evicting interlopers from your seat and, at Vivienne Westwood's show in Paris, the stampede of uninvited students who stormed the barricades. And today, you would be starting another week's onslaught in New York. You would, if you were a top buyer, be trying to make sense of this maelstrom of creative input knowing that your decision to back certain trends could directly affect both your company's profits and your career. Attuned to the deeper rhythms of fashion, the buyer tries to pinpoint what will be significant in 'real life' while bearing in mind those first news-page images which can alter current dress almost instantly. Buyers normally go to the shows of the designers their stores support, plus those they might in future. They are, one reminded me, 'invited to press shows out of courtesy. Our real work is done at the showroom where all the catwalk fantasy is stripped away'. They rely to some extent on the independents, who are one step further back in the fashion chain, and who offer buyers advice. Journalists on trade magazines or consultants to stores begin their forecasting at least six months ahead of the shows, by going to the fabric exhibitions where the designers themselves seek inspiration. By the time of the shows they already have an idea which way the fashion wind is blowing and can put designer fantasies into commercial context. We asked experts for their views on the spring look and its significance to the ordinary woman's wardrobe, and to suggest autumn buys for an instant update. Real life may, as one of them points out, 'move more slowly than the fashion world thinks, always a season behind the shows', but a consensus emerges from the welter of ideas despite widely varying interpretations. That overworked word 'glamour' best describes the image of fashion's inevitable swing away from the years of increasing casualness which culminated in deconstruction and grunge. But within the context of glamour - which essentially means more care over hair, make-up, choice of accessories and cut - it is proportion and fabric which count. Skirt length is a non-issue, as Karl Lagerfeld pointedly illustrated in his three collections. His own label and Chloe included on-knee and calf-lengths, while Chanel was resolutely short because that is what its customers demand. So choose what suits you and proportion jacket and shoes accordingly. Knee-length looks freshest with a heeled shoe but this need not be a towering stiletto. The much-hyped retro look can also be moulded to suit you. Skilful old-fashioned tailoring is back, with the hour-glass silhouette of narrow, sharply-defined shoulders and emphasised hips that Vivienne Westwood foresaw with last season's 'bustles'. It reaches its apogee in highly-mannered, perfectly-cut costumes, complete with 1950s accessories, from new British Designer of the Year John Galliano, who seems determined to put the 'haute' back into couture. But the best collections, such as Westwood, Gaultier, Versace, Dries van Noten and Ann Demeulemeester, use historical elements and make them look modern. Jean Paul Gaultier, often a creative catalyst, gave a lesson in individualisation by taking shapes from every decade of the century and Gaultier-ising them with his signature fabrics and cut. Shock-value transparency and high-shine fabrics are his statement on the 1990s and how right he is. High-tech fabrics, powered on by plastic at Helmut Lang and paillettes at Lacroix and Montana, are indicative but the real-wardrobe versions will be sateen, glazed linen or Chanel's cellophane braid rather than vinyl. Betty Jackson's white satin zoot suit or Jil Sander's skinny rock-chick trouser suit in deep iridescent nylon have believable modern glamour. As one of our experts, Vanessa de Lisle, points out, 'women need not be frightened of modern nylon. It looks and feels sophisticated.' For a link between catwalk creativity and commercial nous, old masters such as Yves St Laurent and Valentino repay attention. They take advanced themes and cleverly detune them into pretty wearability. One strand of fashion seems destined to remain on the magazine page rather than the clothes rail. An undercurrent of violence has succeeded the ugliness which shocked observers last season - Alexander McQueen's trussed-chicken polythene dresses and tyre-track printed suits, Rifat Ozbek's fencing jackets with red slashes and jewelled blood drops, Lagerfeld's restrictive patent corselets, even Galliano's beautiful but unhealthily pampered girls in gilded cages - all are suspect images to today's independent woman. They are designed by men. At least Westwood's women, for all their over-emphasised curves and silly high-heeled shoes, appear in control of their lives.</p>

The SRIX operates 37 self-propelled rail testing cars utilizing their own operators, and a railroad employee acting as a pilot who is qualified on the physical characteristics and operating rules over the railroad it is being operated on. The SRIX argues that their operators are well trained and would not benefit from part 240 certification requirements. The SRIX also argues that the cost of certification would make them non-competitive due to increased labor costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> St. Louis &amp; Chain of Rocks Railroad (SLCR) (Waiver Petition Docket No. RSEQ&hyph;94&hyph;6)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The St. Louis &amp; Chain of Rocks Railroad (SLCR) seeks a waiver of compliance from all provisions of 49 CFR Part 240, Qualification Standards for Locomotive Engineers.

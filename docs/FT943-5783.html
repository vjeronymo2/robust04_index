			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Health officials forced to resign Eleven people have been forced to resign from health authorities after the Department of Health discovered that they were not eligible for their posts. The disclosure came at the same time as the government announced plans to introduce more openness in the National Health Service. The 11 non-executive part-timers were found to be serving on two authorities each, which is against the regulations covering appointments. A check on all the thousands of health authority members was carried out after a similar case of a member serving on more than one authority was discovered earlier this year. The 11 were allowed to choose which authority they wished to remain on. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, said the issue was a 'genuine mistake' arising from the complexity of the rules involved. Mrs Bottomley yesterday launched a draft code of openness under which health authorities and trusts will have to publish details of the money they spend on red tape. They will also be encouraged to publish summaries of their business plans, give details of local waiting times, and reveal the number of complaints received. Information on the numbers of vaccinations and on cervical smear screening should also be freely available. Mrs Bottomley said being open with the public was 'an essential feature of a good public service and must be part of the ethos of the NHS'.</p>

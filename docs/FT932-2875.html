			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Du Pont offer to critics of fungicide DU PONT, the US chemicals group, yesterday challenged its critics to prove that its Benlate DF fungicide had damaged crops when used as labelled, and appointed an outside director to serve as ombudsman on the issue. The company, besieged with lawsuits over Benlate and allegations that it withheld important documents from growers, said it would pay for testing the product at any of the top 10 US agricultural universities for any plaintiff with a current lawsuit. The move follows a decision by federal judge Robert Elliot to direct a jury to find Du Pont liable for Benlate damage. Judge Elliot concluded at a pretrial hearing on Friday that plaintiffs had clearly demonstrated that Du Pont withheld documents relating to the cross-contamination of Benlate with crop-killing herbicides also made by Du Pont. As part of its offer, the company said it would pay for crop damage if the tests proved Benlate caused the damage claimed in the suit. However, Du Pont will ask plaintiffs to agree to withdraw their suits if the tests show Benlate did not damage plants. In addition, Du Pont asked its outside director, Mr Howard Johnson, former chairman of MIT Corporation, to serve as ombudsman with power to retain independent counsel to probe the allegations of wrongdoing and to report his findings to the public. It said anyone with knowledge of an instance where evidence had been withheld in bad faith or data falsified about Benlate should contact him. Du Pont has already paid growers Dollars 500m (Pounds 324.6m) in voluntary settlements but the company suspended payments in November after its research failed to duplicate the effects attributed to Benlate.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Almost 100 show interest in Dunkeld Administrative receivers at Dunkeld Group, the manufacturer of Slix swimwear and Pierre Balmain shirts which collapsed on Monday, have received approaches from almost 100 interested parties, including management appointed to the group less than three weeks ago. A buy-out was launched yesterday by Mr Graham Hudson and Mr Bill Walker, who joined Dunkeld at the end of last month to run the swimwear and shirt divisions. They were meeting yesterday with receivers to negotiate a price. Price Waterhouse, which is acting for management in the negotiations, said yesterday it was too early to put a value on the company. The management team had no facilities in place as yet, although it was 'in the process of selecting investors'. Mr Walker, formerly business development director for the VF Corporation Europe, said he was confident that both the shirt and swimwear businesses, along with the group's 500 employees, 'could have a successful and profitable future'. Dunkeld claims the UK's number one position in ladies swimwear, with 18 per cent of the market. It is also one of the UK's four largest shirt suppliers. Dunkeld, which almost collapsed two years ago after a heady expansion phase left it crippled with debt, bought the swimwear division and a shirt-making business less than a year ago. The deals were accompanied by a placing to raise Pounds 1.7m and a second financial restructuring in which bankers Hill Samuel converted Pounds 5.9m of debt into equity. However, the burden of debt built up in the 1980s proved too much for Dunkeld.</p>

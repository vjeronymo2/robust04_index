			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Ma Chenguang: "Public Tips Help Bring </F> the Corrupt to Court"]    [Text] More than 60,000 people were charged with  corruption last year, a senior official said yesterday.    And 80 percent were turned in by the public.    Fifty-four percent of the cases involved bribery and 24  percent involved embezzlement, said Yang Shen of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission (CDIC).    Nationwide, procuratorial organs handled 525,570 cases  during  the first 11 months of last year involving 60,163 offenders,  said Yang, who is director of the CDIC's Letters-and-Visits  Reception Office.    Phone calls, letters and visits from the public helped the  government uncover more than 80 percent of the corruption cases.    So far, more than 10,000 offenders have been brought to  trial  or face trials, Yang said.    Last August, the country tightened its rein on corrupt  activities, which run from taking bribes and gifts to embezzling  public funds for private purposes.    During the past year, the crime-reporting centre under the  Supreme People's Procuratorate received more than 270,000  reports about illegal activities, 58 of which involved bribery  and embezzlement.    The CDIC and the Ministry of Supervision, the country's two  main supervisory organs, received 100,678 tips from people  nationwide through calls, letters and visits.    Only 2 percent of the reports were fabricated.    To date, 194 big cases have been filed, with all offenders  either having been tried or waiting for trial.    The complaint centre at the Ministry of Public Security also  received 2,595 tips from the public.    According to Yang, among the reported cases at his CDIC  office last year, more than 20 per cent were concerned with  embezzlement and financial infractions.    Most offenders held bureau-director level positions and were  from developing regions such as Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Guizhou  and Yunnan provinces.    Yang said this was because policies and administrative  mechanisms in these areas still have loopholes as the country  becomes a socialist market economy.    He said the Party and the State have strongly encouraged  people to report graft during the nation's anti-corruption drive.    Nationwide supervisory organs have set up  "letters-and-visits" offices, hotlines and complaint boxes to  make it easier for people to report corruption.    And to encourage people to do so, Yang said, special  campaigns have also been conducted to make it easier to report  crime. Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province has run  campaigns to stop corruption against farmers, end  government-financed trips abroad and ban extravagant marriage  and burial ceremonies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Liberals Support Reforms"] </F>   [Text] I.P. Markulov, chairman of the Liberal Party of  Ukraine [LPU], has held a news conference in Donetsk. Since the  party's position is generally well known to the electorate,  Markulov dealt chiefly with answering questions. The LPU is not  going to form any electoral bloc because a political bloc with  some other force, he said, will result in nothing but the  neutralization of both forces. Personally, I will not put myself  forward on the electoral list, Markulov stressed. This was what  the party decided. A leader should concentrate on giving the  greatest possible support to his candidates.    One of the questions concerned the fulfillment of the  protocol agreement between the LPU and the Donetsk strike  committee. Here it was said that the coal lobby in the  government does not want to sign a contract with the World Bank  because of its condition that the coal industry be restructured.  According to the LPU leader, if unprofitable mines continue to  operate at the expense of profitable ones, the money allotted by  the Bank may go into a black hole.    It was also stated that the LPU has broad links with the  Liberal International; however, the LPU domestic policy should  not overstep state borders. The party does not receive, and has  not received, any money from the West, in other words, the party  does not rely on overseas funds.    According to Markulov, the battle today is not between  political parties, but between those who want to preserve  socialism on one hand, and those who fight for radical reforms  on the other. Another question concerned the LPU attitude  toward Zhirinovskiy's party. The LPU chairman stated, among  other things, that Zhirinovskiy's style and methods are  unacceptable. To declare oneself a liberal and to pursue an  extremist policy are incompatible things.    The main thrust of the LPU is to support private ownership,  while its economic policy is socially oriented. The party  believes that Ukraine needs a presidential form of rule.  Political fighting among certain individuals should not obscure  the country's strategic line of development, in other words, the  country's disintegration and interregional conflicts must be  prevented.    Answering a number of other questions about the upcoming  parliamentary elections, the LPU chairman stated that the new  parliament should consist of new people.</p>

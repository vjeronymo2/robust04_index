			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up STRATEGY Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley has put his bet on Poland as eastern Europe's answer to a 'tiger economy'. Addressing himself to a longer time horizon than many analysts - in a research paper called '2001: an investment odyssey' - the global strategist suggests that the Czech and Hungarian republics will also do well, 'but unlike Poland they do not offer the double advantage of having a large and growing market, as well as a cheap manufacturing base.' As for emerging markets in general, he forecasts that several of the world's restructuring economies will fail to transform: 'this could damage the emerging markets mania sweeping the investment world.' POLAND Poland's finance minister is to ask the stock exchange authorities to consider suspending trading in Bank Slaski until all investors obtain equal access. On Thursday the bank had its stockbroking licence revoked by the securities commission following charges that it had mismanaged its own privatisation. It has been given six months to wind down its operations. Ing of the Netherlands has a 25.9 per cent stake in the bank. KENYA The government has scrapped several foreign currency controls, to bring the country close to its declared aim of total liberalisation. Kenyans living overseas will be allowed unlimited local borrowing to finance local investment, and restrictions on local borrowing by foreign-controlled companies will also be lifted. Controls remain on capital accounts and rules barring foreign investors from trading on the Nairobi stock market. ISRAEL The stock market closed down 6 per cent last week, depressed by the recent arrest of two portfolio investment managers by the securities authority on suspicion of manipulating securities for the eight companies they managed. A third person, Mr Amos Weiss, a leading portfolio manager with some Shk1bn (some Dollars 335m) under management, was released on bail last week also after questioning on suspicion of stock manipulation. NIGERIA Activity on the stock exchange was slightly more muted in 1993 than in the previous year, the authorities reported last week. According to the latest estimates shares put on 39 per cent in 1993 compared with a 41 per cent rise in 1992. The stock exchange also reported that 21 new companies were listed on the daily official list in 1993, up from 12 in 1992. At present there are 175 listed companies, with a market capitalisation of N50.5bn. ROMANIA Holders of vouchers will be able to swap them for shares in 20 state enterprises from May, when the Private Ownership Fund issues its first list of companies to be privatised through public offerings. The country's five regional funds hold a 30 per cent stake in some 6,000 state enterprises designated for privatisation over the next seven to 15 years. BUDAPEST The government has drawn up a short list of privatisation consultants to help float shares of Matav, the telecommunications group, on the Budapest stock exchange by the middle of this year.</p>

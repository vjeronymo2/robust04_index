			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: The jewel in France's industrial portfolio / A look at the transformation of Rhone-Poulenc RHONE-POULENC, the French majority state-owned chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, has transformed itself from a ragbag of chemicals businesses into the envy of the industry. Six years ago, the French government put a management consultant, Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, an expert on the pharmaceuticals industry, in charge. He was told to shake some strategic sense into the company. Today, it is a star of the government's industrial portfolio and is being readied for partial privatisation before next February. After some FFr40bn (Dollars 7.4bn) worth of acquisitions and FFr12bn worth of disposals since 1986, Rhone-Poulenc now generates more than 60 per cent of its operating profits from pharmaceuticals, a far more profitable and less cyclical business than its original metier. The transformation has been so complete analysts believe the healthcare businesses could provide all of group operating profits during this year's fourth quarter. New arrivals include Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals business, Connaught, the Canadian vaccines group and the speciality chemicals businesses, Britain's RTZ Chemicals and GAF of the US. During the transformation process, Rhone-Poulenc has doubled its turnover to FFr83.8bn last year, risen from 12th to seventh in the world chemical industry rankings, and lifted foreign sales from 70 to 78 per cent of the total. Now that Rhone-Poulenc and other partially privatised state giants such as Pechiney in aluminium, and Elf Aquitaine in oil have emerged from their shake-ups, the government is starting to cash in on the results. It badly needs to sell shares in such groups at a time when the budget deficit is growing faster than expected and when it needs cash to fund job creation programmes. However, Mr Fourtou's achievement has not been without cost. The group has a reputation for paying prices no private company would like to rival, such as the estimated Dollars 1.7bn it spent two years ago for a majority stake in Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals group. Rhone-Poulenc's acquisition binge has left it with debt that few privately-owned businesses could manage. The company is struggling to reduce gearing, presently at 86 per cent. Analysts believe it is unlikely to meet its publicly-stated target of reducing gearing to 50 per cent by the end of 1993. Mr Fourtou's efforts to reduce group debt have been hit by the general decline in prices for chemicals companies. As one analyst explains: 'Forecasts for the chemicals industry are deteriorating and decent asset prices are difficult to achieve.' One asset sale Rhone-Poulenc would like to make is its titanium dioxide business. But the group has not found anyone willing to pay the price it wants. To achieve its disposals target of FFr3bn this year it needs two substantial sales before the end of December. The polyester, rare earths and aluminas businesses are potential candidates. Meanwhile, the group has not remained immune from the worldwide downturn in the chemical industry. Its agrochemicals business, the world's fourth-largest, has also been hit by poor weather and the reform of the EC's common agricultural policy. Group profits before tax and after minority interests during the third quarter fell to FFr31m from FFr757m in 1991, mainly due to exchange rate losses, a risk of its internationalisation. Company forecasts for operating profits growth this year have been downgraded from 20 to 10 per cent. Next year's group results should improve. Although the cyclical chemicals businesses operating profits are likely to deteriorate, they should be offset by continuing growth in pharmaceuticals, in spite of an increasingly tight pricing environment in the US and Europe. The group should be cash-flow neutral this year and positive next year, even without asset sales. Margins should benefit from cost-cutting. Capital expenditure - including environmental spending - is likely to be cut next year. Further job losses are probably in the pipeline. Rhone-Poulenc's non-voting shares - or preferred investment certificates - have fallen from FFr543 at the end of October, when the government sell-off was announced, to FFr493.50 yesterday. In normal circumstances, analysts argue Rhone-Poulenc would be a prime candidate for a Lord Hanson-style break up. Its senior executives admit the combined value of its holdings in Rorer, Roussel-Uclaf, Institut Merieux are more than Rhone-Poulenc's market capitalisation, effectively giving the chemicals operations a negative net worth. Analysts believe the relatively modest size of the sell-off, between FFr3bn and FFr4bn depending on the price, should ensure its success. More problematical will be encouraging holders of the group's preferred investment certificates (PICs) and participating shares (PSSAs) to swap them for ordinary shares. The former have no voting rights, but offer preferential dividends. Some analysts are dubious about the merits of swaping a preferential dividend for a vote in a company effectively still controlled by the state. Where does the company go from here? Rhone-Poulenc reckons it has more or less completed the reshaping of its business portfolio and it has achieved the critical size required in its five sectors, health care, agrochemicals, fibres, specialty chemicals and chemical intermediates. It does not envisage any more big acquisitions in the near future and says its asset sales programme will start to run down, from FFr3.1bn in 1991 to FFr3bn this year and less next. Meanwhile, Mr Fourtou's team plans to devote the next three to five years seeking productivity improvements across the group and integrating the acquisitions. Increasing the flow of new products will also be a priority, especially at Rorer, whose portfolio of non-generic medicines is older than that of some competitors. The coming share sale and the simplification of the group's complex share structure that goes with it is widely seen in France as a step towards full privatisation. It will 'closely resemble a private-sector company,' claimed Mr Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, the finance director, yesterday. For example, the chairman will be chosen by the public-sector dominated supervisory board, rather than nominated directly by the government. While the Socialist government is committed to keeping majority control for the state and state-owned bodies, Rhone-Poulenc is likely to be a prime candidate for a sell-off under a Gaullist government, likely to take power after the legislative elections next March. Yet, despite its high debts, it does not plan to take advantage of the climate for privatisation to make a rights issue for the time being. Mr Fourtou has said he prefers to live with continuing debts rather than risk diluting earnings per share.</p>

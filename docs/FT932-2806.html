			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Family silver and jewellery piles up in salerooms BUSINESS at the Sotheby's salerooms in Billingshurst, West Sussex has been brisk in recent weeks, Richard Lapper writes. The losses faced by the area's badly hit Lloyd's Names are one of the main reasons, according to Mr Leslie Weller, managing director of the auction house's Sussex division. 'The latest calls have started to affect people. We've been handling quite a lot of property.' Names had been selling everything across the board from garden statues to pictures, he added. 'The market has been going well.' Nationally, Sotheby's said it had received 'thousands' of inquiries in recent months from Names, with most of them seeking to raise between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 100,000. In response the auction house is offering a tailor-made service to Names who want to sell the family silver or other heirlooms. Details of the package were presented to Lloyd's members' agents this week. Sotheby's is offering Names a 40 per cent discount on commission, loans of up to 35 per cent on the value of objects sent for sale, and free surveys. It also promises 'total anonymity'. Mr Norbert Mallet, a Sussex-based Name who faces losses of Pounds 750,000, says that he has had to sell most of his family jewellery in the past two years, at prices he believes are 'some 30 per cent lower' than 1980s prices.</p>

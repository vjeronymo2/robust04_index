			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shunji Yanai, director of the newly created </F> Foreign Policy Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, by unidentified  GAIKO FORUM correspondent; place and date not given: "Japanese  Diplomatic Role in Changing Times: On the Occasion of the  Creation of the Foreign Policy Bureau"]    [Text]Experience and Reflection of Gulf Crisis Are in  Background    [GAIKO FORUM] Would you tell us from the beginning how the  Foreign Policy Bureau came about.    [Yanai] When the Cold War ended, the international situation  became fluid and complicated. Japan was confronted with the  question of how to maintain its security, stability, and  prosperity as well as the task of building a post-Cold War new  international order; hence the need to create an organization in  the Foreign Ministry which could properly respond to such  situations. During the Cold War, one diplomatic policy was to  belong to either the East or West camp. But a new world order  has not yet been formed in place of the Cold War, and it demands  Japan deal with the new era in a positive manner.    In the report of the third Council for Administrative  Reform,  an opinion was expressed that the Foreign Ministry needs to have  an organization which can deal with such situations. In  response, the Consultation Group for Consolidated Diplomacy was  formed with Ryuzo Segawa as its chairman. More concrete views  on reorganizing the ministry were exchanged at the meeting, and  a report was compiled in December 1991. The report recommended  the ministry create two bureaus -- a consolidated policies  bureau and an international information bureau, although names  were not specified.    In the background were such concrete realities as the  experience and reflections of the Persian Gulf crisis which took  place in August 1990. In the sense that the war erupted in the  Persian Gulf, the Middle East and African Affairs Bureau was in  charge of the affair, but the initial diplomatic efforts to deal  with the situation were made at the United Nations and the  Security Council. In the meantime, the coalition forces were  organized with the United States as its main component, joined  by the United Kingdom, France, and other countries. The Middle  East and African Affairs Bureau alone could not handle such a  situation. The matter of transporting refugees of Asian origin  was related to the Asian Affairs Bureau. When situations arose  in which periphery countries were seriously affected by the war  and needed assistance, the Economic Cooperation Bureau had to  step in.    Therefore, crisis management was required for wider spheres  and more subjects than in the past, and this could not be  properly handled by the existing organizations. It was keenly  felt that an overall organization such as the Foreign Policy  Bureau was necessary.    [GAIKO FORUM] As a matter of fact, the United Nations Bureau  was reorganized, was it not?    [Yanai] Most functions of the United Nations Bureau were  taken over, and the Policy Planning Division of the Information  Analysis, Research, and Planning Bureau was added. In addition,  the General Affairs Section was newly created in the Foreign  Policy Bureau. Simply speaking, the United Nations Bureau was  dissolved for a better setup with additional functions. By  nature, the United Nations deals with everything in the  universe. In that sense, the United Nations and what the  Foreign Policy Bureau plans to contend with are closely related.  Therefore, the bureau took over such functions.    [GAIKO FORUM] Were there rearrangements with other bureaus?    [Yanai] There were some, but they were not limited to mere  adjustments. The new bureau is in charge of planning and  framing foreign policies which are across-the-board,  comprehensive, and long-range in nature. In the past, no  bureaus existed to handle such matters.    Adjustments with other bureaus were then needed to deal with  various problems in a more concrete manner. This did not mean  replacing other bureaus, but working out an overall policy by  coordinating the matters under other bureaus' jurisdiction.  <H5>  Comprehensively Coordinating Multinational Matters </H5>   [GAIKO FORUM] Matters which cannot be solved by one nation,  such as problems of displaced persons and human rights, have  taken place in record numbers in recent days, have they not?    [Yanai] The Global Issues Division is in charge of matters  on a global scale. As a whole, the bureau consists of nine  divisions [ka] and five sections [shitsu].    Organizational Chart of the Foreign Policy Bureau   Main Body   Administrators                             Divisions   1)Director-General, Foreign Policy         General Affairs Division  Bureau 2)Councilor   Planning Division   National Security Policy Division   United Nations Policy Division   International Peace Cooperation Section   Arms Control and Scientific Affairs Councilor Organization   1)Councilor, Arms Control and Scientific   Arms Control &amp; Disarmament Division  Affairs 2)Counselor   Nonproliferation of Weapons-Related  Materials Section   Scientific Affairs &amp; Nuclear Energy  Division   International Science Cooperation  Section   Department of International Cooperation   1)Director, International Cooperation      United Nations Administration  Department 2)Counselor                     Division   Specialized Agencies Administration  Section   Human Rights and Refugees Division   Refugee Assistance Section   Global Issues Division      The deputy director-general of the bureau is a councilor,  and  the councilor of the Arms Control and Scientific Affairs  Department as well as the director of the International  Cooperation Department have counselors under them. Basically,  the organization of the Arms Control and Scientific Affairs  Department and the International Cooperation Department are  headed by persons with director-general's rank. Therefore, you  may construe they are almost independent organizations even  though they fall within the Foreign Policy Bureau. These days  there are matters which cannot be solved by a nation, and many  things which are beyond the abilities of a superpower such as  the United States. The organization was formed with this in  mind.    [GAIKO FORUM] In order to practically strengthen foreign  policy, coordination with the cabinet and Foreign Ministry, or  with other ministries or civilian needs, is necessary. What do  you think about this?    [Yanai] The cabinet is in charge of ironing out differences  of opinion between the ministries and coming up with a  conclusion as a whole. But in the process of drawing up and  working out foreign policy, it is naturally required to  coordinate and cooperate with other government agencies and  private organizations, including the mass media and the Diet.  Such work is not monopolized on by my bureau, for other bureaus  do the same work as well. For domestic coordination and  negotiations with foreign countries, it is convenient in many  ways for the Foreign Ministry as a whole to have a general  policy. That point is different from past practices.    [GAIKO FORUM] Your bureau practically came into being with  the inauguration of the Hosokawa cabinet. Did you make  preparations for the Japan-U.S. talks between Prime Minister  Hosokawa and President Clinton?    [Yanai] Japan-U.S. relations are handled by the North  American Affairs Bureau. The Japan-U.S. talks took place in  September of 1993 when the prime minister attended the United  Nations General Assembly. My bureau was directly involved in  the preparations for the prime minister's attendance at the UN  General Assembly and in working out the contents of his speech.  Not confined just to Japan-U.S. relations -- for example,  President Yeltsin's visit to Japan -- direct bilateral  negotiations are handled by either the North American Affairs  Bureau or the European and Oceanic Affairs Bureau. But in such  bilateral talks, there arises matters of global scale as well as  multinational matters. My bureau will be involved in such  matters in order to coordinate them comprehensively.  <H3>  On Japan's Becoming a Permanent Member of the Security  Council </H3>   [GAIKO FORUM] Newspaper reports had it that the cabinet and  Foreign Ministry maintained opposing views on Japan's becoming a  permanent member of the UN Security Council.    [Yanai] Delivering an address at the UN General Assembly was  the first opportunity for the Hosokawa cabinet to manifest its  foreign policy. Domestically, there was an address at the Diet  as well as news conferences, but externally that was the first  official speech.    The most essential problem in the making of an organization  for the new world is how to reorganize the Security Council. In  his address, the prime minister touched on this. As a matter of  fact, the Japanese view was made public in a proposal to the  United Nations secretary-general in early July near the end of  the Miyazawa cabinet. Since the basic foreign policy of the  Hosokawa cabinet was to succeed the former cabinet's,  fundamentally there were no problems.    Since it was an address designed for the General Assembly,  the expression sounded naturally different from the proposal.  Frankly speaking, it is only natural that the nuance become  different to reflect various opinions in the coalition. In that  sense, it cannot be denied there were controversies in the  process of drafting the manuscript for the General Assembly.  The mass media exaggerated it to sound as if there were basic  changes in their way of thinking, but I do not agree with that.    [GAIKO FORUM] It was reported the Foreign Ministry  positively favored Japan's becoming a permanent member, and that  Prime Minister Hosokawa was reluctant to be so hasty.    [Yanai] I do not understand the intention of that kind of  report. It is an important problem, but the nation as a whole  does not correctly comprehend the advantages or responsibilities  once Japan becomes a permanent member of the Security Council.  In that sense, I am of the opinion the matter should be  thoroughly debated domestically.    Internationally, the reorganization of the Security Council  has become a potential reality in a hurry. In the process,  international opinion is conspicuously gaining force that Japan  and Germany should be made permanent members. More than 20  nations are in favor of the idea. A great number of countries  which have not made their views public are wishing Japan and  Germany would contribute by becoming permanent members in view  of their present power status in the world. However,  representatives of developing nations have to be considered for  the position if Japan and Germany are to be members. Such  adjustments require time.    There is a consensus that several new nations should be  added  to the permanent membership, and that the permanent membership  itself should be expanded. While there is the need to  thoroughly discuss the matter domestically, there are risks in  being left behind internationally if Japan indulges in domestic  discussion because international movements are gaining speed.    [GAIKO FORUM] With reference to the dispatch of the Japanese  Self-Defense Forces to foreign countries in relation to  peacekeeping operations [PKO], there seems to be apprehension  about Japan becoming a permanent member because it may  contribute to increased military burdens. What is your opinion?    [Yanai] There are no United Nations forces as such provided  for in the UN Charter, and becoming a permanent member does not  immediately cause a nation to make its armed forces available.  As for present permanent member nations, they bear the  responsibility of providing troops or other facilities to the  United Nations only after they work out special agreements with  the UN. So long as there are no commitments, no differences  exist among permanent or nonpermanent member nations of the  Security Council and ordinary UN member nations.    Japan's Constitution has no provisions for the PKO. Member  nations have discretion as to whether they participate, using  their own judgment. A permanent member nation has no obligation  to participate. Until recently it was the rule that the five  major powers -- all permanent members -- did not participate in  the PKO. It was only in recent days that they began to  participate.    As another example, let me cite the coalition forces  during the Gulf war. At the time, use of force was authorized  by a UN Security Council resolution which Russia [then the  Soviet Union] supported, with China abstaining. Although their  standpoints were different, the Soviet Union and China did not  send troops. Therefore, in compliance with the UN Charter, an  obligation to provide military cooperation does not come about  based merely on grounds of a nation being a permanent member of  the Security Council.    Since all problems of international importance related to  peace and security are debated at the Security Council,  overwhelmingly voluminous information can be gathered. Being  present at all times will be advantageous for Japan which seeks  the right to speak on such matters as promoting peace and  disarmament.    Another point I have to make is that Japan is the second  largest contributing nation to the upkeep of the UN, only after  the United States. Furthermore, Japan is paying its share on  time in comparison to the United States which has a major amount  in arrears. Thus, Japan is the best financial contributor. In  view of the democratic principle of "no taxation without  representation," it is a problem for Japan to pay for decisions  made without Japan's participation.  <H5>  Task of Positively Working for Peace </H5>   [GAIKO FORUM] What sort of diplomatic tasks do you have in  mind for Japan to deal with in the future?    [Yanai] Maintaining peace is a vital problem, although it is  difficult to decide what problems should be given priority.  After World War II, Japan enjoyed peace, even though there was  no guarantee it would last forever. Pacifism thus has taken  root. Japan would never engage in aggression nor become a  military power. However, I do not think a majority of Japanese  have ever thought of such pacifism when Japan actively  contributed to creating organizations or engaged in activities  to ensure world peace. But the Persian Gulf crisis was  instrumental in initiating earnest talks about such matters and  in creating in the Japanese such a consciousness. Therefore,  Japan's major task is to make positive efforts for the cause of  peace. Then there are problems of freedom, democracy, and human  rights which are not heeded in many countries of the world, thus  destroying peace. In addition, there are problems of poverty  and maintaining standards of living, which could be defined as  the foundation or infrastructure of peace. Fortunately, Japan  has the strength to contribute to many countries in such fields,  creating such foundations of peace as human rights, humanity, or  economic development. Japan has made considerable contributions  so far in economic cooperation, and such contributions will  continue to be necessary in the future.    There is still the long-range problem of the environment. It  is further deteriorating toward the end of this century, and  Japan has to make more contributions since it has the ability to  do so. In close relation with the problem of peace, Japan has  to make parallel efforts in dealing with such problems as  disarmament and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  These are major subjects to be dealt with.  <H5>  Methods of Propelling Asia-Pacific Cooperation </H5>   [GAIKO FORUM] In retrospect as regards Japanese diplomacy,  the problems of the Meiji era were said to be amendments to  unequal treaties and problems related to the Korean peninsula.  Presently, although the Soviet Union has collapsed, the  existence of Russia poses great concern for Japan. Some  American journalists are said to have predicted Japan's going  nuclear once North Korea [DPRK] possessed nuclear arms. There  are also many things to be apprehensive about as regards  post-Deng Xiaoping China. In brief, East Asia -- which is  closely related to Japan -- seems to be an unpredictable area.    [Yanai] As you said, security and peace in Northeast Asia  has been one of the most vital aspects for present as well as  past Japanese diplomacy.    After the Soviet Union collapsed, a considerably large  portion of it was inherited by Russia, and Russia itself has  created many unstable factors during its process of change. Of  course, it has not gone back to the times of czars; rather, it  is making efforts to become a democracy and a market economy.  For the sake of stability in that region, Russia wished to make  headway in that direction by all means, and Japan is determined  to assist in any way it can. At the same time, Japan will  attempt to settle territorial disputes revolving around the  so-called northern territories in order to expand equilibrium.    China has been pursuing reform and modernization, and seems  to have achieved considerable success in improving its economy.  It is most desirable for regional stability that China becomes  more open and modernized; Japan may be able to assist in that  direction.    The Japan-ROK relationship has greatly improved, but it  deserves more in view of our grueling historical past. The  North Korean regime and its economy is isolated and closed to  the outside world; it should be made a member of the  international community so the security of this area can be  greatly enhanced. Presently North Korea is suspected of  developing nuclear weapons; that question should be solved by  all means so that North Korea can become an ordinary member of  northeast Asia. It necessary to do everything possible in order  to attain that goal.    Unlike in Europe, there is little regional cooperation in  this area, much to our regret. It is true Europe worked a  considerably long time to achieve what it has today. Asian  nations need time to cooperate with other nations in the  Asia-Pacific region in a broad sense, and to establish  cooperative relations in East Asia or Northeast Asia in a  narrower sense. This is considered one of the tasks of the  Foreign Policy Bureau.    [GAIKO FORUM] Asia seems to have antipathy against the human  rights diplomacy of the United States, harboring the concept  that a dictatorship is tolerable for the sake of development.  Is it not Japan's vital role to act as go-between for the human  rights ideology of the United States and the realities of  developing nations?    [Yanai] Attitudes in Asia about human rights certainly  differ from those of the United States and Europe, nor are they  the same between the United States and Europe. It is important  to respect basic human rights, of course; peace cannot be  maintained without it. On the other hand, it is self-evident  that human rights problems in places where overcoming poverty is  the burning question are different from those in countries  enjoying a relatively high standard of living.    Therefore, as regards world standards of respecting human  rights, there is naturally a limit to which a country can  intervene by praising or condemning another country's human  rights record based on its own standards. It is better to a  certain degree to deal realistically with the problem of human  rights in order not to come into conflict with the sovereignty  of those countries in question. Asia covers a broad area, and to  a certain degree the way of thinking in some Asian countries is  comparatively moderate with respect to human rights.  <H5>  Necessity of Sharing International Information </H5>   [GAIKO FORUM] Today diplomacy and internal affairs are  closely related and inseparable as in no other time in the past.  Have you anything to add in relation to domestic society?    [Yanai] In the past, diplomacy found points of contact with  domestic affairs in relation to war and peace, and in rare cases  with trade. Economic and social affairs between Japan and  foreign countries allowed them to have contacts. Contrarily,  today almost every element of both domestic and foreign  communities is interrelated. For that reason, it is necessary  to coordinate with internal affairs in order to execute good  diplomacy. Diplomacy will never succeed without the support of  the people.    [GAIKO FORUM] Other government agencies are closely related  to private enterprise or regional communities because they have  the right to authorization or licenses. However, it is pointed  out that the Foreign Ministry does not have such a domestic  foothold. Do you have any countermeasures?    [Yanai] Domestic information is not automatically gathered,  and problems related to internal affairs are not easy to  understand. In order to gather and absorb domestic information  or demands, efforts are necessary to contact other government  agencies, politicians, the mass media, and private enterprises  within the country. The Foreign Ministry has networks in  foreign countries which provide access to local feelings. But  these feelings are not necessarily understood at home. Therein  lies the difficulty, and it is necessary to make available  domestically the information gathered abroad, and not keep it in  the ministry. It has become more and more necessary to gather  information rapidly and correctly, and to share it with others.    So far I have talked mainly about the Foreign Policy Bureau  in relation to the recent reorganization of the Foreign  Ministry. But the International Information Bureau was created  at the same time. This means functions not related to  information are transferred to the Foreign Policy Bureau, and  the International Information Bureau is to exert more effort in  gathering and analyzing information. Organizational changes were  made simultaneously in order to make the information gathered  available domestically.    One of the tasks of the Foreign Policy Bureau is to become  the center of crisis management in the event of large-scale  emergencies. The Foreign Policy Bureau has the General Affairs  Division as part of its main body; this division will become the  center of the entire Foreign Ministry and will deal with large  emergencies such as the Persian Gulf war. In the past, such  functions did not exist. When emergencies arose, task forces  were quickly formed, but they were not permanent. Now that the  General Affairs Division exists under the Foreign Policy Bureau,  emergencies will be dealt with at all times.    [GAIKO FORUM] Thank you very much.</p>

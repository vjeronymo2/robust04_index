			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Haruo Shiotani, Editing Member] </F>   [Text] The reason why sport is universally loved,  transcending differences in language and customs of countries,  is that it is played under common rules. Although these rules  vary by the type of sport played -- some are simple while others  are extremely complex -- basically, the same rules apply in each  sport regardless of where it is played. Since matches are played  with the same rules, they can generate tremendous enthusiasm in  players and spectators alike. In J League matches, although I  did notice violations of rules by some players, I was not  convinced the referee's application of rules was correct either.  This type of situation is creating a barrier to the  internationalization of Japanese soccer.    The key to internationalization lies in common rules and  fair  application of those rules. This is not limited only to the  field of sports. In order for all nations to compete and grow  together, healthy competition is essential. In the field of  economy, in order to prevent each country from making its own  rules and using these rules as an excuse to close its market to  other nations, GATT was created, a place where countries could  get together and establish common rules governing tariff and  trade. It was the United States which led the way, selling the  idea of GATT to the rest of the world. That same United States,  however, recently handed down its ruling concerning uniform  patent rules, a decision which clearly violates the principle of  internationalization. The U.S. has refused, for the time being,  to change its system based on the principle of granting patent  to the first to invent.    There are two types of patent systems, depending upon who  will be granted patent, viz., to the first to invent or to the  first to file an application. Although, at a glance, the system  granting the patent to the party who can prove it was the first  to invent appears logical; in practice, it is extremely  difficult to legally establish who really is the first to come  up with a given invention. The United States is the only country  among industrialized nations which still is using this system.  The system designed to grant the patent to the first to file an  application, on the other hand, simplifies examination and  authorization processes. This is the system adopted by most  advanced nations, such as Japan and Western European countries,  across the board.    Today, when technology is spreading across national borders,  if countries do not have a uniform patent system, it is not  possible to generate healthy competition in technological  fields. The patent tends to create various problems which hamper  internationalization, viz., examination setups, the duration of  patents, and application of patents in foreign languages. For  the past 10 years, the World Intellectual Property Organization  (WIPO) has been working on the creation of new international  rules by reconciling various countries' systems.    Based on the debate conducted at WIPO, a draft for the World  Patent Accord Convention was completed last year and was to be  adopted at a diplomatic conference. The focal point of the  conference was whether the United States would be willing to  change its "first-inventor" system. In response to the requests  of various countries, Japan has been preparing for changing its  setup by reducing the time required for examination and  submitting applications in English. Almost all requests made by  the United States to other countries have been accepted. Because  of the council's report, the Bush Administration was leaning  toward the "first-applicant" system.    The situation was changed overnight, however, when the  Clinton Administration took over. The shift to the first  applicant system was to be reexamined. In spite of the wishes of  the various countries which had been anxiously watching the  United States's move since last summer and waiting for its  response by postponing the diplomatic conference, the U.S.  recently decided to adhere to the "first-to-invent" system. The  firmly-rooted opposition of individual investors, academic  circles, and organizations (that do not have patent specialists  on their staff) to the "first-to-apply" system appeared to have  succeeded.    The realization of the patent convention, toward which the  world's advanced nations had devoted their efforts during the  past 10 years, once again has become remote. We realize that  changing the existing system of many years at the request of  foreign countries is bound to meet with strong resistance.  However, they should know that in the matter of patent systems,  all participating countries have made a concession of one kind  or another, thereby equally sharing the pains resulting from  such concessions without which new international rules could not  be written. Only by competing fiercely on the common ground, can  we develop superior technologies and achieve widespread use of  those technologies.    I wonder if the most recent ruling by the United States may  have the effect of pouring cold water, as it were, on the rising  trend of technological internationalization. The United States  had been edgy about the continuing copying of its technologies  and designs occurring in the developing nations. At the same  time, however, it had continued to give preferential treatment  to its own patent applications by going back and recognizing  pre-application dates as legitimate dates of inventions, whereas  with foreign applications field, they considered only the dates  of applications as the legitimate dates of inventions.    This may have been the reflection of the direction into  which  the Clinton Administration's technical policy is moving, viz.,  placing greater emphasis on industrial technology over science  and application development over basic research. To be sure, as  long as the present system is maintained, the chances are that  the United States most likely will have the upper hand in most  litigation concerned with intellectual property. It is a fact,  nevertheless, that the respect which the world had held for the  United States, a country which led the world in free competition  under the slogan of fairness, will be severely damaged, because  the situation is too much like a soccer game with one  participant playing with an advantage of not having an off-side  rule.</p>

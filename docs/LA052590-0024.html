			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> CATHIE WRIGHT, CHALLENGER WAGE EXPENSIVE PRIMARY BATTLE  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and her GOP challenger, Hunt Braly,  have poured nearly $400,000 since January into their bitter primary-election  battle, making it by far the most expensive San Fernando Valley-area race this  year, campaign reports released Thursday showed.  </P> <P> The reports -- the last before the June 5 election -- also showed GOP  congressional candidate Sang Korman outspent Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi  Valley) by more than 3 to 2 this year, aided by a $200,000 loan from himself to  his campaign, while raising less than half as much from outside contributors.  </P> <P> Wright, 61, reported spending $231,810 since Jan. 1 in her effort to win a  sixth term in the 37th Assembly District, which covers northern and western Los  Angeles County and portions of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. She raised  $130,805 in the same period.  </P> <P> Braly, 35, has spent $158,202 since the beginning of the year while raising  $139,518, including a $60,000 personal loan he made to his campaign, his  expenditure statement said.  </P> <P> The race has erupted into an expensive, high-stakes struggle as Wright tries to  fend off Braly's charges that she misused her official position by trying to  fix her daughter's traffic tickets.  </P> <P> The candidates have filled Republican mailboxes in recent weeks with half a  dozen slick brochures apiece attacking each other and touting their respective  platforms. The cost of the mailings represents about two-thirds of the  candidates' overall campaign budgets.  </P> <P> Wright spokesman Carlos Rodriguez charged that the fact Braly is loaning money  to his campaign "is a sure indicator" he lacks sufficient community support to  win. "When he has to loan himself money to run for public office . . . that's  pathetic," Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> Braly said he has taken in more money than "any other primary challenger in the  state" and that he has enough cash to wage a strong campaign.  </P> <P> Gallegly and Korman faced off two years ago for the GOP nomination in the 21st  Congressional District, which covers northern and western Los Angeles County  and southern Ventura County. In that race, Korman, a wealthy Korean-American  real estate developer, personally loaned his campaign $245,000.  </P> <P> Gallegly, a conservative first elected in 1986, reported raising $176,500 this  year and spending $98,623. His contributions included $25,498 from political  action committees representing special interest groups.  </P> <P> In addition to the $200,000 personal loan, Korman's report said he has raised  $73,446 since the beginning of 1990 from individual contributors, the majority  of them Korean-Americans. Korman's campaign spent $168,768 during the same  period.  </P> <P> Korman spokesman Brad Durrell said his candidate must spend significantly more  than Gallegly to overcome "the power of the incumbency."  </P> <P> "Challengers who win tend to spend more money," he said. "Mr. Gallegly gets  free newsletters, he gets free staff, he gets a free 800 number. He gets a lot  of perks to communicate with his constituents."  </P> <P> Spending reports also showed that Northridge real estate broker Paula Boland  has a heavy fund-raising lead in the five-candidate race for the GOP nomination  to succeed retiring Assemblywoman Marian La Follette (R-Northridge).  </P> <P> Boland has taken in $112,113 since Jan 1, while her nearest competitor, La  Follette aide Rob Wilcox, raised $56,634. Attorney Bob Scott reported raising  $52,274, including a loan from himself of $30,914.  </P> <P> Boland said her fund-raising lead "is like a victory. . . . I feel we've got a  win already." But Scott and a spokeswoman for Wilcox both said they have  sufficient money to run good campaigns.  </P> <P> Among the individuals and groups contributing to Boland were the California  Right to Life organization, wealthy Valley car dealer H.F. Boeckmann, and  Robert Wilkinson, a lobbyist for the proposed Porter Ranch development.  </P> <P> Another candidate, Hal Styles, said he spent $700. The fifth candidate, martial  arts teacher Al Thomas, could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

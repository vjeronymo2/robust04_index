			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpts] Members of Rwanda's interim government, formed  less than a week ago, are reported to have moved out of the  capital today, where there has been heavy shelling for the sixth  day running. [passage omitted]    RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] military spokesman, Dr.  Emmanuel Ndahiro, is at their headquarters in Mulindi in  northern Rwanda. Robin White asked him how much progress they  were claiming to have made.    [Begin recording] [Ndahiro] Part of our force that has been  heading toward Kigali is within and around Kigali. We are  holding about four positions within and around Kigali.    [White] And when did you capture these positions?    [Ndahiro] We started fighting (?there) in the morning and  just before midday, we had already taken those positions.    [White] And what is your objective? Are you trying to  capture Kigali at the moment or what?    [Ndahiro] We still feel Kigali is still in chaos; there is  no  order and the priority objective is to reestablish law and order  in that capital, and then we can think about what to do next.    [White] So, you are trying to capture Kigali?    [Ndahiro] We are being very cautious but ultimately, we are  moving into Kigali.    [White] Do you not think that that is likely to cause even  more bloodshed?    [Ndahiro] Inevitably, there will be bloodshed, but we shall  have at least stopped the force that is busy killing our people  and mainly killing the innocent civilians who are not armed.  So, if we can neutralize that force, the government force, that  is killing the people, we shall certainly stop fighting.    [White] You said this particular force. Which force do you  mean?    [Ndahiro] Specifically the (?first) force that is busy  liquidating the people is the Presidential Guard and certain  elements in the Gendarmerie. So until we achieve that primary  objective of making this force incapable of operating, we shall  not stop fighting.    [White] Have any people from the national Army defected to  your side?    [Ndahiro] We have had some who have been captured, not  necessarily defected, but in certain quarters we are told that  some forces are not ready to fight and they are only being  forced to fight. So, we feel that that is a potential force  that can come on to our side.    [White] You have been talking about Kigali, is there  fighting  going on any where else?    [Ndahiro] Yeah, fighting is going on in the northern part of  the country. We have so far, I would say, liberated most of  Mutara that is the eastern part of the country in the north. We  have gone far as Gabiro. Gabiro has fallen, it is in our hands  now. We had earlier seized [words indistinct] Nyumba, we are  shelling it. We hope to thrash other forces out, but the UN  monitoring force that is in Nyumba requested us to hold our fire  so that they could be able to evacuate their forces there, and  we complied for as long as they are evacuating their own.    [White] Do you really believe that you can win a military  victory?    [Ndahiro] I told you earlier that our intention is not a  military victory. We want to stop the senseless killing that is  going on in Kigali. [end recording]</p>

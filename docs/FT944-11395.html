			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / The US Goes to the Polls: The showdown in the states WASHINGTON Not since 1860 has a sitting Speaker of the House of Representatives lost an election, but Tom Foley, whom the Constitution ranks third behind the president, faces his toughest campaign since winning in 1964. Lawyer George Nethercutt has benefitted from the national anti-incumbent tide, and the cash from Republican groups outside the state. CALIFORNIA Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein was expected to cruise to re-election, but republican oil millionaire Michael Huffington is running her close after spending Dollars 16m on television advertising. Feinstein fought back, after Huffington was hurt by news that he employed an illegal immigrant as a nanny. Republican Governor Pete Wilson seems set for a second term. TEXAS Democratic Governor Ann Richards is still popular, and most voters say she is doing a good job. But she has faced a tough campaign against Republican George Bush, another son of the former president, and co-owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. However, Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison is having no trouble warding off Democrat Richard Fisher. TENNESSEE Democrats expected a battle to hold onto the Senate seat vacated by Vice President Al Gore. Congressman Jim Cooper, best known for his centrist healthcare reform plan, is trailing Republican lawyer/actor Fred Thompson. The Democrats are more surprised by the struggle for Senator Jim Sasser, who won with 65 per cent six years ago. FLORIDA Democratic Governor Lawton Chiles was elected to the Florida legislature in 1958 and has not lost an election since, but Jeb Bush has mounted a ferocious attack. Little divides the two in the polls, but the gulf is wide on issues such as immigration, crime and education, where Bush stands far to the right of his father, former President George Bush. VIRGINIA He has been convicted of lying to Congress over the Iran-Contra affair and denounced by fellow Republicans including former President Ronald Reagan, but Oliver North's Senate campaign rolls on with the backing of the Christian right wing. Democratic Senator Chuck Robb, once the darling of his party, has run a lacklustre campaign. PENNSYLVANIA Senator Harris Wofford's surprise victory in a 1991 by-election launched the debate about healthcare reform, but its defeat this year hurt him. Congressman Rick Santorum is way to the right of most Republicans who have won in Pennsylvania, but his opposition to gun control and calls for congressional reform have given him a narrow lead. NEW JERSEY Governor Christine Todd Whitman swept New Jersey last year with a promise to cut taxes, and the Republicans had hoped to repeat her victory in the Senate election this year. But Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg seems to have retaken the lead over Republican Chuck Haytaian. NEW YORK Governor Mario Cuomo faces a tough challenge in his bid for a fourth term. Republican George Pataki has the backing of a powerful political machine but little support of his own. Cuomo has struck back in recent weeks, however, winning the endorsement of Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York. MICHIGAN Democrats are on the verge of losing the seat to Spencer Abraham, a former aide to ex-Vice President Dan Quayle. Abraham appears to hold a narrow edge over Congressman Bob Carr, whose brand of inside-Washington pork barrel politics has failed to excite Democratic voters. Abraham is helped by Republican Governor John Engler's smooth ride to re-election. MINNESOTA Republican Senator Dave Durenberger's retirement seemed to offer the Democrats a good chance of winning a state from their rivals. But most polls show that Anna Wynia, a left-of-centre state lawmaker, trails Congressman Rod Grams, a right-winger who has campaigned against congressional privileges.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Oligov, Russian Federation Main </F> Protection Directorate (MPD) official, by Rodion Morozov in the  "Hello" column; place and date not given: "Vitruk Puzzles the  MPD"]    [Text] Constitutional Court acting chairman Nikolay Vitruk  told a press conference: The Main Protection Directorate [MPD]  needs reorganization. He suggested that it ill suits the MPD to  engage in operational activity and provide material supplies and  everyday services. OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's correspondent Rodion  Morozov phoned Andrey Oligov, an MPD representative.    [Morozov] How far does MPD jurisdiction extend?    [Oligov] Briefly, we are responsible for ensuring the  security of the president's residence -- the Kremlin (MPD chief  Lieutenant General Mikhail Barsukov is also Kremlin commandant),  the president himself, and also a specially defined circle of  state officials. The MPD also includes the traffic  [komendantskaya] service, the administrative service, and the  medical service. The MPD's aggregate strength, including the  presidential regiment, is approximately 6,000. To compare: In  the United States the security service numbers up to 33,000  people.    [Morozov] How is the range of persons needing your  "services" established?    [Oligov] The list of these people is prepared in accordance  with a presidential edict.    [Morozov] Are members of the Constitutional Court among  them?    [Oligov] In the past, we also ensured their protection. At  the same time, certain measures were undertaken to minimize  threats with respect to the justices: and there were such  threats. Who ensures the security of the constitutional  justices, I do not know, but it's not us. In its time the  Russian Federation Supreme Soviet's Committee on Defense and  Security drafted a Russian Federation law on state protection of  Russian legislative and executive power bodies and top state  officials. It was envisioned that protection of all the three  branches of power will be entrusted to a single body -- the Main  Protection Directorate. And then, organized with it should be a  presidential security department, an executive security  department, a legislative security department.... But the law  was never adopted....    [Morozov] How would you respond to the "charge" of engaging  in operational activity?    [Oligov] The operations department has always been organic  to the MPD; and this is justified. The law on operational and  investigative activity also extends to the MPD. Otherwise, how,  without a corresponding operational apparatus, can we possibly  monitor information about threats with respect to government  officials?    [Morozov] And still, how extensive are the powers of your  operations department? Do its officers have the right to tap  somebody's telephone or monitor his apartment or detain a  suspect?    [Oligov] No. If we pursue a plan involving terrorist  intentions, we do this in "linkage" with the Prosecutor's Office.    [Morozov] What about the "provision of material supplies and  everyday services"?    [Oligov] Here, honestly, I find it hard to understand  Vitruk. The MPD is tasked to maintain order at the  [presidential] residence. To this end it is necessary to have  an administrative unit as part of it. There is a team of  construction workers, naturally civilians, who engage in  maintenance and modernization of particular buildings and  premises. Whatever else was meant, I cannot even imagine.</p>

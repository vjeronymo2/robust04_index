			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Boots blamed for high-cost lens solutions and it is far too high, according to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which yesterday found that consumers have been over-charged for contact lens solutions. More than 2m people in Britain wear contact lenses and have to spend between Pounds 110 and Pounds 205 a year each on products to clean and disinfect them. The monopolies commission's report said the market, worth Pounds 91m at retail prices, provided some of the fattest profits in pharmaceuticals manufacturing and retailing. The commission found the market had been restricted by government regulations which required solution manufacturers to obtain a licence, and limited retail sales to chemists and pharmacies. The rules had slowed product innovation and impeded price competition. A complex monopoly had developed among retailers generally. But the commission blamed high prices mainly on Allergan, the leading manufacturer, and Boots, the biggest retailer of solutions, which had exploited scale monopolies. The commission had no evidence that UK prices were above those elsewhere in Europe but it said that the practices of the two companies practices had kept prices higher than they would otherwise have been. Allergan, which supplied 38 per cent of solutions in the UK, had earned an average return on capital of 102 per cent in the past five years - twice the average in the UK industry. The MMC said Allergan and other manufacturers had benefited from weak retail competition, which had reduced pressure on suppliers to cut prices. The commission found that no other manufacturers were illegally exploiting monopoly power, however. The report's most scathing criticism was of Boots, the UK's largest chain of chemists. Boots had 36 per cent of all solution sales last year, earning gross profit margins between 50 per cent and 61 per cent - well above the average on its overall retail sales. Although Boots used its purchasing power to buy cheaply from manufacturers, it failed to pass on the benefits. It sold branded solutions at recommended retail prices and had only small reductions on own-label products. Boots had also tried in 1990 to prevent price cutting by optician Dollond &amp; Aitchison. CV-UK, the second largest supplier, told the MMC that Boots had informed it that unless Dollond raised prices, Boots would cut its own and expected CV-UK to pay for any erosion in its margins. The commission recommended that the sale of solutions be opened to all retailers. It also urged the government to implement quickly a European Community directive intended to allow the freer cross-border supply of the products. The commission suggested that if the government rejected its proposals a price cap should be placed on Allergan's products and Boots should be compelled to cut the prices of branded solutions to at least 10 per cent below recommended retail prices.

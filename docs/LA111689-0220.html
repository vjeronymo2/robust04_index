			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE MAKING GAINS IN MEMORY STUDY  </P> <P> Much about the workings of memory remains mysterious. But scientists are  learning more about its biology and operation.  </P> <P> "You can think of memory, or remembering, as a set of mental events very  similar to perception," said Fergus Craik, of the University of Toronto.  </P> <P> When we perceive something, our brains take in information from our senses and  compare it with our storehouse of knowledge -- our memories -- in order to make  sense out of the information and act on it.  </P> <P> When we try to remember something without input from our senses, he said, "we  try to reconstruct from the inside some faint copy or simulation of the  processes that went on at the time of the original perception.  </P> <P> "Sometimes it is very literal -- a face, or the layout of a room. In other  cases, it is not so much the surface aspects, but what we abstracted from the  perception," for example, whether it was good or bad, threatening or benign.  </P> <P> Scientists no longer believe that whole memories are tucked away like file  folders in four or five cells at a discreet location in the brain. That idea  originated in now-discredited experiments with patients who reported vivid  childhood memories when surgeons touched points in their brains with tiny  electrodes.  </P> <P> Modern imaging of brain cell electrical activity and blood flow, Craik said,  shows that "it's more accurate to think of memory as being widely distributed  within the brain, probably with a tremendous amount of overlap . . . just as  perception is a very widespread activation in the brain. There's a network of  neurons which, when activated, will give us the experience of remembering."  </P> <P> Individual brain cells, or neurons, probably play a role in a variety of  perceptions and memories, he said, much as the 26 letters of the alphabet can  be combined with others to form hundreds of thousands of words. With billions  of brain neurons to work with, "we've got, for all practical purposes, an  infinite number of combinations of neurons."  </P> <P> Just how we manage to activate a precise combination of neurons to dredge up a  memory isn't clear. Certain pathways are "hard-wired" at birth, but most seem  to be established through the interworking of the senses and experience through  the learning process.  </P> <P> "Once a particular network of neurons becomes associated with some meaning or  experience, by whatever means the network is activated, it will again give rise  to one experience and to some extent the meaning," Craik said. "We build up our  perceptual world from there."  </P> <P> New experiences can "color," alter or rearrange the old memory pathways,  adjusting them to fit the new information. The neural connections are also  vulnerable to damage and decay.  </P> <P> Brain surgery, alcohol, distractions, injury and strokes can wipe out parts of  memories, or the capacity to process memories. And memory loss is a natural  part of aging.  </P> <P> Pharmaceutical companies are engaged in a billion-dollar race to develop drugs  that will enhance brain cell performance, Craik said. But "at present , there  is nothing that everybody agrees really works."  </P></p>

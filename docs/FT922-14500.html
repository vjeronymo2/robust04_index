			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Diesel share of car sales grows AMID the gloom of the UK new-car market, diesel cars have emerged as one of the few growth segments in the prolonged recession. Demand for diesel cars has continued to rise, in sharp contrast to the steep fall in overall new-car sales. The share captured by diesel-engined cars has doubled in the past two years. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that the diesel share of the UK new-car market jumped to a record 11.2 per cent in the first two months this year from 8.8 per cent in the whole of last year and only 4.6 per cent in 1988. According to leading car producers, demand has been boosted by the introduction of diesel cars that can match the performance and refinement of similar petrol-engined models. Significant progress has been achieved in both diesel-engine and fuel technology, and those advances have been added to the traditional attractions of diesel cars, such as fuel economy - diesel cars use about 20 per cent less fuel than petrol-engined cars - higher second-hand values, and greater durability and reliability. Diesel cars have also started to make a significant breakthrough in the company-car sector. Measures signalled in the Budget might bring a further boost to diesel demand if the promised reforms of the system for taxing company-car benefits are imple-mented. Changes in fuel duty in the Budget have already widened the favourable differential between diesel and leaded petrol prices. In the two years since 1989, sales of new diesel cars in the UK have risen by 13.3 per cent from 123,345 in 1989 to 139,810 last year. In the same period, overall new car sales have fallen by 30.8 per cent from a record 2.3m in 1989 to only 1.59m last year. Peugeot, the French carmaker which includes Citroen, has made the biggest gains, and the new-found popularity of diesel cars is having a significant effect on other carmakers in the UK new-car market. With its combined Peugeot and Citroen marques, the French carmaker accounted for 43.5 per cent of all diesel cars sold in the UK last year. It also supplies diesel engines to Rover, the British Aerospace subsidiary, for its Rover 200/400 series. The Peugeot brand alone boosted its share of the diesel new-car market to 31.2 per cent last year from 25.2 per cent in 1990 and accounted for three of the five best-selling diesel cars in the UK. The big jump in UK diesel car sales is bringing the British market more into conformity with sales patterns in leading Continental markets.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Hiroki Fukuta] </F>   [Text] Jerusalem, 4 May -- Commenting on Justice Minister  Shigeto Nagano's remark that the 1937 Nanjing atrocity [Nankin  gyakusatsu] is a fabrication, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa,  who is visiting Israel, told a group of Japanese correspondents  on 4 May: "Japan should be engaged in soul-searching over its  past act of aggression. If the justice minister's remark has  caused a misunderstanding among Japan's neighboring nations, as  foreign minister I will work to dispel that misunderstanding."</p>

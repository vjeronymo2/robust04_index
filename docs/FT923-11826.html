			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A LARGE deal in the traded options sector boosted turnover, enlivening an otherwise featureless day in the derivatives markets, writes Joel Kibazo. Following light dealing at the opening, traded options were featured by a big trade in British Petroleum when broker Strauss Turnbull, said to have been acting for Lehman Brothers, 'crossed' 20,000 of the July 160 calls. There was speculation in the market that the deal had been carried out for tax purposes. British Aerospace was the second most active stock option with 1,909 contracts dealt, BZW being a strong buyer of the November 260 calls, the day's busiest series. Total turnover in traded options reached 46,759 contracts, with 5,002 lots transacted in the FT-SE 100 option. In stock index futures, the FT-SE contract for September delivery experienced a volatile session. With economic worries continuing, independent traders led the contract down and it fell to a day's low of 2,411. Bargain hunters prompted a turnround and, by noon, September had reached its peak of 2,440 before drifting back. It finished at 2,424, up 8 from the previous close but 7 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover, at 8,120 contracts, was reasonable.</p>

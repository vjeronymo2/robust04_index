"The new bidding systems and contract procedures laid out in  the action program are internationally appropriate," in line  with the agreement reached at the Uruguay Round of world trade  talks, Hata said.    He then asked for support from all the government ministers  for "sincere" implementation of the program.    The program calling for introducing an open bidding system  on  public works projects to boost foreign access to Japan's  construction market, was approved at the morning cabinet meeting.</p>

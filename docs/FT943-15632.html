			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Buoyant hopes for August car sales Sales of new cars in August will exceed 475,000 - and may even match the 500,000 monthly record - the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday. The forecast came in the wake of statistics showing an 18 per cent sales rise last month. The peak of 500,112 sales was set in August 1989. The figure for August last year was 440,000.</p>

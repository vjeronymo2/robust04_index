			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- China's main leader Deng  Xiaoping has criticized President Jiang Zemin for attempting to  create his own faction to boost his power base, a Japanese  newspaper reported Tuesday [17 May].    The TOKYO SHIMBUN, quoting "reliable Chinese sources," said  the 89-year-old Deng had been grooming Jiang, 67, as the central  figure in a group leadership intended to succeed him.    But a recent departure from Jiang's previous "moderate  stance" sparked Deng's attack, according to the paper.    The paper quoted Deng as saying Jiang, a former mayor of  Shanghai, is trying to form a new "Shanghai group."    Deng cited Jiang's appointments of top police and military  personnel, saying they were made without his being informed, the  paper said.    Among those cited was the appointment early last year of  Jiang's associate Ba Zhongtan to the post of commander of the  Chinese people's armed police forces.    The paper quoted the sources as saying Deng spoke of the  need  to fill posts from among candidates "sought on a nationwide  basis without building factions."    Deng fears Jiang's actions could split the Chinese Communist  Party, it said.    Jiang visited Shanghai for 11 days from April 26, apparently  to carry out an inspection tour. The sources quoted by the  newspaper, however, claimed the visit was part of an attempt by  Jiang to strengthen his power base after being criticized by  Deng.    Jiang served as mayor of Shanghai between 1985 and 1987 and  as secretary of the Chinese Communist Party's Shanghai Municipal  Committee between 1985 and 1989. During that time he became  associated with Ba, who was responsible for security in the  Shanghai region.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (14): Award-winning strategy  -User case study, Leeds Permanent Building Society No chief executive? No worries, if the latest results of the Leeds Permanent Building Society are anything to go by. Anyone examining Leeds' promising 1994 results might be forgiven for thinking that its board's 18-month long search for a new chief executive is almost irrelevant: the UK's fifth largest building society is already in good hands. Moreover, according to John Miller, executive director in change of information systems, the Leeds is setting its sights wider, and higher, than being just the the fifth largest building society. 'If you look at it in terms of the wider competitive base of banks, building society and insurance companies, then we're no longer in the top 10. Our strategy is to be the best provider of home and family services, and that mission is still valid.' Mr Miller is one of what he calls 'the troika' - the team of three executives left at the top when former chief executive Mike Blackburn left to take charge of the Halifax Building Society in February 1993. Under Mr Blackburn, the Leeds prided itself on innovation, and information systems came high on the agenda. The team he left in charge (all appointed from outside the mainstream of the building society world) has proved its worth, moving the Leeds forward in the aftermath of the recession. The Leeds has delivered record financial results and developed innovative ventures such as Leeds Life, the new life insurance company, and Leeds Unit Trust, an in-house unit trust company, in the caretaking hands of financial director and acting chief executive, Roger Boyes. A year ago the Leeds' brief flirtation with the National &amp; Provincial came to nothing, and it has continued to re-inforce its own brands, such as Liquid Gold and the Home Arranger, with extensive television advertising. In the 1993 annual accounts and directors' report, Mr Boyes put on record (and up-front) his belief in the need to change, and keep changing: 'If we are serious about putting the customer first, then nothing about the way we do things, the way we're organised or the products and services we offer can remain unchallenged.' Commercial director, Chris Chadwick oversaw the business process management initiative, which asked staff to participate in an overhaul of procedures, with the aim of making the entire organisation more responsive to customers' needs. More than 7,000 suggestions for improvements were forthcoming, according to Mr Chadwick - 'some have been small and incremental, others have meant re-engineering our systems.' A big re-engineering process has already taken place over the last year with the development of a unified customer database, the first step in customer-focused services. Bringing about the change in information systems is John Miller's job. Although there was a strong technical emphasis when Mr Miller arrived at the Leeds three years ago, he found an IT department that waited to be told its role - 'the organisation was in technical response mode. The IT people regarded their jobs as translating the needs into a technical solution, not actually identifying the needs.' Leeds' operational systems, explains Miller, had to be re-aligned 'to recognise customers as individuals, rather than a series of account numbers.' As in many financial institutions, there had been significant investment in separate applications, running on different computers. Mortgages, savings accounts, such as Liquid Gold, and general and life insurance, were all separate products, with account numbers which attached the customer to that particular product, regardless of other products or services. There were 4.3m customers, but 7m customer records. The aim was to create a unified, customer-oriented database which would enable the Leeds to recognise its customers as users of multiple services, and to satisfy their needs in different areas by cross-selling further services and new products. Olivetti, Unisys, and IBM, and BT were already the main technical partners. The IBM mainframe-based mortgage package had been augmented in 1990 by a Unisys-based package of software and hardware. In the late 1980s, more than 420 branches had already been automated and networked using Olivetti's IBIS cashiering and counter-top applications, running on linked PCs. The branches had to retain the ability to give instant decisions an important element in a competitive market - 'we put the emphasis on a strong service proposition, such as the Home Arranger,' says Mr Miller. 'At the moment of truth, eyeball-to-eyeball with the customer, the person in the branch has to have the ability to say yes, without referring things elsewhere.' Mr Miller's strategy was to build on the existing Olivetti workstations that already provide all the familiar front-end facilities in the branches, with IBM's DB/2 relational database in the background. It 'slid in' to replace the former IDMS, so that end-users in the branches did not even realise there had been a change, apart from having more facilities. 'The DB/2 database meant we could look at the customer and tell all the products - mortgage, visa card, unit trusts, whatever - they were using. First, it gives you cross-selling ability, secondly you can be more responsive to individual customer needs.' Information systems played no small part in the break-off in negotiations with National &amp; Provincial a year ago: it would have been impossible to integrate the two product lines and supporting systems. Leeds takes pride in its robust attitude to IT as a servant, not a master. This year it became the first UK building society to achieve full Iso 9000 accreditation. It has won the Alan Taylor Award for information systems training, and won the British Computer Society Hay Award for excellence in IT management. One of Mr Miller's tasks has been to lower unit operating costs, and concentrate on service satisfaction. A possible route forward is document management - about to be piloted in one specific area. 'We're not just automating what's happening at present, but answering a different question: 'Can we do it differently, and improve productivity by an order of magnitude?',' he says.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks affected by poor results Wall Street Blue chip stocks gave ground yesterday after Chevron and Eastman Kodak released disappointing second-quarter results, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 6.16 lower at 3,735.68, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.89 at 453.36. Activity remained light, with only 231m shares traded on the Big Board. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite inched 0.44 ahead to 434.50, but the Nasdaq composite was 0.66 easier at 715.45. Stocks failed to break out of their aimless drift amid continued uncertainty over monetary policy. For the most part, share prices meandered as investors waited for the Federal Reserve to make good on its chairman's veiled threat to lift interest rates again in the near future. Some of the day's economic news was supportive of the view that the Fed could delay its next credit tightening. The Conference Board, an industry trade group, said its July index of consumer confidence dipped from the previous month's reading, suggesting the potential for slower retail sales. But the data, in line with expectations, had no impact on sentiment, with economists looking ahead to Friday's preliminary estimate of second-quarter growth, a report which could prove crucial in the Fed's decision-making. Bond prices held steady as uncertainty over short-term rates complicated an afternoon supply auction. Meanwhile, news from the corporate sector was generally lacklustre. Among the Dow industrial components, Eastman Kodak revealed a 27 per cent decline in net earnings from continuing operations and its share price was marked down Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 48. Chevron held up a little better, even though its second- quarter profits of 40 cents a share compared poorly with a year-earlier result of 87 cents. The stock closed down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 43. Earnings news in aerospace and defence sectors was mixed. Boeing slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 45 1/2 . Its results were not as bad as analysts had forecast, but investors were hardly impressed by its performance. Martin Marietta dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 43 3/8 , while Loral jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 34 7/8 . A sharp downturn in profits and revenues at Lincoln National, an Indiana-based insurance company, sent its share price reeling. The issue dropped nearly 11 per cent, or Dollars 4 5/8 , to Dollars 38 1/4 in unusually heavy volume of 1.6m shares. Shares in Jones Apparel lost 21 per cent of their value, with the stock dropping Dollars 6 3/4 to Dollars 24 3/8 following a downgrading by UBS Securities. UAL, parent of United Airlines, tumbled Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 99 7/8 in the wake of the surprise resignation of a union official who was one of the architects of the recent employee buy-out of the carrier. On the Nasdaq, Powersoft, a software concern, was hammered amid concern over its gross margins. The issue tumbled Dollars 7 1/2 to Dollars 43 even though it matched expectations. Canada Toronto share prices fell in light trading, with market attention again focused on the release of second-quarter financial results. The TSE-300 composite index ended 18.49 points, or 0.44 per cent, lower at 4,149.90. Declines led advances 423 to 298, volume of 56.13m shares was up from yesterday's 41.60m. Trading value was CDollars 651.0m compared with CDollars 465.0m. Two large companies, Northern Telecom and Stelco, both reported second-quarter net profit compared with a year-earlier loss. Northern Telecom, whose year-earlier loss included a hefty restructuring charge, rose CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 43 1/4 . Stelco A, however, lost CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 8 3/8 . Mexico Equities rallied to a sharply higher close after investors, relieved by stronger than expected earnings results, drove the bolsa's IPC index through two key resistance levels, traders and analysts said. The IPC finished up 79.46 points at 2,393.40 for a gain of 3.43 per cent. 'Investors were partly responding to earnings reports,' a trader said. Grupo Carso's results were better than anticipated as were several others. The buying helped the IPC pierce two resistance levels, at 2,350 points and at 2,380 points.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Siam City Cement sales increase Siam City Cement, Thailand's second-biggest cement producer, said foreign exchange profits and increased cement sales sharply raised its first-quarter earnings, Reuter reports. Siam said net after-tax profit rose to Bt620.2m, or Bt3.18 a share, from Bt299.5m, or Bt1.54 a year ago. It said the strong results could also be attributed to a corporate decision to delay taking depreciation and interest payments charges for its fifth cement kiln.</p>

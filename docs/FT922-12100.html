			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: Pilkington quits US auto glass market PILKINGTON, the glassmaker, yesterday announced it was to quit the US retail market for automobile glass by swapping its 70 retail stores for 22 wholesale distribution warehouses owned by TCG International Inc (TCGI) of Canada. Pilkington said it would pay TCGI an undisclosed amount to balance the deal but the cost would be lower than 5 per cent of consolidated net assets, or less than Pounds 100m. The TCGI warehouses will be added to the 57 wholesale centres operated throughout the US by Libbey-Owens-Ford, a Pilkington subsidiary.</p>

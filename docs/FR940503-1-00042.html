			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regional Administrator must provide the legal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factual basis for any modification of the recommended decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Withdrawal of the penalty assessment, which does not constitute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final Agency action, occurs without prejudice to the Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any order issued by the Regional Administrator becomes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective thirty days after issuance, unless either the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Appeals Board (the Board) suspends the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of the order pursuant to its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sua sponte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority, or a judicial appeal is taken pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 113(d)(4) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board, on behalf of the Administrator, is authorized to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review the decisions of Regional Administrators,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sua sponte, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues of law. The Board may not review fact-finding; second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guess the penalty amount issued by the Regional Administrator; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overturn orders issued on consent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board may withdraw a Regional Administrator's order if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it determines that the Agency lacks jurisdiction to assess a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty, or if it determines that the Respondent is not liable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under applicable law. The Board shall remand an administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order if it determines that elements of the Respondent's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability are different from those found by the Regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator. Under such a remand, the remedy should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformed to the amended conclusions of law. The order shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also be remanded if the Board finds that the order fails to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide clear reasons for the decision. The Board shall allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Regional Administrator's order to issue unchanged if it finds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the order is legally sufficient and it agrees with all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material conclusions of law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within thirty days after the penalty assessment becomes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final, the Respondent may appeal to the appropriate United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District Court.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Procedural Due Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted previously,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mathews <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eldridge <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of three factors in evaluating whether the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative procedures satisfy the Fifth Amendment's due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process requirements. The relevant factors are: (1) The private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest that will be affected; (2) the risk of an erroneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deprivation of this interest and the probable value, if any, of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and (3) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Government's interest including the function involved and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiscal or administrative burdens that the additional procedural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements would entail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The private interest at stake is payment of a civil penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The maximum amount that may be assessed, $5,000 per day of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation, is significantly less than the penalty that may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed under the other civil penalty authorities in the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, EPA's proposed rules would establish a maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount that might be assessed in any one citation. It is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected that the actual penalties assessed per violation will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally be less than the statutory maximum. The circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected in the great majority of cases is a proper focus for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessing due process concerns.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chemical Waste Management, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S.E.P.A., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  873 F.2d 1477, 1484 (D.C. Cir. 1989). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the straightforward and simple hearing procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed would minimize the cost for private parties to contest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment of a field citation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The procedures proposed in this third option should minimize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the risk of an erroneous deprivation of property. Under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rules, a respondent would be served with a citation that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly identified the alleged violation and provided a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable opportunity to request a hearing. If a hearing was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested, it would be presided over by a neutral agency official  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that had no prior connection with the action, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigative or prosecutorial functions. The Presiding Officer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also would have no interest in the outcome of the action. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offers the respondent a hearing before a neutral and unbiased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tribunal, and clearly minimizes any risk of error from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional or other bias.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The parties have the right to discover, before the hearing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all the information necessary to provide for a fair and adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing. Parties may obtain the names of all witnesses that will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be presented, along with a brief description of the witnesses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifications and the subject matter of the testimony, and they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may obtain each document that will be introduced by the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> party. Since the violations involved will be minor in nature and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are expected to typically involve simple and straightforward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factual and legal circumstances, this should provide a respondent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with all the information needed to adequately contest a citation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the citation would typically have been issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately upon or shortly after the violation is detected,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing respondents with ample opportunity to investigate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances of an alleged violation. In these circumstances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional discovery would not be expected to significantly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advance the accuracy of the final decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

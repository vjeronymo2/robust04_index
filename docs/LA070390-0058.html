			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> E. GERMANS CROWD STORES BUT BUYING IS RESTRAINED  </P> <P> East Germany went shopping in the dazzling wonderland of Western consumerism  Monday, but the orgy of buying that many had predicted failed to occur.  </P> <P> In part overwhelmed by the spectacle itself, East Germans crowded into  department stores and shops in record numbers but seemed reluctant to part with  the spanking new deutschemarks they received Sunday as part of the German  economic, social and currency union.  </P> <P> Instead, many appeared content to stare, then touch and price the thousands of  Western items appearing in East Germany's retail stores for the first time.  </P> <P> "I think people will hang onto their money for a while," predicted an East  Berlin woman, Luzie Conrad.  </P> <P> She noted that East Germans have an ingrained habit of treating the West German  mark as a precious commodity to be used only with care.  </P> <P> The absence of a consumer scramble was greeted with a collective sigh of relief  by policy- makers in Bonn, the West German capital. They had been concerned  about the inflationary pressures an avalanche of East German consumer buying  might bring.  </P> <P> Prices on the Frankfurt stock exchange rose sharply on news of the low-keyed  East German consumer reaction, and the deutschemark rose in European trading.  </P> <P> "I'm impressed by the mood of the people and the mood in the stores," West  German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann told an East German television  interviewer during a visit to Dresden. "They are waiting."  </P> <P> Added West German government spokesman Dieter Vogel, "With the D-mark, they  have won their freedom as consumers. They'll be discerning consumers."  </P> <P> Initial figures from the West German Bundesbank also indicated that East  Germans withdrew only the equivalent of $2.8 billion from banks on Sunday, the  first day of the currency union. That figure was nearly a third less than the  expected amount of about $3.7 billion.  </P> <P> To head off any possible spending stampede, East Germans have been limited  under terms of the currency union to withdrawals totaling no more than the  equivalent of $1,250 each during the first week.  </P> <P> Several thousand East German workers in the Berlin area, mainly in the  important metalworking sector, staged brief work stoppages Monday to press  their demands for higher pay and fewer working hours.  </P> <P> Any major industrial unrest or sharp jump in East German wages in the coming  months could endanger East Germany's economic recovery and add significantly to  the cost of German unification, political and economic observers believe.  </P> <P> Monday's events came as one result of the state treaty between East and West  Germany that effectively united the two German economies by extending West  German business, financial and social laws, plus the deutschemark, to East  Germany. The treaty also ended border controls between the two states and set  them on the road to full political unification.  </P> <P> Like stagehands changing sets between acts of a play, East German retailers  spent last weekend in a frenzy of remodeling and restocking in advance of the  start of the country's new commercial era.  </P> <P> By the time stores opened Monday, the country had gone through a collective  face-lift, with bright Western packaging, creative window displays and colorful  products ranging from Reebok shoes to Christian Dior cosmetics that only hard  Western currency can buy.  </P> <P> Most retailers in East Berlin seemed to carry stocks consisting of 60% to 80%  of Western goods.  </P> <P> At a large stand in East Berlin's central Alexanderplatz, a young couple  wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the Lucky Strike logo handed out packs of the  American cigarettes along with a leaflet carrying the words, "Born in the USA."  </P> <P> Nearby, a van sold Western soft porn magazines.  </P> <P> Consumer caution seems to have been bolstered by uncertainty over jobs, as East  Germany's overmanned industry now will begin to slim down to compete with the  West.  </P> <P> Monday, however, East Germans were also curious and occasionally confused as  they came to grips with a completely new set of consumer goods most had seen  only on television or during brief visits to the West.  </P> <P> At a consumer electronics store in the Alexanderplatz, potential customers  seemed to spend most of their energies trying to understand how to operate  sophisticated Western television sets and come to grips with items such as a  Sony Walkman for the first time.  </P> <P> One customer who had come to buy an electric razor was unable to decide after  being confronted with a choice of several brands.  </P> <P> Only at supermarkets and food stores, where East German goods had gradually  disappeared in the days before the currency union, were there long lines of  active buyers as customers waited to restock their refrigerators.  </P> <P> Here, too, the choices were much greater than the food shoppers were used to,  but many of them complained bitterly about the fourfold to sixfold increases in  the price of some commodities, the result of the abolition of subsidies for  staple products such as bread, sugar and meat.  </P> <P> East German television news Monday night showed a young couple in Leipzig  intently discussing for nearly a full minute the pros and cons of buying a  single cup of yogurt at a supermarket.  </P></p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Butler's Wharf unit sold for Pounds 20m A DANISH pension fund has paid more than Pounds 20m for a warehouse development by Sir Terence Conran in Butler's Wharf, in London's Docklands, which went into receivership in December 1990, Vanessa Houlder writes. The administrative receivers, Mr Nigel Hamilton and Mr Alan Bloom of Ernst &amp; Young, said it was the first large deal on Butler's Wharf in what was expected to be a series of disposals. The building, which includes 88 flats, office space and a restaurant, was bought by Kommunernes Pensionsforsikring of Copenhagen. The building is the largest of a group of converted Victorian warehouses on the 11-acre site by Tower Bridge. Sixty-five of the flats have been let.</p>

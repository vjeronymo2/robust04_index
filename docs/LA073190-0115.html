			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL EARNINGS: HEMACARE CORP. REPORTS LOSS IN SECOND QUARTER  </P> <P> HemaCare Corp., a Sherman Oaks company that provides blood-related services,  reported that it lost $295,576 in the second quarter that ended June 30,  compared to a profit of $27,804 a year earlier. The company's revenues  increased 31% in the second quarter to $1.87 million from $1.42 million a year  before.  </P> <P> HemaCare attributed the loss in part to the costs of beginning clinical trials  of a proposed AIDS treatment, called passive hyper-immune therapy. The therapy  involves treating AIDS patients with infusions of sterilized blood plasma from  donors who are healthy but are infected with the virus that causes AIDS. The  company also said that its 4-month-old HemaCare Clinical Laboratories division  lost money.  </P> <P> For the first six months of 1990, HemaCare lost $232,934, compared to a profit  of $206,802 last year.

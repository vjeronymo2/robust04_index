			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Boris Bolshakov, deputy head of the </F> Federal Counterintelligence Service Personnel Directorate, by  Aleksandr Dolinin; date, place not given: "Will You Join  Counterintelligence?" -- first paragraph is introduction]    [Text] The Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] was  set up recently as an autonomous organization. Our  correspondent spoke to Colonel Boris Bolshakov, deputy head of  the Personnel Directorate, about the specific nature of the FCS  and its problems.    [Dolinin] Boris Terentyevich, how is reform of your service  going and has its cadre potential been preserved?    [Bolshakov] The FCS is not living in a vacuum, it is  experiencing the effect of social development trends. There  have been fundamental structural changes in the course of  reorganization but no dramatic replacement of cadres; the  professionals have been retained. We are improving management  organization, we are being relieved of functions that do not  properly belong to us and duplication of functions and are  seeking out internal reserves. We are trying to preserve the  best traditions in line with the Constitution and the laws.    [Dolinin] How far have your organization's functions  changed? Who works in the FCS today?    [Bolshakov] The Border Troops have been assigned to an  autonomous structure, investigation subunits have been wound up,  and we have also been relieved of a number of functions  belonging to internal affairs organs, and there have been  considerable cuts in managerial structures. But in connection  with growing international exchange, there is more work in  ensuring economic security and preventing terrorism, sabotage,  smuggling operations, and the narcotics business. We have  embarked in earnest on improving information and analysis  activity. Consequently, there can be no talk of a sizable cut  in operational personnel. People who have completed their  prescribed period of service have been discharged. We have no  qualms about their future -- former counterintelligence  personnel are rated highly on the job market.    The counterintelligence service has 75,000 personnel today,  while the management apparatus numbers around 1,500. Forces and  funds will continue to be redeployed. For instance, the cuts in  the Armed Forces make it necessary to reorganize military  counterintelligence organs.    Our operational personnel have higher education and most  receive thorough special training. Many speak foreign  languages. Rigorous selection and training are carried out at  FCS training establishments and individual training is provided  on the job.    [Dolinin] How does one get to serve in counterintelligence?    [Bolshakov] You will not find advertisements on the street  or in the newspapers regarding employment in counterintelligence  organs. Young people (Russian citizens) may be advised to apply  to territorial counterintelligence organs. Personal voluntary  recruitment can be as a servicemen or as a civilian. A contract  is concluded with the former. Candidates are carefully vetted  regarding their suitability for specific counterintelligence  work. Morals, honesty, decency, and ability to resist negative  influences go without saying. Health and physical fitness  requirements are also high.    [Dolinin] Are women employed in counterintelligence?    [Bolshakov] We have plenty of women working for us,  including officers and warrant officers. The range of these  posts will clearly expand.    [Dolinin] You mentioned incentives for cadres...    [Bolshakov] The work of personnel in the most "challenging"  areas attracts additional recognition; an "Honored  Counterintelligence Officer" badge has recently been introduced.  The officers who caught representatives of the British and  German special services red-handed and who stopped an attempt by  North Korean Embassy staffers to illegally buy state-of-the-art  Russian technologies were the first to receive it.    [Dolinin] Has the FCS become more open?    [Bolshakov] Counterintelligence leaders have begun to speak  out in the mass media more frequently. I consider it useful to  issue official reports on collegium sessions and FCS leadership  conferences. We give taxpayers information about the way their  money is spent. Studying public opinion helps make the  necessary adjustments to our work.    There are also plenty of fabrications about our work which  give rise to various rumors, conjecture, and suspicions  regarding counterintelligence. People try to blame it for  things that it has nothing to do with.    How can disinformation be countered? For instance, on the  initiative of the FCS director the stamp "For Official Use Only"  was removed from the document announcing the statute on our  service. It has been published in the open press.    [Dolinin] Boris Terentyevich, what is your service's  attitude to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA?    [Bolshakov] We consider your newspaper to be our own. Most  of our personnel subscribe to it. I would like us to have  regular businesslike ties.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bid deadline for Siddons is extended PACIFIC BBA, a subsidiary of BBA, the UK toolmaker, yesterday extended the deadline for its ADollars 86m (USDollars 58m) bid for Siddons Ramset, the Australian hardware and fasteners group, giving substance to speculation that the offer will soon be increased. Pacific BBA said the cash and paper offer would remain open until January 27, nearly two weeks after the original deadline. It said that acceptances had been received for 0.1 per cent of Siddons' stock. The extention will give Pacific BBA time to consider whether to raise its ADollars 1.81-a-share offer to match a rival ADollars 2 cash bid by WA Deutsher, an Australian subsidiary of Illinois Tool Works, the US engineering group. The WA Deutsher bid values Siddons at ADollars 94m. Mr Roger Flynn, Siddons' managing director, said the company was unsure whether the extension would lead to an increased offer.</p>

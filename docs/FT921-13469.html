			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Allies and opponents rally to defend Brooke POLITICAL opponents as well as allies rallied to the support of Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, in the Commons last night. Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Brooke's main adversary, was the first to argue that Mr Brooke's offer of resignation - later rejected by Mr John Major, the prime minister - should not be accepted. Many Conservative MPs nodded in agreement when Mr McNamara insisted that Mr Brooke's reluctant appearance as a vocalist on a Dublin television programme only hours after the murders of seven construction workers by the IRA should not be the cause of his departure from office. Mr McNamara said: 'In my humble opinion it never was - and should never be - regarded as a resigning matter.' He stressed that those who knew Mr Brooke admired his hard work and courage, and regarded his offer to resign as 'characteristically honest and courageous'. Another political opponent, Mr John Hume (SDLP Foyle), paid tribute to Mr Brooke's efforts to promote a settlement, and appealed to the prime minister to ensure that Mr Brooke continued to hold the Northern Ireland portfolio. Mr John Biffen (C Shropshire North), former leader of the Commons, said Mr Brooke's offer was 'entirely characteristic'. He said the House recognised the formidable qualities Mr Brooke brought to one of the most taxing government positions. Mr Merlyn Rees (Lab Morley and south Leeds), a former Northern Ireland secretary, insisted that Mr Brooke's resignation offer should 'not be considered'.</p>

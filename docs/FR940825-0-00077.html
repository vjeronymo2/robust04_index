			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Agency-specific rules must follow the provisions of the Circular unless OMB has granted the agency an exception for classes of recipients of awards from a particular requirement of the Circular (58 FR 62992, 62995). The terms of the Circular, however, permit Federal awarding agencies to make exceptions on an award-by-award basis without prior OMB approval and to apply less restrictive requirements in the case of small awards. Where a conflict exists between a provision of the Circular and a statute, the statute governs (58 FR 62992&hyph;93, 62995). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, HHS is publishing this interim final rule whose primary purpose is to incorporate the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 into HHS's grants administration regulation at 45 CFR part 74. Consistent with the Circular, this rule applies to HHS awards made to institutions of higher education, hospitals and other non-profit organizations. It also applies to such entities if they are recipients of subawards from States, and local and Indian Tribal governments administering programs under HHS awards. In keeping with the longstanding applicability of part 74, this rule also applies to awards to commercial organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule continues part 74's application to certain grants and agreements that HHS has with State governments under programs commonly referred to as ``entitlement programs.'' The specific programs covered are identified at 45 CFR 92.4 (a)(3), (a)(7), and (a)(8). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To make part 74 consistent with the Circular, the amendments eliminate those current part 74 provisions which have been superseded by the standards established in the Circular. However, other provisions, which have been part of HHS's longstanding grants policy, are retained because of their continuing import to proper stewardship of the award making administration and closeout process. These provisions do not have their foundation in the Circular. Neither are they inconsistent with it. In addition, the amended rule contains provisions reflecting certain deviations from the Circular which OMB has approved. All of these matters are discussed in further detail below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although HHS is publishing this rule as an interim final rule with an immediate effective date, it is also inviting comments from the public. First, the rule is being published as an interim final because we believe that OMB afforded the public ample opportunity to comment on its proposed revision to Circular A&hyph;110 which resulted in the final version of the Circular, on which this rule is chiefly based. However, comments are being invited because of the relationship of this interim final rule to our current part 74 and the discretion we exercised in implementing the Circular. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding our current part 74, we have retained in this interim final rule certain of its longstanding provisions which have not been subject to public comment for some time. We are deleting other of its provisions which we believe have been overtaken by the Circular or by other statutes (e.g., the Cash Management Improvement Act) or events (e.g., changes in technology). Because of the varied interests and perspectives of recipients of HHS awards, who operate under a broad array of HHS-administered programs authorized under a variety of different statutes, and comprise an extraordinarily diverse universe in terms of size of operations, level of funding received and purpose of award activity, we are inviting public comment on this aspect of the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to our implementation of the Circular, in general, we have faithfully followed its provisions. However, in several instances we have either elaborated on a provision or modified it to make it pertain more clearly to the HHS environment or for other reasons. Also, we have exercised the discretion which the terms of the Circular afforded federal agencies in deciding how to handle certain matters; for example, whether unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of a recipient's matching contributions (Circular section  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .23 (b), (58 FR 62992, 62997)) or whether recipients should be subject to certain prior approval requirements (Circular section  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .25 (c) (2) and (5), (f) (58 FR 62992, 62998&hyph;99)). We are, therefore, inviting public comment to determine whether any further substantive or other changes to part 74 may be necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion of the Interim Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments to part 74 revise the current subparts A through F; remove current subparts G through AA; add a new appendix A; and delete appendixes G and H, which contained procurement standards from previous versions of OMB Circulars A&hyph;102 and A&hyph;110. No changes are made in existing appendix E, concerning cost principles for hospitals, and appendixes I and J, concerning audits; therefore, those provisions continue as codified and are not republished here. Similarly, the status of appendixes B through D and F remains ``reserved.'' The Authority citation has been corrected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Inchcape's slow puncture The market grew so excited about Inchcape's overseas earnings after sterling's devaluation it blinded itself to the countervailing margin squeeze that stemmed from the rising yen. By virtue of its big Toyota distributorship, Inchcape resembles a proxy Japanese company. Yesterday's 5 per cent fall in Inchcape's shares prompted by disappointing interim results was the penalty for such oversight. Inchcape did well to offset the margin pain by driving for extra volume, helping Toyota increase its UK car sales by 43 per cent. Moreover, the margin pressure should ease once higher car prices are absorbed by the UK market and Toyota steps up its manufacturing output from Derby. Nevertheless, the strong yen will continue to depress Inchcape's second half. Throw in the sharp drop in demand from mainland Europe and recent Chinese austerity measures, and Inchcape's immediate prospects grow still duller. The company's recent acquisitions, which contributed just Pounds 400,000 of operating profit on sales of Pounds 47.3m, add an edge of concern. A variety of setbacks in Japanese brewing, Malaysian consumer goods, and Australian motors provide a few more worries. That said, Inchcape's long-term appeal as a well-managed means of riding the Chinese economic wave remains undiminished. That alone should limit the fall in the shares. But these results serve as a useful reminder that distributors can face a particularly painful crush when manufacturers' margins are squeezed.</p>

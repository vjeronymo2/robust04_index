			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian Vice Premier on Foreign Economic  Activities Valentin Landik told INTERFAX-Ukraine that he had  applied to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk for resignation  today in the morning. Landik stressed that he had made this  decision in order to conform with the law, which does not permit  Supreme Soviet deputies to work in a government department.    Commenting on the results of his activities in the  government, Landik stated that Ukraine's foreign trade balance  had been significantly improved and its export had increased  several times. "We must stimulate export and limit import by all  means. We can do without Snickers. We need import for our  industry," he said.</p>

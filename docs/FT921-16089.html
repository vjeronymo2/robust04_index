			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Red Army tries to stay on the sidelines THE once-mighty Soviet army is striving to avoid being dragged into the fighting in Georgia in spite of increasing attacks on its men which are severely testing its patience, Reuter reports from Tbilisi. The army, reduced to virtual helplessness after 70 years of Soviet rule in Georgia, remains neutral in fighting between President Zviad Gamsakhurdia and rebel groups besieging him in his parliament. Colonel Vassily Belchenko, aide to the commander of the army's Transcaucasian district, said four soldiers and one officer had been killed by gunmen since fighting began in late December. The army, now effectively controlled by Russian president Boris Yeltsin, fights back where it can. But any serious intervention by army forces, whether sanctioned by Moscow or the result of an internal mutiny, could have disastrous consequences for efforts to create a Commonwealth of Independent States from the ruins of the old Soviet Union. The Russian-dominated army is still seen by most republics as a central threat. Meanwhile the Tbilisi garrison can only sit and watch as a few hundred or at most a few thousand men and youths destroy the picturesque city centre building by building.</p>

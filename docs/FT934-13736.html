			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Profits at Citicorp rise 18% in third term CITICORP, the largest US banking group, yesterday reported an 18 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings compared with the previous three months. The result reflects improvements in the credit quality of its loan portfolio. While pointing to a further improvement in the bank's capital and reserves, Mr John Reed, chairman, added: 'The best news in our results was in credit costs, which are declining more rapidly than we had expected, and in the improvement in the quality of our portfolios.' During the three months, net income rose to Dollars 528m, or 97 cents a share, from Dollars 446m, or 82 cents, in the previous three months and Dollars 116m or 17 cents in the third quarter of 1992. Commercial credit costs in the third quarter were Dollars 233m, down from Dollars 297m in the second three months of the year, while credit costs on consumer lending were Dollars 665m, down from Dollars 708m. Trading income, which in previous quarters had provided the fastest-growing source of revenues, amounted to Dollars 478m, down from Dollars 572m in the previous three months but ahead of the Dollars 451m of the 1992 third quarter. Income from foreign exchange trading fell by nearly a third, to Dollars 245m from Dollars 352m, while securities trading revenues rose marginally to Dollars 233m. Through retained earnings and the sale of new preference shares, Citicorp lifted its key tier one risk-adjusted capital ratio to 6 per cent at the end of September, from 4.3 a year before. This was still below the 7 per cent to 8 per cent targeted by the bank in the medium term. BancOne, one of the fastest growing super-regional banks, reported net income of Dollars 284.9m, or 82 cents a share, in the third quarter, up slightly from Dollars 281.9m in the previous three months and Dollars 245.7m, or 70 cents, in the third quarter of 1992.</p>

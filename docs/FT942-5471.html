			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Chill blows in from the west: Even though inflation pressures still seem low, FT writers say pessimists are in the ascendant in European bond markets Despite the summer sunshine, a deep chill has descended over the European capital markets. Fears of renewed inflation have crossed the Atlantic, making an unexpected and disturbing entry in Europe's financial centres. Across the continent, bond prices in the past month have suffered the steepest fall since early 1990, when markets were unnerved over the prospective economic impact of German unification. Amid widespread concern about sharply rising money supply growth in Germany, the sell-off has brought long-term bond yields in Europe's most powerful economy to slightly above levels in the US. Hopes have evaporated that Europe could be shielded from the long-term interest rate rise in the US after the Federal Reserve started tightening credit in February. Since economic recovery in Europe is still only hesitant - in contrast to the US, now in the fourth year of upswing - the sharp rise in long-term interest rates has come at a difficult time. Unemployment in the European Union is a record 11 per cent. Reflecting the turbulence, 10-year bond yields in Germany closed yesterday at 7.07 per cent, up by 0.24 points compared with the previous week and 1.52 points compared with the end of last year. Yields on UK government bonds (gilts) were up nearly 2 points compared with the end of last year, while those in France rose 1.70 points. Investors and traders have been badly unsettled. 'It's still gory out here,' says Mr Sanjay Joshi, chief bond economist at Daiwa Europe, the securities house, in London. 'Everyone is underwater.' Pressure on French bonds have mainly come from futures contracts. 'It is quite incredible,' said one Paris bond analyst. 'You could never have predicted these levels a few months ago.' An economist at a French merchant bank says: 'A lot of leveraged foreign investors, particularly in the US, have been pulling their money out of French and other European bonds.' Mr Christian Strenger, chief executive of Frankfurt-based DWS, the Deutsche Bank affiliate which is Germany's biggest fund management group, says fundamental economic factors do not justify the steep yield rise. But he adds: 'A lot of people have been badly hurt. It will be a little while before they get back into the game.' Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg, the merchant bank, is still more pessimistic. 'We are seeing a very aggressive and painful adjustment in real yields. This is a bear market that will have occasional fierce rallies. But basically the trend will continue over the next six to 12 months.' The interest rate squeeze spells bad news for European governments trying to fund large budget deficits on nervous and volatile markets. If it persists, the tightening could have repercussions for the European Monetary System, which has been performing relatively smoothly since the abandonment of narrow bands last August. International financial uneasiness has brought acute consequences for weaker-currency governments in Europe, penalised by financial markets for failures to control budget deficits. As investors fret about poor European economic convergence and the shrinking chances that economic and monetary union will take place by the initial 1997 target date, a gap in bond market yields between northern and southern Europe seems to have become permanent. The bond market shake-up could add to political pressures on several European governments. In Spain corruption scandals affecting the ruling Socialist party have prompted rumours of a possible downgrading of Spanish government debt. 'The fact that the Spanish market has fared worse (than other markets) has little to do with fundamentals and more to do with the political situation,' said Mr Jose Luis Feito of Madrid brokers AB Asesores. In a week of contradictory economic data, the markets have been ignoring good news and focusing on the bad. A post-unity inflationary fillip in Germany - one of the main reasons for upward pressure on European interest rates during 1990-92 - now seems to have ended. According to figures published this week, the annual rate of German price rises has fallen to 2.9 per cent, the lowest for three years. However, this development has been outweighed by worries about the Bundesbank's cuts in short-term interest rates in the past two months, in spite of soaring growth of M3 money supply. According to latest Bundesbank figures, which have been distorted by exceptional factors, annualised M3 growth in April was 15.8 per cent, well above the Bundesbank's 4 to 6 per cent target. This year is almost certain to be the third in succession in which the Bundesbank's money has been exceeded by a wide margin. Mr Thomas Mayer, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, in Frankfurt, believes the Bundesbank made a misjudgment in its latest  1/2 point cut in the discount rate in May. He predicts that 1994 growth in M3 money supply will be more than 10 per cent. 'This may or may not lead to future inflation but for market participants it is deeply unsettling. It would be reassuring if the Bundesbank would clarify its policy.' On a broader front, the tactics of the Bundesbank have attracted unusual criticism during the past fortnight. On May 23, ambiguous remarks by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, about a pause in cuts in interest rates  -later clarified as referring simply to its official rates rather than money market rates - depressed bond prices. Additionally, the Bundesbank has twice during the past fortnight cancelled auctions of short- and long-term German government bonds. The German finance ministry justified the delay on the grounds that its short-term financing needs had been fulfilled. But the Bundesbank's cancellations were widely interpreted as confirming that investors had no intention of returning to the market. Additionally, the Bundesbank's moves disrupted bond auctions in France, Spain and Italy - governments with considerable financing needs. For many analysts, this week's bond market fright has been excessive. In most of Europe, inflationary pressures are still thought to be low. 'I think that fears of a resurgence of inflation in Germany are overdone,' says Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at BHF Bank in Frankfurt. 'Our prediction is that inflation will be about 2 per cent throughout much of next year, and may even fall below that.' However, this week's worries over the Bundesbank's policies have been just one of the factors weighing on the markets. Signs of a slight pick-up in economic recovery in Germany and France - the subject of a confident communique from the Franco-German summit in Mulhouse on Monday - have added to bond market fears about higher interest rates in coming months. Growth in both France and west Germany may be 1.5 per cent or more this year. These rates of expansion are moderate by comparison with previous recoveries, but they are none the less higher than forecast earlier in 1994. In Britain, government bond prices fell particularly steeply in mid-week after release of data showing a 7.1 per cent rise in Britain's narrow M0 money supply in the 12 months to May. In Italy, Mr Antonio Fazio, governor of the Bank of Italy, issued a public warning to the new government about the risk of increasing inflation through measures to revive the economy. The biggest single concern for bond investors is the sheer weight of government debt. Because of the size of debt interest payments in all EU countries, this week's increase in interest rates will add to strains on budgets - offsetting the positive effect on government finances of the European economic recovery. In a speech this week, Mr Tietmeyer underlined that 1994 budget deficits across the EU would average more than 6 per cent of gross domestic product - slightly down from last year. Total public debt, on the other hand, would grow to more than 70 per cent of GDP. Mr Tietmeyer warned that governments could become 'impotent prisoners in a budgetary debt trap'. Fears like this have played a particular role in discouraging non-resident investors from buying European government bonds this year. Reflecting increasing globalisation of markets in recent years, a Salomon Bros study estimates that investors from abroad last year accounted for 73 per cent of net issuance of government bonds in Germany, 50 per cent in Italy, 48 per cent in Spain, 34 per cent in Denmark, 25 per cent in the UK and France and 22 per cent in Italy. Bond analysts report that US-based 'hedge funds', which were large buyers of European government debt last year, have recently stopped purchases. If, as many economists believe, German money supply figures show a marked slowdown in coming months, allowing the Bundesbank to resume interest rate cuts, the interruption in bond purchases by international investors could be overcome relatively quickly. On the other hand, as Mr Rolf-Gunther Thumann, a specialist on the German economy at Salomon Bros, points out: 'No one knows how M3 will behave. The uncertainty will not go away soon.' The nightmare for German policymakers is that M3 will continue to misbehave throughout the summer - intensifying fears among domestic German investors of a build-up in inflationary potential. Under these extreme circumstances, the Bundesbank might have little choice but to engineer an increase in interest rates during the summer - at a highly inopportune moment during the campaign for the German general elections in October. 'At the beginning of the year, the possibility that Germany would start to tighten policy was not on the agenda,' says one London bond analyst. 'But now things have changed.'

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> 3 STABBING SUSPECTS SURRENDER TO POLICE  </P> <P> Three local teen-agers, wanted in connection with a stabbing last weekend which  allegedly involved members of an Orange County skinhead gang, surrendered to  San Clemente police Tuesday.  </P> <P> Witness identification of a car license plate led police to three youths  suspected of involvement in a late-night confrontation Saturday which left one  man in critical condition with a stab wound in the chest, Sgt. Richard Downing  said.  </P> <P> Michael A. Bojorquez, owner of the car, and Jason B. Groves, both 18, were  charged with assault with a deadly weapon and released on their own  recognizance. A 16-year-old male also was booked on the same charge and  released to his parents.  </P> <P> The victim, Timothy Wayne Mudd, 21, of San Clemente, told police that he and  fellow San Clemente resident Jay Brody, 18, were walking on North El Camino  Real to a nightclub when occupants of a white Volkswagen yelled out "O.C.  Skins."  </P> <P> When Brody shouted back the name of another skinhead group, the Volkswagen  pulled into the parking lot of an Italian restaurant and three males jumped out  and attacked the two San Clemente men, Brody told police.  </P> <P> Mudd is recovering at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission  Viejo. Brody suffered minor injuries.  </P> <P> Groves, in an interview, said, "We were playing rap music real loud and they  hit Mike's (Bojorquez's) car with a rock." When they pulled over, he said, one  youth struck him.  </P> <P> Groves said he didn't see the stabbing and only learned about it as the three  were driving away. Groves said it happened in self-defense.  </P> <P> Police confirmed that two knives were found at the scene but were unable to  identify who owned them.  </P> <P> All five subjects have told police that they were or are members of a skinhead  gang, Downing said.

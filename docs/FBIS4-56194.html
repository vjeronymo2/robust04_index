			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Francisco Mendoza on statements by Cuauhtemoc </F> Cardenas, presidential candidate for Mexico's Democratic  Revolutionary Party, PRD, during a tour of Los Angeles on 27  April; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] Cuauhtemoc Cardenas said he has not noticed any U.S.  meddling in the Mexican electoral process and asked the Clinton  administration to continue to respect Mexican positions and  decisions. Cardenas said internal problems will be solved by  Mexicans themselves and added that if he wins the election, he  wants a mature, close, productive, respectful, and equal  relationship with the United States to solve bilateral problems.    Cardenas offered guarantees for investment to help generate  jobs and said he would promote changes in NAFTA to address  critical omission in that agreement, such as the immigration  issue. The PRD presidential candidate also pointed out that the  United States has reason to be concerned about instability and  the elections in Mexico because any negative event in Mexico has  an impact on U.S. social, economic, and political life.    Cardenas assured that he would assume total responsibility  for improving NAFTA. I am convinced, he added, that gradually,  through a dialogue between friends, we can find ways to modify  this agreement. It is a cornerstone for a new, imaginative  cooperation structure. Nevertheless, he indicated that his view  of NAFTA has not changed.    The presidential candidate said immigration issues are one  area where he has found critical omissions in the treaty. This,  he noted is not only the most important issue in the  relationship with Mexico, but it also has the greatest potential  for controversy. Cardenas criticized U.S. politicians who  exploit chauvinism and racism in their xenophobic campaigns  against Mexicans.    He said investment is important, but it is not the essential  ingredient for economic success. He stated that if Mexicans are  to live up to their potential, liberty and a state of law must  be guaranteed throughout the North American market. Cardenas  added that his main goal is to restore true democracy and  justice to a society that has been ruled for too long by  authoritarian decisions, patronage, and corruption.    As I reported this morning, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas also said he  supported the observance of the Mexican electoral process by  people abroad, by international observers. Cardenas said they  should be present not only on election day but that they should  already be in Mexico to learn about the whole electoral process.    In terms of the debate he will hold with other parties'  candidates, Cardenas said that tomorrow, the PRD will hold a  first meeting with Adolfo Aguilar Zinzer [newspaper commentator]  and representatives of the Institutional Revolutionary Party and  the PAN [National Action Party] to decide upon the terms of the  debate. Cardenas said there was a problem with the date fixed  for the debate but that they are willing to be flexible.    This is the general information in broad terms. Cuauhtemoc  Cardenas is currently meeting with members of the Mexican  community, PRD members in California, and Mexican-Americans  assembled in downtown Los Angeles. Several Los Angeles  personalities and leaders of the Democratic Party and of liberal  and so-called progressive organizations will attend an evening  event in Beverly Hills. Cardenas will meet early tomorrow with  LOS ANGELES TIMES and LA OPINION executives. Cuauhtemoc  Cardenas concludes his tour of Los Angeles tomorrow. He said no  other visits to the United States are scheduled in his political  campaign.</p>

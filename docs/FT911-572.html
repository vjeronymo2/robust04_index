			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Bessmertnykh hopeful on Middle East talks MR Alexander Bessmertnykh, the Soviet foreign minister, yesterday emerged from brief but unprecedented talks with Israeli leaders saying he believed there was a 'substantial' chance that efforts to convene Arab-Israeli peace talks would succeed. He is due to meet Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state and main leader of the peace bid, in Cairo tomorrow to review progress on a proposed Middle East peace conference, to be sponsored by Washington and Moscow, that would presage direct bilateral talks between Israel and its Arab foes. Mr Baker was on his way back to the region last night for the fourth time since the Gulf war ended, in what a senior White House official has described as 'one last trip' to see whether there is sufficient support to go ahead with a regional peace conference. This hint of impatience in comments by a senior national security adviser is intended to put pressure on both Israel and Arab countries to make compromises so that such a conference can go ahead. Like Mr Baker, Mr Bessmertnykh expressed the belief that a genuine prospect for peace talks still existed, without offering any indication of progress on the obstacles remaining. 'I have a hope - not yet at the level of full confidence - but I hope that further contacts will make it possible to move forwards to peace negotiations,' he told a press conference. He acknowledged that the key question of who should participate in the negotiations had yet to be resolved. Moscow backs the Arab demand that the UN should play a significant role, something rejected by Israel. Israel also seeks complete exclusion of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and other limits on Palestinian representation. Mr Bessmertnykh did not use his visit - the first to Israel by a Soviet foreign minister - to announce, as Israel had hoped, the restoration of full diplomatic relations, broken off by Moscow during the 1967 Six Dar War. But he said that point was 'very, very close' and adopted a much friendlier tone in talks with Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, and Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, than he had in remarks before his six-hour visit. He made no mention in his public statements of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which he had objected to sharply the previous day in Jordan. Asked whether the Soviet Union might restrict Soviet Jewish emigration to Israel as a means of pressuring Israel on the peace process, he replied that both sides had agreed that 'no country will try to put pressure on any other country.' Israeli officials said Mr Bessmertnykh told them emigration would continue.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Letter: Lack of commitment that leaves Gatt in doubt Sir, Your editorial, 'Full speed ahead on Gatt' (July 9) suggests that trade negotiators 'are condemned to succeed' in a world trade agreement under the Gatt. I beg to differ. Even after several years of negotiations, a Gatt agreement is by no means assured. As you said, final agreement in agriculture has not been reached; given the politically sensitive nature of agriculture and the unwillingness of any of the G7 leaders to stand up to special interest groups, agreement may not even be possible. When they start to pay much more than lip service to a world trade agreement, then the Uruguay Round could be completed in days. Given the lack of western leadership in others areas such as Bosnia, I for one will not be holding my breath. James Robertson, 11 Fairbridge Road, Archway, London N19 3EW</p>

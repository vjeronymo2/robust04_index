Billy Graham of the United States left Beijing  for Pyongyang on Thursday carrying with him a verbal message  from U.S. President Bill Clinton to Kim Il-song, a government  source said.    "We understand Clinton's message calls on North Korea to  resolve the nuclear question at an early date," he said.    The source added that Rev. Graham will drop into Hong Kong  after his visit to North Korea, where he will have a press  conference on the results of his visit to Pyongyang.    During his stay in Pyongyang, Graham is expected to meet  President Kim Il-song and officiate service at the Pongsu church  in Pyongyang.    This is Graham's second visit to North Korea. During his  first visit in April 1992, he conferred with Kim Il-song and  gave a lecture at Kim Il-song University.</p>

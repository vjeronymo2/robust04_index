			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NATIONWIDE REJECTS PAYMENT IN DISPUTED ALZHEIMER'S PROGRAM;  </P> <P> ALZHEIMER'S CLAIMS TURNED DOWN  </P> <P> Nationwide Insurance said today that it is holding to its decision to reject  claims filed by an agency that offers therapy for Alzheimer's disease victims  in Ohio. A spokesman for the agency said the program will fold.  </P> <P> The company's decision, announced in an unsigned statement, came after the  company reviewed claims filed by Toledo-based Intergenerational Services Inc.,  a nonprofit agency that offers therapeutic services to Alzheimer's patients in  66 nursing home in 15 northwest Ohio counties.  </P> <P> Columbus-based Nationwide, which administers the Medicare program in Ohio,  contends that the activities that Intergenerational offers to Alzheimer's  patients are recreational and social, not psychotherapy. The services, in the  company's view, therefore do not qualify for even partial reimbursement under  the government's medical insurance program.  </P> <P> Intergenerational said today that it will go out of business because of  Nationwide's policy, because it cannot afford to continue operations during an  appeal.  </P> <P> "Even though they are going to appeal Nationwide's decision, they're going to  be phasing out the program," Stan Collins, an agency spokesman, said. "They  just can't stay in business."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Academician Yuriy Nikolayevich Pariyskiy, deputy </F> director of the Special Astrophysical Observatory, Russian  Academy of Sciences; Viktor Leonidovich Afanasyev, doctor of  physical-mathematical sciences and director of the Special  Astrophysical Observatory]    [Abstract] The Russian Academy of Sciences Special  Astrophysical Observatory -- located in the Northern Caucasus,  25 km from Zelenchukskaya Station, in the mountains of  Karachayevo-Cherkessiya -- is the largest such observatory in  Russia. It has the world's largest optical telescope (6 meters)  and the world's largest radiotelescope (the 600-meter  RATAN-600). Together, the two telescopes can perform virtually  any ground-based astrophysical experiment in the optical,  centimeter, and decimeter ranges. The 6-meter telescope is used  to study number of phenomena, including the chemical  composition, magnetic fields, and atmospheres of stars and the  spectral and polarimetric characteristics of relativistic  objects such as black holes and neutron stars. The RATAN-600 has  a wide range of uses, such as studies of the interstellar medium  and star formation. More than 20 organizations from Russia and  the near-abroad make use of the RATAN-600, and in 1989 alone, it  found 14,000 objects. Like other facilities of the Academy of  Sciences, however, the observatory is having difficulty getting  money for even minimum maintenance. The RATAN-600 is  particularly troubled in that regard and has been operating at  10-percent capacity in recent months. Figures 2, references 2  (Russian).</p>

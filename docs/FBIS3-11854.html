			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Caracas, 27 Mar (DPA) -- After spending two years in  prison for a 1992 coup attempt, Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez  (retired) today held a news conference while surrounded by  thousands of "Bolivarian" supporters. During the news  conference, Chavez did not rule out the possibility of an armed  struggle, and he called for profound changes in Venezuela,  including an constituent assembly and economic reforms.    With the support of mid-level officers, the ideologue of the  so-called 200 Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement (MBR-200)  organized the first coup attempt against former President Carlos  Andres Perez on 4 February 1992. Today, however, Chavez harshly  criticized the government of President Rafael Caldera for his  "improvised plans" to combat the crisis facing the nation, and  he insisted on the need for "structural reform."    Chavez stressed his organization is political in nature, but  in discussing the group's goal "to seize power," he did not rule  out the possibility of an armed struggle. Any path, whether by  way of armed conflict or elections, remains valid, and the  choice depends on the people, he said, describing himself as a  "soldier of the people."    Chavez added, "We hope for the peaceful path, but we expect  profound changes." He also noted he did not regret the events  of February 1992, adding that only "the sovereign" people can  decide whether or not he stages a rebellion.    The news conference, which was attended by a large number of  reporters, was held in a concert hall, while hundreds of people  waited in the streets to greet him. Chavez indicated that one  solution to keep "the people from taking up arms" would be to  summon a national constituent assembly, and he went on to  criticize the "politicos" and leaders of the traditional  political parties.    Regarding former President Perez, who is now accused of  alleged misappropriation of public funds, Chavez was skeptical  that the Supreme Court would issue a warrant for his arrest,  adding that he knew of "under the table" agreements by  Democratic Action and the Social Christian Party to exonerate  Perez.    Chavez, who has benefited from what President Caldera has  described as "pacification," said peace within the Armed Forces  can only by achieved through the release of those individuals  involved in the two coup attempts of 1992 (4 February and 27  November).    He demanded more jobs and respect for the thousands of  soldiers involved in or accused of being involved in the two  coups, many of whom have joined the MBR-200, an organization  that seeks to create a "great national front."    Chavez reiterated he struck no deal with President Caldera  in  exchange for his release, and instead he criticized the economic  policies being implemented by the government that took office on  2 February.    "I hope President Caldera confronts the difficult situation  in our country in a firm and forceful way," Chavez said as he  answered more than 20 questions posed by reporters from domestic  and foreign news media.    [Caracas Radio Rumbos Network in Spanish at 1836 GMT on 27  March carries a two-minute report that includes recorded remarks  made by Chavez to supporters after his 27 March news conference  had concluded. In the recording, Chavez says: "One cannot talk  of retirement. Nobody is retiring here, because true soldiers  never retire. We are now walking hand-in-hand with the people,  and we are here to appear before the country and to summon unity  around the strategic goal of transformation."]</p>

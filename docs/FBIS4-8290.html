			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 9 -- Leader of the Confederation for  an Independent Poland (KPN) Leszek Moczulski said during a  meeting of the KPN Political Council on Saturday that KPN,  despite press reports, is not facing a split. He stressed there  are various options within the KPN leadership, adding that he  even believes the differences are too small as similar views  result in similar proposals of solutions.    The KPN leader also said that if Lech Walesa does not sign  the 1994 budget, KPN will support this decision. "We are the  only parliamentary caucus which asked the president not to sign  the budget law," he added.    In the opinion of its members, KPN is a uniform political  force whose isolation has been caused by the KPN decision not to  be engaged in alignments which would be incompatible with the  KPN programme.    While addressing the meeting, Political Council Member  Krzysztof Kaminski sharply criticized the press for reporting on  the alleged split in the KPN.    Moczulski is the unquestionable KPN leader and a candidate  for president, Kaminski said. The KPN leader confirmed he would  run in the next presidential elections.    At the end of the meeting, heads of the KPN regional  organizations presented reports concerning preparations for  local government elections. They said the KPN was setting up  coalitions with centre-right parties in numerous provinces.    Leader of the KPN parliamentary caucus Krzysztof Krol  stressed that members of regional chapters of centre and  right-wing parties were much more responsible than their  leaderships, and added that this provided a chance for winning  the common struggle.</p>

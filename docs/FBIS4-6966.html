			<p>BFN     [Text]- The announcement came several hours after the  socialists cast their ballots for Hata in a prime ministerial  nomination vote in both chambers of the Diet.    Hata swept to power on the strength of 274 votes in the  lower  house, defeating Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    The SDP, with 74 members in the lower house, held six  cabinet  posts in the government of Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata's predecessor  as premier.    The strength of the coalition excluding the SDP stands at  182  seats, compared with the 206 of the LDP in the 511-seat lower  house.    Asked by a reporter whether the SDP will withdraw support  for  a policy platform accord inked on April 22 by the seven  coalition partners, Murayama replied, "We will no longer be  bound by the agreement." The agreement calls for cooperation in  such key policy fields as the proposed imposition of a new  indirect tax and Japan's response to the issue of Pyongyang's  suspected development of nuclear weapons.    The accord followed two weeks of tough coalition  horse-trading designed to reconcile sharp differences in key  policy fields, a prerequisite for launching a new coalition  government.    "It is outrageous for a certain political party or an  individual to have destroyed the current combination of  coalition parties while ignoring the process of the  accord-building," Murayama said, apparently referring to the  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]-led conservative mainstream.    The sudden flare-up of a coalition standoff delayed the  formation of a new cabinet by Hata, who was expected to announce  his new ministers Monday [25 April] evening. The coalition  stripped the LDP of its 38-year lock on power last August.    The new parliamentary caucus, named "Kaishin (Innovation),"  comprises Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Japan New Party,  and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), as well as two  splinter groups that recently defected from the LDP -- the  Liberal Party and Kaikaku no Kai.    Including former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi, an LDP  rebel who is now an independent, the parliamentary strength of  the new group is 130, dwarfing the SDP's 74 seats.    The SDP apparently perceives the sudden convergence of five  political blocs as a move aimed at accomplishing a proposal by  the Shinseito-led conservative mainstream to create a new  unified party, political analysts said.    Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and his Komeito  [Clean Government Party] counterpart Yuichi Ichikawa originally  proposed such a convergence to defeat the LDP in an upcoming  general election under the newly-legislated electoral system,  which has introduced a mix of single-seat constituencies and  proportional representation.    The move suddenly gathered momentum when DSP Chairman Keigo  Ouchi told party legislators the coalition parties should  initiate such a parliamentary group to create a "firm support  base" for the Hata administration. The DSP leader was earlier  one of the chief critics of such a move.    Ouchi later told a news conference, "The reason why we have  to establish the parliamentary group to back the new prime  minister is to facilitate the implementation of the nine-point  policy platform agreed upon by the coalition parties."    Ouchi also said, "We need to consolidate the parliamentary  base to support the prime minister and we put together parties  that could quickly agree to the convergence as it is hard to  enlist all the parties immediately into the new group."    The new parliamentary group "Kaishin" also plans to entice  Komeito with 52 lower chamber legislators into its folds,  coalition sources said.    In a related development, Ouchi told reporters that the  coalition partners will appeal to the SDP to drop its decision  to leave the coalition.    The selection of new cabinet ministers will follow a meeting  of the leaders of coalition parties, who will start their  discussions on Tuesday morning. Ozawa, leaving the premier's  official residence in a limousine, told reporters he and other  coalition leaders will assemble at 10 A.M. [0100 GMT] to discuss  the situation.</p>

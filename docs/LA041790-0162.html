			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND NOT INTERESTED IN GOP CONVENTION;  </P> <P> POLITICS: ORANGE COUNTY, SAN DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES ARE ALREADY BOOKED FOR  AUGUST, 1992.  </P> <P> A lot of Republican leaders are California dreaming these days but are more  likely to wake up somewhere else in 1992.  </P> <P> The dream involves putting the party's 1992 national convention in the  electoral heart of the nation's largest state. Republican National Committee  Chairman Lee Atwater, particularly, has been pushing the idea of holding  President Bush's expected August, 1992, renomination somewhere in Southern  California, said sources familiar with Atwater's thinking.  </P> <P> Apparently, however, the Southland is not interested.  </P> <P> The latest blow came from Orange County, in a letter Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter  wrote last month to Atwater to tell him the city would not be able to bid on  the convention.  </P> <P> The letter came after both Los Angeles and San Diego officials had made clear  to Democratic and Republican leaders that their cities would not be interested.  </P> <P> The question of finding a site for a convention that will not be held for  nearly 2 1/2 years may seem premature. But, in fact, such massive undertakings  take so long to plan that the decisions are fast approaching. The Republicans  have set June 1 as the deadline for cities to bid on being host to the  convention, and Democrats may already have announced their choice by then. For  now, no California cities are in the running for either party's convention.  </P> <P> Atwater, who has been fascinated by California politics, reportedly had been  particularly keen on having the convention in Orange County, the GOP's largest  vote base in the state. The move for the first time would have put a national  convention in a suburban area, allowing the GOP to symbolically focus on the  slice of American demography that represents the party's greatest strength.  </P> <P> Party officials have spent considerable time discussing the "political" pluses  and minuses of various sites, said Charles Black, a prominent Washington-based  GOP consultant and close friend of Atwater. And, he added, the benefits of  holding a convention in Southern California are "obvious."  </P> <P> But "question number one is who can logistically put the convention on, and  question number two is who is going to bid," said Black. Until those questions  are answered, "neither Lee nor the President are leaning one way or another. .  . . Anything you hear is pure unadulterated rumor." Earlier this year, GOP  officials inquired about Anaheim's convention center, said City Councilman Irv  Pickler. "The inquiry came in," but "we have sort of begged off."  </P> <P> The problem, said Bill Snyder, president of the Anaheim Area Visitor and  Convention Bureau, is that the city already had too much hotel and convention  business booked for the summer of 1992.  </P> <P> "Associations and large convention groups have made decisions five, six, and in  some cases nine years ahead," Snyder said. "There's no way you can try to  'unbook' that number of groups and come off without deep, deep scars in the  association business."  </P> <P> San Diego officials had offered the GOP a similar explanation for why their  city was not interested, GOP sources said. Los Angeles, by contrast, might be  interested at some point, but not in 1992. The city's convention center will be  undergoing expansion that summer, and the work will not be finished until early  1993, according to city officials.  </P> <P> Representatives of eight cities met with GOP officials last month to discuss  possible convention bids. Three of the cities -- New York, Cleveland and  Houston -- also are bidding on the Democratic convention. The other five that  have expressed interest so far are Atlanta, which was the site of the  Democratic convention in 1988, Detroit, Kansas City, Miami and St. Petersburg,  Fla.  </P> <P> The party's site selection committee will spend the summer visiting the cities  that bid, and the final decision will be made in January. In the absence of a  California bidder, Houston, as one of Bush's adopted hometowns, and the two  cities in Florida, the home of Bush's son Jeb, are favorites in early  handicapping.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Democrats, who were burned four years ago when the GOP beat them  in the race to sign a convention contract with New Orleans, have adopted a  speeded-up schedule this year. Ironically, although California cities are  turning up their noses at a convention, a number of cities are lobbying hard  for the honor.  </P> <P> A Democratic site selection committee already has been wined and dined in New  York, Cleveland and Houston, and plans to complete its tour with a trip to New  Orleans next week. The committee will meet in mid-May to make a recommendation  to party Chairman Ron Brown, who is expected to announce his decision in late  May or early June.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Cathleen Decker in Los Angeles contributed to this story.  </P></p>

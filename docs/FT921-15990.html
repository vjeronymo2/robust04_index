			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / French Socialists dig in for presidential fight: Party barons are manoeuvring for position in the 1995 election THE departure of Mr Pierre Mauroy as first secretary of the French Socialist party is likely to prove the penultimate move in a power struggle between party barons to decide who will be the Socialist candidate in the 1995 presidential elections. Mr Mauroy will tell the executive bureau of the party this morning that he is resigning after three-and-a-half years in the job. Why he is resigning is unclear. When news of Mr Mauroy's decision broke last Saturday it was widely assumed he would press the candidacy of Mr Michel Delebarre, the 45-year-old urban development minister and mayor of Dunkirk, who was for many years one of Mr Mauroy's closest associates in his town hall fiefdom in Lille. The job was not Mr Mauroy's to give, of course. The choice will be made, probably before the end of this week, by the 131-strong governing committee of the party. Since membership reflects the numerical strength of the rival factions in the party, the vote should give a strong indication of the internal bargains being made by the barons. By yesterday evening it seemed they had indeed made their bargains when it became clear Mr Mauroy would not be endorsing Mr Delebarre, but rather Mr Laurent Fabius, the 45-year-old speaker of the National Assembly and former prime minister. Later Mr Delebarre formally announced he would not be a candidate. The reason for the shift from Mr Delebarre is that Mr Michel Rocard, former prime minister and long a fancied contender in a future presidential race, had undertaken to back Mr Fabius. On the face of it a Rocard-Fabius alliance looks an unlikely pact of two ambitious rivals between whom there is no love lost. The explanation is not that Mr Rocard has discovered a sudden affinity for Mr Fabius, but that he was determined to keep Mr Delebarre out. He suspects Mr Delebarre of being a covert supporter of a rival whom he fears far more than Mr Fabius; that is Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, who has recently soared higher than Mr Rocard in the opinion polls and who is widely discussed as a future star of the French political scene. Not only does Mr Delors enjoy enormous prestige, he is untouched by the stain of corruption and general discredit which affects most of the French political establishment. The prime reason for this is that he has been away from French politics since 1985. Although he is a member of the Socialist party governing committee, he is not the leader of a faction and he does not command campaigning power or bargaining leverage. In recent months Mr Delors has been assiduous in maintaining a prominent political profile in France, as a way of maximising his appeal in the minds of the party's king-makers. On Sunday, for example, he was the star guest in the prestige personality television show L'Heure de Verite, and he took advantage of the occasion to make statesmanlike pronouncements on French policy issues - from the future of the nuclear bomb to economic reform. The significance of his statements should not be misinterpreted, however. The fact that Mr Delors says that French nuclear weapons should eventually be placed at the service of a common European foreign policy should be set alongside his other recommendation, that for the time being France should maintain the independence of its nuclear force. Mr Delors is not announcing a change in French policy, he is just advertising his availability. Being available is one thing; getting adopted is another. One option for him would be to return fully to French politics as a springboard for a presidential campaign in 1995. This was much discussed last autumn, when it was suggested that President Francois Mitterrand might summon him back to replace Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister whose unpopularity has grown by the month. The disadvantage of this option is that Mr Delors would risk contamination without any real prospect of being able to avert heavy defeat for the party in the 1993 general election. Since last month's European Community summit at Maastricht, however, Mr Delors has seemed less tempted by a premature return to France, not least because his tenure in Brussels could conceivably be extended until the end of 1994. But if Mr Delors stays away from France, he can give his candidacy real credibility only on two conditions: he must appear constantly before the public, and he must have a friend at the heart of the Socialist party. Since Mr Delebarre is a member of the traditionalist faction to which Mr Delors also belongs, but is not himself a plausible presidential candidate, perhaps he could have been that friend. If Mr Rocard had wanted to keep out Mr Delebarre he could have done so without difficulty. The traditionalist faction led by Mr Lionel Jospin, education minister, in association with Mr Mauroy, has almost 30 per cent of the votes in the party, but so does the Fabius faction. Mr Rocard's group is slightly smaller, with nearly 25 per cent. But he and Mr Fabius between them command a majority of the votes.</p>

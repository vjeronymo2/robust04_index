			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 20 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev and his Armenian counterpart Vagan Papazyan  discussed today at the Russian Foreign Ministry issues dealing  with the early ceasefire and the termination of hostilities in  Nagorno-Karabakh and around it, as well as the prevention of  incidents on the border between the Azeri Republic and the  Republic of Armenia. The foreign ministers were unanimous in  their opinion that the conflict, started many years ago, cannot  be resolved through the use of force and should be settled as  soon as possible with the mediation of the Russian Federation by  political means, by means of talks.    Russia, as a mediator, is seeking to bring the stands of  both  participants in the conflict closer together and to persuade  them to sign immediately a ceasefire agreement, Galina Sidorova,  political adviser to the Russian foreign minister, told  ITAR-TASS after the end of the meeting. The talks are rather  complicated, because the conflict is a long one, many problems  have been accumulated in relations between the two sides, and  they feel mistrust for each other, Sidorova said. Russia is  doing its utmost for the agreement on the end of armed  confrontation and prevention of destabilisation of the situation  in the whole region to be signed as soon as possible, she  stressed. According to Sidorova, "now it is difficult to say  when the two sides will sit down at the negotiating table, to  what extent a possibility of holding meeting by them has become  more real. There is a draft agreement, and now it is necessary  to bring the stands of the two sides closer together," she said.    Kozyrev discussed settlement problems also with Arkadiy  Gukasyan, spokesman for the Nagorno-Karabakh leadership.    Last Tuesday the Russian foreign minister had a meeting with  Azeri Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov within the framework of a  programme of working consultations.</p>

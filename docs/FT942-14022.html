			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Australian securities suit filed The Australian Securities Commission yesterday filed a suit against Mr John Spalvins, who built up the Adelaide Steamship group in the 1980s, as well as four other former directors of the company and Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells/Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu, the former auditors of the group. The ASC, acting on behalf of the Adsteam group, is demanding that ADollars 340m (Pounds 163.4m) be repaid to the company - an amount which it claims is equivalent to 'improperly paid dividends and interest'. The suit is a civil action, and while claiming that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties or were negligent, does not allege any criminal behaviour. In the action, filed in the Federal Court in Adelaide, the ASC maintained that the former directors and auditors caused Adsteam's profit for 1990 to be overstated by at least ADollars 518m in the accounts. The accounts, to year-end of June 1990, and certified in the following October as 'true and fair' by the directors and auditors, said that the company had 'achieved its 14th consecutive record profit for ADollars 220.3m, notwithstanding high interest rates and the difficult economic climate in Australia'. Yet, as the ASC notes, a month later the company's share price had dropped to 35 cents - compared with ADollars 3.53 when the results were announced - and Adsteam entered into an arrangement with its bankers.</p>

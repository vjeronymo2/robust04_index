			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: INGENIOUS INVENTIONS BY ALLEN BRAGDON (HARPER &amp; ROW:  $8.50, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> A pleasantly silly catalogue of improbable-looking 19th-Century appliances,  presented in a guess-what-this-is format. Perusing these photographs of soap  savers, chicken waterers, cartes de bal and sugar nippers offers the nostalgic  pleasure of a stroll through a turn-of-the-century hardware store. However, the  reader is left with the disquieting notion that in 2089, Bragdon's grandson  will publish a similar volume devoted to such quaintly impractical devices as  the fax machine, car phone, computer mouse and Walkman.  </P></p>

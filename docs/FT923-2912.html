			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Firmer dollar and bonds lift US equities Wall Street SHARE prices on Wall Street rose strongly in the wake of the cut in German interest rates. Shortly after midday, the scale of the rise triggered the New York Stock Exchange's programme trading circuit breakers, and throughout the afternoon the market clung on to the morning's gains, writes Nikki Tait in New York. By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 70.52 at 3,376.22, after opening more than 35 points up and reaching a level of 3,368.92 by 1pm. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was finally 5.69 ahead at 425.27 and the Nasdaq composite 11.20 stronger at 594.21. Turnover on the NYSE amounted to a heavy 252.7m shares, while rises outweighed declines by 1,287 to 573. The market's surge came against the backdrop of a strengthening dollar and a rising bond market. Traders quickly reasoned that these developments would give the Federal Reserve more leeway to lower interest rates, thus helping to shift the stagnant US economy on to a recovery path. Yesterday's advance was said to result from steady demand for stocks by both institutional and individual investors. A number of leading US corporations were among the market's most actively traded shares in the morning session - most of them showing solid gains. Ford Motor advanced Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 42 7/8 , General Motors Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 34 7/8 and Chemical Bank Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 32. Tobacco and food group Philip Morris gained Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 85, although its major rival, RJR Nabisco, eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 8 3/4 . Merck, the drugs company, was also active, firming Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 48 5/8 . Compaq Computer put on Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 33 3/4 on the back of a new product launch and in the wake of IBM's delayed debut for its low-cost PCs. Weyerhaeuser, the forest products concern, climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 36. At the end of last week the West Coast-based group said it was delaying the flotation of its Paragon Trade Brands subsidiary because of the diaper price war. In the banking sector, plans by Shearson Lehman, a subsidiary of American Express, to sell its Boston Company to Mellon Bank for Dollars 1.45bn left Mellon shares down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 40 1/4 . American Express rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 22 3/4 . Maytag, the home appliances manufacturer, appreciated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 14 3/4 on news that it is entering a co-operative alliance with Germany's Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate. The New York Times said it knew of no particular reason why its shares should advance strongly yesterday: by lunchtime the class 'A' stock was Dollars 1 1/2 ahead at Dollars 28 1/8 . Canada TORONTO stocks climbed throughout the day to end sharply higher in the wake of the surprise cut in Germany's leading interest rates. The TSE 300 index rose 29.8 to 3,470.4 and advances outscored declines by 365 to 205 after volume of 33.2m shares valued at CDollars 359.9m. The German rates cut helped the Canadian dollar recover about a third of a cent from last week's sell-off. The rally in the currency paves the way for a hefty cut in the Bank of Canada's key rate on Thursday, money market traders said.</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / New poll boost for anti-Ozal campaign THE Turkish government's election pledge to oust President Turgut Ozal has been given a new boost with publication of an opinion poll yesterday, suggesting 59 per cent of Turks believe he should be removed from office. The poll is the latest indication of growing popular discontent with political interference by the president. It follows Mr Ozal's repeated use of his veto over legislation and bureaucratic appointments, and a public row over who should sign the Black Sea Economic Co-operation pact. The leadership row has been simmering for months since Mr Suleyman Demirel, prime minister, promised to oust Mr Ozal, who in 1989 used his party's parliamentary majority to have himself elected president. Both opposition parties boycotted the vote. Mr Demirel would need a two-thirds parliamentary majority to change the constitution, the only legal way, barring impeachment, to force the president to step down.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANGEROUS REMEDY  </P> <P> There are two possible explanations for President Bush's decision to promote a  constitutional amendment prohibiting vandalism of the American flag. Neither  does the President much credit.  </P> <P> One is that the advisers who so adroitly manipulated the flag and other popular  patriotic symbols during his campaign last year persuaded him to take what  political advantage he could of the Supreme Court's ruling that flag burning is  a protected form of political protest. The other accepts his notion that the  solemn compact by which this nation governs itself ought to change because Bush  feels "viscerally" about the issue.  </P> <P> The First Amendment to the Constitution is the most majestic and flexible  blueprint for the practical realization of fundamental human liberty ever  devised. "Congress," it says, "shall make no law respecting an establishment of  religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of  speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and  to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."  </P> <P> In the 200 years since Congress approved those words as the first and most  important provision of the charter we call our Bill of Rights, the United  States has passed through armed civil turmoil, foreign wars, global  confrontation with aggressive totalitarianism and economic and social changes  so profound as to have been unimaginable to the framers. Yet in all that  perilous passage, no one, no matter how dire the press of circumstance, has  found it necessary to alter the language of the First Amendment or to create a  constitutional exception to its application.  </P> <P> Flag burning, with all its connotations of contempt for this country's basic  institutions and the sacrifices made to maintain them, is a particularly  noxious form of expressive speech. It is, in fact, political pornography. This  court, like others before it, has wisely held that tolerance of obnoxious  speech is the irritating -- but, in the end, not very burdensome -- price we  pay for that freedom which is the root of all others.  </P> <P> Cooler heads on both sides of the congressional aisle, like House Speaker  Thomas S. Foley and conservative New Hampshire Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey, already  have expressed skepticism about any attempt to alter the First Amendment. As  outrage gives way to prudent deliberation, others doubtless will join them. The  cynical, the opportunistic and the merely rash, however vocal, must not be  allowed to have their way in this.  </P> <P> It would be a tragic paradox indeed if an attempt to protect the symbol of the  American nation became, in fact, an assault on the most substantial foundation  of its liberties.  </P></p>

Demirel stated that Turkey and Israel confirmed their  determination in working toward regional solidarity and  cooperation. The guest president was ceremoniously seen off at  the Cankaya Mansion. After the Israeli and Turkish national  anthems, Weizman and Demirel inspected the honor guard. Weizman  parted from Husamettin Cindoruk, Turkish Grand National Assembly  speaker; Prime Minister Tansu Ciller; General Dogan Gures, chief  of the General Staff; Constitutional Court President Yekta  Gungor Ozdem; and other officials.    In a speech, he delivered at the ceremony, Demirel stated  that his meetings with Weizman proved that both Israel and  Turkey had the political will needed to develop bilateral  relations. Pointing out that there must be expansion in all the  areas discussed, Demirel added that the economic relations will  be developed within a very extensive framework. Demirel said  that arrangements were under way to complete, in a couple of  months, the legal infrastructure needed to develop the economic  and commercial relations between the two countries. Demirel  further announced more cooperation in the defense industry,  agriculture, tourism, industry, energy, and contractor work.    Demirel said: The Middle East is being restructured at the  present time. Elevating the standard of living and eliminating  terrorism from the region are two key elements needed for  stability there. These conditions are directly linked to the  development of the Middle East peace process and Turkey and  Israel confirmed their determination to undertake every effort  necessary toward achieving them -- through regional cooperation  and solidarity.    In the speech, he delivered at the ceremony, Weizman said  that his visit was extremely beneficial for future relations  between Turkey and Israel. Pointing out that world and regional  peace will benefit enormously from the development of the  solidarity and cooperation between the two countries, Weizman  added that he is persuaded that Turkey will continue to  contribute positively to the Middle East peace process.  Indicating that he had extended an invitation to Demirel,  Weizman added that it would give him great pleasure if Demirel  would visit Israel as soon as possible.    Meanwhile, Demirel presented Weizman with a photo album of  pictures of the visit. Weizman later departed from Ankara's  Esenboga Airport to Sanliurfa. The guest president will be  conducting a study tour of the Ataturk Dam and other various  installations. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and State Minister  Nurhan Tekinel will be accompanying Weizman on his tour of the  GAP [Southeast Anatolia Project]. Weizman will be leaving  Sanliurfa for Istanbul during the evening hours. He will be  leaving Turkey after visiting the historical and touristic  sights of Istanbul.</p>

The cables said in part: The horrendous massacre that the  Zionists committed today against innocent Palestinian  worshippers is the greatest evidence of terrorism and delinquent  behavior demonstrated by the usurping Israeli entity since it  was founded with the help of those who claim to be concerned  about civilization, democracy, freedom, and human rights.    If this is the promised Israeli peace, then let it be seen  by  the entire world's international, regional, and humanitarian  institutions. We and history await your stance and your verdict.    The Lebanese Communist Party [LCP] denounced the massacre  and  said it was an attempt to impose additional conditions on the  Palestinian side and put pressure on other Arab parties.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Cassini Starts Talking: Fashion master Oleg Cassini makes his debut as a  talk-show host Sunday at 2 p.m. on Arts &amp; Entertainment cable, but the  venture doesn't mean he has designs on a whole new career. "My philosophy is,  if it's there, why not try it," Cassini said in a telephone interview from his  office in New York. On "Conversation with Cassini," he talks informally "with  people I know well, at my house or their house, so their personalities come  though." Bob Hope is on the first program.

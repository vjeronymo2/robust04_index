			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Drink: It's time to roll out the barrels - Jancis Robinson discovers the secrets of making a fortune in the wine trade LUNCH WAS served under a tree by the pool, the snails and duck cooked by the local two-star chef and smilingly served by his mother. In the dappled September sunlight of a good Burgundy vintage (yes, 1992) we watched two young men fulfil their pool maintenance contract and discussed the world's financial crisis. The cold hand of stagnation and bankruptcy has certainly touched most parts of the wine business, but my hosts' very particular sector of it seems as hot as ever. Jean and Noelle Francois report little slackening of demand for the top quality French oak barrels they sell from their three pre-eminent cooperages: Francois Freres in Burgundy, Demptos just outside Bordeaux and Demptos Napa, a joint venture in California. Total production is more than 200 casks a day (75 in St Romain, 100 in Bordeaux, 30 in Napa) which can sell for Pounds 250 apiece. As Gerard Lebrere of the biggest cooper's Seguin Moreau, says: 'The world is infatuated with new oak at the moment'. As more wine producers console themselves over slow demand with the mantra 'less but better', the wooden cask has taken on a mythical significance. At the lower end of the ladder the most obvious way a producer can jack up the price of his wine is to age it in wood, preferably oak new enough to impart a perceptible layer of 'oaky' flavour, and trumpet the fact on the label. At the top end, the increasingly high proportion of meticulously nurtured fruit in many cases demands meticulously coopered wood which not only adds more complex flavours but smooths the winemaking process. High scores and public acclaim are imperative to generate sales and top quality new French oak seems, at present anyway, to be the key. Demand for oak casks is strong therefore from producers at the bottom who wish to climb and from those at the top who dare not slip. Only those producers with a real cash flow problem - such as Burgundy's most logjammed negociants and smaller, mid-range domaines - have sharply cut their orders this year. But producers in the New World and emerging Old World wine regions who wish to demonstrate that they too belong to the wine world elite have more than compensated. Of the 200,000 French oak barrels made for a particularly generous vintage such as 1990 more than half are exported, with the ambitious and relatively cash-rich wineries of California taking about half of all exports. The geographical diversification of the French cooperage business, initially impelled by the 1973 oil crisis, means that it is now, thanks to southern hemisphere orders, a year-round rather than three-month activity. Survival in the cooperage business takes considerable nerve however, as well as financial reserves, which is why many smaller coopers have foundered. While not being so long-term as the timber business (trees should be at least a century old before being hewn into wine casks), a good cooper has to bet on his likely sales in two to three years' time, buying ahead after careful selection from France's efficiently-managed forests, which cover a quarter of that sizeable hexagone. Top quality oak tends to be from slow-growing trees from certain treasured areas, carefully split into staves by following the grain and then left outside for a couple of years like giant stacks of matches to yield the harshest tannins to the elements. This relatively buoyant market is fought over by the 30 or so specialist coopers left in France, other than those well-heeled, traditional wine producers who still have their own in-house cooper. Some of the biggest are based in Cognac where barrels are all-important, but it is a sign of the relative health of the wine and brandy markets that Seguin Moreau is now a nice little earner for the Remy Martin group selling 95 per cent of its barrels to wine producers. Taransaud uses its particularly fine stock of French oak to do the same for the Hennessy bit of the LVMH group while Vicard and Radoux are still independent. Francois Freres of Burgundy became the biggest family-run cooperage business in 1989 with its trans-hexagon acquisition of Demptos, to which Seguin Moreau has responded by setting up shop in Burgundy last November. Nadalie is the other sizeable Bordeaux cooper, but Californians Kendall-Jackson have bought a stake in a French cooper. Coopers such as Demptos will export staves for reconstruction into casks abroad but others try to minimise such potentially expensive problems as contamination and leaks by exporting whole made-up barrels sheathed in plastic. Like most craftsmen however, with the possible exception of chefs and marblers, coopers, those who actually coop for a living, are a disappearing species. Seguin Moreau has cleverly harnessed Portuguese cooperage skills to make French staves. Just as port and traditionally matured Portuguese wines have kept the cooper's art alive in Portugal, so sherry, rioja and a wide range of wood-matured spirits mean that there are still flourishing cooperages in Spain, Scotland, Ireland and, particularly, America where bourbon must be matured in a new charred American oak cask. This rule, surely formulated by some American timber merchant, can generate sales of up to 1m casks a year, many of which eventually find their way to Scotland where Scotch whisky producers are becoming increasingly worried by the possible effects of the bourbon slump on their own production costs. The future may bring new American oak casks. (Used wine casks tend to be traded down for use on increasingly lowly wines.) The sherry producers of Andalucia play an important part in the cooperage business too, not just by breaking in oak casks specially for some of the more particular malt whisky producers, but by usefully abhorring new oak and using individual casks for up to 200 years. The sweeter, more obvious flavours of American oak have traditionally been favoured by Spanish wine and brandy producers ever since the 17th century, and this naturally less porous oak is also widely used for reds hefty enough to take it in Australia as well as California. European oak is finer and although there is no shortage of French oak, it is expensive, representing up to half the price of a barrel today. Many coopers, mindful of history, are looking east for cheaper oaks - particularly since there are, for the moment at least, few controls on exact wood provenance, however much Napa Valley winemakers agonise over whether to order Allier or Troncais - names which may, in reality, be used interchangeably by France's still blessed barrel salesmen. Jancis Robinson's series Vintners' Tales (BBC2 Mondays 8.50 pm) looks at some of the more colourful characters in the wine trade.</p>

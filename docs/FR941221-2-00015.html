The Program will assist U.S.-based industrial firms that have entered into U.S.-Israeli joint ventures (partnerships of United States and Israeli companies) to carry out research and development on long-term, medium- to high-risk technologies. This Program is separate from the existing Bi-national Industrial R&amp;D Foundation (BIRD), which continues to offer support for commercial joint ventures. Inquiries about BIRD assistance should be addressed directly to the BIRD Foundation, Tel Aviv, Israel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Such projects should focus on research, development and commercialization of technologies that are not appropriately funded by other U.S. or Israeli government-funded research and development efforts. This assistance will take place through the use of cooperative agreements with U.S.-based industrial firms pursuant to this Notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funding will be made directly to the U.S. firms that are partners in the U.S.-Israeli joint ventures. Funding from the U.S. Department of Commerce for the pilot Program is limited to the U.S. partner(s) to a U.S.-Israeli joint venture, with funding for the Israeli partner(s) to be provided by the Israeli Government. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Applications must be received on or before January 20, 1995.

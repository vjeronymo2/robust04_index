			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family (Wall Street): Investors wait for a political jump-start IT HAS the air of a party which has passed its peak. The music is slowing, the drink is running a little low. Dawn may be near. True, Wall Street scaled new heights last week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at 3,272.81 on Tuesday afternoon. But it was a rather half-hearted effort, with an edge of less than one point on the previous record close - set on January 28. Even Tuesday's record close, moreover, was not mirrored in the broader market indicators. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, for example, remained some seven points shy of its all-time peak, although it did move upwards. Significantly, the S&amp;P-500 reached its all-time high almost one week before the Dow, on January 15. The question hanging over the market, of course, remains the state of the economy and whether - as election campaigning picks up pace - it can hope for even lower interest rates. The gains of the past six weeks have stemmed largely from declining yields on competing investments, coupled with a belief that the authorities will do everything in their power to jump-start the economy. Accordingly, it was remarks by the Federal Reserve chairman which gave Wall Street such a fillip on Tuesday. Appearing before a Congressional committee, Alan Greenspan noted that while he believed that interest rates to date should prove sufficient to provoke an economic recovery, the Fed was prepared to ease further if necessary. 'We are continuing to evaluate whether some additional insurance in the way of further monetary ease would be appropriate,' he remarked as the Fed's policy-setting open market committee began its regular monthly meeting. It did not take long, however, for worries to set in. Amid heavy trading, Wall Street saw the Dow fall over 15 points on Wednesday, and a further couple on Thursday, as the market awaitedFriday's unemployment report. In the event, that was worse - which, from the market's perspective, means better - than predicted. Non-farm payrolls in January were estimated to have fallen by 91,000, with manufacturing employment down by 52,000. Quite apart from the grim situation in the manufacturing sector, the retail trade lost some 51,000 jobs in January and all service industries showed a loss of 29,000. The unemployment rate itself remained a 7.1 per cent. Yet, by noon there was little indication that the Fed was interpreting this data as immediate cause for a further easing. To some observers, at least, this was not entirely surprising: there is certainly a school of thought which argues that there has not yet been sufficient time to measure the impact of the December discount rate cut, and any additional action at this stage would be premature. Still, the market took the lack of signals to heart. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, having initially risen almost 14 points when the jobs figures were released, had slumped to a loss of around four points by midday on Friday. Meanwhile, as the corporate reporting season continues to roll, the auguries are mixed. Although no-one could describe many of the earnings reports as cheerful, overall they have at least presented relatively few new horror stories. GTE, the largest local telephone company, reported a 10 per cent increase in net fourth-quarter earnings while Cummins Engine has forecast a return to profit in the first quarter of the year. By contrast Pepisco, the large soft drinks, restaurants and snacks group, reported near-static figures, hit by restructuring charges, while a number of large food retailers reported weaker figures as promotional activity continues to sweep the sector. At Chrysler, the financially-stretched car-maker, there was a fourth-quarter profit of Dollars 97m - in line with market expectations - although a Dollars 74m loss at the pre-tax level and a warning that it might lose significantly more than that in the first quarter of 1992. Like so many companies, Chrysler is pinning its hopes publicly on the latter half of the year, helped by launches of its new Jeep Grand Cherokee and LH series of mid-sized saloons. As for the continuing efforts of the corporate sector to replenish balance sheets, it was the turn of Sears Roebuck last week to announce a Dollars 1bn offering of PERCS - the new equity-based security - while American Express plans to raise up to Dollars 1bn via the flotation of a minority stake in its credit card-processing subsidiary. One thing is certain: while the good times are rolling, the canny are certainly cashing in. Monday     3234.12 + 10.73 Tuesday    3272.81 + 38.69 Wednesday  3257.60 - 15.21 Thursday   3255.59 -  2.01 Friday     3225.40 - 30.19</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: WHY ARBITRAGERS KEPT TO SIDELINES DURING MCA DEAL  </P> <P> MCA Inc.'s $6.6-billion sellout to Matsushita ought to be a big victory for  Wall Street's arbitragers the professional traders whose specialty is betting  on takeover deals. But in fact, many of the arbs say they'll reap no windfall,  because they didn't buy MCA. It just never looked like an honest enough deal to  them.  </P> <P> "I think the vast majority of professional arbitragers played that deal  correctly -- that is, they had very small positions or none at all," argues  Jeffrey Greenblatt, partner at the Baker, Nye Investments arb firm in New York.  </P> <P> For months, much of what was being said about MCA's takeover potential "were  things that just didn't make sense," Greenblatt says.  </P> <P> So the profits from the deal, instead, will flow to the cowboy speculators who  took a chance on MCA armed with little more than hunch and hope.  </P> <P> The arbs' avoidance of MCA is a good commentary on the state of the stock  market -- and offers good reason why less-well-informed speculators will  continue to be the main driving force in the market, with all of the attendant  volatility that can cause for stocks.  </P> <P> Professional arbs are traders who make a living ferreting-out market  information before it becomes well known. Takeovers have long been their bread  and butter, for obvious reason. In the deal-crazy '80s, arbs played rumored  takeover stocks with abandon and made huge profits.  </P> <P> But the 1987 stock crash and the 1989 collapse of the junk bond market killed  off untold numbers of arbs by killing the deal game. And this year, one of the  biggest anticipated takeovers -- the buyout of United Airlines -- collapsed,  bloodying more arbs.  </P> <P> The arbs who are left are sober realists who have gone back to arbitrage's  roots: Rather than take a flyer on something, they wait for a deal to be  announced. Then they try to determine what the target's stock should be selling  for, given the complexity of the deal and the time to completion.  </P> <P> "It's back to arbitrage as a systematic discipline again," says Gene Cordon,  partner at arb firm Mesirow Advanced Strategies in Highland Park, Ill. "Even  those people who are more aggressive arb managers have become more cautious."  </P> <P> What you see happening now with MCA stock is indeed traditional arbitrage.  Thursday, 779,900 shares traded between $65.75 and $66. MCA closed at $65.875.  Arbs know Matsushita will pay $66 a share in cash. What the pros are doing now  is poring over research, trying to estimate the real value of the expected $5  in stock to be paid for MCA's WWOR TV station. And they're estimating how long  the deal will take to be consummated.  </P> <P> If the final value of the deal is indeed $71 a share, a buyer at $66 will earn  7.6% before expenses. If the deal is completed in two months, as expected, that  looks like a substantial annualized return. But to the arbs, that return is  just adequate considering trading expenses, the chance of hitches developing  and the uncertainties about valuing WWOR.  </P> <P> To the speculators who paid prices in the $40s or $50s for MCA in recent  months, there's no need to analyze MCA now. They stand to make a handsome  profit. But those gunslingers could just as easily have been wrong, and lost  their shirts.  </P> <P> Baker Nye's Greenblatt says the "nature of the personalities involved" meant  there was too much risk in MCA. And talk valuing MCA at $90 a share just raised  the risk, Greenblatt says, because "I don't think anybody who did analytical  work believed those values would be achieved."  </P> <P> So, many of the pros stepped away, and the amateur speculators took control.  And that's how it's likely to stay in the bear market. That will mean more  volatility, because speculators' trigger fingers have replaced the arbs' more  deft touch.  </P> <P> Fund Investors Abandon Uncle Sam: In times of international turmoil, investors  are supposed to seek safety in U.S. government securities. Somebody forgot to  tell mutual fund investors about that concept.  </P> <P> October fund industry statistics, out Thursday, show a continuing outflow of  cash from bond funds that invest in Treasury securities. Purchases of those  funds totaled $1.01 billion for the month. Meanwhile, investors redeemed $1.46  billion of those funds' shares, resulting in a net outflow of $447 million from  the U.S. government funds.  </P> <P> The outflow occurred even as investors generally showed bullishness about other  bond funds and about stock funds. Overall, net purchases of bond funds totaled  $1.4 billion in October, compared to $1.7 billion in September. Net purchases  of stock funds totaled $1.1 billion, compared to $1.2 billion. While down for  now, the ongoing net inflow of cash shows investors aren't spooked by economic  and war worries. If they were, they'd be liquidating like crazy.  </P> <P> So why are people cutting out of Treasury bond funds? Don Clark, officer at the  Financial Programs fund family in Denver, argues that fund investors are simply  showing their sophistication. Unlike in years past, "People are less inclined  now to run for cover (during crises). They're more inclined to look for buying  opportunities," he says.  </P> <P> Money is exiting Treasury funds because the 7% to 8% yields those funds pay  look meager compared to returns elsewhere, fund officials say. Where the money  is going:  </P> <P> * Bond and stock funds that invest in foreign securities. Global bond funds  alone saw a net inflow of $711 million in October, and fund officials say those  portfolios remain hot tickets this month. Many of the funds offer yields of 9%  or better.  </P> <P> * U.S. stock funds, especially those investing for long-term growth. The  market's low in October just encouraged more bargain hunting. And that has  continued in November, fund officials say. The Franklin Group of funds in San  Mateo, Calif., says net stock fund purchases zoomed to $45 million in November  from $4 million in October. Meanwhile, investors already in stock funds largely  are staying put. At T. Rowe Price funds in Baltimore, spokesman Steve Norwitz  says stock fund redemptions fell 50% in November from October.  </P> <P> * Tax-exempt municipal bond funds. With income tax rates rising, investors are  realizing that tax-exempt muni yields of 6.5% to 7% are worth more than even  8.5% taxable Treasury yields.  </P> <P> Another sign that fund investors now are less worried about the Iraq situation  and the economy: Fidelity Investments' monthly survey of individual investors  showed sentiment improved in November, after falling for five months.  Fidelity's sentiment index rose to 67.2 this month from 64.1 in October. The  index, which measures investors' optimism about the markets, was at 94.3 in  June.  </P> <P> Briefly: From the Maybe-They-Should-Ask-Someone-Else Dept.: At the recent U.S.  League of Savings Institutions convention, a Soviet official asked for U.S.  advice in overhauling the U.S.S.R. Savings Bank.  </P> <P> FUND INVESTORS' MARKET VIEWS  </P> <P> Here are mutual fund purchase, redemption and net cash inflow/outflow totals  for key fund categories in October. The figures show investors remained  positive on stocks, but yanked big money from U.S. government bond and junk  bond funds.  </P> <P> October data in (millions)  </P> <TABLE

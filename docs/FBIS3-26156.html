Locked up in the Tongge Heading Radiator Factory on the  outskirts of Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, they worked hard more  than 12 hours a day, but only three meals were provided for.    "The housing and wages stipulated on the contract were  hollow  words," Wang Li, head of the Yilong labour wrote to the Yilong  Administration Bureau of Employment Service (YABES), which had  signed the contract with the radiator factory and recruited them  for the job.    "Help us, if you didn't tell us a lie," he continued.    Upon receiving Wang's letter, Zhang Youlun, the director of  the employment service bureau immediately flew to Taiyuan to  talk with the labour contractor at the privately run factory.    Zhang travelled back and forth between Yilong and Taiyuan  five times. He negotiated hard and long before being able to  get his village folks back home with their wages.    Compared with millions of other peasant labourers from  China's most populous province, Wang Li and his fellow-townsmen  were fortunate.    They were organized and were contract labourers with the  local Employment Service Administrative Bureau, a new  subdivision of the local county government, while many others  are not. "They are blind drifters," Wang said.    While the "blind drifters" flock into cities in early spring  with little idea where to locate jobs and how to secure wages  and other benefits, the jobs and wages for Wang and his folks  were secured. When they ran into problems, they had Zhang and  his colleagues to help them settle the problems.    "Though the factory fooled both the employment service and  us, we could still have the agency to represent us and to fight  in our interest," Wang said. "This has made us feel safe."    That's the duty of the YABES, one of 50 branches of the  Sichuan Administration Bureau of Employment Service (SABES)  which is now spreading all over Sichuan.    With its branches in Sichuan and four administration offices  in Beijing, Xiamen, Guangzhou and Haikou, SABES, as a government  organization set up in 1987, has been providing services for a  few hundred thousand country labourers in Sichuan who spend the  better part of a year working away from home either in the  province or in prosperous coastal areas and major cities.    More than five million Sichuan peasants working outside the  province are sending money back to their homes, thus creating an  important source of income to the province. In 1992, the  labourers sent back more than 8 billion yuan ($1.38 billion).    But the job is not easy.    "No other thing is more difficult than `dealing with'  people," Tan Renzhou, an official with SABES, said.    At first, the work was routine. Staff members at the  branches of the bureau simply granted "work permits" to those  labourers who wanted to find work in other provinces.    They examined tens of thousands of labourers' resumes a year  and conducted interviews. People who applied for the work  permit would have to prove that they were physically strong and  had no criminal record, and pay 50 yuan ($5.7).    The resume plus the 50 yuan would soon land the applicants  in  jobs the bureau helped to locate.    But soon, Tan and his colleagues discovered that it was very  difficult to locate jobs for the millions of people. To look  for better and more openings, they had to maintain frequent  contact with all kinds of enterprises.    Tan said they mainly worked with the State and  collective-owned factories, rarely privately-run enterprises.    "As the go-between of the labourers and the employers, we  are  responsible not only to businesses, but also to our Sichuan  labourers," Tan said.    To take up the responsibility, they often had to haggle with  those enterprises to secure the best possible wages, housing,  and working hours.    To make sure that the businesses followed the contract, Tan  and his colleagues often visited those enterprises on the spot  to check.    Over the years, SABES and its branches have worked out good  relationships with Sichuan labourers and also with many  companies across the country.    For instance, in 1990, the Guangda Toy Factory on the  Dongguan County in Guangdong asked the service's main  headquarters in Chengdu, the provincial capital, for 800  workers. SABES handed the request to its branch in Xichong  County, a relatively poor county with a large number of surplus  countryside labourers.    Under the guidance of the county employment service, the 800  peasants left home and began their work. They worked in teams,  and leaders were appointed who could write to the branch  frequently.    In the same year, Liu Minxian, head of the county employment  service branch visited the factory twice.    As time went by those Xichong peasants gained a foothold in  the city.    In comparison with colleagues in Sichuan, the employment  service officials working in local offices are dealing with what  they call more trifling issues.    Ju Haiyan, the 32-year-old woman official of the Beijing  branch of the service, takes charge of about 10,000 Sichuan  labourers who have obtained work permits to work in Beijing from  the service.    The few weeks after the Spring Festival are the busiest  period of the year, she said, when labourers from the  countryside pour into Beijing and other major cities in China.    Besides cooperating with the Beijing Labour Bureau to grant  the "Beijing Temporary Living Permit" to them, she said she has  mainly handled conflicts between labourers and their employers  in Beijing.    In May last year, Ju got calls from both the Sichuan  labourers and their employer at the Beijing Plush Bird Factory  in the suburbs of Beijing, which signed an employment contract  with SABES.    The employer complained that some of the 30 workers from  Sichuan had already left while others had stopped working.    But Chen Jun, the young team leader of the Sichuan workers  reported that they had been leading a dull life, "even worse  than that at home," and that they were earning about 200 yuan  ($35) a month, "too little to save any after eating in this  expensive city."    Ju went to the factory to investigate. She found that the  factory failed to provide the contract Sichuan workers the  chance to see films or videos. There wasn't even a library.    Ju first consulted with the factory management and it  promised to furnish a reading room and a few entertainment  facilities, such as pingpong tables for the young migrants.    She also talked with the young Sichuan workers, persuading  them that their experience working at the factory would be  beneficial to their future development. In three days, the  young migrants began to work again.    But it was still regrettable for her that the factory  refused  to give those labourers a pay raise.    "First, the average wage level of Beijing is lower than that  in the coastal areas," Ju explained with some regret.    "Of course, all factories need just `cheap' labour."    Today, Tan, Ju and their colleagues are trying to expand the  service's influence.    Tan admitted that he and his colleagues had not been able to  strike accords with privately-run businesses and thus, they had  not been able to secure protection and benefits for Sichuan  workers working in those enterprises.    He said the service would try to amend their shortcomings.    "After all, if the labourers get good administration, they  will become a huge source of wealth for Sichuan," he said.</p>

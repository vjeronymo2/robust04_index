In addition, a Pounds 10m cut in the value of Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea play, went straight to the balance sheet. Cabra said this left a net asset value per share of 17.13p making total assets of Pounds 16.5m. Net debt, which is on demand, remained at about Pounds 52m, according to Mr John Duggan, chairman. He said Cabra had the support of its bankers. Losses per share, after a Pounds 474,000 tax credit, were 11.34p (5.81p) and the interim dividend is passed (0.1p).</p>

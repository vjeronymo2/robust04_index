			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Bonds: BAe storms back to market with record Dollars 400m offer FOR THE second day running, Eurobond investors rushed to snap up a large, generously-priced dollar bond issue as British Aerospace launched the largest Eurodollar deal yet by a British company. The five-year, Dollars 400m deal - increased from Dollars 300m due to demand  -marked a storming return by a borrower which had studiously avoided the public markets since its disastrous rights issue last summer and subsequent management upheaval. With its credit ratings recently reaffirmed at A2/A+, and with a new boardroom line-up finally completed, the yield on offer yesterday - 111 basis points over US treasuries - was seen as attractive. Other similar credits, such as Reed and Ericsson, currently trade at a yield spread of around 90 basis points. In later trading, the BAe spread tightened to some 106 basis points. 'My philosophy is not to squeeze the last basis point or two out of the Euromarket - it will only come back to haunt you,' said Mr Tony Rice, BAe treasurer. The company had originally planned to raise between Dollars 200 and Dollars 250m, but was happy to take more. 'Liquidity in the bilateral and syndicated London banking market is very low at the moment,' said Mr Rice. 'This gives us a very strong negotiating position with our banks.' The proceeds were not swapped, though; had they been, the cost to the borrower would have been around 60 basis points over Libor - roughly in line with what the group's banks would expect to earn, said Mr Rice. Meanwhile, yesterday's Dollars 500m sell-out issue for Compagnie Bancaire was priced as expected to yield 75 basis points over Treasuries, and tightened later to a spread of under 72 basis points. Yesterday also saw a continuing flow of Ecu transactions, although none achieved the success of the Ecu150 deal from Johnson &amp; Johnson the day before. The most difficult deal to sell was reported to be a Ecu110m issue from Nederlandse Gasunie. The five-year bonds from the AAA-rated borrower came to the market offering a yield of 8.8 per cent - just below the yield on the benchmark Credit Local issue, and some nine basis points lower than the level at which the Johnson &amp; Johnson issue had settled. 'It's expensive - it's no gift,' said one banker involved in the transaction. More favourably received was a Ecu150m, five-year issue from Philip Morris - a single-A rated borrower - offering a yield of 9.3 per cent. The deal was said to be selling well to Swiss and other continental European investors, although, as with the NedGas issue, the syndicate was not broken yesterday. Both issues were brought by Paribas, which also launched the first Ecu issue for the Republic of Turkey. The Ecu150m, three-year deal, with a yield of 11.55 per cent, was priced to offer a spread of 200 basis points over the three-year swap rate. At that level, it offers a significant pick up over the three-year floating-rate issue from Greece, which yesterday was trading at a spread of under 100 basis points over Libor. The issue had been marketed in advance to high-yield funds and other investors, and was said to have been well taken up, with the bulk of the issue going to such investors rather than to banks.</p>

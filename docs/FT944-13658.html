			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Cray expects lower earnings Cray Research, the world's leading supercomputer manufacturer, said it expected lower earnings in the fourth quarter and in 1995, in spite of higher than expected third-quarter earnings. Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 16m, or 62 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 220m, compared with Dollars 15.3m, or 58 cents, on revenues of Dollars 202m in the same period last year. Wall Street analysts had been projecting earnings of about 30 cents a share. Cray noted that its quarterly earnings can swing significantly, depending upon when it ships a single multi-million dollar supercomputer. It said that it had signed almost as many new orders in the third quarter as in the first half of the year. However, the average selling prices of Cray's supercomputers is declining as it expands commercial sales. 'We expect to grow revenues for the full year, but we won't achieve our goal of 10 per cent revenue growth,' said Mr John Carlson, chairman and chief executive. The company projected lower revenues and income for 1995. In the fourth quarter Cray will take a previously-announced restructuring charge of about Dollars 8.5m, or 25 cents. For the year to date, net earnings were Dollars 46.2m, or Dollars 1.78 a share, on revenues of Dollars 684.5m. This compares with net earnings of Dollars 36.5m, or Dollars 1.40, on revenues of Dollars 592.2m in the same period last year.</p>

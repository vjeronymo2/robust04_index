			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FASTPITCH SOFTBALL;  </P> <P> BLASTERS, WOLVERINES FIND SOME SOLACE IN DEFEATS  </P> <P> It was some consolation for Laguna Hills Blasters Coach Robert Melendrez when  the La Crescenta Condors defeated the Texas Illusions, 1-0, Monday for the  title in the American Fastpitch Assn. fifth International Friendship Tournament  at Maxwell Park in Anaheim.  </P> <P> The title game allowed the Blasters a measure of pride. The Blasters can say  they lost to the eventual champions.  </P> <P> The Anaheim Wolverines, only other Orange County girls' softball team to  advance to the quarterfinals, can make the same claim. The Wolverines also were  eliminated by the Condors, losing, 2-1.  </P> <P> La Crescenta knocked the Blasters out of the tournament in the semifinal round  with a 2-0 victory.  </P> <P> "I think we just ran out of gas," Melendrez said. Laguna Hills played seven  games in the four-day tournament.  </P> <P> In the quarterfinals, Laguna Hills defeated a 3-0 team, the Camarillo Breakers,  2-1.  </P> <P> "We laid the bunts down and slapped (the ball) in that game," Melendrez said.  </P> <P> But the Condors matched the Blasters' style of play in the semifinal round.  </P> <P> "It is tough for us to beat them because they are quick like us. Give me a big,  slow team (to play) anytime," he said.  </P> <P> The Blasters won't win many games with power. They peck away, a run at a time.  </P> <P> Said Blaster infielder Erika Frazier: "We just didn't have the same amount of  intensity as we did in the first game today."  </P> <P> They also were without Maureen Del Mazzio, a Canyon High player, who started  the semifinal game but left because of pain from her impacted wisdom teeth.  </P> <P> "One player in a critical position, like Mo (Maureen), can make so much of a  difference in a game," Melendrez said.  </P> <P> La Crescenta, defeating Texas in extra innings, scored the winning run in the  bottom of the eighth when Tina Baca lined a single into right-center field,  scoring Jeanne Mixon, who had tripled.  </P> <P> "I had stranded several runners today," Baca said. "I wasn't intimidated (in  that spot), but I knew I had to do something."  </P> <P> The Condors' pitchers did their part too.  </P> <P> In the victory over the Blasters, Jenny Berry pitched a two-hitter. Against the  Illusions, Janell Campbell pitched a four-hitter.  </P> <P> The victory also gave La Crescenta a measure of revenge.  </P> <P> Texas, which emerged from pool play without a loss, had defeated La Crescenta,  2-1, Saturday on a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the seventh.  </P></p>

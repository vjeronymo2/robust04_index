			<p>BFN     [Text] Yokohama, April 19 KYODO -- The Yokohama District  Court found Tuesday [19 April] two former leaders of now-defunct  support groups for a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmaker,  guilty of receiving tax refunds illegally through submitting  false accounts.    The court sentenced Yoshio Nagano, 52, to 18 months  imprisonment with four years' suspension and a 5 million yen  fine, and Kiichiro Hara, 51, to one year imprisonment suspended  for three years and a 3 million yen fine. The two previously  led political groups for LDP House of Representatives member  Akira Amari.    From 1989 to 1991, they submitted to the Kanagawa Prefecture  Election Monitoring Committee reports of donations 10 times  greater than those actually received. According to the  accounts, the men received tax refunds and evaded some 68  million yen in taxes.    Judge Hiroshi Akiyama said, "their criminal liabilities are  serious since they established the political groups for the  purpose of tax evasion by making unlawful use of the (state's)  tax rebate system."</p>

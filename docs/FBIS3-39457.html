This was confirmed by the German  liaison command with the Western Group of Russian Forces in  Berlin on Wednesday [16 February]. In view of the high risk,  the Bundeswehr demands immediate clarification. It was stated  that the missing ammunition cannot be found on any list.    According to an official statement by Matvey Burlakov, the  commander in chief of the Russian forces in eastern Germany, the  ammunition was used up at training sites, said Bundeswehr  Lieutenant Commander Klaus Heermeier. However, he thinks that  this is completely unlikely. [passage omitted]</p>

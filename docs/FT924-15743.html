			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Compaq attacks Japan market COMPAQ, the US personal computer company, yesterday launched a line of cheap desktop computers in Japan in an effort to lift its almost negligible share in the market. The launch looked certain to accelerate the decline of PC prices in Japan, which tend to be much higher than in the US or Europe. However, analysts said Compaq's small presence in the market would mean the impact of its lower prices would be slow to be felt. The computers are almost identical to computers Compaq launched in the US in June, and the prices in Japan only slightly higher. The main difference is they will be equipped with the DOS/V operating system which can accommodate Japanese language programmes as well as normal IBM-compatible programmes. The computers are strikingly cheaper than similar computers on the local market and will provide a test case of whether it is possible to build market share in Japan on the basis of lower prices and US-style marketing. Compaq will, for example, be the first computer vendor to offer a toll-free phone line to give advice to its customers. The cheapest model, with an Intel i386sx microprocessor and 2 megabits of active memory will sell for Y128,000 (Dollars 1,030), roughly half the recommended price of a similarly-equipped computer from NEC, which supplies over half of the Japanese market. The actual difference in price will be smaller because high dealer margins for an NEC machine leave room for bigger discounting. Mr Masaru Murai, president of Compaq's Japanese subsidiary, said: 'I think this will change the personal computer world in Japan and that is our objective in this market. We are not here to introduce a price war. We are here to expand the market.' Compaq's main competitors in Japan, such as NEC Toshiba did not appear worried by the competition. Mr Katsuichi Tomita, general manager of NEC's PC marketing division, said NEC had in the past decade brought down the price of computers and this would continue. Mr Steven Myers, analyst at Jardine Flemming Securities, said: 'NEC will have to make some response, but in all likelihood they will not have to match Compaq's prices.' Compaq has signed on more than 40 dealers, which have 500 to 600 shops. It has contracts with two Japanese companies to provide on-site servicing.</p>

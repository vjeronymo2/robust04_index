			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hiroshi Yano, Tadao Akashi, and Takayuki Kohama </F> of the Metal Forming Engineering Division, Toyota Motor  Corporation; MS received 12 May 93]    [Text] Auto manufacturers rely on computers to provide  superior motor vehicles at lower prices, thus meeting the needs  of society and responding rapidly to market demands. In the  forging of parts as well, the application of computers (CAE)  began in the field of CAD and CAM, and has now expanded into  analytical simulation.    This paper introduces the application of CAE to forged part  design. First, we introduce a comprehensive two-dimensional  forging process design support system, FESTE, which Toyota Motor  Corporation has successfully developed in-house. Secondly, the  current topics of CAE application, such as three-dimensional  parts simulation and automatic three-dimensional modeling, are  described.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   The production of automobile forged parts is characterized  by  the fact that a wide variety of such parts are produced in large  quantities. So during the production preparation process, the  efficient use of computers is indispensable.    The application of computers to forging in our company began  with CAD and CAM, and has now expanded to analytical simulation.  In this report, CAE denotes comprehensive computer-aided  support, including CAD, CAM and simulation.    This report introduces a comprehensive design process  support  system, FESTE, developed with forging simulation techniques as  its nucleus, and refers to examples of CAE application to forged  part design.  <H5>  2. Purpose of Forging CAE </H5>   Forging process design used to depend largely on the  know-how, or empirical rules, of expert designers. Before making  the final decision for mass-production, the conventional method  was to repeat designs and test on a trial-and-error basis. There  is increasing demand for better quality raw materials, more  precise shapes and the use of light alloy, and a special need in  the preparatory stage of such production is to shorten the lead  time, the time from development to mass-production. Hence the  requirement for a more active role of CAE. Figure 1 shows the  flow of the design process with CAE. The following paragraphs  describe the purpose of introducing CAE into practical design  work.    a) Reduction of test frequency: This is achieved through  simulation experiments to screen proposed designs.    b) Efficient procedure of the design process: Design work  itself improved via computerized automation.    c) Better quality: Designer fully uses CAE to develop high  value forging parts.    d) Cost reduction: Cost for die production and test are  reduced as a result of better design.    e) Single-source data control: To use common data in  CAD/CAE/CAM can shorten the time from design to mass-production.     <H5>  3. Two-Dimensional Forging Process Design Support System </H5>   3.1. Features and General Description of FESTE,  Two-Dimensional Forging Process Design Support System    Even in the case of symmetrical parts, such as transmission  gears, it is becoming more and more difficult to get the best  production design within a short period, based solely on  empirical rules. Hence, FESTE is designed to form a simple  system, available for die designers themselves, to run  simulation, and automatically following a standardized die  design process. FESTE has the following features: a) easy  operation; b) high analytical precision; c) time-saving  procedures; d) short time requirement and e) single-source data  control.    3.2. Forging Rigid-Plastic FEM Simulator    The features of the simulator, which stands at the center of  the FESTE system, are as follows.    (1) Rigid-plastic finite element method    The rigid-plastic finite element method (FEM) is a method of  numerical analysis where the subject material is treated as a  rigid-plastic body, so elastic deformation of the materials may  be ignored. Among the advantages of this method are that errors  attributable to stress do not accumulate, it permits greater  deformation per step, and strain rate sensitivity can be  considered in the design. Due to these advantages, it provides a  practical means of analysis which has a rapid calculation  ability in the case of extensive plastic deformation, as occurs  in forging.    Hence, we adopted a theory (1) based on the compression  characteristics method, which is free from theoretical  contradictions in yielding conditions, stress and the like.    (2) Database    In practical use of the simulation system, two factors play  a  key role, the way the database (DB) is used, and its precision.  The database consists of: 1) material characteristics DB; and 2)  tool-to-material friction conditions DB. The material  characteristics are approximated according to the following  expression:  &lt;/graphic&gt;     The material characteristics DB is expressed by a matrix of  the nature of materials with temperature, which classifies the  values, a, b, n and m. The tool-to-material friction conditions  DB is a matrix of the processing method with temperature, in  which the friction coefficient &mgr; obtained from Coulomb  friction is classified. We have succeeded in expressing vast  amounts of our experimental data and previous expertise  numerically, which makes it possible to use the most appropriate  database for practical analysis conditions.    (3) Output of analysis results    The information which designers must obtain from analysis  includes: 1) deformed profile; 2) cavity filling; 3) stroke vs.  load curve; 4) die pressure distribution; 5) stress distribution  (e.g., equivalent stress and stresses in respective directions);  and 6) strain distribution (e.g., equivalent strain and strains  in respective directions).    Figure 2 shows the results of the forming simulation of a  forged transmission gear, including the results of analysis of  deformed profile, equivalent strain distribution and die  pressure distribution.       3.3. Example of System Application    The example given here is the system applied to the design  process of forged raw materials for a transmission gear, in a  closed forging process using a high-speed automatic press  (Figure 3). As shown in Figure 4, the raw materials are  generally worked into final shape from cut materials in three to  four steps.             (1) Determination of forged material shape    The forged material shape is determined with the aid of  two-dimensional CAD based on the forged material shape data, to  which machining stock removal and die draft angle are added,  considering the best possible forging method with reference to  the CAD database of shape of parts determined at our development  division (Figure 5).       (2) Consideration of process plan    In forging generally, several processes should be  considered.  It is conventional to rely on empirical know-how in screening  proposed designs. FESTE makes it possible to judge the design  based on simulation, so all the designer has to do is to draft  on CAD more than one plan with different volume distributions  (Figure 6).       (3) FEM data preparation    Process data prepared with CAD are automatically converted  into FEM analysis data. Process drawing data for the second  process, for example, is converted into pre-forming material  shape data for use in FEM analysis and the third process data  into upper and lower tool shape data for the same purpose  (Figure 7).       For material forming, the best element division is  automatically accomplished with reference to the element  division database in consideration of tool shape and working  method. Further, once the type of forming material and the press  to be used are specified, FEM data are completed.    Moreover, apart from the preparation of process plans with  CAD, the forming material shape can be freely converted with the  use of shape parameters, which provide a simple means of  considering the design assuming different dimensions (Figure 8).       (4) Execution of FEM analysis    FEM analysis is executed on EWS, which are exclusively used  by CAE, in about 10 minutes.    The results of analysis are controlled as a database,  classified by type of part, to allow designers to refer to past  analysis results on similar parts.    (5) Evaluation of analysis results    Analysis results provide designers with information as to  forming load, die pressure, cavity filling and others, which  allow them to make a comprehensive judgment. Figure 9 shows the  results of a comparison of cavity filling between plans A and B.  In plan A, as the material deformed, it filled the outer  portion. This implies the possibility that flash could develop  if the material penetrated into the clearance between upper and  lower tools as work proceeds. In plan B, however, filling turned  out to be uniform and well-balanced until the final stage. With  consideration given to other factors as well, such as forming  load, plan B was adopted for mass-production.       Furthermore, using elastic FEM software, dies are evaluated  for strength based on the results of analyzed die pressure  distribution (Figure 10).       Should problems be found with process plans during this  stage, designers return to steps (1) and (2), and seek again the  best process design on computer.    (6) Automatic drafting of die, assembly, and process drawing    This is done based on the process data used for simulation.    Although die design work was standardized to a large extent,  it used to take a great deal of time because of the great number  of dies to be designed. FESTE picks up the process data on CAD  described in (5), and works automatically to submit the design  of the best die division, details and installation jigs,  automatically printing out process and die design, and die  assembly drawings. Figure 11 shows a die assembly drawing thus  automatically designed.       (7) Die manufacturing    NC data are prepared based on die manufacturing data,  subsequently initiating die manufacturing. After inspection, the  die is tested on an actual press, before proceeding with  mass-production.    3.4. System Evaluation    Test results agreed very well with simulation results from  FESTE and no problems occurred in mass-production. The support  system shortened design time to one quarter that of conventional  design. Owing to the high precision of the improved design  process, the frequency of tests required is reduced, and lead  time has been greatly shortened.  <H5>  4. CAE for Three-Dimensional Forging Parts </H5>   4.1. Three-Dimensional Simulation Technique    Many problems remain to be solved in the analysis of  three-dimensional parts, such as increased calculation time, and  the establishment of automatic division techniques into element  and tool definition methods. At present, this type of analysis  is performed with nearly axially symmetrical parts. Figure 12  shows the results of three-dimensional analysis for extrusion of  an inner spline extrusion.&lt;sup&gt; (2)&lt;/sup&gt;       4.2. Automatic Modeling System    Although it is now difficult to simulate specially shaped  parts with three dimensions, automatic process design, based on  parameter input, and the automatic three-dimensional modeling  system, can be employed for the parts for which the design  process is standardized. With dimension parameters input as  parts data, this system automatically calculates stock removal,  draft angle and other requirements, and formed out forging  process design including preforming design, to automatically  draw up a model in three dimensions. The expertise of die  designers is incorporated in this design process, making it  possible to generate the desired forging process as  three-dimensional data. Figure 13 shows the results of automatic  three-dimensional modeling of a connecting rod using this  support system and the cutter location obtained from the data  used. It is clear from this diagram that three-dimensional  modeling work time, which used to be very long, is shortened and  that the system reduces the time for design work, significantly  reducing lead time.     <H5>  5. Conclusions </H5>   This report introduced the practical application of  two-dimensional CAE to the forging of automobile parts and the  current state of development of the three-dimensional system at  Toyota Motor Corporation. The recent expansion of CAE  application was made possible by rapid progress in computer  technology, the strong need for such a system from the very  beginning of research, and strenuous efforts in its development.    In the future it should achieve drastic work transformation,  following the concept of concurrent engineering, which  encompasses in its scope all the design stages, from design to  production, based on CAE.

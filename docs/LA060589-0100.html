Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS BLOCK LOPEZ CANYON  </P> <P> Neighbors of the Lopez Canyon Landfill blocked garbage trucks from entering the  dump today, for the third time this year.  </P> <P> About 30 protesters, who live in Lake View Terrace, Pacoima and Kagel Canyon,  said they believe that the city-operated landfill is hazardous to their health.  The Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation denies that the dump is dangerous.  </P> <P> Today's protest was aimed at a meeting of the California Waste Management Board  scheduled for Friday in Los Angeles. At that meeting, board members will review  the dump's operating permit, which is out of date.  </P> <P> The protest ended after about an hour, when Los Angeles police officers  threatened to arrest protesters if they did not disperse.  </P></p>

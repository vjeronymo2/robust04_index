			<p>BFN     [Text] Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], explained his view that on the  precondition that the Hata cabinet resigns en masse, the SDPJ  may return to the coalition government. In this regard, Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata said in the evening of 22 May: "I am sure  that (Mr. Kubo) will come to see me or call me to talk about his  trip to China. There is no change in our policy of keeping  seats for (the SDPJ) and they are welcome to come back at any  time. I have to deal with the situation after directly talking  to him." Hata made these comments to a group of reporters at  his official residence.</p>

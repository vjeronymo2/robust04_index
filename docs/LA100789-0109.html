			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'OLD GRINGO' DRAWS LATINO PROTEST  </P> <P> "Where are the Mexicans?" "Mexicans Without Mejicanos?" "Jane Fonda and  Columbia Exploits Mexican History." "The Story of Mexico for the Mexicans."  </P> <P> Those were some of the placards carried by 25 Latino demonstrators who  protested Thursday night outside the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and  Sciences in Beverly Hills before a screening of Columbia Pictures' "Old  Gringo," which stars Jane Fonda, Gregory Peck and Jimmy Smits as a Mexican  revolutionary.  </P> <P> "We are sick of the 'Macho-Latino-lover' images that Hollywood creates about  Mexicans to bring out the fantasy," said Raul Ruiz, a professor of Hispanic  studies at Cal State Northridge, coordinator of the protest, which included  members of several Mexican-American groups.  </P> <P> While picketing, Virginia Reade chanted: "Jane Fonda is a racist. She promotes  herself as a liberal? The director (Argentine Luis Puenzo) had to go to Mexico  to learn the history of our country, the leading actor had to learn how to be a  macho-Mexicano. . . . We also have Mexican stars."  </P> <P> However, Steve Rivers, Fonda's spokesman, said: "Smits was just the best actor  for the part. 'Old Gringo' is an American bilingual movie. This film is not  about Mexico and the Mexican Revolution. Mexico is used only as a backdrop."  JOCELINE FRANK  </P></p>

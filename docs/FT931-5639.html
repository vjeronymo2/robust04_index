			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Matra to challenge minivan ruling in court MATRA HACHETTE, the French transport and telecoms group, is mounting a court challenge to the European Commission's decision approving the Volkswagen and Ford minivan joint venture. Matra, which developed the Espace minivan with Renault in the 1980s, also promised yesterday to continue fighting the Commission's 'unfair' grant of Ecu750m (Pounds 619.5m) in regional and social aid to the car manufacturers' new minivan plant in Portugal. Mr Yves Sabouret, Matra director in charge of EC affairs, said yesterday: 'Matra will go on using all the means at its disposal to question decisions which obviously contradict all principles of industrial efficiency and social justice (in the Community)." Mr Sabouret said EC support for the VW/Ford plant at Setubal would create dangerous overcapacity in European production of minivans - 'the only healthy, balanced market in the EC car industry'. Matra said the Renault Espace was still the market leader in Europe, accounting for 65,000 of the 100,000 minivans sold in 1992. But Mr Frederic d'Allest, Matra managing director responsible for cars, said analysts had estimated that with the help of EC funding VW/Ford could grab 40 or 50 per cent of the growing market within a year of opening in 1995. The case against last December's competition decision will be heard by the European Court's lower chamber, the Court of First Instance. Matra is already challenging the July grant of Ecu750m of EC development and training subsidies in the main European Court, and is expecting a preliminary opinion on the case by the end of April. The Commission exempted the VW/Ford joint venture from competition rules just before Christmas until the end of 2004, subject to certain conditions. Among the reasons given for incentives was that the market was dominated by a single supplier - Matra/Renault - and that co-operation would have 'extremely positive effects on infrastructure and employment in one of the poorest regions in the Community'. But Matra claimed yesterday that the VW/Ford venture fulfilled none of the criteria for exemption from the rules. Ford said it had been expecting a court challenge and believed the Commission had acted properly. A spokesman for Mr Karel Van Miert, who took over as EC competition commissioner in January, refused to comment the case.</p>

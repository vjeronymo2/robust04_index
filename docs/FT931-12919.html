			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Clinton's first state of the union address to be delivered on Feb 17 President Bill Clinton's first state of the union address will be delivered on February 17, the White House announced yesterday, Jurek Martin reports from Washington. This will beat by a symbolic one day President Ronald Reagan's initial state of the union message in 1981. Far more than last week's more spiritual inaugural address, it will encompass legislative priorities at home and external foreign policy objectives, though the fine print of Mr Clinton's extensive list of domestic proposals is unlikely to be ready before mid-March. As part of the preparation, the president is taking his cabinet this weekend to his Camp David retreat to debate policy options. On Monday he named his wife Hillary Clinton to head the health-care reform task force.</p>

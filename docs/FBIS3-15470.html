			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yegor Gaydar, leader of the State Duma faction  Russia's Choice, believes that there are "substantial  discrepancies between those numbers mentioned by the Russian  president in his address to the Federal Assembly on February 24  and numbers voiced by the prime minister at the extended sitting  of the government on March 4."    "This contradictions concern the inflation's  reference-points, the key aspect of the 1994 economic policy;  the thing is that they are not of a quantitative but of a  qualitative nature," he underlined during his conversation with  journalists on Friday.    According to Gaydar, the presidential address "lays hope at  least for a relative opportunity to reach monetary stability  this year, it gives hope to stabilize volumes of production and  create premises for its further growth;" at the same time the  analysis of the budget submitted by the government "leaves no  hopes for this."    Speaking about prospects of the budget's consideration in  the  State Duma, Gaydar said that "he is absolutely convinced that  the branch ministers will themselves, or via their  representatives in parliamentary committees, urge to increase  appropriations for all possible articles." "I am afraid that  this will result in a proposal to increase the budget deficit to  20-30 Tn rubles," he said.    As far as Russia's Choice faction is concerned, it will not  back the budget during its discussion in the Duma if "serious  corrections in the structure and volume of expenditures"  primarily aimed at "lowering of the general level of state  pressure on the budget" are not introduced into it," said  Gaydar.    Responding to Interfax, Gaydar said that even after the  government's program is made public it will be hard for him to  make any political prognosis for 1994. "A political prognosis,  as well as an economic one, does not depend upon public speeches  but upon concrete economic decision. Decisions adopted by the  government even during the last few days surprisingly contradict  to each other," said Gaydar.</p>

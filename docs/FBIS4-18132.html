			<p>BFN     [Text] The French Basque separatist organization,  Iparretarrak, announced in a communique on Wednesday evening [30  March] that it will continue the "armed struggle" for as long as  "its essential aims have not been achieved."    Iparretarrak has, however, said that it might be prepared to  reconsider its activist policy in the case of "an unconditional  amnesty of all Basque prisoners and a dialogue."    Iparretarrak has been blamed by police for setting an  explosive device against a military truck in Dax on Monday  evening.</p>

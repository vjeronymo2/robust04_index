			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper's break out pulls other base metals higher - Market report COPPER prices broke up out of their recent ranges at the London Metal Exchange yesterday afternoon, pulling other metals higher. Fresh speculative interest fuelled a rise that triggered stop-loss buying orders above Dollars 2,475 a tonne for three months delivery. The price closed at Dollars 2,482.50, up Dollars 35, before being trimmed back to Dollars 2,478 in after hours trading. Some traders expectations of a further decline in LME warehouse stocks were supportive. ALUMINIUM tracked copper but was not able fully to match its gains as there is a sizeable resistance area stretching up towards the Dollars 1,550 a tonne level for the three months position, which closed at Dollars 1,52.50, up Dollars 10. Three months ZINC finally broke above Dollars 1,000 a tonne as the bullish enthusiasm of copper and aluminium spilled over. Stop-loss buying took the price up to the day's high, with final business at Dollars 1,006, a Dollars 12 gain. LEAD was also steadier, although three months metal continued to meet stubborn resistance near the Dollars 600-a-tonne level. It finished at Dollars 596, up Dollars 4. Compiled from Reuters</p>

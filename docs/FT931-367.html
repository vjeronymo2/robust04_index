			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Israel Discount ahead 53.6% ISRAEL Discount Bank, the country's third-largest bank, yesterday reported a significant 53.6 per cent increase in net profits for 1992 to Shk145.4m (Dollars 52.6m). This sharp rise was attributed to a decrease in the size of the bank's provision for bad debts and to an increase in income from non-banking activities, mainly services involving the capital markets and foreign currency. Israel Discount's bad debt provision fell from Shk157.1m in 1991, when the country's banks were forced to make considerable write-offs for loans given to the troubled agricultural sector, to Shk128.4m last year. The bank's consolidated assets totalled Shk17.5bn at the end of the year, increasing 14.7 per cent from the previous year. Shareholders' equity rose 10.5 per cent to Shk2.6bn, while net return on shareholders' equity was up from 4.7 per cent in 1991 to 7 per cent in 1992. Israel Discount Bank of New York, the bank's major subsidiary and the largest Israeli bank operating abroad, increased its net profits in 1992 to Dollars 14.1m from Dollars 11m in the previous year. The bank said these results were 'satisfactory, surpassing last year's despite the economic condition in the US'. The New York bank's balance sheet totalled Dollars 3.9bn at the end of the year.</p>

Addressing today's full meeting of the current session of  the  CPPCC National Committee, David S. H. Chu, said, "economic  development can spur progress in sports. Meanwhile, progress in  sports can also improve the quality of a nation, and promote  economic prosperity and progress.    In the course of deepening reforms and opening China wider  to  the outside world, he said, it is necessary to mobilize all  positive factors to invigorate the Chinese nation, including the  full use of comprehensive and great functions of sports.    The fact that China's bidding for the holding of the 2000  Olympic Games won full support of the entire Chinese people  shows cohesiveness of the Chinese nation, he said.    Now, there are more and more countries loving peace and  understanding and backing China, he added.    According to Chu, bidding to hold major international sports  meets is a great honor for a country or a nation.    For a large country like China, it is far from enough to  hold  just several international sports meets every year, he said.    The state should encourage cities and localities that have  never held such meets to submit bidding, he said.    Cities and localities that have held such meets should bid  to  host more. "To this end, the state should formulate a series of  encouragement policies," he said.    He revealed that he is currently assisting the state physics  culture and sports commission in bidding for the holding of a  major international sports meet -- the China Bicycle World Cup  Tournament.    Talks on cooperation have been held with two TV networks:  CBS  in the United States and Sky in Europe, he said.    The 12-day tournament is scheduled to start from Hong Kong  to  the Tiananmen Square in Beijing via Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Nanjing  and Tianjin. The two networks will televise live the tournament  four hours daily.    The successful bidding for the tournament will not only help  improve China's cycling standards, but also will enable the  cities the cyclists will move through to open wider to the  outside world, said Chu, who is vice president of the China Golf  Association and chairman of the Mission Hills Golf Club in  Shenzhen, Guangdong Province.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Telegraph sells Trinity stake and buys into Canada THE TELEGRAPH has sold its near-13 per cent stake in Trinity International, the publishing group, for Pounds 26.8m and is buying half of the 22.6 per cent stake in Southam, the Canadian newspaper group acquired recently by Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger Group. Mr Black, chairman of the Telegraph, built up the interest in Trinity, publisher of the Liverpool Post and Echo in 1990, almost certainly in the hope that the Telegraph would one day be able to increase its stake or even take over the group. Like Mr Black, Trinity has a string of small papers in Canada. Hollinger paid CDollars 259m (Pounds 141m) for the stake in Southam, Canada's largest newspaper publisher with 18 daily papers and interests in business information services and trade publications. The Telegraph is to pay half of that. The sale of the Trinity holding to a wide range of UK institutional shareholders, suggests that Mr Black has conceded that he had little chance of winning control of the company in the foreseeable future. There are only 12 voting shares, and they are held by directors. The unusual structure was created in 1904, when the company was first incorporated, to protect its then Liberal political line against potential Conservative predators. Mr Black, through Hollinger, bought 5.6m of the shares at prices ranging from 170p to 200p in July 1990. The final total of 8.74m shares was sold, it is believed, at 320p, producing a pre-tax profit on the deal of Pounds 6.5m. Last May the Trinity stock was acquired by the Telegraph as part of a reorganisation prior to the listing of the Telegraph on the Stock Exchange. The money will be put on deposit. Mr Philip Graf, Trinity's managing director designate, commenting on the sale yesterday, said: 'We are very pleased. We understand the shares have been placed with a wide spread of institutions.' Trinity said it keeps its voting structure under review, but it is clear it does not feel under any real pressure to change it at the moment. In March, Trinity was able to raise some Pounds 23m from a rights issue to help pay for its Pounds 45m purchase of Scottish and Universal Newspapers. Participation by the Telegraph in Southam is subject to the approval of Southam's independent directors and the Telegraph's shareholders, other than Hollinger. Hollinger holds a 68.1 per cent stake in the Telegraph. The statement said the Telegraph's cash resources, together with the Pounds 26.8m proceeds of the Trinity sale yesterday would be sufficient to cover about 75 per cent of the cost of the proposed joint venture interest. Hollinger paid CDollars 18.10 a share for its stake in Southam, shares of which were yesterday trading at CDollars 15 1/4 . Last month Mr William Ardell, Southam's chief executive, said the Canadian group planned to forge closer links with Mr Black's other international publishing investments, the Daily Telegraph in the UK and Australia's Fairfax Holdings. Mr Ardell said that he foresaw opportunities to create products, including improvements to existing papers.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Kuwait warned it may lose tax immunity KUWAIT has been warned that it is in danger of losing its valuable sovereign immunity from taxation in the UK by one of its most distinguished and longstanding UK advisers, Lord Shawcross. The former attorney general, who is an adviser to the Kuwait Investment Office, the emirate's international investment arm, gave the warning in a letter he wrote over the summer to a senior member of Kuwait's ruling Al-Sabah family. The KIO is believed to have made annual tax savings in the UK of at least Dollars 1bn a year over the past decade as a result of being given sovereign immunity from taxation. The Financial Times disclosed yesterday that Kuwait may have abused this immunity by receiving more than Pounds 600m of tax refunds on its Dollars 1.7bn investment in British Petroleum. According to the testimony of a former senior Kuwaiti official, the investment was made by the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, which is not entitled to sovereign immunity. When the BP shares were bought, in 1987 and 1988, Kuwait said they had been purchased by the KIO on behalf of the state investment fund. Following the FT's disclosures, an Inland Revenue official said yesterday: 'If allegations of tax abuse are brought to us, we will investigate.' Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, yesterday wrote to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, saying that the Inland Revenue had been making an 'over-generous and overlax interpretation of sovereign immunity' which was 'costing the exchequer and the British taxpayer millions'. There is no suggestion that Lord Shawcross was aware that the BP investment was made by the KPC. His letter warns about the possible loss of sovereign immunity because of concerns that damaging disclosures are likely to be made during Kuwait's legal action against former KIO managers related to big losses on Spanish investments. 'The publicity attached to the case would be harmful,' the letter says. 'At the least it must raise questions as to the adequacy of the control and audit system exercised by Kuwait over the KIO, which permitted. . . alleged crimes to take place. This in turn would suggest that some of the defendants . . . were committing crimes of which the Kuwait government was unaware . . . This would, I think, lead the British government to reconsider the status and activities of the KIO in the United Kingdom.' Lord Shawcross's associates said he refers to KIO's tax status. Mr Brown also said there was a case for withdrawing the KIO's right to sovereign immunity, which is normally withheld from state agencies such as the KIO if they act in a 'commercial' manner. 'Quite clearly the KIO was working in a commercial way,' Mr Brown said. Labour tax reforms, Page 8</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Takhir Ramazanov: "China-Uzbekistan-Further the </F> West"]    [Text] Tashkent--The draft of a general plan for the  reconstruction and development of Uzbekistan's  telecommunications networks to the year 2015 has been completed.  Assumed as a basis were the recommendations of the international  union of electrical communications, which proceeded from the  fact of an extremely poorly developed telephone system in the  republic, especially in the village.    More than 2,500 rural population centers in Uzbekistan do  not  have a telephone. By the year 2015, the instrument will be in 72  out of each hundred rural families. In cities where fiber-optic  communications will be developed, the capacity will grow to 3.3  million numbers, and out of each 100 families, 90 will have  apartment telephones. A Transasiatic-European fiber-optic cable  line passing through the territory of Uzbekistan will unite  China with Western Europe. To satisfy the internal requirements  of the mass installation of a telephone system, the republic  will require not less than $20 billion, which it generally  cannot afford. But, then, in international business, you cannot  do without the establishment of joint enterprises and foreign  investments. The famous German Siemens and Alkatel firms and the  Japanese association for assistance to international  cooperation, which unites 216 large companies, have shown a  serious interest in Uzbek projects.</p>

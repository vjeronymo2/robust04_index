			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Russia attracts investors Russia is enjoying an upturn in foreign investment attracted by shares in Russian companies, according to Mr Anatoly Chubais, Russia's deputy prime minister for privatisation. He said share prices were soaring following the end of the voucher auctions in June. The second phase of privatisation - the selling of company stock for cash, with fewer privileges for the workers - is now under way. Mr Chubais forecast that foreign investment would be running at Dollars 1bn a month by the end of this year and would continue to grow in 1995. It had totalled over Dollars 2bn in the first six months of the year, and was growing by around 40 per cent a month. Brokers have also reported a growth in portfolio investments in Russia this year.</p>

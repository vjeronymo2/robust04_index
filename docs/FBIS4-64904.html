			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Axel Vornbaeumen: "A Surfer in His Brown </F> Element"]    [Text] Watch out, because something is happening in Germany  once again. Or perhaps not? One remembers who should know. Or  perhaps not? There is a witness of the time who has recognized  historical parallels. Or not? So how was it then--let us take  Point 4: "Books of Jews must be removed from bookstores." Or  Point 13: "Goebbels denies Jews their human dignity. They are  outlaws." Or Point 16: "Jews get out."    The man draws the connecting line from "then" to "today" 17  times. Then, Point 18, the congruence: "Civil cowardice"--"Civil  cowardice."    What is that? A comparison? Even that would be a perversion  of history, far beyond the bounds of what can be tolerated. But  it has become even more than that: an equation.    The dreadful barefoot historian is named Heinrich Hirzel.  And  his parallels look like this: Point 4: "Books of Republikaner  authors are no longer published or are traded only under the  counter." Point 13: "Friedmann, member of the central council of  the Jews denies Republikaner their human dignity." Point 16:  "Republikaner get out."    The presumptuous one-to-one of the tale of woe, printed in  the April issue of the party newspaper DER REPUBLIKANER, is  suitable at best as a piece in the completely open scale of  interpretations: were things not nearly so bad in those days or  are things again as bad today as they were then? To each his  own, to be used deliberately. For Hirzel, in his own words a  "marginal figure" of the Nazi resistance movement, "White Rose,"  and now a Europe candidate of the extreme rightist Republikaner,  in any case, the comparability ends only "with the outbreak of  World War II."    At the end of five columns, such subtleties will not bother  the reader of the brown paper, imbued with substantial end-line  mentality anyway according to the findings of opinion polls.  There is finally someone with chutzpa: a German man, a German  paper, a free country. So one will still be allowed to say....    One is allowed..... In the latest report on constitutional  protection presented last week by Federal Interior Minister  Manfred Kanther, the actions of the Republikaner are summarized  with astonishing forbearance. The compilation sees at best  "clues" for extreme rightist aspirations of the party. Not a  word about anti-Semitism.    At the same time, according to the leaked findings of the  North Rhine-Westphalian Office for Constitutional Protection,  there are model speeches for the super election year in the  drawers of the Republikaner, with which the anti-Semitic  potential latent in the German populace is to be activated in  the voting booths. But that, according to the analysis of Rainer  Erb from the Center for Anti-Semitism Research in Berlin, would  indeed be a new quality in the political unculture. "Never in  the history of the FRG has an election campaign been waged with  anti-Semitism."    But the time has never been so favorable. Anti-Semitism in  the German populace, says Erb, "has reached a level that will  not melt away." And this is despite the fact that those who live  in yesterday are dying out. For the Republikaner, it is again  worthwhile to stir up the brown sediment.    Certainly, according to Erb's observations, the muffled  anti-Semitism was "a constant element in the party." Ernst  Galinksi and then Bubis--the pattern was always the same: the  chairmen of the Central Council of the Jews, according to  Schoenhuber's crude logic, are themselves to blame for the  anti-Semitism in Germany. For him, he says, the "decisive  question" is therefore this: "Is the excessive philo-Semitism  not just as dangerous as anti-Semitism?" Schoenhuber's  conclusion: "It is very good that that sometimes bursts forth in  Germany."    It has burst forth. And the man in the pose of persecuted  innocence has recently again been working on that with great  determination. The latest "popular instigator" attack against  Bubis, just days after a synagogue burned in Germany for the  first time in half a century, fits the pattern. The  Republikaner, dangling on the verge of insignificance in the  media, are again "in." There is not a day of television without  images of Schoenhuber, even though, as he laments, it is without  the original tone. But that is delivered by his admirers via  telephone. "Mr. Schoenhuber, you are a hero," is how his  Republikaner friends commented on his suit against the chairman  of the Central Council of the Jews. And in a "renowned inn" at  Tegernsee in the deepest Bavarian territory of the CSU  [Christian Social Union], the people greet the renegade "more  than ever." Because of his broad success, Schoenhuber keeps on  coming with new attacks: a denunciation against the writer Ralph  Giordano "for public instigation to commit homicide." One must  know the choice of words, the chief of the Republikaner visibly  rejoices at Giordano's rhetorical faux pas: "If I, Franz  Schoenhuber, were to say that Mr. Giordano must be done away  with, then you ought to see what would happen in Germany." Nor  is Schoenhuber letting up with respect to Bubis. He  uncompromisingly called upon the chairman of the Central Council  to apologize.    Is a person who has obviously found a concept for success  just talking this way to serve the baser instincts of his  clientele?    "I must understand the ordinary people if I want to make  good  policy," the relentless populist once said in an interview with  the weekly newspaper DIE ZEIT. A little bit of sports palace in  a beer tent and a few properly placed provocative words to  transform the vague feeling in the stomachs of the horde of  extreme rightist supporters into a political program? As hardly  anyone else, Schoenhuber commands the polyphonous address." the  transfer of racist and anti-Semitic messages to his supporters  without having to be explicit," attests Siegfried Jaeger,  professor at the Duisburg Institute for Language and Social  Research.    Or is that also the way the man thinks, who in press  interviews is quite able convincingly to mimic the polyglot  liberal?    Behind closed doors, among his own people, the multicultural  facade flakes off. The brown thoughts of the confessing SS-man  ("I was there") likewise waft through the room. Gysi? Bolshevik  and Jew. Bubis? The Jew. The Germans? It is time for them to  raise their heads again. The only thing that "we" can be  reproached for, is the fact "that we have lost two world wars,"  someone said who recently noted Schoenhuber's droning in the  back room about us once again being somebody.    Doubtless painful defeats for the top Republikaner. He would  not like to have any more such feelings during the election  evenings of this year. And enough of them are still ahead.    That is why he is now talking the way he has always thought.  A surfer has found his element. Gregor Gysi, himself the address  of anti-Semitic abusive letters, has registered the insidious  change of climate in Germany. But he is one of the few who also  names it: Schoenhuber. In a topical hour about the synagogue  fire in Luebeck, the man from the PDS [Party for Democratic  Socialism] says that Schoenhuber expresses his profound  anti-Semitism, "because he is convinced that that will yield him  more votes." And in view of the times, Peter Glotz, a  rhetorically gifted unconventional thinker in the SPD [Social  Democratic Party of Germany], advocates a long-overdue showdown  with the "strong man and terrible populist from Upper Bavaria."  Glotz has also recognized the reality that considering a  13-percent share of the population with a closed world view one  "cannot always sneak away." The sober realization is that  Schoenhuber is relevant to the society.    The society is no different. Certainly the boss of the  Republikaner was one of the first to recognize that. Schoenhuber  had the "fascism of the old parties" compiled on two leaflets.  There is a lot of stuffy tavern talk there from the past eight  years. Ministers, state secretaries, and a Bundestag president  are included there. The Christian Democrats predominate in the  collection of quotes but the Social Democrats are also present  with xenophobic and racist babbling.    Rejoice Germany. Franz Schoenhuber sets the leaflet aside  and  leans back satisfied in his Europe office. "The largest share of  them would be subjected to a procedure to exclude them from our  party." People buy that from him in these times. Still.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Observer: Battle of the bulge At last Nigerian citizens can get cracking with head of state general Sani Abacha's 'War Against Indiscipline and Corruption'. Due to start in April, it was postponed but not - as unkind wags suggest - because of trouble deciding the identity of the enemy in this odd war. Still, the war should prove highly popular in some quarters of Lagos. It might persuade the police guarding the federal secretariat to cease doing a brisk trade in parking spaces. It could ease the city's traffic jams, by preventing drivers from queueing to buy scarce fuel - supplied by state monopoly - from illegal roadside hucksters. It might even reconnect the FT's office telephone. Despite paying the bills on time, it's been disconnected by clerks at the state-owned telephone company Nitel. They say an additional cost is necessary in order to 'reconcile the account'. As in, 'reconciled to one's fate'.</p>

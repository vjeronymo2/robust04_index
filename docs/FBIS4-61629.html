			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yekaterina Zhilyakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 6 TASS -- A possible Russian decision to  join NATO will hardly provoke public discontent, judging by the  results of a public opinion poll held in Moscow by the Mnenie  independent sociological service headed by Grigoriy Pashkov.    Russians no longer consider NATO to be hostile. Every third  out of the 1,000 respondents described NATO as an neutral  organization as regards Russian security. A total of 27 per  cent are not against Russia's possible joining of NATO, and  almost one half of them favor Russian involvement in NATO's  Partnership for Peace program.    The recent NATO air strikes in former Yugoslavia have  somehow  shattered the Muscovites' calm attitude to NATO. The number of  Moscow residents believing that NATO is a neutral organization  decreased as compared to the January poll. Two thirds of the  respondents do not think the air-strike decision was correct.</p>

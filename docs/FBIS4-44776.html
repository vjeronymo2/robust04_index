It  is mostly sufficient to coat the surfaces with hard films. That  saves costly basic material. Using new physical and chemical  deposition processes it is now even possible to enhance the  physical limits of hardness: diamond, the hardest substance in  the world, can be deposited as a thin film on tools. Such new  film processes for hard metals have been developed successfully  in recent years in Germany as well. It is the intention of a new  research project to extend them to steel tools. Until now there  are still no superhard films for the processing of ferruginous  metals, and diamond is not suited for such a purpose. The  hardest alternative is boron nitride. It is the aim of another  combined project of the Federal Ministry for Research and  Technology [BMFT] to vacuum metallize it as a thin film. By  combining diamond films and cubic boron nitride as a supplement,  superhard films will become available for all materials and  categories of application. Such research projects are supposed  to result in a position of international leadership in the  application of superhard films. The initial results had been  displayed at the Hannover Fair.    Swift technological development is continually elevating the  quality and reliability criteria for components. Since the  surface is of critical importance for the effectiveness of many  tools, it is mostly enough to alter their properties. Further  advantages of surface engineering are that energy and material  can be economized through an appropriate combination of basic  material and film and substitutes can be had for relatively  costly basic materials.    This is the reason why in recent years the processes  developed in micro-electronics for the physical (physical vapor  deposition [PVD]) and chemical (chemical vapor deposition [CVD])  deposition of films from the gaseous phase have been extended to  the coating of all sorts of components and tools. Currently  coatings are utilized in many engineering sectors: in  micro-electronics, in the optical industry and even for the  wearing protection of components and tools. It is the aim of  these new film technologies to enhance the performance of tools,  components, machinery and equipment so that companies can  strengthen their competitiveness in the world's markets.    Diamond is an especially attractive material for film  engineering. Of all known substances diamond is the hardest, it  is particularly resistant to abrasion and it is chemically  resistant. Because of its high heat conductivity and its  excellent optical and electrical properties it is a very  promising material in the future of micro-electronics. Even the  most extreme substance, however, has its weak point: at  temperatures over 500 C, approximately, diamond reacts with  oxygen, meaning that the precious crystal burns up.    In the early eighties, on the basis of research activities  in  the former Soviet Union, Japanese researchers developed  deposition of polycrystalline diamond films from an active  gaseous phase at low pressure. Such CVD diamond films turned out  to be excellent wearing protection for tools and components. As  a result there was a fresh outbreak of diamond fever, this time  in scientists' laboratories. According to market research, as  early as the late nineties, the volume of CVD diamond films for  tribological applications is likely to swell up to 3 billion  German marks [DM].    Two unresolved problem areas are being feverishly worked on:  diamond coating of steel and processing of steels in which the  diamond films undergo chemical wear because of high carbon  solubility.    Steel is such a critical basic material for tools and  components that the BMFT has decided to support the "vapor  deposition [VD] diamond coating of steel." Participating in the  DM9 million combined project, half of which is financed by the  BMFT, are the Juelich Nuclear Research Facility [KFA] research  center as project sponsor, CemeCon limited company [GmbH],  Aachen, as contract coater, Daimler-Benz corporation [AG], Ulm  research center, and Siemens AG, Berlin, both of which use steel  tools in their firms, and tool manufacturer United Hardmetal  GmbH, Horb am Neckar. Coordination of the research and  development [R&amp;D] tasking will reside with the Fraunhofer  Institute for Film and Surface Engineering.    The basic R&amp;D tasks to be resolved are: the  temperatures for  the diamond deposition have to be lowered to below 500 C,  the diffusion processes between the underlying steel body and  the diamond film have to be attenuated and, lastly, adequate  bonding of the films has to be realized.    The participating industrial users are hoping for a definite  increase in the effectiveness of tools and components with  diamond coating and a technical lead over the international  competition in equipment and machine building and, ultimately,  as a result, economic advantages.    Since there is still an absence of superhard coatings with  which ferruginous materials can be treated, the BMFT is  therefore supporting a combined project worth nearly DM10  million for concurrent research on "cubic boron nitride films."    Cubic boron nitride (c-BN) ranks alongside diamond among the  "superhard" materials. Even the electrical and optical  properties are similar to those of diamond. Unlike diamond,  which is subject to chemical wear because of its reaction with  iron in the processing of steel, cubic boron nitride is  eminently suited, even at high temperatures, for the processing  of ferruginous materials. This explains the great interest by  industry and above all by tool manufacturers in cubic boron  nitride films. Cubic boron nitride's excellent properties also  hold forth promising future applications in transportation and  energy engineering as well as communications engineering and in  the medical sector.    Internationally, however, development in the field of cubic  boron nitride films is only at the outset. Activities have  progressed the furthest in Japan and in the U.S. One Japanese  research group has already succeeded in coating drills with  cubic boron nitride. But there are still a number of unresolved  questions that have to be resolved before practical  implementation. For instance, there is still extensive  uncertainty about which processes and coating parameters can  produce cubic boron nitride films that are as free from phase  shift as possible.    Essential to practical use of cubic boron nitride films for  wearing protection in electronics or optics is their excellent  bonding. Films of several micrometers' thickness are required  especially on tools. This problem has still not been resolved  globally. Currently various interim film bonding agents are  being tested, but so far this has not resulted in any  breakthrough.    The structure of the combined projects indicates the strict  industrial orientation of the planned research activities. The  partners want to realize a position of international leadership  in industrial applications of superhard films. The decisive  prerequisite for market success will be the economicalness of  the coating technologies. The objective is to be well armed with  supertough films in tough competition.

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Renewed demands for oil tax relief DEMANDS from the opposition benches for transitional relief for companies adversely affected by changes in petroleum revenue tax announced in the Budget were supported by Mr Roger Knapman (C Stroud) in the Commons last night, Ivor Owen writes. He stressed that the supply sector of the oil exploration industry needed time to adjust to the new tax regime through the provision of a 'meaningful transitional arrangement'. Mr Knapman, speaking during the resumed committee stage of the Finance Bill, suggested that it should be possible to devise a 'fiscally neutral' scheme. Earlier Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, defended the decision of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, not to consult the industry in advance about the changes. Mr Alistair Darling, chief Labour spokesman in the debate, said the disruption caused to the industry by the chancellor's sudden announcement could result in the loss of between 10,000 and 30,000 jobs. He accepted that there was scope for adjusting petroleum revenue tax, and possibly for limiting the allowances that could be claimed in connection with exploration, providing the changes were phased in and permitted transitional relief. Mr Malcolm Bruce, for the Liberal Democrats, said his party would support a Labour amendment to provide transitional relief. Sun Oil, the UK arm of the Philadelphia-based energy company, yesterday sold a package of 10 North Sea exploration blocks to Amoco. The move effectively takes Sun out of North Sea exploration although the company retains some producing assets. Sun said the move was not connected to the government's oil tax changes, but that its parent company had decided last September to reduce its exploration expenditure.</p>

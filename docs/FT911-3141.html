			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / US steps up pressure for interest rate cut THE US administration yesterday continued to press for lower world interest rates, making a clash with Germany a near-certainty at Sunday's meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. President George Bush yesterday said on television that he wanted 'to see these interest rates down a little bit, including our own.' That would be good for the world economy, he said. By contrast, Thursday's Financial Times reported Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president, as saying that Germany would resist calls from the US to cut rates at the G7 meeting. A clash on interest rates therefore appears inevitable at the G7 meeting, although it is expected that it will end with a communique that papers over the cracks. Mr Bush's remarks were yesterday reinforced by Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury under-secretary for international monetary affairs. He told a press conference that the US wanted greater awareness in the G7 of the need to maintain, and where necessary, re-establish growth. He said the US believed inflationary pressures were subsiding and real interest rates in Europe were too high. Underlying the US stance is a belief that America's G7 partners have not sufficiently appreciated the adverse developments in the world economy over the past two years. The changes in eastern Europe and the Gulf war have created a huge demand for capital that cannot be met from traditional sources now that Germany has moved into current account deficit and Arab oil producers no longer have surpluses. A more cautious approach on interest rates was advocated yesterday by Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. He did not think the main industrial countries could force interest rates lower.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (8): Power opens door to glory - Profile: CESC In 1989, when Mr Rama Prasad Goenka, chairman of RPG Enterprises, India's fourth largest business house, took over CESC, which supplies power to Calcutta and surrounding areas, he promised that the city would not be hit by power failures, writes Kunal Bose. Today, no other big Indian city, except Bombay, can claim to be as well-off as Calcutta is in terms of power availability. Mr Goenka says: 'The change in the power scenario will bring about the economic regeneration of Calcutta.' According to Mr Sanjiv Goenka, the vice-chairman, 'we make constant endeavours to get the most out of our existing power plants. In the past two years, there has been an improvement of 25 per cent in CESC's power generation. The average plant load factor for the CESC units is over 70 per cent, against the national average of 57 per cent.' But CESC also depends to a great extent on the state electricity board to meet Calcutta's demand for power. The improvement in the working of these two agencies in recent times has allowed CESC to draw adequate power from them, enabling it to meet the demands of Calcutta's citizens. Since the early 1970s the power crisis in the state hasdiscouraged industrial investment. But the turnaround in the power situation has brought Calcutta back in the reckoning of investors. Mr Sanjiv Goenka wants to ensure that 'history does not repeat itself as far as power for Calcutta is concerned. Power is neither fast food nor instant coffee. We at CESC are working towards creating sufficient power generating capacity for the future.' CESC, which now has a total capacity of 580MW at four thermal stations, is setting up a 500MW coal-fired power complex at Budge Budge, 25km from Calcutta. The first unit of the complex will be commissioned in March 1996 and the second a year thereafter. Rolls-Royce Group will supply two 250 MW turbine generators for the Budge Budge complex. The investment of Rs20bn in the power complex 'is the biggest ever private sector investment in West Bengal. The complex will go a long way to create the conditions for industrial growth in the state,' says Mr RP Goenka. Since the Goenka takeover, CESC has become an aggressive utility company. It has also started preliminary work on another power complex at Balagarh which will finally have a capacity of 1,500MW. But in the first phase the Balagarh complex's capacity will be 500MW. The turnkey contract for the project is to be given to Rolls-Royce with which CESC has a 'business relationship of more than six decades'. CESC is financially strong enough to raise resources from the Indian capital market and banks and financial institutions from within and outside the country to fund the two power complexes, says Mr Sanjiv Goenka. When the Budge Budge complex and the first phase of Balagarh are commissioned, CESC will not need to draw power from the outside agencies. Besides creating new power capacity, CESC is making adequate investment to strengthen its transmission and distribution system. Asked how CESC would fare if a uniform national power tariff is introduced, Mr Goenka says: 'We would stand to gain since our tariff is among the lowest in the country. What I now want to do is to raise the CESC service to consumers to an international level.'</p>

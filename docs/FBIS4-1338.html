			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English  on 23-24 April on pages 7 and 9 carries two half-page election  advertisements from the Democratic Party [DP]. The  advertisements are printed on the lower right-hand corners of  the pages. The page 7 advertisement says in large white letters  across the top: "In 1989, these were the NP [National Party --  Nats] leaders whose government brought you detention without  trial, crime, corruption and hit squads."    Below this are two rows of photographs arranged around the  date 1989. The photographs, with names printed underneath, are  those of, top left to right; R. F. Botha, Minister of Foreign  Affairs; F. W. de Klerk, State President; D. J. de Villiers,  Minister for Administration and Privatization. Bottom left to  right: H. J. Coetsee, Minister of Justice; G. S. Bartlett,  Deputy Minister Economic Affairs and Technology; and R. P.  Meyer, Deputy Minister of Constitutional Development and  Planning.    Below the photographs, again in large white letters, are the  words: "Thankfully they're now the new National Party, and if  you turn the page, you'll meet their new leaders." The print  and photographs are set against a dark background.    The page 9 advertisement carries at the top, in the same  sequence, the same photographs of the same six people against a  dark background in the same order, this time arranged around the  date 1994. The ministers titles are now updated: D.J. de  Villiers is identified as Minister for Public Enterprises, H.J  Coetsee as Minister of Justice &amp; of Defence and G.S Bartlett  as  Minister of Mineral &amp; Energey Affairs. R.P Meyer is still  identified as a deputy minister. Immediately below the  photographs, in large white letters: "WORRYING ISN'T IT?"    Below this runs a thick black line across the advertisement,  with two columns of small printed text, the two columns  enclosing the DP emblem in blue and yellow. The small-print  text reads: "Look again. If FW de Klerk's `new' Nats look  strangely familiar, it's because thirteen of the `new' Nats' top  candidates were cabinet ministers or deputy ministers in the  1989 election -- and they've almost all been ministers,  deputies, or MPs since the 1970's! These are the `new' Nats  who, in 1989, promised to cut tax rates by five percent. Since  then, income tax has nearly doubled. These are the `new' Nats  who, since 1989, have allowed billions of rands of your money to  be stolen and squandered by corrupt homeland governments. These  are the `new' Nats who, in 1993, agreed to retain Detention  Without Trial. Who, in another secret deal, offered the ANC the  power to appoint its own judges to the land's highest courts.  (Luckily the DP put a stop to this at negotiations). It's  clear that FW de Klerk and his `new' Nats are just as  inefficient and incapable of containing corruption as the `old'  Nats. So when they promise to provide effective opposition  after the election, there's good reason to be sceptical. In  contrast, there's good reason to believe us when we say we'll  provide effective opposition. After all, we've believed in the  same principles for 35 years, so we're not about to abandon them  now, when they're needed most. So vote for the Democratic  Party. You'll find there's no better party on which to pin your  hopes."    Below the small-print text and DP emblem runs another thick  black line, and below this, across the bottom of the  advertisement, in large black print: "Democratic Party.  Protecting you from the abuse of power."</p>

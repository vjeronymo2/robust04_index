			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASTED TALENTS AND THE SECOND LADY  </P> <P> Marilyn Quayle's responses to your reporter's questions were brilliant. My  favorite part was when, apparently, the reporter insisted on bringing a  photographer into the vice president's quarters. Mrs. Quayle had already  explained that was a violation of family privacy, so she simply invited them  both to conduct the interview outdoors. Bravo, Mrs. Quayle!  </P> <P> BRENDA HESTER  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Arts: Today's Television Political correctness can have the oddest effects. Today BBC2 champions apartheid and screens a programme singing the praises of prostitution. If the network presented a series promoting new comedians provided they were white and excluded blacks there would be hell to pay. But The Real McCoy is okay because it promotes black comedians and excludes whites. Why this South African style 'separate development' for different races, so vehemently opposed by BBC2 types for decades, is now acceptable on BBC2 itself is anybody's guess (10.00). BBC2 would not, of course, allow a woman to make a programme arguing that prostitution can be fun because, as we know from the commissars of political correctness, prostitution exploits women. But it seems that male prostitution is altogether different. Just as BBC2 has, for some years, found space for the homosexually erotic while toeing the suppression line on the heterosexually erotic, so Open Space is readily given over to an explanation of how 'prostitution can be a positive and enjoyable choice' provided you are homosexual (11.15).</p>

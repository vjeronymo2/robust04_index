			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Closing branches 'saves banks little' BANKS AND building societies will lose revenue and save little by large-scale branch closures, a study from the Boston Consulting Group, a management consultancy, says. Mr Simon Farmbrough, a vice-president at Boston, said: 'As a profit improvement strategy, branch closure is a red herring.' The analysis says big closure plans should be dropped and banks should find other ways to cut costs while maintaining a physical presence on the high street. It suggests reforming branches to deliver products more cheaply, and developing banks' selling capabilities. Banks in the long term, it says, typically retain only 50 per cent to 70 per cent of the customers of branches they close, while making it more difficult to recruit customers in those areas. Closing the smallest 20 per cent of branches would save only about 2 per cent of a typical retail bank's total costs. The report says there are some 18,800 bank and building society branches in the UK, or one for every 3,064 people - the fourth-highest concentration after post offices, hairdressing salons and fast food. Fast food alone has 35,000 outlets, one for every 1,646 people. Maintenance costs of the branches are very high, at about Pounds 5.5bn, the report estimates. It acknowledges that banks have been closing branches rapidly, with the four biggest clearers reducing the number by 18 per cent during 1981-91. It emphasises that closure reduces revenue because of difficulties in customer retention, sales, and recruitment of new customers. Most customers are traditional in banking habits and on average visit a branch 2.4 times a month. Most also resent upheaval and have the option of turning to nearby competitor branches following after a closure. Four fifths of bank sales of life and pension products come from leads approaches made in the branches, and 28 per cent of customers said they visited their branch to have a general discussion or inquire about other products.

This time, all  leanings were represented at the session. A true debate took  place under the presidency of Deputy Frantz Robert Monde.  Several issues were tackled. The president of the assembly took  the opportunity to deny allegations by the Committee of Actions  for National Reconciliation [CARENA] spokesman Adyjeangardy  relating to possible participation by the Chamber of Deputies in  the national conference on 6 February. It is simply false, he  uttered. I have given my support to the principle, but the  Chamber cannot send an official delegation to this conference,  he explained.    What most attracted attention at this session was the  resolution project presented by a group of parliamentarians of  the south who have enjoined President Aristide to designate a  new prime minister within the next 48 hours. This resolution  caused much ink to flow in the Haitian parliament. It is a true  ultimatum. An ultimatum cannot be issued to the president of a  republic, one deputy objected.    It was a very animated, passionate debate during which  partisans and opponents changed their viewpoints. Finally, the  Assembly gave its sanction. Thanks to votes by the Alliance for  Parliamentary Cohesion and the socialists, the principle of  urgency was adopted by the Chamber. A special committee was  constituted to give a ruling on the matter.    Urgency or ultimatum? The question remains unanswered.  Behind  the scenes of the Chamber, a resolution project aimed at  dismissing President Aristide for serious violations of the  Constitution is being discussed. On the side of the ACP, steps  are being taken: they are reportedly finishing up this  resolution project. But at yesterday's session, they were  concerned instead with the justification or nonjustification of  a resolution summoning the head of state to designate a new head  of government.

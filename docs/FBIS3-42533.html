It has all the  prerequisites to make a breakthrough into space. We have the  Yuzhnoye Design Bureau at Dnepropetrovsk and the Yuzhmash, which  is known to just about everyone. There are many of its special  facilities with different capabilities, a National Space Agency  has been established and there is a fairly good record of  scientific accomplishments. In the not distant future plans call  for putting a Ukrainian satellite, the "Sich," into orbit. There  is least of all any desire to be exotic or to surprise the  world. What is most important is the implementation of a  grandiose project for remote sensing of the Earth.    "Recently the method for aerospace monitoring of the state  of  the environment is being used more and more widely," says Vadim  Lyalko, corresponding member of the Ukrainian Academy of  Sciences, director of the Center for Aerospace Study of the  Earth of the Geological Sciences Institute, Ukrainian Academy of  Sciences. The scientists of the Ukraine, within the framework of  the "Ukrkosmosresursy" and "Kosmos" projects, have developed and  tested original methods and equipment which during sensing in  the ranges from ultraviolet to microwave make it possible to  solve many ecological problems. These include, for example, an  estimate of water saturation of the soils, rise of the water  table and salinization of soils, detection of active fault  zones, sectors of damage to oil, gas, heat and water pipelines,  lands and water bodies polluted by heavy metals, nitrates and  petroleum products, search for underground water sources,  oil-gas and ore deposits, weather prediction and much else. For  the complete space monitoring of the Ukraine it is necessary  that the photographs carry multisided information on the  geoecological state both of its territory and the territories of  other countries. The members of the Scientific Council for Study  of Natural Resources by Remote Methods, Ukrainian Academy of  Sciences, are dreaming of the implementation of such a project.    Right now, however, as reported by V. Lyalko, specialists on  remote sensing of the Earth have gone further. A survey from a  satellite, even our own, is still not enough. In order to have  complete information it is necessary to establish a network of  surface stations for the reception and processing information  because geoecological conditions constantly change. Accordingly,  within the framework of the national space program five centers  are being established, each of which will carry its own  functional load. The developers were supported by the government  of the Ukraine, purchasing and distributing modern computers and  processing equipment to the centers. Surface stations have  received the capability, for the time being in research and  experimental modes, for testing space information processing  methods. The work is held back by the fact that it is necessary  to "hire" satellites from Russia and the United States and these  services are expensive. But in the future, when the  "surface-space-surface" ring is closed, the routine information  collected by the "Sich" satellite will certainly become as  necessary as statistics. The developers, like all the people,  are dreaming and ideally see a picture such as this: at each  oblast center (initially, but later in a still denser network)  there will be a display from which specialists will receive not  only necessary information on the geoecological state of the  region, but also recommendations on the adoption of decisions in  the case of accidents, calamitous events, etc.    For the time being the project can be carried out only to  the  extent that funding or the availability of a material base  allows. However, foreign countries also are highly interested in  these "scraps." Professor Lyalko stated that fairly good  cooperation is being organized with American and French  specialists and the Arab countries, for example, have been  interested in the end product of routine remote sensing. Israel  would not mind receiving assistance from the Ukrainians in the  search for deep (up to 100 meters) water. To put it briefly,  cash on the barrel head is being asked. It remains to get it,  that is, for developing and introducing unprecedented technology.    However, the mastery of space by oneself is an expensive and  slow business. The cooperation of countries here has very good  possibilities. Understanding this, specialists at the Center for  Aerospace Study of the Earth are striving to organize mutually  advantageous contacts with Russia and other foreign partners.  Together with Russian colleagues and with the participation of  scientists in the United States and ten other countries in the  world the Ukrainians are working on the implementation of the  very interesting "Priroda" project. It provides that in late  1994-early 1995 a module with the most modern and perfected  instrumentation will be constructed which will link up with the  Mir orbital station and with which with time a solution will be  found for mankind's problems of space monitoring of the Earth.</p>

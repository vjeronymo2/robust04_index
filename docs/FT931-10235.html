			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Euroc decline in profits continues EUROC, the Swedish building materials group, saw profits after financial items fall 17 per cent to SKr125m (Dollars 16.8m) in 1992, the third successive decline, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. The group blamed a sharp drop in construction activity in its main markets, stiffer competition and reorganisation costs. These more than offset the effects of cost-cutting and increased productivity. In 1991, the group made a SKr151m profit.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Denmark returns with SFr1bn issue THE KINGDOM of Denmark yesterday satisfied expectations by launching its second large bond offering in as many weeks. However, it surprised the market with its decision to borrow in Swiss francs rather than French francs. Mr Niels Sorensen, head of the foreign debt department at Denmark's National Bank, said he had decided on Swiss francs because that currency was under-represented in the bank's debt portfolio. However, Mr Sorensen said any further borrowing could well be in French francs. 'It is likely that we will be borrowing again in the not too distant future,' he said. The proceeds from yesterday's SFr1bn six-year offering would be used to replenish Denmark's depleted foreign exchange reserves. Last week's record Pounds 1.3bn Eurobond offering by Denmark was for the same purpose. Mr Sorensen said the bank's foreign exchange reserves had fallen to DKr35bn at the start of August, from DKr60bn in July. He blamed this on heavy currency intervention to help restore stability in the European exchange rate mechanism. In addition to shoring up its foreign exchange reserves, Denmark's National Bank plans to use proceeds from future bond issues to replace its outstanding short-dated debt, which is mainly in the form of commercial paper. Yesterday's Swiss franc offering by Denmark rivalled the record for a single transaction in the Swiss bond market, set by the Republic of Austria at the end of June. UBS, the lead manager, said deals of this size took time to absorb. However, it was confident Denmark's entire issue would be placed before the payment date on September 30. Demand for the paper was predominantly from domestic investors. The bonds, which carry a coupon of 4 1/4 per cent, were quoted at less 1.85 bid, from an issue price of 101.8, in the afternoon. UBS also led the other notable deal of the day, arranging a SFr300m seven-year offering for the World Bank. Although the bonds also carry a coupon of 4 1/4 per cent, the higher issue price of 102 reflected the issuer's superior credit rating. The bonds were trading at less 1 5/8 bid in the afternoon. Expectations of lower interest rates in Switzerland have increased the attraction of the Swiss franc sector, and syndicate managers expect more borrowers to tap this area of the international bond market. Elsewhere, the Kingdom of Sweden re-opened its successful Ecu500m seven-year deal, and sold a further Ecu100m. The move was aimed at restoring liquidity to the issue. The joint lead manager, Swiss Bank Corporation, said the original amount, issued on June 2, had been priced to yield 5 basis points over the benchmark 9 1/2 per cent French OAT government bond due 2000. However, demand from Ecu-denominated funds, central banks and Swiss investors was such that the bonds were yielding 40 basis points below the benchmark bond earlier this week. The new tranche was priced to yield 33 basis points below the OAT. SBC said it did not expect any further Ecu-denominated deals in the near future because of the lack of swap opportunities. Meanwhile, the steady stream of German banks tapping the D-Mark sector continued, as Trinkhaus &amp; Burkhardt, the Dusseldorf-based bank, raised DM150m through a seven-year offering. Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating service, said it had lowered the long-term debt rating for Banco di Napoli, Italy's fifth-largest commercial bank, to A2 from A1. About Dollars 750m worth of debt is affected.</p>

The Parliament resolution said however that "the military  aggression is being pursued and that Croats as well as Serbs  continue to perpetrate atrocities in Bosnia-Hercegovina."    Parliament called on European Union ministers and the United  Nations to take the necessary steps to immediately stop Serb  militias from attacking Moslem-populated Srebrenica, Zepa,  Maglaj, Tuzla and Bihac.    It also warned the Croatian government of sanctions if  Zagreb  continued to maintain troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> CONTAGIOUS DISEASE OF COMMITTEE-ITIS  </P> <P> When in doubt, local governments often form a committee. But beware such  unintended consequences of committee-itis as the guarding of turf and the  swelling of egos. And then there's that bane of fiscal prudence, the padding of  the municipal budget.  </P> <P> At a time when everybody is trying to find ways to cut, it makes sense to do  what the City Council in Irvine is endeavoring to accomplish. It is trying  bravely to reduce the number of commissions that have been authorized over the  years to look into various issues. This year-end pruning around the hedges of  City Hall is a good example for other communities looking for ways to save some  money.  </P> <P> But, alas, committees and commissions do not seem to go gracefully into  retirement. In Irvine, the city has accumulated a 10-page list of advisory  boards created during the city's 19-year history. The various committees and  commissions cost the city about $500,000 annually.  </P> <P> In all, Irvine, with a population less than half the size of Santa Ana, has 67  assorted advisory boards to its neighbor's 11. Anaheim, another big Orange  County city, has disciplined itself along the way so that it has only 13  committees. Irvine has no target goal for the number of committees it wants to  cut, but it recognizes that it has too many of them. It will eliminate some,  consolidate others, and in the process no doubt affirm the value of those that  remain.  </P> <P> The trick for Irvine, and other communities so afflicted, is to weed out  commissions that duplicate services without punishing those whose chief offense  is controversy.  </P> <P> An example of the latter is the 2-year-old Citizens Advisory Committee on  International Affairs, targeted for the ax. It has become a symbol for the  far-flung concerns of the administration of former Mayor Larry Agran, now so  out of fashion in the council chambers. The committee is too big, all right.  But reorganize it; don't eliminate it. There is a place for symbolic  expressions, such as the committee's recent recommendation that, at official  functions, the city boycott coffee grown in El Salvador.  </P> <P> The best place to focus is on committees that duplicate efforts or whose task  is done. For example, even the members of the Public Safety Commission, another  endangered committee, have been asking what their purpose is these days.  </P> <P> Then there are groups such as the Pelican Hills Road Monitoring Committee and  the Peters Canyon Wash Open Space Spine Monitoring Committee. Cities can  economize on both money -- and words -- by eliminating committees such as  these.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE MARKET: SEASONAL PICKS INCLUDE ASPARAGUS, BLOOD ORANGES  </P> <P> Asparagus -- with its long graceful form, delicate flavor and dollop of  nutrients -- is one food that appeals to foodies and health foodies alike. And  when you consider how quickly it can be prepared, it may even qualify as a  fast-food.  </P> <P> Its season lasts for only about four months -- mid-February to June.  </P> <P> Although asparagus is grown in Ventura County, the soil does not lend itself to  large-scale commercial production, said Lyle Carson, owner of Carson Farm  Supply in Ojai.  </P> <P> "Asparagus is usually grown up in the San Joaquin Valley in high peat soil.  Local homeowners, if they amend the soil, can have reasonable success. It needs  a loose, high organic soil," he said.  </P> <P> Those who prefer the pencil-thin asparagus grown in Lodi can find it at the  Central Market in Camarillo, said Manager Robbie Nichols. "Pencil-thin  asparagus has a lot less weight compared to the regular asparagus that the  supermarkets get. It is a little more expensive but it's better. It has less  waste and it is more tender."  </P> <P> Pencil-thin asparagus also cooks much faster, Nichols said. "The regular  asparagus have woody stems, whereas with the pencil-thin kind you don't have  that. It cooks in a matter of five minutes, and the regular takes more like 10  or 15 minutes."  </P> <P> Those not in the mood for vegetables might want to try citrus fruit. Right now,  blood oranges are available. This orange is a surprise to the eyes and the  taste buds. Blood oranges are red inside and often are described as tasting  like oranges crossed with raspberries. "They should last about another month,"  Carson said.  </P> <P> Health-conscious people looking for unusual fare might try tofu enchiladas and  tofu manicotti, said Kelly Coy, assistant manager of Trader Joe's in Ventura.  </P> <P> "Tofu instead of cheese is used because it's lower in cholesterol. No  preservatives are used, and they're all ready to eat," he said.  </P> <P> Imported seafood that looks especially good this week are Mississippi  freshwater catfish, Idaho trout and Norwegian salmon, said Bob Nazarian of  Gelson's Market in Westlake Village. All are farm-raised and 24 to 48 hours  fresh, he said.  </P> <P> "The advantage of farm-raised fish is that people don't have to keep it on the  boat for a few days, it doesn't have to be iced down as often," said Nazarian.  "The quality is pretty uniform too."  </P> <P> Locally, "things are a little slow because of the bad weather we've had  lately," said Hipolito Marin, general manager of Brandon King Seafood in  Oxnard. "The local lobster season is closed and won't open again until October,  but the Maine lobsters, local prawns and crabs are still available."  </P> <P> </P> <P> LOCALLY GROWN  </P> <P> * Bennett's Honey Farms -- Four varieties of honey. 3678 Piru Canyon Road,  Piru.  </P> <P> * Brandon King Seafood -- Local spot prawns caught from Port Hueneme, Dungeness  crab from Alaska, all live. 3920 W.

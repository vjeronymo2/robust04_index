Washington is  considering imposing economic sanctions on the DPRK together  with other UN members if the U.S.-DPRK talks on suspected  nuclear weapons development by North Korea are "deadlocked"  (according to a government source). It is certain that if the  United Nations decides on the sanctions, Japan will be asked to  cooperate.    Several years ago, a senior government official secretly  said: "In the near future, North Korea will suddenly discharge  its military power or will collapse because of economic  difficulties. It is unlikely that the transfer of power from  President Kim Il-song to Secretary Kim Chong-il will be made  smoothly." Although his opinion did not represent the  government view at the time, it has become common in the last  year because of various behaviors by North Korea.    The DPRK announced last March that it would withdraw from  the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Also, it keeps  rejecting nuclear inspectations by the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA). Moreover, it succeeded in the  experimental launch of its "Nodong 1" intermediate range  ballistic missile over the Sea of Japan last May, continuing to  exert its energy in missile development. As for its economic  policy, the DPRK, for the first time, admitted that its third  seven-year economic plan failed. At the same time, the country  has established a new personnel lineup with the Kim family on  top.    Japan has so far analyzed that North Korea is "seriously"  considering developing nuclear weapons (according to a Defense  Agency source). It has taken the position that the issue of  suspected nuclear weapons development by the DPRK should be  resolved through dialogue. Based on this stand, Japan is  carefully watching the developments in the U.S.-DPRK talks and  is willing to help make progress in the North-South dialogue.  It has also given political consideration to the issue. As  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said: "North Korea should not be  isolated from the rest of the world."    It is true that the actual state of North Korea is not  clearly known. Tokyo depends on information given by Washington  to know about the DPRK. However, it is said that the U.S.  information represents differing views on the country.    The government thinks: "It is possible that the DPRK has  developed something similar to a nuclear weapon. But it will  take another two or three years for the DPRK to be able to load  nuclear warheads onto missiles and launch them at Japan"  (according to a Foreign Ministry source). Even so, it cannot be  denied that the situation has become tense.    Nonetheless, the Japanese Government remains negative about  imposing economic sanctions on the DPRK.</p>

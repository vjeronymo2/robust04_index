			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wilson Bowden leaps to Pounds 31m - UK housing recovery and pension fund windfall build 85% advance Pre-tax profits at Wilson Bowden jumped by almost 85 per cent last year to Pounds 31.2m as the group took advantage of the recovery in the UK housing market. The figure included a Pounds 5.5m pension refund. Without it pre-tax profits still rose by 52 per cent, from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 25.7m. Mr David Wilson, chairman, described this as a magnificent performance given the patchy nature of the recovery. The group is proposing a 6.65p (6.2p) final dividend as forecast at its Pounds 57.2m rights issue in November, giving a total up from 8.7p to 9.3p. Earnings per share, excluding the pension fund windfall, increased by almost 58 per cent to 22.4p (14.2p). Turnover increased by 45 per cent to Pounds 185.1m (Pounds 127.7m). After the rights issue, which received 99.1 per cent acceptances, the group was left with net cash of Pounds 20.7m and shareholders funds of Pounds 232.2m. Land purchases completed following the year end have left it with net debt of Pounds 4m. This is expected to rise to about Pounds 20m by the end of 1994 as the group pursues its target of building 3,000 homes a year by the late 1990s. Last year it completed 1,860 homes, a rise of 36 per cent. Housing operating profits increased by 60 per cent to Pounds 22.1m, and the average price of a home rose from Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 83,900. The increase was due to a change in sales mix towards more expensive, higher margin homes rather than an underlying increase in house prices, said Mr Wilson. Profits from commercial property sales rose by 36 per cent to Pounds 6m (Pounds 4.4m). Mr Wilson said reduced demand for small industrial units meant that sales would become 'more lumpy', but he would be disappointed if the group did not increase property profits in the current year. COMMENT Housing operating margins reached 14.7 per cent in the second half and will easily top 15 per cent in the current year. The group's strength is its long land bank with average plot costs of about Pounds 16,000, excluding land creditors. This compares with an average selling price likely to exceed Pounds 90,000 this year. Property profits will depend upon the timing of the sale of a Pounds 17m Leicester leisure development and Pounds 20m Northampton shopping centre. But they should exceed last year's Pounds 6m, increasing group pre-tax profits to Pounds 35.5m and putting the company on a prospective p/e of 21: a must for any housebuilding portfolio.</p>

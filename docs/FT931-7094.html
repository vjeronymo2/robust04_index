			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Small increase in N-power proposed MR JAMES HANN, chairman of Scottish Nuclear, the state-owned generator, last night proposed only a modest increase in the proportion of the UK's electricity needs met by nuclear power. Mr Hann suggested that the government should state in its forthcoming energy white paper what percentage of the electricity market should be held by each energy source. He recommended that nuclear power should have between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of the market. With nuclear energy at present meeting about 20 per cent of the market, Mr Hann is advocating little expansion in nuclear capacity. He says Britain should simply replace the older Magnox stations at the end of their useful lives 'with new and more efficient designs'. Scottish Nuclear has no operating Magnox stations but wants to replace the Hunterston B advanced gas cooled plant in Ayrshire with a Hunterston C station by about 2010. The company has said the new station would probably be a pressurised water reactor plant. Mr Hann, in a speech in Glasgow, said coal should meet between 50 per cent and 55 per cent of the UK electricity market (compared with 63 per cent in 1990-91), gas 15 per cent (1 per cent), oil and orimulsion zero (9 per cent) and renewables 5 per cent (3 per cent). After the government had laid down the percentage shares, Mr Hann said, 'a simple mechanism based on financial incentive and disincentive would enable the concept to work'.</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXXON TO UNVEIL LESS POLLUTING PREMIUM GAS  </P> <P> The oil company that gave the world the Exxon Valdez oil spill hopes to score  some environmental points with consumers by introducing lower-emissions  gasolines in California today, joining three other refiners already selling  such fuel here.  </P> <P> Exxon Corp., the West Coast's fifth-largest retailer of gasoline last year, is  expected to unveil a reformulation of its Exxon Extra premium unleaded gasoline  at about 175 stations in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Another version of the gasoline will go on sale at the same time in Sacramento  and San Francisco -- the first such fuels in Northern California.  </P> <P> "We hope this is a small step toward convincing people that we're not as bad as  they may think we are," Exxon marketing executive Paul White said. "We do care  about the environment."  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, Exxon estimates that the new gasoline will cut a vehicle's  hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions by about 7%, compared to its ordinary  premium unleaded gasoline, which the new fuel will replace.  </P> <P> In Northern California, which will have a different version of the gasoline,  the new Exxon Extra will cut hydrocarbon emissions by only 4% and will have no  effect on carbon monoxide emissions.  </P> <P> Exxon already sells different lower-emissions formulations of gasoline in 24  other states along the Gulf Coast and in the Northeast and Pacific Northwest.  </P> <P> In Southern California, Exxon joins Chevron Corp., Shell Oil Co. and Atlantic  Richfield Co., the West Coast's No. 1 retailer, which last September introduced  the first lower-emissions gasoline in the country. Both Chevron and Shell sell  reduced-emissions premium unleaded gasoline in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTDOOR NOTES / RICH ROBERTS;  </P> <P> AGREEMENT REACHED TO RESTORE WILDLIFE HABITAT IN LOWER OWENS VALLEY  </P> <P> Environmentalists and sportsmen are hailing a tentative agreement between the  Los Angeles City Department of Water and Power and the Inyo County Water Dept.  to implement the Lower Owens Valley Project.  </P> <P> More than 1,000 arid acres stretching about 50 miles from Independence south to  Lone Pine will be restored as a warm-water fishery for bass and a wetlands  habitat for wildlife, including tule elk, waterfowl and other birds.  </P> <P> And Los Angeles, supporters say, won't miss a drop.  </P> <P> The water will be removed from the L.A. aqueduct through the existing Blackrock  spill gates north of Independence, increasing the flow into the Lower Owens  River from a maximum of 25 cubic feet per second to as much as 50 c.f.s.  </P> <P> Thaddeus Taylor, an Inyo County water commissioner and county manager for  CalTrout, said the current flow is often nearer 5 to 10 c.f.s. but probably  will stabilize at about 35 once the project is in place. Before it reaches dry  Owens Lake, the water will be recovered through a pump-back station at Keeler  Bridge on California 136 southeast of Lone Pine and returned to the aqueduct.  </P> <P> The hang-up was the pump-back station. Estimates a year ago were that it would  cost $4- to $6-million to build and $100,000 to $200,000 a year to operate.  Inyo County, which says it has no money, wanted L.A. to build it.  </P> <P> Although the project is now budgeted at $7.5 million for construction and  $900,000 a year to run, the city has agreed to split the building cost and  finance Inyo County's half at $300,000 a year, interest free.  </P> <P> The agreement announced last Friday at Bishop beat by one day a court-imposed  deadline of April 1 to reach a preliminary agreement on a long-term management  plan for ground water.  </P> <P> Taylor said that the agreement was significant because, since 1905 when Owens  River water started flowing to Los Angeles, "It's the first time they have  entertained the notion of co-management of water resources in the Owens  Valley."  </P> <P> The State Department of Fish and Game will be the lead agency in developing the  plan. Overseers based in Bishop are Curtis Milliron, a fisheries biologist, and  Denyse Racine, a wildlife biologist.  </P> <P> Brian Tillemans of the DWP office in Bishop drew the original draft plan, and  Taylor and David Groeneveld, a plant ecologist for the Inyo County Water Dept.,  also played leading roles.  </P> <P> Taylor said that construction of the pump-back station is scheduled to start in  July of 1990, after completion of an environmental impact report, and  construction will take three years.  </P> <P> Taylor said fishing and waterfowl interests are being solicited for input.  </P> <P> The country's largest gathering of fly fishermen and stars of the sport is  scheduled Saturday and Sunday at the Amfac Hotel in Westchester.  </P> <P> Up to 3,000 are expected to attend "Flyfishing World," the annual production of  the Southwest Council Federation of Fly Fishers, which represents 25 clubs in  Southern California, southern Arizona and southern Nevada.  </P> <P> The show, which started in 1973 at Wilderness Park in Downey with about 300  people, will feature exhibitors from Alaska, Canada and the East Coast, and  there will be continuous demonstrations and presentations by widely known  personalities, including fly tiers Polly Rosborough and Poul Jorgensen and  anglers Dave and Joan Whitlock, Mike Lawson, Dick Talleur and Rick Pasquale.  </P> <P> Registration opens at 7:30 a.m. Presentations are scheduled from 9:30 to 3:30  each day. A banquet is scheduled at 7:30 Saturday night.  </P> <P> Admission is $12 for adults, $15 for families. Proceeds will go to local  conservation projects. Parking is free.  </P> <P> Briefly  </P> <P> The Department of Fish and Game reports that there were 23 hunting casualties  in the state in 1988, including one fatality. Shotguns accounted for 13 of the  accidents, archery two. Sixteen occurred during the pursuit of waterfowl and  upland game. The fatality was one of seven shootings of deer hunters. The  trigger of the hunter's own rifle snagged as he was climbing through a fence. .  . . State fishery biologists are cautiously confident that they have developed  a larger hybrid strain of bass in Shasta Lake since introducing Florida  largemouths into the northern largemouth habitat in 1980. Old-timers at the  lake marveled at the size of the bass -- up to 8 1/2 pounds, several over 7 1/2  -- taken recently.  </P> <P> About 1,000 openings remain for reservations to climb the Mt. Whitney Trail to  the highest peak -- 14,495 feet -- in the 48 contiguous states this year. The  Whitney Ranger District in Lone Pine limits traffic to 50 hikers a day, by  reservation only. There were 7,350 last year. This year, July, August and  weekends in June and September are filled. Those applying now are advised to  ask for mid-week dates in September and October. Write: Whitney Ranger  District, P.O. Box 8, Lone Pine, Calif., 93545. A response takes four to six  weeks.  </P> <P> Mike Rosala of Buena Park won last weekend's Santa Monica Bay Halibut Derby  with a tournament-record 47-pound 1-ounce fish. Jim Goodwin, West Los Angeles,  was second with a fish at 29-8, and Michael Resideskg, Costa Mesa, third, 20-5.  There were 1,800 participants, who weighed-in 415 legal catches of 22 inches or  longer. . . . Marriott's Fly Fishing Center in Fullerton is offering classes in  nine facets of the sport this month. For details, call 1 (800) 367-2299. . . .  The Santa Monica Bay chapter of Ducks Unlimited will have its 10th annual  banquet Wednesday, April 19, at 7:15 p.m., at the Bel Air Club, 16801 Pacific  Coast Highway, Pacific Palisades.

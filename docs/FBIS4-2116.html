			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Northern China's  important port city of Tianjin is expanding its economic  cooperation through joint development efforts far and near.    Located on the Bohai Sea, Tianjin is effectively cooperating  with Beijing city, Shanxi, Hebei, Heilongjiang and Shandong  Provinces as well as with Yunnan, Guangxi and Xinjiang in the  remote areas.    Statistics show that a total of 11,420 cooperative projects  were signed last year, attracting capital of 967 million yuan  from other areas.    Officials said that regional cooperation, which began in  recent years, has effectively helped local economic growth.    Various organizations to promote regional cooperation were  established and expanded. The association of mayors of cities  around the Bohai Sea, for instance, now has 17 member cities.  The Tianjin Municipal Government has set up representative  offices in a number of other provinces.    At present, the city is cooperating with the coal-rich  Shanxi  Province in the development of coal, transportation and raw  materials industries.    The cooperation projects with Qinghuangdao city in Hebei  Province not far from Tianjin have come to some 50, involving a  total investment of 38.70 million yuan. Local products  including cloth shoes, carpets and tableware are exported via  Tianjin port.    The city has also opened many specialized markets for such  products as petrochemical materials, textile raw materials and  automobile industrial products.    In addition, a major market network is taking shape,  covering  capital, technology, labor and information services.    By the end of 1993, the number of capital goods markets  totalled 28, attracting many large industrial and commercial  ventures all over China. The transaction volume topped 20  billion yuan last year, according to figures from the Tianjin  Municipal Government.    A few large trans-regional joint ventures were also  established. Some Tianjin factories with quite advanced  technical levels, especially in such fields as chemicals,  electronics, machinery, textiles and automobiles, have begun  offering machinery for processing strawberries, wild apples and  other local produce to North-west China.    The Tianjin Welding Electrode Company, for instance, has set  up 25 joint ventures in eight provinces and autonomous regions.  In Xinjiang alone the joint ventures achieved a net profit of 7  million yuan last year.    Officials said that Tianjin has now established many raw  materials bases in other parts of China.    Tianjin also offered technical and other forms of help to  many poor areas. It has arranged 33 projects of technology  transfer, personnel training and commodity exchange with  localities around the Three Gorges areas in Central China.    In addition, it has signed more than 600 technical and  economic cooperation projects with North-west China's Gansu  Province, benefiting both parties.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTDOORS;  </P> <P> NOTES;  </P> <P> HUNTING PROS, CONS ARE HOT TOPICS IN BURBANK  </P> <P> "Hunters are being harassed in the field.  </P> <P> "Professional wildlife management is being attacked in the courts.  </P> <P> "Legislators are proposing piecemeal wildlife management measures.  </P> <P> "The state agencies authorized to manage our resources and our wildlife seem  unable to function in this environment.  </P> <P> "Hear the facts . . . (and) help to devise a positive course of action to  protect professional wildlife management and your right to hunt."  </P> <P> So states a flyer setting the tone for Safari Club International's Hunter's  Rights Symposium Saturday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., at the Pickwick Banquet  Center in Burbank. Some participants are calling it a critical event for  California hunters.  </P> <P> Speakers will include Loren Lutz, executive director of the Society for the  Conservation of Bighorn Sheep; Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress); Mike  Mathiot, western regional director of Quail Unlimited, and environmental  attorney Pat Marley.  </P> <P> Also, the so-called "mountain lion initiative" on the June ballot will be  discussed by Lee Fitzhugh, extension wildlife specialist at UC Davis, and  Assemblyman Dick Mountjoy (R-Monrovia) will talk on "The Right to Gun  Ownership."  </P> <P> Attendance, including lunch, is $35; without lunch, $12. More information:  (818) 797-1287 or (818) 351-0700.  </P> <P> When Bill Poole built the Royal Polaris in 1976, it became the world's largest  commercial sportfisher. He has since sold the boat to Frank LoPreste, who is  about to become the owner of the second-largest sportfisher.  </P> <P> John Grabowski, president of the Louisiana-based Qualifier Corporation, has  built and is preparing to bring the Qualifier Excel from its Louisiana shipyard  to San Diego's Fisherman's Landing. At 120 feet long and 31 feet wide, the  steel-hulled, $2.3-million boat surpasses in length and width the  113-by-30-foot Royal Polaris.  </P> <P> "We went a little bit bigger just to get the capacity we wanted," Grabowski  said. "Hopefully, in years to come, we're going to try to fish out of Costa  Rica, and the ultimate goal is to fish the Galapagos Islands."  </P> <P> Grabowski said the boat, scheduled to depart Louisiana Feb. 20 and arrive in  San Diego -- barring a backup in the Panama Canal -- in the middle of March,  holds 35,000 gallons of fuel and has an estimated range of about 6,000 miles.  </P> <P> It is equipped with electronics not yet seen on any other sportfisher --  including a telex system for the businessman and an onboard computer system for  such tasks as bookings and inventory keeping.  </P> <P> Its maiden voyage, an 18-day venture to the yellowfin tuna grounds of the  Revillagigedo Islands, is scheduled for April 2.  </P> <P> LoPreste is already planning to build another boat.  </P> <P> "Whether it will be bigger . . . at this point that's not my goal," he said.  "Maybe just to be able to say that I'm bigger I might go a little bigger, but  I'm not going to do it just on an ego trip."  </P> <P> Briefly  </P> <P> The U.S. Forest Service will start charging a $3 processing fee this year for  wilderness permit reservations to the Mt. Whitney and other quota trails within  the Inyo, Toiyabe and Sierra national forests. Reservations will be accepted by  mail or in person from March 1 through May 31. Prior postmarks will be  returned. The Whitney trail, which usually sells out in the peak months, is  100% reserved, the others half-reserved and half-daily arrivals. For Whitney,  write P.O.

The event raised $25,000 to offset medical costs for the former  president of the Sportfishing Assn. of California. . . . The Royal Polaris,  skippered by Phil Loomis returned to San Diego from an 18-day trip to Alijos  Rocks, Clarion and Socorro with 19 passengers having landed 380 yellowfin tuna,  126 wahoo, 21 yellowtail, 92 grouper, two marlin and six amberjack.

Twenty-five anglers on a nine-day trip  aboard Dan Sansome's American Angler out of Point Loma brought back 372  yellowfin -- 25 over 100 pounds, the largest a 137-pounder caught by Kelley  Paakkonen of La Mirada. . . .

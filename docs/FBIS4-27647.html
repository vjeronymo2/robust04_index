			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, June 2 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- It is likely  that the composition of the government's team would be changed  by resigning of some of its members judging from some  publications of the newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" and the newspaper  "UNEN" issued by the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary  Party [MPRP]. If the central official press "ARDIYN ERH" on its  first pages is demanding in the editorial to undertake serious  measures in tackling properly the cabinet of ministers up to  removing from the composition of some its members, the "UNEN" is  directly naming those ministries and departments which leaders  have been viewed to quit their ministerial posts. In  substantiating its criticism the "UNEN" resorts to the arguments  put forth by the democrats voiced during the days of a political  hunger strike in April for the resignation of the government.  The "ARDIYN ERH" is quoting the General Secretary of the ruling  MPRP B. Dashyondon as saying that it is quite possible to  provide changes in the team of the government. The "ARDIYN ERH"  of today calls the name of the Minister of External Relations T.  Gombosuren devoting him a whole page in today's issue. Holding  his post T. Gombosuren managed to outlive three premiers namely  D. Sodnom, S. Gungaadorj and D. Byambasuren.    Among the writers of the country the pursuit for the year's  state prize is carrying on. The prize is awarded annually on  the eve of the main holiday of the country being the Naadam  which is celebrated in July. The "ARDIYN ERH" publishes an  article by Doctor L. Tudev who is standing for conferring all  the candidates excepting D. Maam, a writer who three years ago  headed the alternative writers' organization.    At the conference held in Cairo of foreign ministers of  nonaligned movement countries Mongolia released a memorandum on  the issues under discussion as an official document of the  conference which is provided in today's issue of the newspaper  as well.    The newspaper informs that Mongolian businessmen still  continue in order to make their own profit betraying the  national interests of the country. The fact that two years ago  the U.S.A granted the most favourable terms nation's status to  Mongolia has lead to the growing interest arose on the part of  many Hong Kong's firms to Mongolia. During the last period  several attempts to bring into the country of finished  production with forged documents on their manufacturing in  Mongolia for reselling on the U.S. market have been revealed.  The newspaper reports about one of such cases where there are  involved in some firms of China and Hong Kong.    The newspaper "UNEN" carries an interview with member of the  steering council of the MPRP, chairman of the Standing Committee  of the parliament N. Bayarsaihan. The main topic of the  interview is the progress in reference to the economic  reformings, its outcome and prospects for near future. N.  Bayarsaihan acknowledges that the aim of the government being to  check the decline in production, and attain stabilizing of the  situation for a two-year-long period has not been fulfilled. He  is in favour of intensifying the privatization of state-owned  property. So far the most of national wealth is still nobody's.  Moreover there have been formed some groupings interested in  retaining such a case in order to dispose as they think fit of  this no man's property, said N. Bayarsaihan. To corroborate  this statement, he quotes the names of joint stock companies  with prevailing state-owned property pattern.</p>

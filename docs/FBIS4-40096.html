			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A declaration on the creation of the Russia's  Democratic Choice Party has been adopted at a founding congress  being held in Moscow on the initiative of the Russia's Choice  faction in the State Duma. Yegor Gaydar, speaking at the  opening of the congress, said that the party's fundamental task  was to create the prerequisites for stable economic development.  In his words, present economic policy could place Russia in the  position of a country under colonial rule within five years.    At the same time, Gaydar stressed that the new party will  not  join the opposition to the government, although it does not  support it completely.    [Begin Gaydar recording] Our position toward the government  was formulated a long time ago. We support a coalition  government: The government is fragmentary. We support  individual areas of the government's work, including those in  which members of our faction are working, some of whom are  involved in the creation of our party. Privatization policy is  just one obvious example. But we are not prepared to take  responsibility for the essence and content of official economic  policy. On the whole we do not support it. [end recording]  [passage omitted]    [Announcer] As for relations with other parties, answering a  question from Ekho Moskvy, Yegor Gaydar said the following:    [Begin Gaydar recording] Of course our party's allies, in  the  Duma at least, are the 12 December faction and, on the whole,  the Yabloko faction. Neither of these parties yet has its own  developed political structure, but nevertheless, we regard them  as our allies.    As for the Democratic Party of Russia and the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord, these are not our allies. They are  parties defending essentially different plans for Russia's  future. In the Democratic Party there is undoubtedly a very  strong element of playing on great-power sentiments. There are  many points on which we disagree with the Party of Russia and  Accord. But of course we are ready for dialogue with them.  [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

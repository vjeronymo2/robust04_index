			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam  puppet clique have started the "Hwarang" military exercise with  the mobilization of the puppet army, police and reserve forces,  more than 1,300,000 in all, crying over the non-existent "threat  from the North."    NODONG SINMUN today says this reveals again their  treacherous  nature in seeking only confrontation and war.    The analyst says:    A grave situation has been created on the Korean peninsula  by  the war moves of the United States and the South Korean puppets.    While visiting South Korea, U.S. Defense Secretary William  Perry was closeted with the puppets to examine war preparations  and declared that the "Team Spirit" nuclear manoeucres would be  resumed in November.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique frequently stage provocative  war games of the puppet army including operations for breaking  through the Military Demarcation Line. Recently, they checked  the reserve ammunition.    It is obvious that the "Hwarang" is motivated by a sinister  intention to drive not only the puppet army but also  para-military forces and inhabitants into war manoeuvres against  the North.    Through the military exercise, the Kim Yong-sam puppet  clique  are seeking to divert the attention of the people elsewhere,  save the crisis and justify their policy of confrontation and  war.    But the days of traitorous regime, estranged by the nation,  are numbered.</p>

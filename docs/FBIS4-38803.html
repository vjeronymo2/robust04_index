			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Appeal No. 122-1 RD of the Russian Federation Federal </F> Assembly State Duma to Ukrainian Supreme Council and Crimean  Supreme Council Deputies, dated Moscow, 25 May 1994]    [Text] Esteemed Colleagues!    The State Duma is following with great disquiet and concern  incoming information regarding the exacerbation of the conflict  between the Republic of Crimea and Ukrainian central organs.    We know from our own experience of building a new Russian  state how difficult the problems associated with the demarcation  of powers are. But we also know how futile and destructive are  attempts forcibly to resolve issues linked with peoples' desire  for self-determination.    The State Duma viewed with hope the announcement of the  first  steps toward constructive dialogue and accord taken in Kiev by a  group of Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Council deputies.    We express confidence that reason will prevail over emotion  in this dispute both in Kiev and in Simferopol. We hope that  Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Council deputies will not allow  irresponsible politicians to jeopardize people's peace and  security for their own opportunistic ends. For its part the  State Duma is ready, with consideration for the delicacy of the  prevailing situation, to do everything in its power to help seek  constructive compromises based on the Russian-Ukrainian treaty  of 19 November 1990.    For two centuries the Crimea has served and, we are  confident, will continue to serve the interests of the fraternal  peoples of Ukraine and Russia. Once again we call for  restraint, civic wisdom, and the renunciation of hasty emotional  actions.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHOPPING: VITTADINI MAINTAINS AN ORGANIZED CLOSET  </P> <P> With clothes tucked neatly into cabinets and not a mannequin in sight, the new  Adrienne Vittadini store at South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court looks more like a  million-dollar closet than a fashion boutique. And that's exactly how the  fashion designer planned it.  </P> <P> "Adrienne wanted a store that wouldn't feel like a store," says Ross Manning,  owner of the new Crystal Court boutique. "She wanted women to feel like they  are walking into a grand wardrobe. She wanted it dramatic and sophisticated,  but extremely practical and elegant. Like the clothes."  </P> <P> Vittadini, the 44-year-old Hungarian-born designer of softly structured women's  knitwear, has expanded her lines in the past few years to include evening wear,  swimwear, scarfs and handbags. Parts of her collections are found in almost  every major department store in the country, but Vittadini recently launched an  effort to open boutiques so that nearly everything in her collections can be  found in one spot.  </P> <P> The Crystal Court store, her third and newest boutique, will carry about 500  new items each season, about $150,000 worth of merchandise at any one time,  according to Manning.  </P> <P> The nearly 2,000-square-foot shop was designed by Milan architect Gai Aulenti,  who was also responsible for restoring Venice's Palazzo Grassi as an art museum  and for designing the new Musee d'Orsay in Paris.  </P> <P> Shipped in 18 crates last fall, components of the salon were designed and  custom-made in Italy and reassembled at Crystal Court. Italian craftsmen made  everything from the 26 hand-milled, bleached beechwood cabinets to the 52 brass  clothes rods, as well as the 24-foot-long glass-topped beechwood table on which  the floral arrangements and visual props designed by Larry Laslo are displayed.  </P> <P> Laslo and Vittadini collaborate on the look of everything Vittadini does except  the clothes: the gift boxes, the floral arrangements, the window displays and  the design props seen throughout the store. During a visit from New York to  oversee completion of the boutique, which opened at the end of November, Laslo  said Vittadini's operation is similar to Ralph Lauren's in that every aspect of  the business is programmed to look the way Vittadini and Laslo want it to look.  </P> <P> "We are very uniform throughout the collection," Laslo said. "Every detail is  planned and designed as one statement, from the gift boxes to the window  designs."  </P> <P> The windows in all three Vittadini boutiques (the others are in Beverly Hills  and St. Louis) are changed weekly to reflect the evolution of the collections,  Laslo said. "There is constant newness, and her windows must reflect that."  </P> <P> Although the store's overall design is a traffic stopper -- a huge domed  ceiling with a skylight tops the built-in cabinetry -- the various elements are  purposely understated to draw attention to the clothes. For example, beechwood  was chosen as the shop's motif because of its subtlety; the clothes stand out  dramatically against its pale grain, Manning said. "The store was really  designed with the clothes in mind. It's meant to be a showcase for the  collection."  </P> <P> That collection keeps growing and is constantly exploring new territory,  Manning added. Among the most recent additions are the designer's  pearl-studded, hand-knit sweaters ($190), which can be paired with a number of  cotton, black-and-white separates.  </P> <P> Also new are the hibiscus-print cotton tops, wide-legged pants and silk shirts.  Prices in the store range from $35 for a scarf to $400 for an evening outfit. A  long, black-and-white striped knit tunic -- a Vittadini signature piece --  sells for $145.  </P> <P> The designer's spring line is gradually filling up the Crystal Court store,  replacing last season's holiday and cruise wear. Inspired by the movie "White  Mischief," many of the pieces have a '40s look: navy-and-white, wide-legged  career trousers; silk jumpsuits and long skirts.  </P> <P> Desert shades and safari-inspired sportswear, dropped torso dresses and linen  separates are also prominent. So are bold red-and-white striped pants and sheer  striped shirts and long, poppy-printed jackets. The spring evening wear uses  lots of black and white, with hand-knit sweaters, silk blouses and rhinestone  bows.  </P></p>

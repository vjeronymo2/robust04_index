			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> HOPKINS TO BUILD SHOPS, HOUSING IN RIVERSIDE RENEWAL  </P> <P> Downtown Riverside is getting a face-lift, and Hopkins Development Co. of  Newport Beach is the latest Orange County developer to get a piece of the  action.  </P> <P> Hopkins, a specialist in redevelopment projects, recently won permission from  the city to build 14,000 square feet of shops over a newly constructed  underground parking garage near the historic Mission Inn and the city's  convention center.  </P> <P> Hopkins is also building 84 apartments and for-sale flats in the  one-square-block area along with Wilmore City Development.  </P> <P> It's the first redevelopment project in downtown Riverside to include a large  amount of housing. That is one of the latest trends in development in Southern  California: putting housing closer to jobs, which makes the downtown  neighborhoods livelier at night and cuts down on automobile traffic.  </P></p>

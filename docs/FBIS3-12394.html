			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F> Group]    [Text] Reaction by Muslim circles to the recent crime by  the Zionist regime of violating the sanctity of the Abrahamite  shrine and massacring the Palestinian worshippers revealed the  nature and character of many Arab regimes and weakened their  political bases. The student and popular demonstrations  throughout Egypt, which started a few days ago, speak of the  deep Islamic bond that the Egyptian people have with their  Palestinian brothers and shows the different stances by the  Egyptian people and by the Egyptian Government in their approach  to the Zionist regime.    The Egyptian Government, which knows this reality more than  anyone else, adopted a progressive position immediately after  Tel Aviv's recent crime to politically exploit the issue and to  avoid the negative repercussions that the Zionist regime's acts  could have at home. Condemning the massacre of the worshippers  at the Abrahamite shrine, it called on international  organizations to seriously examine the issue and take punitive  measures against the Zionist regime.    But this stance, which did not conform with the nature and  principles of the foreign policy of Husni Mubarak's regime,  adopted a contradictory nature with the intensification of the  Egyptian people's protests against the recent crime by the  Zionist regime. The Egyptian police's clashes with demonstrators  protesting against the Zionist regime and the killing of 12  demonstrators [as heard] showed the contradictory behavior of  the Cairo regime and revealed its accord with the Zionist regime.    Political observers believe that the Egyptian Government  cannot agree with the Egyptian people's feelings of solidarity  with the Palestinian dream and walk hand-in-hand with the  Zionist enemy at the same time. These political observers  believe that with their people's reaction to the Zionist  regime's crime, the Arab governments that have been drawn into a  compromise with the Zionist regime based on an incorrect  assessment have realized for the umpteenth time that the path of  compromise with the Zionist regime that they have chosen to  tread does not conform with the people's views and that these  regimes are at a crossroads, where they must choose between  their people and relations with the Zionist regime.    What is certain is that accord among Arab governments and  their people will not only help strengthen these regimes, but  will also grant them immense popular support, which can play an  important role when it comes to showing the direction in which  political developments and processes should move.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Customs has issued a number of rulings on the accounting procedures which may be used to identify merchandise or articles for drawback purposes. In a memorandum dated September 3, 1981 (File: 213253), all Regional Commissioners were directed to permit the use of FIFO in place of lower-to-higher identification and 19 CFR 22.4(f) (requiring lower-to-higher identification) was waived pending the promulgation of &sect;191.22(c) in the proposed revision of the Customs Regulations pertaining to drawback. The reason given for this action was to ``.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;create savings for both Customs and industry by eliminating an antiquated procedure which is not cost effective.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Customs Service Decision (C.S.D.) 79&hyph;252, Customs held that fungible merchandise commingled in storage or manufacture could be identified on a FIFO basis for purposes of 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) (see also C.S.D.'s 79&hyph;301 and 79&hyph;448). In C.S.D. 82&hyph;35, Customs held that when fungible merchandise belonging to several persons is commingled in storage, each person could identify for drawback purposes his withdrawals on a FIFO basis, considering only his inputs and withdrawals. In C.S.D. 83&hyph;54, Customs held that when fungible drawback and non-drawback products were commingled in storage, withdrawals for drawback purposes may be identified against the drawback material in the order of its receipt into the commingled storage facility. In C.S.D. 84&hyph;82, Customs held that when fungible drawback and non-drawback input was placed in commingled storage, withdrawals for drawback purposes could be identified on a ``higher-to-lower'' basis against the drawback input commingled therein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In C.S.D. 88&hyph;1, Customs held that the use of FIFO for drawback purposes, as provided for in the above-described rulings, required that the products be actually commingled in the same tank and that the FIFO procedure must be applied on a date-by-date basis, as illustrated in the ruling. (Section 484A, Customs and Trade Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;382; 104 Stat. 629, 707; 19 U.S.C. 1313(p)), provided alternative monthly accounting procedures for certain crude petroleum and petroleum derivative products in certain conditions. In its directive implementing this statute (Customs Directive 3740&hyph;006, March 17, 1992), Customs stated that the legal principles set forth in C.S.D. 88&hyph;1 would continue to apply to articles not provided for in &sect;484A.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1965 (see T.D. 56487, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 25, 1965 (30 FR 12280)), Customs published a general drawback rate for substitution manufacturing drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives. General rates are manufacturing drawback contracts describing standardized procedures (e.g., steel, provided for in T.D. 81&hyph;74, or piece goods, provided for in T.D. 83&hyph;73). Because the procedures covered in general rates are standardized, a manufacturer or producer who can comply with the terms and conditions of the general rate may seek application of the general rate to its operations through a Customs regional office instead of having to apply for and obtain approval from Customs headquarters, as is true of specific substitution manufacturing drawback contracts (see 19 CFR Part 191, Subparts D and B, respectively). Because of its extreme complexity, the general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives is an exception to this practice, requiring application to Customs headquarters for approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> T.D. 56487 promulgated the general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives by adding it to the Customs Regulations then pertaining to drawback (19 CFR 22.6(g&hyph;1); &sect;22.6 then contained the general drawback rates). (When Part 22 of the Customs Regulations was revised into Part 191, the general drawback rates were not included in the revised regulations, as not being of sufficient general applicability for such inclusion. Thereafter, general drawback rates were published separately as T.D.'s. The general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives, formerly in 19 CFR 22.6(g&hyph;1), was published, without substantive change, as T.D. 84&hyph;49.) T.D. 56487 provided for a monthly period of manufacture, unless a different period was authorized. T.D. 56487 was issued after very thorough review by the government and after the public was given an opportunity to comment (see Notice of Proposed Rule Making, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on June 16, 1965 (30 FR 7756)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Notice of Proposed Rule Making for T.D. 56487, the reasons given for promulgation of the general drawback rate were to meet the complex problems of refiners who produce large groups of widely diversified petroleum products and to provide a better basis for the proper allowance of drawback on such products, and to ensure compliance with the applicable statutory provision (19 U.S.C. 1313(b)). Although the T.D. permitted the designation for drawback of imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives used at one refinery of a refiner as the basis for the allowance of drawback on petroleum products manufactured or produced at another refinery of the same refiner, the T.D. applied to manufacture or production of the latter, or substitute merchandise, on a refinery-by-refinery basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

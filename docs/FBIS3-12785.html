			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following review of the 22 February  issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Awqaf Minister's Efforts Defended    2. Imams Urged to Take Propagation Initiative    3. Western Media Criticized    4. Koran Meanings Translated into Albanian, Bosnian    5. NATO Ultimatum to Serbs  <H5>  AWQAF MINISTER'S EFFORTS DEFENDED </H5>   In its 22 February issue, the state-owned weekly 'AQIDATI  publishes on page one a 300-word editorial signed by Board  Chairman Samir Rajab defending Awqaf Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Ali  Mahjub from criticism. The writer begins by saying that it is  not surprising to see Dr. Mahjub attacked because he is a  successful man, and it has become the habit in Egypt to  criticize only successful people. He adds that the main  accusation leveled at the minister was that only policemen and  state employees attend his seminars and meetings, but this  accusation was refuted last week when thousands came to hear him  speak in Upper Egypt. The writer then praises the minister for  his successful efforts in bringing Christians and Muslims closer  together and arranging meetings between Coptic Pope Shinudah and  Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi and Shaykh Muhammad Mutawalli  al-Sha'rawi. In conclusion, the writer says: "While Awqaf  Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub has taken upon himself the  task of confronting terrorism with an enlightened mind and a  boldness that many lack, he must fully realize that the  propagators, planners, and perpetrators of terrorism will use  all illegal means to deter him from this noble aim. Hence, what  they are using against him now is one of these dirty tricks,  intellectual terrorism. But we tell him: Continue on this path  and fear nothing but God Almighty, your conscience, and the  Egyptian people."  <H5>  IMAMS URGED TO TAKE PROPAGATION INITIATIVE </H5>   Further reporting on Dr. Mahjub's activities, the paper  publishes on page two a 450-word report on speeches he made in  al-Minya and Asyut that focused on the roles and duties of  mosque imams. Speaking in al-Minya, he urged the imams to retake  the initiative in propagation and stand firmly against  impostors. He said: "Religious propagation and those in charge  of it have entered a stage where the situation has become  confused and trends have diversified; where a group that has no  knowledge of religion, its tenets, or the rules or methods of  propagation are vying with the legally, religiously, and  constitutionally qualified imams. This has lead to confusion in  religious thinking among our youth. Adulterated thinking has  been propagated among our youths by a group of people who have  nothing to do with their religion's thinking and who are not  asked to explain this thinking." He then warned: "We will pay  a heavy price and the moderate Islamic course will be affected"  if any of the imams fail in their duties. After stating a  similar message in a speech in Asyut, the minister added that  the state is responsible for the correct concept of Islamic  propagation, fully supports religious establishments, and gives  them unlimited backing. He then urged the imams to go to the  streets, mosques, youth centers, and schools to spread the  message.  <H5>  WESTERN MEDIA CRITICIZED </H5>   On page six, the paper publishes a 340-word comment by  Basyuni al-Halawani in the "Very Frankly" column, in which he  criticizes the Western media for exaggerating "individual and  limited" terrorist actions that take place in Egypt in order to  distort the image of Islam and damage Egypt's economy. After  noting the number of terrorist incidents in Germany in 1993, the  writer says that comparing the terrorist incidents in Egypt with  those abroad shows that real terrorism is in Europe and not in  Egypt, "which remains the most stable and safe country in the  world, and that treachery and betrayal will not change the  Egyptians' tolerant nature." But, he adds, the western media is  persisting in exaggerating these incidents, and this shows that  there are specific objectives in this campaign. He then calls  for a stand against these correspondents "who speak only in the  name of extremism and terrorism and who are looking daily for  whatever distorts our image and damages our interests while  turning a blind eye to all Egyptian achievements." He adds that  this entails drawing up rules and regulations and reviewing our  media policy of dealing with terrorism and extremism so as not  to give the Western media the opportunity to continue publishing  tendentious reports.  <H5>  KORAN MEANINGS TRANSLATED INTO ALBANIAN, BOSNIAN </H5>   The paper carries on page 11 a 700-word report describing  the  efforts of the Islamic Relief Society and its latest  achievement, the printing of 100,000 copies of interpretations  of the Koran in the Albanian and Bosnian languages for  distribution among Muslims in these two countries.  <H5>  NATO ULTIMATUM TO SERBS </H5>   On page 21, 'AQIDATI carries a 300-word comment by Ashraf  Abu-al-Hawl on the aftermath of the NATO ultimatum to the Serbs  in Bosnia. He says that NATO should extend this ultimatum to  other Muslim areas but concludes by saying that one should not  expect "the West to sacrifice its sons for a few Muslims, even  if they are Europeans or Slavs, as is the case with the  Bosnians. Therefore, we have no choice but to accept the West's  solution as long as we cannot resolve it ourselves."</p>

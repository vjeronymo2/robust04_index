			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Japanese companies cut capital spending JAPAN'S Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday published further evidence of deepening pessimism among Japanese businessmen. Capital spending by big companies in the fiscal year from April will fall for the first time since 1986-87, according to a ministry survey. Even though the expected decline is small - 1.4 per cent - the ministry believes the negative figure is ominous because it indicates a marked change in sentiment among businessmen. In the previous survey last autumn, the ministry had forecast a 1.2 per cent increase in investment. Miti's report comes at a time of intense debate within the government about possible action to counter the slow down in the Japanese economy. Miti officials, many with close industry links, are among the most vociferous supporters of government action to stimulate growth. But the Bank of Japan believes further cuts in interest rates are now unnecessary and the Ministry of Finance dismisses as premature demands for increased public spending. The survey shows that capital spending by leading companies rose 6.8 per cent in the year to March, the smallest increase since the mid-1980s. For the current year Miti predicts a 8.9 per cent decline in capital spending by large manufacturing companies and a 6 per cent decline in investment by service industries. Electronics companies are cutting investment by a full 26.4 per cent and car makers by 9.8 per cent. Paper manufacturers, operating in a highly cyclical industry, are planning a 30.7 per cent reduction. The overall reductions would be more severe were it not for planned increases in spending by electric power utilities and other quasi-public institutions.</p>

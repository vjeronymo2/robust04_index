			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Wickes doubles to Pounds 8.76m - Expansion plan could treble number of stores over next few years Wickes, the DIY and timber retailer, yesterday announced details of an ambitious expansion plan that could treble the size of its store portfolio over the next few years. Encouraged by buoyant trading, which more than doubled half-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 8.76m, the group said it hoped to be operating 200 stores in the UK and 100 in continental Europe within five years. Mr Henry Sweetbaum, chairman, said the group had launched nine new stores in the six months to June 30 and planned to open 10 more by the year-end - taking the total to 97. He said the group had been persuaded to accelerate the pace of expansion by a sharp upturn in operating profits and an 11 per cent increase in like-for-like sales at its existing stores. The pre-tax figures, however, were flattered by reduced interest payments of Pounds 1.82m (Pounds 5.23m), which fell sharply after the group used funds from last year's Pounds 58.1m rights issue to reduce net debts from Pounds 72.9m to Pounds 16.3m - equivalent to gearing of 11 per cent. At the operating level, profits rose from Pounds 10m to Pounds 12.5m on increased turnover of Pounds 355.2m (Pounds 294m). 'The recession has turned into a recovery and we have outperformed our competitors in the sector,' said Mr Sweetbaum. He also hailed an improved performance from Hunter Timber, which moved into the black for the first time in several years with an Pounds 800,000 profit. Although Malden Timber - the merchanting business - continued to operate at a loss following flat first quarter sales, Mr Sweetbaum predicted its losses would decline following a wide-ranging structural review. Under the reorganisation, costing Pounds 1.9m in the first half and Pounds 1.4m over the next six months, Malden's management will be integrated into Hunter Timber. Earnings per share rose from 1p to 1.6p and an interim dividend of 0.5p (0.2p) is declared. COMMENT Despite the robust upturn in operating profits, Mr Sweetbaum was sufficiently concerned about interest rate rises to sound a note of caution on the likely strength of the recovery. Nevertheless, Wickes has tailored recent price cuts to demand and won the volume growth to pay for it. It also expects to generate enough cash to open 29 new stores next year, six of them on the continent. That optimism, despite recent planning setbacks in France, prompted a 2p rise in the shares to 97p. Full-year profit forecasts have been clipped to Pounds 30m to take account of further reorganisation in the timber business, leaving the shares on a forward multiple of 18. Although that looks top heavy, the p/e is likely to fall to a more attractive 12 next year if profits reach forecast levels of Pounds 45m.</p>

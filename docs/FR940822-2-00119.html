			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Adjudicating child custody litigation in which family violence may be involved;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Determining and addressing the service needs of children exposed to family violence including the short- and long-term effects on children of exposure to family violence and the methods for mitigating those effects when issuing protection, custody, visitation, or other orders;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Adjudicating and monitoring child abuse and neglect litigation and reconciling the need to protect the child with the requirement to make reasonable efforts to maintain or reunite the family;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Adjudicating and developing dispositions for cases involving elder abuse;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Determining when it may be appropriate to refer a case involving family violence for mediation, and what procedures and safeguards should be employed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Coordinating multiple cases involving members of the same family, and obtaining and appropriately using social and psychological information gathered in one case involving a family member in a case involving another family member; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Handling the criminal and civil aspects of interstate and international parental child abductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In previous funding cycles, the Institute supported a national and a State symposium on courts, children, and the family; a national symposium on enhancing coordination of cases involving the same family that are being heard in different courts; development and evaluation of a curriculum addressing the adjudication of allegations of child sexual abuse when custody is in dispute; and the development and testing of curricula to enhance judges' understanding of the dynamics of family violence and guide them in adjudication family violence cases and custody cases in which spousal abuse is involved. In addition, the Institute has supported studies of the appropriate use of mediation in child abuse cases and in divorce, custody, and visitation cases involving family violence; development of a video and other materials for parties and children awaiting a court hearing in domestic relations cases involving family violence; a benchbook for judges on child abuse and neglect caws stemming from parental substance abuse; curricula to fairly adjudicate child abuse and neglect cases; an examination of the effectiveness of probation as a sanction for child sexual abuse offenders; and the development of guidelines for courts in handling elder abuse cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application of Technology.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This category includes the testing of innovative applications of technology to improve the operation of court management systems and judicial practices at both the trial and appellate court levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Institute seeks to support local experiments with promising but untested applications of technology in the courts that include a structured evaluation of the impact of the technology in terms of costs, benefits, and staff workload. In this context, ``untested'' refers to novel applications of technology developed for the private sector and other fields that have not previously been applied to the courts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Institute is particularly interested in supporting efforts to determine what benefits and problems may occur as a result of courts entering the ``information superhighway,'' including projects to establish standards for judicial electronic data interchange (EDI); local, Statewide, and/or interstate demonstrations of the courts' use of EDI (i.e., the exchange of documents or data in a computerized format that enables courts to process or perform work electronically on the documents received) beyond simple image transfer (facsimile or computer-imaging); and demonstrations and evaluations of innovative judicial/court uses of electronic communications networks including those required to meet the reporting mandates contained in recent Federal legislation such as the Brady Act and the National Child Protection Act. In addition, the Institute is interested in demonstrations and evaluation of the effective use of management information systems to monitor, assess, and predict evolving court needs; and evaluations of innovative technologies highlighted at the Fourth National Conference on Court Technology held in Nashville in October 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ordinarily, the Institute will not provide support for the purchase of equipment or software in order to implement a technology that has been thoroughly tested in other jurisdictions such as the establishment of videolinks between courts and jails, the use of optical imaging for recordkeeping, and the creation of an automated management information system. (See section XI.H.2.b. regarding other limits on the use of grant funds to purchase equipment and software.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In previous funding cycles, grants have been awarded to support:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / The Base Rate Cut: Small businesses offer a cautious welcome  -Low level of borrowing dulls impact on profits OWNERS OF small businesses welcomed yesterday's 1 percentage point cut in the base rate more for the effect they hoped it would have on customer confidence than for its immediate impact on their financing costs. Lower interest charges will not have a significant impact on profits because many businesses have made a determined effort to reduce their borrowings. 'The cut won't make a lot of difference to our bottom line because we have used our overdraft facility frugally,' said Mr David Atkinson, company accountant at Northern Tooling, a Wetherby-based company that reconditions machine tools. 'But it will help our customers who have large overdrafts.' Northern Tooling, with turnover of just over Pounds 1m, has an overdraft of Pounds 120,000, well under its agreed limit of Pounds 160,000. Mr Atkinson said that if the base rate cut did boost demand it planned to relaunch investments in a new computer system, shopfloor equipment and vehicles for its managers. Many businesses have made themselves much less dependent on bank borrowings or shifted from variable rate to fixed-rate loans to reduce their exposure to changes in bank lending policies. National Westminster Bank said only 20 per cent of business start-ups made use of borrowings compared with 40 per cent a few years ago. Norfolk Labels, a label printer to the food industry, uses finance houses to fund its capital expenditure and, because it has good cashflow, maintains a Pounds 250,000 deposit with its bank. Mr Jack Parker, managing director, said: 'The banks have been very greedy in the past and my attitude is to stay away from bank loans.' The company recently spent Pounds 350,000 on new equipment using a five-year fixed-rate loan carrying an APR of 11.25 per cent from a finance house. Mr Parker said he was prepared to pay that rate because he expected interest rates to rise in the next few years. Mr Parker said one benefit of the base rate cut would be to improve the disposable incomes of staff and make them more reconciled to the lower wage rises or pay freezes that companies such as his have brought in during the recession. Norfolk labels has just agreed a pay freeze with its 25 employees. In spite of the controversy that arose in 1991 about the high cost of bank borrowings, the latest NatWest/Small Business Research Trust surveyshows that the cost of finance now ranks only a poor third among the concerns of managers. Lack of business and difficulty in getting paid were the two main worries with interest rates mentioned by just 9 per cent of companies surveyed. NatWest said that half of its customers were continuously in credit and a quarter were continuously overdrawn. Mr Brian Woods-Scawen, a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Birmingham, said that a growing number of companies would not be affected because they had been tied into fixed-rate loans with a minimum rate which had already been reached. National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank have minimum base rates of 6 per cent. If base rates fall below that level businesses might find they do not benefit, although NatWest has said it will keep its minimum rate under re-view. Other accountants who advise small businesses pointed out that some businesses would be unable to increase their investments. Mr Charles Burton, a partner in the Bradford office of Haines Watts, said: 'An interest rate cut is all fine and dandy as long as you can borrow money in the first place. Very many small companies are already at their overdraft limits and can get no more. Anyone who thinks the cut will change this situation is whistling in the wind.' Mr Charles Hatton, a partner in Moore Stephens at Southport, said: 'Let us not lose sight of the fact that a 6 per cent base rate is still well above the rate of inflation - and our clients are typically paying base plus several more percentage points. Mr Grahame Elliott, a senior partner in Stoy Hayward in Manchester, said: 'A lot of my clients have decisions pending on capital projects, so the cut may help them make up their minds. It's not the cut, but a consistent direction that matters. If they believe rates will continue to fall, they may try to borrow, but not if there is a chance of them rising again.'</p>

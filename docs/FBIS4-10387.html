			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ubeda Bravo] </F>   [Text] Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo reiterated in  statements this morning that Army chief Humberto Ortega is the  one who has the weapons and therefore the power even though  President Violeta Chamorro is commander in chief of the Armed  Forces.    "It is well known that in this country, whoever has the  weapons has the power. It will be hard for Ortega to leave soon  because he has the rifles," the chief of the Nicaraguan Catholic  Church said after meeting with Managua Mayor Arnoldo Aleman.    Dr. Emilio Alvarez Montalvan, a prominent political analyst,  labeled Humberto Ortega's statements as "praetorian" and  exceeding his military duties.    "Ortega's statements are a clear praetorian sign that the  Sandinist People's Army (EPS) exercises control over the  civilian government," said Alvarez Montalvan.    Alvarez Montalvan said that the EPS meddles in civilian  society "where it has no right to meddle."    "At this stage of the game, Humberto Ortega should be home  after his 14 long years at the head of the EPS," he said.    Various social sectors have requested Ortega's retirement.  Some Sandinists such as Edmundo Jarquin and Carlos Tunnerman  Bernheim have said on several occasions that the high-ranking  military head's retirement "would be healthy."    Guillermo Potoy said that Ortega's statements demonstrate  once more that "military power prevails over civilian power."    "Humberto Ortega is another gorilla [derisive term used to  describe military officers] among those that have existed in  Latin America and who want to remain in power backed by  weapons," Potoy commented.    According to Potoy, Ortega's continued presence as EPS chief  would bring more instability to the nation.    Meanwhile, Wilfredo Navarro, president of the Independent  Liberal party, told a local radio that Humberto Ortega's  statements "reflect the fragility of the state of law that some  are attempting to establish in Nicaragua."</p>

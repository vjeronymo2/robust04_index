			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Arts: In support of a summer institution - William Packer finds this year's Royal Academy Summer Show a hotbed of controversy and talent It really is time to stand up for the Royal Academy's annual Summer Show. This year's is the 226th in an unbroken sequence that goes back to 1768, and without it the Academy would be nothing. Whatever else it does in the meantime with its splendid galleries, it remains in its essence what it always was - a private society of artists come together for the purpose of showing the work of its members by right, and of others by invitation. That is entirely its affair. Throughout its history it has been a natural source of controversy, stirring up squabbles within and resentment and misunderstanding without. But then what else would we expect, or indeed want? This year is no exception and fairness requires only that our criticism should be levelled at what is presented in the light of what is possible, given the nature of the beast. Some hope. I have seen every Summer Show since 1960. I first successfully submitted my own work in 1963, and have continued to do so at intervals, though not this year. I reviewed every one from 1970 to 1990, at which point it seemed reasonable to pass the duty on to a colleague for a while. I am, you might say, an old Academy hand. But I remember well the days when the Academy had seemed to set its face against much of contemporary painting and sculpture, alienating a whole generation of artists. And I recognise now just how much the Academy has re-newed itself from within, reclaiming that central position in British art which it was always meant to hold. In resuming my own public response this year, I have to say that I have been shocked, not by the Summer Show itself, but by the published violence already visited upon it. Certainly I hardly recognised the show described so brutally by at least two distinguished colleagues on other papers as the one I visited and enjoyed myself. Of course there are weak and even dreadful things among those on show, but then how could there not be in a miscellaneous show of even 300, let alone some 1300 works? And how could any such show achieve formal or thematic coherency when the member artists alone, who have the right to show six of their works, are of such different kinds? To expect such virtue is to miss the point. There is nothing like the Summer Show anywhere else in the world, and its critical importance lies in its very independence from critical dogma and curatorial orthodoxy. I would defend it on those grounds even at its most maddeningly idiosyncratic and perverse, but that is hardly the case today. What in fact it demonstrates to the world at large is that the Turner Prize and the Saatchi Collection notwithstanding, and all that goes with them of avant-garde orthodoxy and opportunism, there remains a broad and rich stratum of professional artists hard at work putting paint on canvas, making prints, making sculpture. Some of them may have had their own moment in the spotlight of critical approbation, which has now passed on: others may have long been disregarded. Some are abstract in their preoccupation, some still content to draw upon the stimulus of the real and visible world. Collectively in their work they give the lie to the facile assumption that such things of any quality are no longer done, that none of it is worthy of the collections of the Tate or the honour of a British Council tour abroad, that none of it is even worth attention. And who could honestly say that the quality is not there, if only the visitor has the independent curiosity to discover it on the walls of the Academy for himself? With some 400 fewer works hung, this Summer Show is smaller than normal and, taking it room by room, is clearly and effectively hung. The architecture, spreading into the Central Hall, is less constricted, and the sculpture, though still a problem, is better assimilated throughout than before and well displayed in its particular concentration in the Lecture Room. Of particular works, I recommend the still-lifes of Gus Cummins and Elizabeth Blackadder; the etchings of Norman Ackroyd and Peter Freeth; the large abstracted water-colours of Norman Adams; two vast abstracts by Sandra Blow; the quiet Sussex parkscapes and greenhouses of Olwyn Bowey; Norman Blamey's portrait of his son - which is as fine a modern portrait as one could find. Portraits and life painting and drawings of true distinction are thin on the ground. Of the non-members' works, I was drawn to Chris Orr's Small Titanic print; to Noel Forster's linear abstract; to three tiny still-lifes by John Maddison; to Stan Smith's seated nude; to Karn Holly's Paris bridge; to the animalier sculpture of Adrian Sorrell; to a portrait by Tom Coates. But it is invidious to go on . . . Peter Coker, Anthony Whishaw and William Bowyer  -the 226th Summer Show has much to show for itself. The Summer Exhibition: Royal Academy of Arts, Piccadilly W1, until August 14: sponsored by Guinness.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Iranians buy stake in German factory THE IRANIAN government has acquired a major stake in the main production plant of Pneumant, eastern Germany's largest tyre company. Iran has bought 40 per cent of the factory at Furstenwalde, east of Berlin, with the remaining interest sold to a management-employee buy-out and to other German investors. The disposal by the Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, was for an undisclosed sum. Iran has guaranteed purchase of the basic output of the factory over the next 12 months, while additional production will be sold to 'untied' European tyre dealers. Pneumant has also concluded a consulting agreement with Iran which has several old tyre factories which are to be modernised. Loss-making Pneumant, which also has large factories in Dresden and Riesa, which are to be sold separately, had turnover last year of DM180m (Dollars 113.9m) and roughly one-fifth the output of Continental, Germany's largest tyremaker. Continental co-operated closely with Pneumant last year and expressed strong interest in buying the east German producer. However, Continental's interest weakened and Pneumant was placed in liquidation last September. An industry observer said the west German tyre giant wanted to make sure Pneumant did not fall into the hands of a competitor before abandoning it. The deal with Iran will secure 890 jobs over the longer term, the Treuhand said.</p>

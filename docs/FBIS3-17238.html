"It can be understood from the proposal of Ilyumzhinov that  the talk is about a change in the status of the Republic of  Kalmykia", the spokesman said in a statement on Monday,  explaining that such a change was possible under the  constitution only upon mutual consent of the subject of the  federation and the federation itself.    "If (Ilyumzhinov) proposes to preserve the republican  status,  then, according to the Russian Constitution, Kalmykia should  have its own constitution", the spokesman said.    "The Kalmyk president's aspiration to preserve Russia's  territorial integrity may be only applauded. However, any  political action, however noble its motivation could be, should  be brought in line with the principles and norms of the Russian  Constitution. Any other approach is fraught with substitution  of the idea of expediency for the idea of law. Such an approach  will have nothing in common with the challenge of building a  law-governed state", the spokesman emphasised.</p>

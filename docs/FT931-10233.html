			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Avesta Sheffield reports on changes AVESTA SHEFFIELD, the Anglo-Swedish company which is one of Europe's biggest stainless steel producers, has detailed the first effects of its post-merger rationalisation and hinted of more to come. The company was formed in November from a merger between Avesta of Sweden and British Steel's stainless operations. Avesta shareholders have a 60 per cent stake and British Steel owns the remainder. Stockholm-based Avesta Sheffield said changes were already under way. Employment is being cut from about 9,000 at the time of the merger to 8,750, including 50 jobs in distribution, 70 in plate production, and 60 on the precision strip side in Sweden. In line with the job cuts, a wide-plate finishing facility at Sheffield has been closed, and in precision strip a detailed examination is being made of possible rationalisation at Sheffield. Mr Per Molin, chief executive, said: 'It is already clear we will benefit from the synergy effects we anticipated. In some cases the financial affects are greater than we had originally envisaged.' In spite of strong market volumes in Europe, the company is suspending melting at its Tinsley Park site in Sheffield for the week beginning February 15. Similar melting cuts are being introduced in Sweden, aimed at reducing stocks and supporting a recent upward movement in prices.</p>

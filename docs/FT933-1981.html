			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Paper glut to hit Ecu bond market AFTER a year of famine, the Ecu bond market is now threatened by a glut of paper. Sweden yesterday launched an Ecu500m issue of five-year bonds, bringing the supply of new paper to more than Ecu1bn in the last week. In addition, the French government announced details of a Ecu1bn-Ecu1.2bn auction of 10-year OATs next week, while the Italian government is holding a domestic Ecu bond auction this week. The fragile recovery of the Ecu bond market could be in jeopardy, according to some analysts. Yesterday, Barclays de Zoete Wedd's European bond strategists downgraded Ecu to an 'underweight' recommendation, saying that the market has outperformed most other European markets but is now looking expensive. Ecu bonds are currently yielding around 20 basis points less than their theoretical, basket-currency value, having recovered substantial ground following the widening of exchange rate mechanism bands in August. 'At this level, we think the market is beginning to look expensive . . . There is no reason to hold (Ecu) at all as better value can be had through its constituent parts,' said Mr Mark Capleton, a BZW strategist. The sudden burst of new issue activity was prompted by the short supply of current coupon paper - bonds which are priced around their par value. As a result of the recent bond market rally, older bonds with higher coupons are now trading at a substantial premium to their par value, which deters some investors. Demand for par-priced paper has been used as a justification for pricing weaker credits to yield less than benchmark French government bonds. While the first in the series of deals, the Council of Europe's Ecu150m eight-year deal via Goldman and UBS, caught the swell of demand perfectly, subsequent deals have proved harder to sell. Some analysts said that Sweden's Ecu500m five-year deal via Paribas Capital Markets, priced yesterday at eight basis points through the comparable BTAN issue, was too aggressive. However, other dealers said that the pricing was fair, although current coupon levels, below 6 per cent for five-year bonds, are unattractive for some investors. 'It is a positive sign for the market that there is new issuance, without any sign of moving closer to monetary union,' said Mr Jonathan Davies, an analyst at UBS. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how the market will hold up under the weight of further supply, which includes a potential European Community offering.</p>

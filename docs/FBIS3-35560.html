He said: Muslims and officials in Islamic countries should  not not be tricked by the Zionists' deceitful rationalizations.  It would be foolish for anyone in the world to think that a few  extremist or mentally ill Jews could commit such a crime without  a hand from the Israeli and American military.    Explaining the reasons for the crime, the head of the  legislature said: Presently due to the blessing of the Islamic  revolution the Zionists are facing great waves of popular  struggles and Israel with America who are well aware of the  consequences of the deep rooted resistance by the children of  the intifadah, Hamas, and other revolutionary children of  Palestine, are committing such horrendous crimes.    He also expressed regret over and criticized the silence of  international organizations and associations regarding the  crime. He said in this respect: What is being presented today as  the Middle East peace plan has no other aim than the expansion  of the hegemony, crimes, and ominous aims of the Zionist regime.    Stating that this crime would not have happened if 'Arafat  and his cronies had not accepted the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the  Majles speaker referred to the principled Iranian policy on the  Zionist regime and said: Muslim nations and governments should  accept the reality that the enemy will come forward a step for  every step that they take back.    Finally Nateq-Nuri hoped that the children of Palestine will  continue their struggles with greater morale and uproot the  usurping regime occupying Jerusalem.</p>

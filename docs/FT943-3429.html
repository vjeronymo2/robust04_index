			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Observer: Corzine goes solo Goldman Sachs' recent performance may have been hit by poor results on its trading activities, but the choice of Jon Corzine, 47, as the firm's new senior partner is a reminder of where the real power in the firm lies. Corzine has been with Goldman for 20 years and has come up through the ranks as the partner in charge of trading governments, mortgage-backed securities and money market instruments. His new number two, Hank Paulson, 47, is the investment banking man. In the past, Goldman has tended to split the top job by appointing two co-chairmen. Robert Rubin shared the job with Stephen Friedman before he joined the Clinton administration as chairman of the National Economic Council, and before that the firm was dominated by John Whitehead and John Weinberg. Doubling up at the top of an investment bank has always looked a bit of a fudge, although it has worked well in Goldman's case. Given his age, Corzine will have longer than many of his predecessors to prove that the new regime can work equally well.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / People: Swinson re-emerges at Stoy Hayward Christopher Swinson, erstwhile national managing partner of BDO Binder Hamlyn, has emerged from a period of uncharacteristic quiet to announce that he will be joining rival accountancy firm Stoy Hayward on January 1. Swinson will help build the firm's litigation support department, where he joins Robert Watson, an existing partner who specialises in personal litigation. Swinson says he will focus on professional negligence, libel, contract disputes and regulation issues, and is confident that the work will continue to grow. 'In a recession people resort to the law more frequently,' he says. 'I can't believe that trend will decline.' Swinson left BDO last June after being deposed from his position following a coup by other senior partners in the firm. 'I've thoroughly enjoyed being on my own, but it is not credible in the long-run to be totally divorced from the coal-face,' he says. 'You can end up seeming too academic.' He has been maintaining his extensive professional commitments in the past few months, including joining the board of the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the policing arm of Britain's new accounting standards body. He also continued his studies for a law degree in London part-time, but says he has no current plans to switch profession having built up capital in accountancy. Meanwhile, Swinson has wasted no time in applying his legal skills. He recently served a writ against BDO for compensation and recovery of his interests in the partnership. BDO has called the writ unwarranted and says it will be strongly contested. ***** Peter Herke, a former director of Digital Equipment Company in the UK, has joined Elonex, the fast-growing privately-owned north London personal computer manufacturer. As sales and marketing director, he will be responsible for strengthening the group's customer base and guiding its expansion into new markets. One target will be the corporate local area network sector where Elonex has already begun to make inroads. Educated in Canada, Herke studied electrical engineering at the University of British Columbia before taking an MBA at the LSE in 1965. In that year he joined DEC as a computer salesman - the US group's 13th UK-based employee. With the exception of four years in the 1970s managing a computer graphics company he worked continuously for DEC until September. During his last year he was md of DEC's small and medium enterprises in Europe. 'What is happening now with Elonex reminds me very much of the exciting times at DEC in the 1960s and 1970s,' he says.</p>

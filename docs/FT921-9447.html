			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Ericsson slumps to SKr1.6bn on flat sales ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, yesterday said a combination of weak demand and restructuring provisions had pushed pre-tax profits for 1991 down by two-thirds to SKr1.6bn (Dollars 274.4m). Ericsson warned that demand for telecommunication products would continue to be 'very weak' during the first half of this year, mainly because of planned cuts in capital expenditure by telephone operating companies. It added that the 1992 profit figure - which was 'highly dependent upon sensitivity to economic conditions' - was expected to be low. Orders last year fell by 9 per cent to SKr44.7bn, while sales were virtually unchanged at SKr45.8bn, against SKr45.7bn in 1990. Fully diluted, earnings per shares dropped from SKr14.66. However, Ericsson is holding its dividend at SKr3.50. While order bookings increased by 26 per cent during the fourth quarter of last year to SKr13.82bn, the group's pre-tax profit for the period fell by 97 per cent to SKr93m. However, the final three months showed a significant recovery over the third-quarter performance, which left the company facing a SKr194m loss. Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive, said the company intended to continue with its investment development plans despite the recession. He insisted that 'strong development programmes coupled with cost effectiveness' were enabling the company to maintain and strengthen its international market shares. When the economy begins to recover, Mr Ramqvist added, the company would return to a 'good level of profitability'. Part of last year's profit decline is due to the SKr600m being set aside by the company for its continuing restructuring. Last week, it announced that 1,000 jobs were to go mainly at its Swedish operations, where 14,000 are employed.</p>

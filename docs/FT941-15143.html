			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Confusing trend in use of English language Sir, Are British publishers aiming to dispose of one of their key assets - the English language? Or is the American market the only focus of their attention, despite the increase in British book sales over the recent Christmas period? I received two books at Christmas which give rise to such questions; one was the well-reviewed Wild Swans - Jung Chang's autobiographical view of the development of communism in China; the second Paul Merton's satirical impression of the History of the Twentieth Century. Both were printed and published in Britain and in each the authors in their introduction make specific mention of the use of English words. Therefore the authors cannot be pleased to see American spellings in their books. One has a PhD in linguistics from a British university and teaches in London, and the English language must surely be central to the work of an essentially English humorist. Wild Swans contains examples such as 'somber' and 'maneuvring' throughout. The Merton book is not consistent in its choice, but just on one page we see a noun and its related verb both spelt as 'practise', along with the use of 'offense'. Is it by accident or design that the American rather than the English version of the 'spell-checker' seems to be in use, when most word processing packages offer both? No wonder that so-called 'typos' regularly appear in a range of publications (although rarely in the FT). Those seeking to learn and use the English language today, especially by reading, and to understand its origins and nuances, must be thoroughly confused. This raises a final question. Should the government really be seeking further to involve businesses in British education? Sylvia P Webb, 2 Alderley Court, Berkhamsted, Herts HP4 3AD</p>

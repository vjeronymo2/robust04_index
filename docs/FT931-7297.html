			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Hacker caused computer to 'crash', jury is told A COMPUTER system used by an international cancer research centre was put out of action by a schoolboy computer hacker, Southwark Crown Court was told yesterday, John Mason writes. Mr Paul Bedworth, now 19, installed a rogue program into the computer used by the Brussels-based European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer, the jury heard. This caused the system to 'crash', Mr Vincent Piedboeuf, the centre's head of information technology said. It was the worst systems breakdown the centre had experienced, he said. Surgeons needed 24 hour a day access to the computer files, which held details of patients and treatments they were receiving. Mr Bedworth, of Ilkley, West Yorkshire, denies charges including obtaining unauthorised access to computer material and unauthorised modification of computers under the Computer Misuse Act. The trial continues today.</p>

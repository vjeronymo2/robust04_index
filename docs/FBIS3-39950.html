			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Stefano Marroni report: "Bertinotti Stirs Up Treasury Bill </F> War"]    [Text] Rome -- "Every time that attention is turned in  Italy to fiscal questions, the same reaction is stirred up:  From the center-left there is always someone who is seeking to  appear as the protector of small and legitimate interests, in  order to defend large and illegitimate interests. This time,  however, I have the feeling that the maneuver will not succeed:  ordinary people, pensioners, workers will have no difficulty in  understanding the prize at stake." Fausto Bertinotti does not  agree, and resolutely rejects the squall of criticism which is  descending on him from almost the whole of the political world.    A wall of noes greets his hint that the left will need, if  it  enters government, to review the taxation of interest on  treasury bills, for anyone owning government securities in an  amount exceeding 200 million lire [L]. However, he is not  giving in, stating that he will be announcing tomorrow the  details of a proposal for an inheritance tax, which is one of  the key items -- together with reducing the workweek to 35 hours  -- of Communist Renewal's program.    But the "treasury bill war" has now been triggered, and  everything leads us to believe that it will continue throughout  the election campaign. The right --from the League to the  National Alliance -- is attacking: denouncing the attempt to  further squeeze those who save, and gleefully attributing the  Communist Renewal secretary's intentions to the whole of the  progressive ticket. For Forza Italia's Antonio Martin  Bertinotti starts with "the right premise," but comes to the  wrong conclusion. "It is true," the economist states, "that in  absolute terms the fact of excluding interest on government  securities from taxation leads to unfair results, with a person  earning L100 million from working paying half this sum in taxes,  while someone earning this amount from securities keeps the full  amount. But this inequity is not so easy to resolve: Unless  one accepts a huge rise in real interest rates and and a whole  set of negative consequences on the budget and employment."    At the center, Pact for Italy members and the PPI [Italian  Popular Party] let it be known that Bertinotti's proposal "does  not make sense," and, as PPI politician Roberto Pinza points  out, an attack on savings "would end up increasing the hostility  generated by the tax burden." Tax lawyer and Pact candidate  Giulio Tremonti gives Renewal's leader credit for at least being  ostensibly and completely consistent with the culture of the  "financial left." From this perspective Bertinotti's views are  more coherent and convincing -- Tremonti states in an open  polemic with refutation of the PDS [Democratic Party of the  Left] program -- than those of certain groups whose internal  rivalry we are currently witnessing. And the VOCE REPUBBLICANA  speaks of a left which is in jeopardy, which goes "into battle  with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi by implying a tax on  savings, while latter promises to abolish as much tax as  possible. Let us therefore not be surprised then, if the right  is already shouting victory based on opinion poll results."    But quite a lot of Bertinotti's allies are also distancing  themselves, and not hiding their irritation and embarrassment at  a move which could boomerang. Or, in the words of Socialist  Fabrizio Cicchitto, an "exercise which is good only for losing  votes for the progressive front." After Mussi's "political"  clarification, the PDS is letting the voices of its technicians  be heard: "There is no need to intervene with new taxes on  treasury bills," Vincenzo Visco, responsible for PDS tax policy,  assures; interest rates are falling, and we are moving toward a  stabilization of government debt. The deficit reduction is  being obtained by another means, and for this reason  interventions of this kind do not make sense."    For Paolo Leon, any revision of the taxation of financial  activities is not a question for the near future and ,  therefore, "should not be viewed as a threat but as an  opportunity." But Filippo Cavazzuti is very decisive:  "Treasury bill holders can be calm -- the vice chairman of the  Senate Financial Committee explains -- the suggestion of a  revision of the taxation of treasury bills is not shared by the  majority of the progressive front. It is a position of the  Renewal."    Nor does Bertinotti hide that this is so, and waxes ironic  on the fact that, in Italy "it falls to a Communist force to  advance proposals of a frankly socialist flavor." For him, "no  one has been able to explain in a convincing way why L50 million  earned by an employee should be taxed at the source, and the  same income, in the form of interest on treasury bills, should  be totally exempt." The Renewal, Bertinotti assures us, has no  intention of taxing the small saver, "the fruit of labor which  has already been amply taxed. It is obvious that, as is the  case a primary residence and any inheritance tax, one must  provide an exemption threshold below which nothing is paid. I  have mentioned the figure of L200 million."    The question of taxing wealth, that is another matter, the  Renewal's leader makes the distinction, "because this is what we  are talking about: the raking up of treasury bills was how,  during the eighties, large industrial profits, trillions, were  transferred from production to financial investment. This has  been the path of the `financialization' of Italian capitalism,  which with one hand collected contributions from the state for  restructuring, and on the other hand was investing in treasury  bills instead of in plant and machinery. And therefore  reviewing the taxation of securities -- with the qualification  that if interest rates fall, taxes will also be reduced -- also  means promoting the return of resources from financial  investment to productive investment, to industrial  capitalization."    For his critics, and in particular those of the left,  Bertinotti has a curt response: " What needs to be determined  is whether or not the will exists to reform the tax system,  whether it is possible to achieve equity while surrendering to  unacceptable blackmail. I have the impression that many of  these heated objections are specific to the election campaign.  In the past, millions of workers went on strike, based on CGIL  [Italian General Confederation of Labor], CISL [Italian  Confederation of Trade Unions], and UIL [Italian Federation of  Trade Unions] programs, which had this proposal at their center.  And by the way," he concludes sarcastically, "I do not remember  major objections being raised in those days."</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Operations resume after fire at petrol additives plant Operations resumed at Associated Octel's petrol additives plant (above) at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, yesterday after a blaze had destroyed a reaction vessel and injured one worker and five firefighters. All the injured were released from hospital after treatment, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. The fire started while emergency services were trying to stop a leak of ethyl chloride. About 200 firefighters battled the blaze, which began at 8.30pm on Tuesday. A police helicopter flew over parts of Cheshire downwind of the blaze warning people to stay indoors because hydrogen chloride vapour was escaping. Associated Octel said the vapours dispersed quickly and were not a danger. The biggest concern was over a fire under a storage tank with a two-hour protective coating. Firefighters put it out with 20 minutes to spare, leaving other fires to burn while they tackled it. All fires were out by 8am yesterday. The accident prompted calls by residents and politicians for an independent inquiry and relocation of the plant, which employs 1,650 people. The plant is part of a petrochemical complex which includes Shell's Stanlow refinery and dominates the south bank of the Manchester Ship Canal. Mr Bob Larbey, corporate affairs manager, said: 'This was a major fire but safety procedures worked. We do not yet know what caused the leak, but automatic sniffing equipment detected it. The coating on the storage tank also did its job. It is all very well calling for shutdown and relocation, but we are a major employer. Exports from the site are worth about Pounds 250m a year.' The company will use local stocks and supplies from abroad until the ethyl chloride plant is rebuilt. Mr Larbey said the cost of the fire was still unknown but the plant was fully insured.</p>

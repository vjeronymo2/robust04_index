			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine warning on coal inquiry MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, warned yesterday that there would be 'uncomfortable conclusions' from his department's inquiry into the market for coal, Lisa Wood writes. He told the employment select committee, which is investigating the proposed closure of 31 pits, that there were still no contracts for coal when the existing ones ran out in March, apart from a conditional contract signed by Eastern Electricity and PowerGen this week. British Coal and the power stations had large stocks of coal, would not need more for a long time, and it was cheaper to import foreign coal, he told the committee. 'That is the stark position we face. It is as stark today as in October when I first announced it,' the secretary of state said.</p>

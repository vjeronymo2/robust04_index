			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in a  statement Friday denounced the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique's  brutal suppression of the struggle of peasants and people of  other strata against farm market opening, Seoul-based radio  Voice of National Salvation [VNS] reported.    The statement says the courageous turnout of the peasants  and  other people in a struggle for defence of the nation's  foundation for existence is an entirely righteous patriotic  action.    It strongly demands that the Kim Yong-sam group of traitors  admit and apologize for its anti-popular criminal act,  immediately release the arrested peasants and students and  promptly stop the desperate search.    Such a thorough-paced pro-American flunkeyist traitor and  fascist maniac as Kim Yong-sam can find no shelter in this land,  the statement says.    The only way out for the peasants and people of other strata  is to overthrow the fascist "civilian" regime and establish an  independent democratic government, stresses the statement.</p>

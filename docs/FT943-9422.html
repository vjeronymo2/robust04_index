			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Builders reluctant to hire jobless staff Employers are very reluctant to hire professional and managerial staff unless they have a job already, says a leading construction industry survey published today. It will make depressing reading for middle-ranking executives who lost their jobs during the recession and are hoping to return to work as the economy slowly recovers. Montrose Technical Recruitment, the industry's biggest recruitment agency, said that 93 per cent of construction employers 'would rather appoint candidates who are currently employed elsewhere even though the recession has forced redundancy upon many through no fault of their own'. Many companies are prepared to wait for staff to serve notice rather than hire an unemployed person with no recent experience. Employers said jobless managers and professionals would have a better chance of being re-employed if they could show that they had been prepared to take a lower grade job such as labouring - one employer even suggested busking - rather than remain out of work. Some said unemployed job seekers should 'offer to work for no pay to get back into the job market'. Mr Robert Smith, Montrose managing director, said employers preferred to take on managers with recent experience, even though salaries were rising in the industry because there was a shortage of experienced staff. More than 500,000 jobs are estimated to have been lost from the construction industry since 1989, according to employers. Montrose has filled more than 18,000 labouring, managerial and professional jobs in the past 12 months. Of the 75 employers questioned by the agency, more than half said being made compulsorily redundant could make it even more difficult for an applicant. 'Jobless applicants have to show extra initiative and commitment to give themselves an equal chance with those who have held down a job throughout the recession, even though salaries and demand for staff are growing again,' Mr Smith said.</p>

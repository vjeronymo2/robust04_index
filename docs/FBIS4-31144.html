			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 3 Jun (TANJUG) -- Colonel Lazo Babic,  commander of the Western Slavonia Corps of the Serb Krajina  Army, sent a protest letter to General Sharmi, the UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] commander for Sector West, over an incident  that happened at a meeting of Sector West's commissions in Lipik  yesterday. According to a statement by the Serb Krajina Army's  Main Headquarters, Croatian General Dzanko threatened to arrest  one of the official Krajina representatives at the talks, and a  more serious incident was prevented only through UNPROFOR  General Vergar's intervention. Voicing serious concern over the  success of the upcoming talks and the safety of the Krajina  negotiators, Col. Babic demands the Croatian general's apology  over the incident that could have unforeseeable consequences.  He also demands an increased level of security by UNPROFOR at  future talks' venues.</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Black horse looks a banker - Lloyds likely to succeed in C&amp;G bid Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society is one of the UK's most self-confident mortgage lenders. It does not usually cast itself in the role of an organisation driven by events. Yet, chief executive Andrew Longhurst could not emphasise strongly enough this week that his board originally had intended all C&amp;G's members to make a windfall gain in sharing out the Pounds 1.8bn cash takeover bid from Lloyds Bank. He stressed that the society had been forced to produce a more restricted scheme for spreading the money among fewer members only because of a High Court ruling. Acknowledging that people now excluded from the payments - investors who opened accounts after the end of 1992, and all borrowers - would be unhappy, Longhurst sought to pre-empt criticism by saying C&amp;G had wanted to include them. 'If they are to be described as victims,' he added, 'then they are the law's victims or the government's victims - not C&amp;G's victims.' Although borrowers will get no cash payments, they should benefit from the more competitive rates expected to result from C&amp;G becoming part of the Lloyds bank group. Like C&amp;G investors, those in the former Heart of England building society, the business of which was transferred to C&amp;G last October, will qualify for payments if they opened investment accounts before the end of 1992. All payments will be made soon after completion of the deal. This is now expected next summer if it is approved by a special general meeting in March. Some C&amp;G members, however, are not convinced that C&amp;G had no choice but to act as it has done. Their questions include: Why was there no appeal against the High Court judgment restricting payments? Why did the society not simply set a different cut-off date for qualifying investors to include more of them, even at the expense of extending the timetable for the deal to proceed? Longhurst said C&amp;G had not appealed because there was no guarantee the appellate court would have ruled in the society's favour. In any case, he added, such a move certainly would have involved another extension of the original timetable. The original deal was announced in April. C&amp;G feels renewed uncertainty over its future would have a poor effect on both the society and the bank. Those who see things differently include Paul Rivlin and Peter Nicholson, who are organising members into a C&amp;G Alternatives Group, which intends to call for a special general meeting in the autumn. It takes 100 members to call for such a meet-ing. Rivlin says there are three broad subjects which the group would like the board to justify to members: The decision to abandon mutual ownership; Rejecting the idea of floating the society instead of simply transferring to an existing organisation such as Lloyds; Excluding other potential bidders for C&amp;G. (This would include discussing the society's Pounds 1.8bn valuation.) The deal with Lloyds depends on approval by C&amp;G's borrowers and investors in two separate votes. The society has 370,000 borrowers and a simple majority of their votes is required. There is no minimum voting threshold for borrowers. But the investors' resolution must be approved by at least 75 per cent of those who vote. It must also be approved by at least half of the total number of investors eligible to vote, or investors holding 90 per cent of the total balances of those eligible to vote. The recent history of building societies suggests the great majority of members are content to accept the judgments of their boards about how they should progress. On that basis, even if the alternatives group gets its special general meeting and despite the high levels of approval the Lloyds bid must win from members, C&amp;G looks likely to team up with the black horse.</p>

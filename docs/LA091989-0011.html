			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIGHTING THE WAR ON DRUGS  </P> <P> I have read with close attention everything your paper has published in the  past days about the drug problem, particularly what has to do with my country,  Colombia, and with my hometown, Medellin.  </P> <P> Your article (Part I, Sept. 9) analyzing the impossibility of controlling drugs  at its source has confirmed my point of view, and that of many Colombians also,  that, no matter how much our government tries, no matter how many lives we  sacrifice, or how much money you send us in planes and arms to fight the drug  cartels, there will be no end to this struggle, at least, not until the demand  ends.  </P> <P> Will it ever end? This is the big question the world is now asking. The  complexity of the problem is undeniable.  </P> <P> At some time in the future the world will realize that by outlawing cocaine we  have created an evil greater than the drug, and it is the corruption and  immorality which have no respect for human life. Colombia is a clear example of  this. We are not fighting drug addiction so much as corruption by drug  traffickers at levels never before seen in our country.  </P> <P> It is not that we don't have problems of drug addiction in our country or that  we are insensitive to the dimension of the problem in the United States and in  other countries of the world. It is just that no other country's legal system  and survival as a civilized nation have been threatened as has been the case of  Colombia.  </P> <P> Wars are senseless, but people seem to get into them without realizing how  senseless they can be and always thinking that it will be only for a few  months. But this is a different situation. Even President Bush speaks of years,  and deep down everybody knows that as long as people want to use cocaine, there  will never be an end to this.  </P> <P> So, if we will end up accepting that people will get cocaine somehow, let us  accept it now before my country is torn apart. Let us all dedicate our efforts  to what peace can offer: the opportunity to prevent its use by giving a better  life to those who are more susceptible to become addicts and help to those who  already are.  </P> <P> DIANA JARAMILLO  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Debt threatens investment, says Bank: Quarterly Bulletin warns cautious borrowing likely - Asset-backed securities market grows Peter Norman, Economics Editor Severe financial constraints affecting a minority of UK households and companies are likely to lead to cautious borrowing patterns and moves to reduce debt in the months ahead, the Bank of England warns today. In an article released before publication tomorrow of its Quarterly Bulletin and Inflation Report, the Bank concludes that the continuing effects of high debt levels on some companies could dampen investment and employment expansion during the present economic recovery. In the longer term the Bank expects households and corporations will be willing to take on debt again. In the personal sector, income gearing - the ratio of net interest payments to disposable income - is back at the levels of the mid 1980s while the corporate sector as a whole has reduced its indebtedness sharply since 1992. But, says the Bank, 'in the recent recession, debt had a much greater impact on both sectors' behaviour than in the recession of the early 1980s. 'Even last year, many companies remained vulnerable to a sharp rise in interest rates.' House price falls and debt deflation 'left many recent housebuyers - a substantial minority of all homeowners, and often young, first-time buyers - with negative net wealth'. At its peak in the first quarter of 1993, the negative equity of homebuyers totalled nearly Pounds 12bn and affected about 1.8m households, of which more than half were in the south-east. In the first quarter of this year, negative equity was still affecting 1.29m households. Its total value was Pounds 7.6bn, representing an average of Pounds 5,900 per affected household, the Bank says. In the corporate sector, the Bank found that smaller companies were especially badly hit by high levels of debt. Many companies became vulnerable to recession through over-expansion in the 1980s when they had high profit expectations that were not fulfilled. One analysis showed that 'the firms that were highly indebted in 1991 had been among the most profitable in the mid 1980s'. The combination of debt and poor profitability among highly geared companies led in the recession to large-scale job losses, cuts in investment and widespread insolvency. A substantial minority of households had mortgage arrears and some lost their homes through repossession. The Bank says the financial hardships experienced by households have changed spending patterns and affected the economy as a whole. For example, lump-sum repayments to mortgage lenders rose by 140 per cent between 1989 and 1993 to Pounds 2.5bn, or nearly 5 per cent of personal sector saving last year. This increase, at a time of falling mortgage rates, almost certainly reflected concern about debt levels.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WESTAMERICA SET TO SELL LAND IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY  </P> <P> Westamerica Inc., a publicly owned residential development company, said  Thursday that it is negotiating to sell two vacant subdivisions in Riverside  County in a deal worth $12 million to $14 million.  </P> <P> The prospective buyer is Griffin Homes, a privately held developer  headquartered in Calabasas, according to a report Westamerica filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> Officials at Griffin could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Westamerica, which moved to Orange County from Minnesota in 1987, builds  entry-level single family homes, mostly in Riverside and San Bernardino  counties, said Theodor Nickolas Bodnar, firm chairman and chief executive.  </P> <P> He said the company often buys land at low prices years before there is a local  market for homes, obtains the necessary zoning and building clearances and  then, when a market does develop, sells the undeveloped subdivisions to other  builders "at a big profit."  </P> <P> The properties Griffin is interested in, Bodnar said, fall into that category.  One is a 156-lot subdivision in Rancho Temecula and the other is a 147-lot  subdivision in Lake Elsinore.  </P></p>

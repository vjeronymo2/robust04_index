			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Taboos that need to be broken in Docklands Sir, You say that 'restoring hope to areas such as docklands is essential if extreme right-wing politics is not to be a recurrent form of protest in elections'. You note that 'many white, working-class people in the area have been economically marginalised by the docks' decline'. But you fail to take note of what is being done to restore hope and create work - modern work - if not for died-in-the-wool-Jack-Dash-dockers, then their children, and those of incomers ('A shiver in east London', September 20). For example, last December a Pounds 1.2m training centre opened in Tower Hamlets, aimed especially at women and people from ethnic minorities and offering training in office skills, computing and new technology. One month later, two new Access Centres were opened in Wapping and on the Isle of Dogs. Run by Skillnet, the Access Centres are designed to act as the first link in the chain between unemployment and a job for all young Tower Hamlets people. In neighbouring Newham, the Docklands Computer Aided Learning project is giving more than 10,000 Newham children of all origins the benefit of the highest concentration of computers anywhere in Europe. If good is to come out of evil, it will be necessary for both working-class and middle-class English taboos to be broken. For the former, this means acknowledging the correlation between the introduction of the Dock Labour Scheme in 1967 and the start of the closure of London's docks in 1968. It also means acknowledging that father-to-son working-class employment is no longer valid in the 1990s. As for the middle class, perhaps it needs to rid itself once and for all of post-colonial guilt - surely the driving force behind the housing policy of Tower Hamlets Council.

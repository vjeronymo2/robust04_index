			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Unionists get clarification of London's declaration A Northern Ireland minister last night used a speech to a pro-unionist group to provide clarification of part of the Downing Street declaration and to reassure unionists that London is not indifferent to Ulster's future. Speaking just hours before this week's 72-hour IRA ceasefire ended, Mr Michael Ancram said London would 'vigorously and wholeheartedly' support Northern Ireland's wish to remain in the union for as long as the greater number of the province's people so wished. He said the joint declaration's assertion that Britain had 'no selfish strategic or economic interest' in the province meant only that the government had no agenda of its own that would cause it to frustrate the population's wishes. His remarks to a meeting in Cambridge came as Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, attacked Mr John Major for his 'provocative and belligerent' tone during the ceasefire. Mr Adams said Mr Major's preoccupation with the survival of his government was a 'minus factor' in the peace process. But the significance of the IRA's gesture 'will not have been missed by the policy makers at Whitehall'. The Sinn Fein president, who earlier this week in effect discounted the chances of a ceasefire extension, hinted in Belfast there was a potential for some further initiative from the IRA at a later date, although he would not be specific about what that might be. Mr Ancram told the Friends of the Union there was at present 'no widespread support' for a joint authority in Northern Ireland. This was 'not something which . . . I expect to see emerging from any genuine process of dialogue leading to an agreed solution'. Meanwhile, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, used a speech in Toronto to pledge that the government would persevere in its efforts to forge a lasting settlement.</p>

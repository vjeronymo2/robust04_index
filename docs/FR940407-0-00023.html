			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> c. Submit a program amendment of the Division's definition of the term ``Public Road'', to read the same as the corresponding federal definition at 30 CFR 761.5 and, in addition, provide that the definition applies only in the context of Utah Admin. R645&hyph;103&hyph;100,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , Areas unsuitable for Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Submit a program amendment of the Division's definition of the term ``Affected Area'' to read the same as the corresponding federal definition at 30 CFR 701.5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II. OSM and the Division agree that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. If a road in Utah has not previously been determined to be part of an existing surface coal mining operation, the road will not be required to be included within a permit, based on current federal statute and regulations and the current Utah statute and rules; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. With respect to any application for a permit to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations under the Utah Coal Regulatory Program, including any application pending at the time of this agreement, the state will apply the Utah statute and rules existing on the date of permit approval. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asserted that the Federal regulatory definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area,'' and Utah's proposed amendment to its regulatory definitions of those terms, do not clearly define OSM's and Utah's jurisdiction over public roads. The commenter stated that until OSM and Utah clarify their jurisdiction over public roads, they must only impose on operators regulations that conform to the specific terms of the September 4, 1992, agreement. The commenter noted that this agreement requires Utah to submit to OSM a program amendment to Utah's regulatory definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area'' that ``reads the same as'' the corresponding Federal regulatory definitions of those terms. In line with this position, the commenter stated that Utah's proposed amendment must be changed because the proposed definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area'' use terms, such as ``coal mining and reclamation operations,'' that are not contained in the corresponding Federal regulatory definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area.'' Alternatively, the commenter stated that OSM may approve Utah's proposed amendment, but only after OSM formally changes its own regulatory definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area'' to use such terms as ``coal mining and reclamation operations.'' Also, the facilitate this position, the commenter stated that OSM's and Utah's regulations must be modified to include the specific terms of the September 4, 1992, agreement. Two additional commenters stated that, in accordance with the September 4, 1992, agreement, all Utah mine roads existing as of that date were ``grandfathered,'' i.e., exempted from regulation. The commenters further said that under that agreement, if a road had not been included within a permitted surface coal mining operation prior to September 4, 1992, it will not be incorporated into a permit. The commenters then requested that the Utah program be amended to specifically incorporate this grandfather provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM agrees with the comment that the Federal regulatory definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area,'' and Utah's proposed amendment to its regulatory definitions of those terms, do not, respectively, clearly define OSM's and Utah's jurisdiction over public roads. Those definitions, however, do not purport, in and of themselves, to define jurisdiction over public roads. In the preamble to the final roads rule, OSM said that it currently relies on the applicable language of the Federal definitions of ``surface coal mining operations'' at section 710(28) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 700.5, and that Utah must, among other things, also rely on its statutory definition of that term at U.C.A. 40&hyph;10&hyph;3(18) in determining jurisdiction over public roads (56 FR 58846, 58848&hyph;49, November 22, 1991). Also, in the final roads rule, as discussed under part III.A. of this notice, OSM found that, when determining whether a public road is subject to regulation under SMCRA and the Utah program, the regulatory authority must consider the extent and effect of the mining-related use of the road (56 FR 58846, 58847&hyph;49, 58851&hyph;52, 58854&hyph;55, November 22, 1991). Thus, OSM's and Utah's jurisdiction over public roads is determined, respectively, under the Federal and Utah definitions of ``surface coal mining operations'' and other guidance such as the preamble to the final roads rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with the comment that the Federal and Utah regulatory definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area'' must literally ``read the same.'' Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(a), OSM may approve a proposed amendment to a State program if, among other things, the proposed amendment is in accordance with SMCRA and consistent with the Federal regulations implementing SMCRA. OSM interprets paragraphs I.2.b., c., and d. of the September 4, 1992, agreement to only require Utah to submit to OSM a proposed amendment meeting those requirements. For the reasons discussed above under part III of this notice, OSM finds that Utah's proposed amendment meets, upon the stated conditions, the requirements of 30 CFR 732.15(a) and provisions I.2.b., c., and d. of the September 4, 1992, agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with the comment that the Federal and Utah regulations must be modified to include the specific terms of the September 4, 1992, agreement. Nothing in SMCRA, the Federal regulations, the Utah program, or the September 4, 1992, agreement requires Utah or OSM to modify their respective regulations to include specific terms of that agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: A safety net for the cautious investor - Guaranteed equity bonds seem to offer growth - or your money back. But, it is not that simple . . . SAFETY IS very important to most investors, and the word 'guarantee' usually provokes a positive reaction. That might explain the proliferation of guaranteed equity bonds which offer a simple slogan: 'Stock market growth without risk.' Most people know they 'ought' to invest in equities because of the long-term gains which can be made. But they are all too aware of how volatile stock markets can be. They fear that investing at the wrong time, such as just before the crash of 1987, could result in losing capital. And with the FT-SE 100 index setting a record high this week, they could have extra reason to be cautious. Guaranteed products provide the reassurance some people need. In most cases, the worst that can happen is that they get back their original sum invested. The product can take the form of a building society account, in which the 'interest' is stock market growth, or it can be an insurance bond such as the one launched recently by National Westminster. This offers investors the rise in the FT-SE 100 index over five years, or the return of their original investment, whichever is the greater. As an additional attraction, it offers a 'lock-in facility.' If the Footsie rises by 25 per cent from its original level at any point over the five years, that gain will be 'locked in.' Even if the market falls, the investor will receive a minimum return of 25 per cent. (The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000). Then, too, a basic rate-payer will face no extra tax when the bond matures. Add these factors together and it sounds like a flawless product. But guaranteed equity bonds have a number of disadvantages which are not always immediately apparent. Inflation. A guarantee that returns your original capital in five years is not necessarily a good deal, since your capital will buy less. At 5 per cent inflation, Pounds 1 is worth 78p after five years. Loss of interest. Instead of putting your money in the bond, you could have put the same sum in the building society and enjoyed the benefits of compound interest. If you had earned 5 per cent interest net, Pounds 1,000 would have grown to Pounds 1,276 after five years. Lack of income. Most guaranteed equity bonds pay all their return on maturity; thus, they are of little use to income-seeking investors. Some do pay 'income,' but there is a risk that this might represent merely the return of the original capital (see below) . Loss of dividend yield. The Footsie reflects only the capital growth of share prices, not the dividend yield - for which most guaranteed bonds do not give credit. With shares yielding 3.7 per cent now, losing the dividend yield over five years makes a significant difference. An investment in an indexed unit trust would give the holder credit for both the capital growth and the dividend yield on the index (although this would be somewhat diluted by the manager's charges). Misleading percentages. Some products, particularly those sold by building societies, may offer to return more than the rise in the Footsie. But this 'extra' percentage is available only to non-taxpayers. A bond which offers a 133 per cent rise in the index to gross investors will pay only 100 per cent to basic rate-payers. Higher-rate taxpayers. Although basic rate-payers face no additional charge on most guaranteed equity bonds, higher rate-payers could pay the difference between basic and top-rate tax on encashment. In the above example, a bond that offered 133 per cent of the rise in the index to non-taxpayers would pay only 80 per cent to higher rate-payers. Furthermore, proceeds from the bonds are taxed as income. For those top rate-payers who do not use up their annual Pounds 5,800 capital gains tax allowance, this makes them less attractive than an indexed unit trust. Fixed holding periods. In most cases, the bonds last for five years and investors may well not get the full value of their investment if they withdraw their money before the period is up. Given these factors, sophisticated investors will probably reason along the following lines. The stock market probably will rise over a five-year period. If it does, an indexed unit trust (or an actively-managed fund with a proven record) could well outperform a guaranteed equity bond, because of the dividend yield and, in some cases, the tax position. If the stock market falls, it would be better to invest in the building society (or gilts) and earn an income than to rely on the money-back guarantee. There are, however, a lot more people who would regard themselves as 'amateur' rather than sophisticated investors and, for them, guaranteed bonds will continue to appeal. The financial sector has been alert to many of the problems, and a number of the bonds on the market are designed to overcome some of the perceived disadvantages. Scottish Amicable has produced the third issue of its Capital Guarantee bond which allows for the growth in the FT-SE 100, including the re-investment of dividends. This addition comes at a cost; there is an initial charge of 5 per cent as well as a 5 per cent bid-offer spread. Allowing for a bonus allocation of units for those who invest before September 10, this means that, of an initial investment of Pounds 10,000, only about Pounds 9,160 will rise in line with the index. Further, there is an annual charge of 1.5 per cent which is deducted from the dividend income. So it is quite a complex calculation as to whether this structure will be more profitable than a more straightforward bond which lacks the dividend facility. If you assume that the market yields 4 per cent and that dividends and share prices grow by a steady 5 per cent per year, I calculate that the Scottish Amicable bond would be ahead of the NatWest product. But different assumptions would produce a different result. Lock-in facilities appear particularly popular: more than 70 per cent of the investors in Save &amp; Prosper's first guaranteed bond, launched last November, opted for this benefit. Indeed, the first lock-in took effect after the FT-SE rose 10 per cent to reach its recent record high. Save &amp; Prosper plans to launch a new bond on September 1. This will offer the choice of 98 per cent of your capital rising in line with the Footsie, or 90 per cent rising in line with lock-ins at 20, 30 and 40 per cent growth. The lock-in facilities on Scottish Mutual's Guaranteed Investment plan differ from those on the S &amp; P bond; Scottish Mutual offers to lock in gains once the index has risen by 50, 75 and 100 per cent. This might sound better than the S &amp; P deal but much depends on how optimistic you are about the market; if it rises 49 per cent but then falls back, S &amp; P investors will get a lock-in but Scottish Mutual investors will not. The more cautious you are about equities, the better it is to have a low lock-in level. Scottish Mutual's bond uses the average level of the Footsie over the last year of the product's life as the measure of the investor's gain: S &amp; P uses the average over the last six months. This technique protects against a sudden fall in the index just before maturity; on the other hand, since equities tend to rise over time, the averaging could well reduce the overall return. There is a 5 per cent initial charge, which means only 95 per cent of your money benefits from the rise in the index. But those who invest before September 3 will qualify for a 'bonus' of 2 per cent which will reduce the impact of the initial charge. Minimum investment is Pounds 7,500. One twist on the guaranteed product which is proving popular is the income facility. Rather than guarantee to pay back the original capital, some companies offer to pay a fixed income over the five years. The 'guarantee' that then applies is that the company will pay a residual lump sum which, together with the income payments, returns the original investment. Say a person invests Pounds 10,000 to earn an income of 8 per cent a year. The bond would pay Pounds 800 for five years (total Pounds 4,000) and then guarantee that the minimum repayment value after five years would be Pounds 6,000. The stock market normally would have to grow at a set percentage for the investor to get back his original capital as well as the income. Save &amp; Prosper offers another bond which pays 8.5 per cent income (paid quarterly or annually) over five years. The bond-holder gets a minimum of 57.5 per cent of the original investment on maturity. To get back Pounds 10,000, the Footsie would have to rise 30 per cent over the five years. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,500 (Pounds 5,000 for those who want quarterly income). The nature of these products has attracted criticism, mainly on the ground that investors could be misled by the high 'income' on offer and fail to understand that this might simply represent the return of their capital. But Save &amp; Prosper says it surveyed investors who bought an earlier income bond and found that 91 per cent felt the literature made the risks to capital clear. Business expansion schemes also are offering returns based on the Footsie's growth (for details, see the article on Page IV). It seems clear that guaranteed equity products are here to stay, and that there will be more variations as the 1990s progress.</p>

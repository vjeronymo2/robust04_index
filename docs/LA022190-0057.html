			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANK'S INROAD INTO SECURITIES SALES IS UPHELD;  </P> <P> BANKING: THE SUPREME COURT REFUSED TO STOP SECURITY PACIFIC FROM PACKAGING ITS  MORTGAGES FOR SALE TO INVESTORS.  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to bar Security Pacific National Bank  from pooling its mortgages and selling them as securities to investors, a move  that further chips away at the nation's 57-year-old law separating banks from  the securities business.  </P> <P> As expected, however, securities industry representatives and bankers disagreed  sharply over how much the court's action erodes the Depression-era  Glass-Steagall Act separating the businesses.  </P> <P> Securities industry officials called the Supreme Court move a major blow to the  act, and some other observers predicted that it will provide bankers further  inroads into the securities business. But banking executives said such  assessments exaggerate the effect and that the court simply upheld the right of  banks to sell loans as they choose.  </P> <P> "It is a step in the right direction, but by no means did the wall tumble,"  said Richard M. Gerwitz, a managing director of Security Pacific 's merchant  banking unit.  </P> <P> The case stemmed from Security Pacific's move in 1987 to bundle home loans and  sell them to investors as "pass-through certificates." Investors who buy  certificates, also called mortgage-backed securities, receive a stake in the  bank's pool of mortgages. Principal and interest payments made by homeowners  are then "passed through" to investors who own the certificates.  </P> <P> U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke, who regulates national banks  such as Security Pacific, gave the bank his blessing, saying laws do not  restrict the way banks can sell their mortgages. Security Pacific National Bank  is the main unit of Security Pacific Corp. in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Clarke's opinion sparked a lawsuit filed against him by the Securities Industry  Assn., the main trade group for brokerages. The suit maintains that Security  Pacific's activities amounted to the underwriting of securities, which is  forbidden by the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act. In one court paper, the association  went so far as to say that allowing Security Pacific to continue its program  would be to "write Glass-Steagall right out of the statute books."  </P> <P> Enacted during the Great Depression amid fears that securities ventures would  cause bank failures, Glass-Steagall is a legal barrier preventing banks from  entering such investment-banking activities as underwriting stocks. Bankers  have long criticized the law as outdated and have chipped away at the barrier  the past two years as regulators have allowed such expanded powers as  underwriting corporate debt .  </P> <P> A federal appeals court last September said Security Pacific could package its  own loans and underwrite them as securities, calling it "the business of  banking." That decision reversed a 1988 ruling by a federal judge. The Supreme  Court, without comment, let stand the appeals court ruling.  </P> <P> Reacting to the Supreme Court action, the securities association warned that  one result could be an increase in risks for banks and taxpayers, who insure  deposits up to $100,000. It urged Congress to take up the Glass-Steagall  controversy to "prevent the random chipping away by federal banking agencies of  the safety barriers between the two industries."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- Chu Song-il, chairman  of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade  Unions of Korea (GFTUK) in his talks on June 3 proposed  bilateral contact between the GFTUK and South Korean trade  unions for the convocation of national conference.    Pointing to the negative stand taken by the South Korean  authorities toward the North's proposal to convene a national  conference, he said:    This is a challenge to the patriotic proposal of the North  side which is bending all efforts for the convocation of a  national conference and treacherous act openly ignoring the  desire of all the fellow countrymen for an early opening of an  epochal phase for the peace and peaceful reunification of the  country.    Now the fellow countrymen of all walks of life in the North,  South and overseas hoping for national reconciliation, unity and  reunification are fully determined to bring the national  conference to a success.    The workers in the North and South must take the van in the  nationwide movement for the convocation of the national  conference.    The workers in the North and South must meet and discuss  with  each other the great work of the nation with the national  conference ahead and jointly pave the way for reunification.    Responding to this urgent demand, the GFTUK Central  Committee  proposes to the trade unions of South Korea to hold in a short  time bilateral contact for discussing the question of the  convocation of a national conference.</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Arts: Swan Lake at the Coliseum - Ballet After the disappointments of Romeo and Juliet which opened the Kirov Ballet season, it is good to report that the company is grandly itself again with its second offering, Swan Lake. This Petersburg staging is the best in the world. It is made for grown-ups by grown-ups. It plays no tricks, offers neither gratuitous psychological insights nor optimistic reassessments of score or text. It understands that the way in which, a century ago, Petipa rescued and re-ordered the original and ungainly score (three stagings in Moscow, between 1877 and 1882, did not succeed) was wise and theatrically vital. It has, across its years in Petersburg, been edited by several producers, yet each appreciated the values of Petipa's version, and incidental vagaries have been excised or muted. What we see now is Swan Lake as rite as well as national treasure. The production enshrines attitudes about classic dancing, about how a lyric tragedy may be expressed within the terms of the academic vocabulary, which are true, and unassailably right. And, unlike almost every other version, this Swan Lake is of unfailing theatrical power. Igor Ivanov's sets provide ideal - because poetic but unemphatic - locations. Galina Solovyova's costumes have been revised for this season and are handsome, opulent. (The expensive programme book, by the way, credits neither of these artists). Within this framework, the grandeur of Kirov dance style gives the choreography immense lustre. The general dances of the first and third scenes are aristocratic because the dancers' training is itself noble. The impeccable ranks of swans are a symbol of Tchaikovsky's vision of bewitched maidens, and of ballet's metaphoric transmutation of women into dance forms. And the Mariinsky Theatre orchestra - under Viktor Fedotov and Boris Gruzin in two performances as the week ended - plays with absolute commitment, absolute conviction. This is, as I have suggested, a Swan Lake for adults, for people who care about Swan Lake as a masterpiece to be honoured, and not just a catch-penny attraction, all title and no sense. It is sure in its momentum, refined in its means. (A comparison with the Royal Ballet's staging - which has a more 'authentic' text - shows how we mistrust the ballet, tricking it out with egregious incident, clouding its dance and its larger meaning). And the Kirov perform with such distinction that even mannerism and dullness, which were the respective contributions of Yulia Makhalina and Alexander Kurkov in the leading roles on Friday night, are absorbed into the general eloquence of the presentation. Makhalina, beautiful, strong and emphatic in technique, offered a reading of Odette/Odile that looked extreme in physical outline and self-absorbed. Certainly Kurkov is a paste-board Siegfried, but Makhalina's style - with over-wrought tempi, hectic accents, tragedy queen manners - brought little to the ballet. On Saturday afternoon Irma Nioradze was a tender Odette, the dance elegant, and a lustrous Odile. Her Siegfried was Alexander Gulyayev, who has a lively dramatic presence - the first act was well played in its charm and eagerness - and a neat, if not gaudy, technique for the ball-room endurance test. But I wish the Kirov would not treat the coda to the great pas de deux as if it were a pentathlon, with breaks for applause after every trick. Pierina Legnani expected such acclaim in Swan Lake in 1895 after her fouettes. We have progressed a little - if not enough - since then. A note in passing. The management owes it to the public to identify cast changes. The first act trio on Saturday afternoon was entirely different from that printed in the cast-list, and the audience was not informed. There were also changes on Friday night which went unmarked. Courtesy to dancers and public alike requires that changes be announced. The Kirov Ballet is at The Coliseum with varied programmes until July 31.</p>

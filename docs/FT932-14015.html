			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith calls for Serb ultimatum MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday increased pressure on the government for military action against the Serbs in Bosnia by urging the threat of air strikes to check further Serb advances. He called for 'a clear ultimatum' to be issued to the Serbs 'that they will not be allowed to continue with their aggression unchecked - and that if they do so their lines of supply within Bosnia will be subject to air attack'. Mr Smith's comments followed his call last week for an ultimatum threatening air attacks on Serb communication and supply lines if they did not comply with a ceasefire. Labour MPs will today debate policy on Bosnia amid evidence of growing pressure on the leadership for a still more aggressive stance on Bosnia. Some Labour MPs are demanding the sending of ground troops. Mr John Major responded to Mr Smith's call by saying moves such as air strikes were being 'seriously considered' in talks with allies. But he warned that 'the road to further action, particularly if that road leads to military action . . . is a road that is fraught with perils'. The prime minister feared British humanitarian aid efforts would have to stop if military strikes began. Mr Smith said he appreciated the risks, but they had to be set against 'the possibly greater risks' of inaction. Mr Major sought to calm Tory MPs' fears about UK troops being sucked into a prolonged conflict in Bosnia by setting firm parameters for British troops' involvement in combat. He said the 'only circumstance' in which he could foresee Britain becoming part of a military operation was if it were under Nato command, with US participation and backed by a new United Nations resolution with Russian support. An escalation of outside military involvement was not yet the policy of any leading UN government, he added. Downing Street said cabinet ministers kept policy on Bosnia under constant review, but officials rebuffed suggestions that Britain would necessarily fall into line if President Bill Clinton backed air strikes. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, urged Britain to back the UN High Commission for Refugees' proposals for 'safe havens'. Earlier, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said the government had 'extreme reservations' about the use of military force. He also said he was satisfied that the 2,300 British military contingent was the right size for the humanitarian tasks required and that he was discussing with the UN the future of the British Field Ambulance unit, deployed in Croatia since last May.</p>

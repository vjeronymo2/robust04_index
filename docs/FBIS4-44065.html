			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Andreas Papandreou, Greek Prime Minister and </F> European Council President--recorded]    [Text] History demands that the European Union [EU]  assumes its responsibilities at the level of the entire  continent. It also demands it contributes to formulating a  political and economic order in Europe based on free consent and  solidarity between the European nations with respect for their  history, civilization, and traditions. The treaty for the EU is  our answer to this challenge by history, it sets the bases and  determines a stronger international presence by a united Europe.    However, the march toward European integration is a  continuing process. We look to the future with optimism. The  intergovernmental conference in 1996 will give us the  opportunity to diagnose the possible weaknesses of the current  system and to proceed with the necessary readjustments with the  participation of our new partners. However, as a community of  democratic countries, we cannot proceed without the support of  our citizens. The positive result of the Austrian referendum,  which we welcome with particular joy, constitutes a clear  message of optimism and confidence in tomorrow's Europe.    On this occasion, I would like to again express our  appreciation to the outgoing European Parliament for the spirit  of cooperation it demonstrated and for the majority that voted  for this expansion. I am very happy because today all of us are  given the opportunity to meet here to formally seal a successful  outcome to an official negotiation that lasted for one year and  for which important efforts were made by 16 European states and  by the European Commission.    As president of the European Council, I am proud of the  successful outcome of these negotiations during the Greek  Presidency. I congratulate you and welcome you to the ranks of  the EU.</p>

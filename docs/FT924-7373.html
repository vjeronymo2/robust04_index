			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / The price of darkness The machinery of British government runs efficiently when it is working in the dark with the blinds drawn and the lights switched off. Decisions made by torchlight under the blanket are either executed in secret or, this being a democracy, put to parliament for its formal approval. This system runs smoothly when none of its parts is dented or, worse, exposed. It goes awry when the House is not properly disciplined, or when a corner of the blacked-out cave that is Whitehall is illuminated, or when the cabinet - which theoretically controls it all - is brought into disrepute. It is for these three reasons that we are enduring a period of dismayingly weak, not to say impotent, government. The House of Commons is unpredictable, a little light has found its way into some of the departments, and the prime minister and his colleagues have lost their authority. Take the Commons first. Last Thursday's statement of economic policy was well received by the Conservatives, or all but a handful of them. The irreconcilable Thatcherites were for once subdued. There seemed reason to hope that the normal course of British parliamentary business might be resumed - that from now on ministers would propose and all Tory MPs would vote in the Conservative lobby. This is still possible, but the greater likelihood is that there will be further nerve-wracking rebellions, perhaps during the prolonged passage of the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty, or possibly when the time comes to vote on the financing of the new council tax. Consider next the fresh insight we now have into the way civil servants and ministers behave. This is derived from the documents in the Matrix Churchill case. The papers are being deployed with his customary skill by Labour's Mr Robin Cook, who is 'releasing' them in batches aimed, as smart bombs are to their targets, at the TV news headlines. He let off a few more last night. This has unnerved the administration and the prime minister. It has deflected attention from the Autumn Statement, which was supposed to be the foundation of the government's recovery. Mr John Major's latest speech on the economy, delivered last night, will have to share the available headline space with Mr Cook's missives. That, however, is not the principal reason why the Matrix Churchill case is so damaging. Four ministers plus the attorney-general stand accused of trying to keep information from a court, when the probability was that the result would be the imprisonment of three innocent men. The ministers' reply is that all they were asked to do was confirm that the relevant papers fell within the categories of secrecy deemed by long-standing rules to warrant a public interest immunity from disclosure. None of them was individually aware of the full case for the prosecution or any of the case for the defence. So it was up to the judge to override their findings, which, as we know, he did. Let us assume that the official inquiry, the terms of reference of which were sensibly broadened by Mr Major yesterday, vindicates this argument. The villain is then seen to be the system of secrecy. Public interest immunity is not essentially a matter of law. It is an administrative convenience. Ministers and officials determine what is and is not a secret. We can easily imagine the detachment, the objectivity, the balanced judgment with which they exercise their prerogative of 'sticking to the rules'. There is therefore no need to impart malign motives to the ministers concerned. The apparatus is itself malign. This is of greater significance than the matter of whether or not it was right to arm Iraq when the government was saying that its policy was not to send lethal weaponry to either Iraq or Iran. I suspect that the average voter (although strangely not the House of Commons) is fairly cynical about political lies. Taking a risk that innocent parties might be jailed is more directly offensive to public sensibilities. That risk is inherent in the secretive method of government. We are left with the question of Mr Major's authority, which he began to lose on September 16 when Britain left the exchange rate mechanism and the magic attached to his name vanished. A prime minister who had enjoyed unprecedented popularity for nearly two years suddenly became the butt of the nation's jokes. The pent-up frustration over the recession came to a head. The weakness inherent in an overall majority of 21 was revealed, the more cruelly so since the disaffected Tory faction is large enough to topple the government by voting with the opposition. No one expects a quick end to this long-running farce. To say that 'it all depends on the economy' is a convenient cover for the more desperate phrase, 'it is going to take a helluva long time'. There lies the nub. The turnround will come in the end. It always does. But it would be imprudent to expect it before the government's reputation is irretrievably damaged.</p>

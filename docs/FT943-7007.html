			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Novell held back by purchases Novell, the leading computer networking software company, reported a loss for its third fiscal quarter after charges stemming from the June acquisition of WordPerfect and Borland International's spreadsheet product line, Quattro Pro. The company announced plans to reduce its workforce by 1,750 through attrition and redundancies over the next six months, bringing total employment down to about 8,250. Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 489m, up 13 per cent from Dollars 434m in the same period last year. The results for both this year and last include those of WordPerfect, a software company bought by Novell in June. The company reported a third-quarter net loss after charges of Dollars 4m, or 1 cent a share, compared with a net loss after charges for an earlier acquisition of Dollars 257m, or 69 cents, in the same period last year. Third-quarter costs from the WordPerfect merger and the purchase of the Quattro Pro business resulted in charges against earnings of Dollars 120m, of which Dollars 114m related to the write-off of purchased research and development associated with Quattro Pro. These costs, net of tax, reduced earnings a share by 22 cents. Excluding acquisition-related charges, earnings increased 35 per cent to Dollars 77m, or 21 cents, in 1994, over a comparable figure of Dollars 57m, or 15 cents, in 1993. Wall Street analysts had been projecting earnings of about 25 cents a share. Earlier this week the company warned earnings would be down because revenue from its two June acquisitions was lower than expected, while operating expenses were higher. Novell said it would complete the process of consolidating its operations and those of WordPerfect over the next six months and take a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. Combined net revenue for the nine-month period was Dollars 1.5bn, up 14 per cent from Dollars 1.3bn for the same period in 1993. Net income, including acquisition-related items in both years, was Dollars 186m, or 51 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 62m, or 17 cents.</p>

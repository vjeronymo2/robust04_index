The national government is apparently drafting a document in  which President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's administration will state  its viewpoint and refute information it deems incorrect. The  government thus inaugurates a new stage in Paraguayan foreign  relations, abandoning its passive posture and acting more  independently before other countries. Proof of this is the  stance regarding the U.S. Government's request to send troops to  our country to build six schools and eight water wells in San  Pedro Department without the participation of the Paraguayan  Army.    Before accepting this "social aid", the government sent the  U.S. Embassy a lengthy note requesting more details about the  mission and the funds that each party will have to invest in the  joint exercise, and proposing the participation of the  Paraguayan Armed Forces.    The Paraguayan Foreign Ministry note to the U.S. Government  conditions the development of the operation to the participation  of Paraguayan sappers, a detailed list of the tasks the U.S.  troops will carry out, and an account of what the operation will  cost each country, among other requirements.    The U.S. State Department has issued a report on the  situation of human rights in Paraguay that was released by the  U.S. Embassy in Asuncion.    Contradictory reactions -- for and against -- to the  negative  aspects of the report flew as soon as it was disclosed.    U.S. Ambassador Jon Glassman was summoned by Paraguayan  Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner, who informed the  ambassador of the government's unrest over the U.S. State  Department report. He was told that the Paraguayan Government  would rectify and clarify some points of the report.    That same day German Ambassador Joachin Kausch was also  summoned by Foreign Minister Ramirez Boettner to explain his  statement to the media regarding the absence of Paraguayan  guarantees for foreign investors.    After a long interview, the German ambassador said the media  had misinterpreted what he had said, that he never described  Paraguay as an unsafe country for foreign investments.    Asked about a lack of guarantees for investors, President  Wasmosy said that there seems to be an orchestrated campaign to  distort the country's image abroad, although he did not say who  is responsible.</p>

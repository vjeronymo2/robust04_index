DRP&hyph;64 and DPR&hyph;59, issued to the Power Authority of the State of New York (the licensee), for operation of the Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3 (Indian Point 3) located in Westchester County, New York, and the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (FitzPatrick) located in Oswego County, New York, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendments would revise Section 6.0 (Administrative Controls) of the Technical Specifications of both facilities to reflect, in part, licensee management changes. Specifically, the title of Executive Vice President_Nuclear Generation is being changed to Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer and a new position, Vice President Regulatory Affairs and Special Projects, which will report to the Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer, is being established. In addition, the list of Safety Review Committee (SRC) members is being deleted and replaced with a description of SRC membership requirements, including individual qualifications. Each SRC member, including the alternates, will have to be approved by the Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before issuance of the proposed license amendments, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilities in accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Operation of the FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 nuclear power plants in accordance with the proposed amendment[s] would not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change is purely administrative and does not involve plant equipment or operating parameters. There is no change to any accident analysis assumptions or other conditions which could effect previously evaluated accidents. The proposed change will not decrease the effectiveness of the organization's ability to respond to a design basis accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. Since the proposed change is administrative in nature and does not involve hardware design or operation, it cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The authority and responsibilities of the Resident Managers and the Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer with respect to the safe operation and maintenance of the FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 nuclear plant are not being reduced or otherwise changed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

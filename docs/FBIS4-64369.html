			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["tl"-signed report: "Government Coalition Wants To `Faith </F> Heal' Economy"]    [Text] Bonn -- The Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] chairman and candidate for chancellor, Rudolf Scharping,  has warned against "setting economic figures too high for purely  tactical reasons in the run-up to the elections." Economic  development in Germany is still stagnating, Scharping said in an  interview with HANDELSBLATT.    Scharping accused ministers Waigel and Rexrodt of "faith  healing." The chancellor goes on about "flowering landscapes of  the economic upswing," but the government coalition has not done  its homework to achieve this, the SPD chairman said. That is  why the six leading economic research institutes have quite  rightly criticized the fact that the course has not yet been set  by the government for a vigorous economic growth and a high  level of employment.    Scharping pointed out that domestic demand -- especially  private consumption, but also production investment -- will  continue to drop, or increase to the most insufficient degree.  The incomes of the masses have also declined significantly in  1994. Capacities are far from being fully utilized,  unemployment continues to increase, and a considerable number of  jobs are still being cut.    The SPD chairman also quotes the president of the Federal  Association of German Industry [BDI], Tyll Necker, who,  together, with other industrial leaders, doubts -- quite rightly  -- whether the mass unemployment can be expected to drop in  1995, if the policies remain unchanged. Anyone conveying the  impression that the problems have already been solved is  creating false hopes, said Scharping. They are disguising the  fact that outdated structures in the state and the economy have  to be modernized, if the slight recovery is to become stable  growth for all.    Scharping said it is crucial that ecological changes of the  industrial society are promoted and the modernization of the  state's activities is accelerated. This is the only way to meet  the challenges of the labor market and to restore "social  justice in Germany, which has been damaged" by the Kohl  government. Scharping: "Unless we do that, we will lose a great  opportunity arising for our country during the next economic  cycle."    For this reason, the SPD suggests a solidarity pact, in  which  it wants to include the trade unions, industrialist  associations, and the Bundesbank. This specific action by the  state should continue a job-oriented wage policy in a climate of  expansion that is free of inflation, said Scharping. Scharping  said that the preconditions for such a solidarity pact coming  into being are "the cornerstones of a future Social Democratic  government policy": The 1995 tax rate must not be increased any  further, net debt will have to be decreased, and -- as soon as  the economic development allows -- the proportion of the GNP  allocated to state spending must grow at a slower rate than the  GNP itself.    The SPD wants to "promote" investment in industry "by tax  reliefs." That is why investment allowances and exceptional  write-offs are being planned. Scharping wants to cut ancillary  wages as "early as possible," in order to decrease the burden on  industry and to increase the income available to those in  gainful employment.    The SPD chairman once again mentioned the surcharge planned  by the SPD, which would affect fewer than 20 percent of all  taxpayers. Scharping: "With this package of cost cuts for  employers and companies, tax cuts for the incomes of the masses,  and with tax relief for industrial investment, we will manage to  achieve an economic upswing for everybody -- and not just a  Kohl-made upswing for millionaires."</p>

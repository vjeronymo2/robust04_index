			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Permanent interest-bearing shares Pibs are the closest you can get to holding ordinary shares in a building society. They are fixed interest securities with no redemption date - so your capital cannot be guaranteed. You can realise your investment only by selling them on the open market - with the chance of capital gain or loss. They provide a relatively high yield, as the table shows. This is partly because a building society is theoretically not obliged to pay out if doing so would drive it into loss. Also, the market is relatively small and the shares are not always easy to buy and sell.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                        Coupon   Issue price  Minimum  Price*    Yield* Stock                (gross %)      (p)      (Pounds)   (p)  (gross %)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires    9.375     100.165     1,000    90.50    10.354 Bradford &amp; Bingley     11.625     100.129    10,000   114.25    10.175 Bradford &amp; Bingley         13       100.2    10,000   126.75    10.256 Bristol &amp; West         13.375     100.338     1,000   128.25    10.429 Britannia                  13     100.423     1,000   124.50    10.442 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs     11.75     100.962    50,000   117.25    10.021 Coventry               12.125     100.749     1,000   115.75    10.460 First National          11.75     100.247    10,000   103.50    11.353 Halifax                  8.75     100.615    50,000    90.25     9.695 Halifax                    12      100.28    50,000   120.50     9.959 Leeds &amp; Holbeck        13.375     100.227     1,000      128    10.449 Leeds Permanent        13.625         100    50,000   136.25        10 Newcastle               10.75     100.317     1,000  102.875    10.450 Newcastle              12.625     100.446     1,000   118.25    10.677 Northern Rock          12.625     100.135     1,000   121.75    10.434 Skipton                12.875     100.476     1,000      122    10.553  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase price as at noon 21/12/94 excluding accrued interest.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hoare Govett  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

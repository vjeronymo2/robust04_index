			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producer resistance blamed for lack of progress at coffee pact talks COFFEE PRODUCING countries have come under fire from consumers for being unprepared for the 10 days of talks on a new international agreement that ended in London on Tuesday with little progress. 'I am very disappointed,' said Mr Myles Frechette, head of the US delegation, who was annoyed to have missed the Thanksgiving holiday only to find that 'producers resisted talking about the issues'. 'The whole process could be speeded up if we had constructive proposals from the producers,' said Mr Robert van Schaagen of the Netherlands, chairman of the International Coffee Council. The producers appear not to have taken on board the advice given by Mr Alexandre Beltrao, the International Coffee Organisation's chief executive, in the run-up to the latest talks. Coffee exporters would have to co-operate much more than in the past if a future international coffee agreement was to be successful, he said. Delegates have given themselves more time by extending the deadline for negotiations for three months from December 31. The pact expires in September next year and at least six months will be needed for member countries to ratify any new agreement. The ICO will meet again on January 25 when discussions will continue over so-called 'selectivity', under which consumers will be able to choose the type of coffee that comes into the market. This is an important issue. One of the main reasons for the collapse of the ICO export quota system and consequent halving of world prices was the fact that consumers were unable to exercise their increasing preference for mild and arabica coffees over robustas because of the system's rigidity. Producers as ever put a cheerful face on the little progress made. Mr Valdemar Carneiro Leao, Brazilian delegate and producer spokesman, told the Reuter news agency there was a wide recognition that members were dealing with something different from the past. 'But the whole mechanism of selectivity is becoming clearer and clearer,' he said, adding that the meeting had 'almost been in an exploratory mood'. Nevertheless, prolonged talks on selectivity have prevented any bilateral discussions of quota shares and price range targets. One major hurdle was overcome in September with agreement on the principle of a universal quota system - under which exporting countries would send coffee to all destinations 'without distinction between importing member and non-member countries'. Now the momentum appears to have been lost. There have been suggestions that one reason for the slowdown has been the change of administration in the US. But throughout the talks Mr Frechette has insisted there has been no change in the US position. 'The US remains committed to finding an agreement that addresses the issues of the past,' he said on Tuesday. The coffee agreement was likely to be low on President Clinton's list of priorities, and was unlikely to be looked at until 'late summer or early fall,' said Mr Frechette. Ms Judy Ganes, analyst with Merrill Lynch, said observers should forget about differences between producers and consumers and look at the potential areas of disagreement among the producers. 'Think about what has really happened at these talks,' she said. 'They did not even get on to quota shares and price targets'. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London brokers, pointed out that the biggest stumbling block at the latest talks had been the world's biggest producer. There was no doubt that the lack of progress was caused by intransigence, lack of preparation and a downgrading of the delegation by Brazil, he said yesterday. 'This was seen as a clear sign that Brazil still does not know where it stands on coffee policy, and there is a general feeling that it will continue to block until it has a domestic structure in its industry.'</p>

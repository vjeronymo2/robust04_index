			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Party may get new name Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the Italian Christian Democrat (DC) leader, is expected today to announce plans to rename the party, writes Robert Graham. He has apparently decided that this is the best way of signalling its desire to change. So far, his efforts to revamp the party since taking over from Mr Arnaldo Forlani last autumn have met strong resistance. The DC's poor showing in recent municipal elections has been attributed to its identification with the worst excesses of the coruption scandals.</p>

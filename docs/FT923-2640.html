			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Strength in the US dollar and thus in the Australian dollar has meant that buyers in other currencies effectively pay more for wool auctioned in Australia. The market there held firm at first but yesterday eased a little. The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator which closed at 548 cents a kilogram last week, rose to 550 on September 15 and fell back to 542 cents on September 16.

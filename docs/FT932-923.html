			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreign ownership talk brings Jakarta to life - This year's surge in Indonesia The Indonesian stock market tends to catch pundits unawares. After an almighty crash in 1991, the market was all but written off as a backwater of poor earnings growth, low turnover and ceaseless scandal. But like one of the archipelago's many volcanoes, equities have bubbled back into life. Since the new year the Jakarta composite index has risen by 31 per cent to yesterday's 1993 high of 358.39. While this is still far below its 1990 peak of 682, local and foreign investors alike are rediscovering their appetite for stocks. Much of the recent gain has been prompted by government officials suggesting that the limit on foreign ownership - currently set at 49 per cent of companies' listed shares - will be raised, probably to 60 to 80 per cent. In the belief that foreign fund managers will grab at the opportunity to increase their Indonesian exposure, local investors have been buying stock. In the last month, daily turnover has consistently exceeded Rp50bn, considerably better than the Rp20bn (Dollars 9.6m) or less averaged in quieter periods. The top dealing houses may now be turning a profit for the first time in a year, allowing formerly disgruntled brokers to wear their Mont Blanc pens with pride. How long the bullish smiles will remain is an open question. Many brokers fear that local interest will wane once the foreign ownership limit is raised, only returning on the back of a fresh and spicy rumour. Others argue that the arrival of new foreign money will push the index up, attracting more locals into the game. Mr Peter Arkell, Indonesia specialist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, says the point is close where the internal dynamics of the market will tie investors in place. Indonesian investors will 'start watching the market and spreading rumours like Malaysia and Hong Kong', he adds. A bullish outlook is also supported by evidence that the fundamentals of the Indonesian economy are improving. Whilst the bad debts of the banking system are disturbingly high, interest rates are coming down, and inflation, after an initial spurt at the start of the year, appears to be under control. Foreign donors are expected to pledge about Dollars 5bn to Indonesia for the next year when they meet in Paris on Monday. There is a danger, however, that bad news is being glossed over, a concern heightened by the lack of bearish brokers in town. Economists warn of a falling off of private direct investment and call into question the government's policy of subsidising state-owned high-technology industries. On the corporate scene, many companies remain highly geared and 1992 results were generally poor, with Astra International, the automotive conglomerate and the market's second largest company, a typical example. While the purchase of a stake this week by Toyota, of Japan, has lifted its ownership crisis, Astra remains burdened by poor sales and more than Dollars 800m in foreign debt. Yet its share price has appreciated by 55 per cent in the last six months. An indication of the strength of investor sentiment will be the response to a forthcoming tranche of new issues, including Barito Pacific, a leading timber company headed by the politically well connected Mr Prajogo Pangestu. Barito Pacific is expected to raise Dollars 300m, equal to the total that was raised by all 16 new issues last year, and valuing the business at Dollars 3bn. It may be that Indonesia is coming into form at the right time, given the stagnant performance of the scandal-ridden Thai market and the political turmoil in Japan. As Mr Anthony Davies, managing director of Baring Securities Indonesia, explains, American unit trusts are currently awash with cash and looking to invest. 'Unit trust subscriptions are at record levels, and if their managers put just a tiny bit into Indonesia the market will go up,' he says.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Venables fights back over Spurs MR TERRY Venables has counter-attacked against the attempt to oust him from Tottenham Hotspur football club by seeking to force Mr Alan Sugar, the chairman, to sell his 48 per cent stake in the company to Mr Venables or his backers. Mr Venables, who borrowed most of the Pounds 3m he has invested in Tottenham, would have to put together a consortium of backers to buy out Mr Sugar, whose stake was valued at Pounds 7.73m at yesterday's closing price of 101p. Mr Sugar, the electronics millionaire, last week tried to sack Mr Venables as chief executive. It emerged that Mr Sugar had offered to buy Mr Venables' 22 per cent stake at the price he paid for it - an average of about 85p a share. Mr Venables' counter-attack forms part of a petition to be presented to the High Court. On Friday he obtained a court order reinstating him until a hearing next Tuesday. A transcript of Friday's judgment by Mrs Justice Arden refers to the two main points of Mr Venables' petition: 'that Amshold (Mr Sugar's vehicle) may be ordered to sell its shares in the company to the petitioner, or as the petitioner may direct, at such price as the court may determine' and that the company should be prevented from terminating Mr Venables' contract. The judge heard that Mr Venables ran the football-related activities of the company, that his appointment as chief executive - he was previously manager of the football team - was agreed with Mr Sugar, and that Mr Venables' removal would damage the company, which had 'made a major financial recovery while Mr Venables has been chief executive'. Mr Venables had expressed concern about control of the company in December 1991, before a Pounds 7m rights issue underwritten by Mr Sugar which gave Mr Sugar, as chairman, a much larger stake. It was alleged that Mr Sugar said: 'Trust me - even if I pick up all the shares, we have a shareholders' agreement.' Mr Nick Hewer, Mr Sugar's public relations representative, said last night there was no comment on the transcript. It had been impossible to present any evidence at Friday's hearing, which was held at very short notice, he said.</p>

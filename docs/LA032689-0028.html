			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TV-ERA MONSTER  </P> <P> I feel compelled to write after viewing only a few minutes of probably the most  demented show on television, "Freddy's Nightmares." I am horrified our society  has allowed TV to sensationalize and glorify suffering, perversion and  mutilation.  </P> <P> I truly enjoy the horror classics -- Frankenstein, the Wolfman, the Mummy.  These movies left much to the imagination, yet still thrilled and chilled.  </P> <P> Freddy is a psychotic mutilator who only fuels sick and misguided minds. It's  time to draw the line. Today's children mustn't grow up thinking this is  "normal."  </P> <P> I hope that more people speak out against the programming on today's  television. If the quality of programming doesn't improve soon, my children may  end up the better for it because my television will be put out on the curb, in  the trash, where it belongs.  </P> <P> DEBORAH L. GEROME  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

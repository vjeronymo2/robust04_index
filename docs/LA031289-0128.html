			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: WHAT THE NOMINATED DOCUMENTARIES HAVE TO OFFER  </P> <P> While the furor continues over "The Thin Blue Line's" lack of an Oscar  nomination for best documentary film, what about the documentaries that were  nominated?  </P> <P> Unsurprisingly, all but one of them are political. ("Let's Get Lost," a  portrait of musician Chet Baker, is the exception.) Perhaps political is too  limited a word: They are films about justice and the unfaltering work of some  very different men and women to see that it prevails.  </P> <P> The nominees are:  </P> <P> "The Cry of Reason -- Beyers Naude: An Afrikaner Speaks Out," produced by  Robert Bilheimer and Ronald Mix. Classic in its form and formidable in its  angry intelligence, this is a stirring portrait of ex-Dutch Reform churchman  Naude, once looked on as a leading contender to be prime minister of South  Africa, now a man some consider the logical successor to Anglican Bishop  Desmond Tutu.  </P> <P> Naude's doubts about the compatibility of apartheid and Christian principles  began well before Sharpeville, but that massacre in 1960 crystallized his  thinking and shifted his orderly, white Afrikaner's life 180 degrees. Modest,  articulate and passionate in his zeal about the obscenity of apartheid,  churchman Naude stands shoulder to shoulder with South Africa's people of  color, one of their most vigorous spokesmen.  </P> <P> As the film makes clear, Naude has endured government banning to emerge more  thoughtful, more focused and more powerful than before. (Non-Academy members  may be interested in knowing that this film, as well as "Promises to Keep,"  will show Saturday and Sunday mornings through March at the Monicas in Santa  Monica.)  </P> <P> "Hotel Terminus -- The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie" by Marcel Ophuls, plays  like a gigantic mystery story, as the dogged film maker follows the trail of  the Gestapo chief whose penchant for sadism won him the nickname "Butcher of  Lyon." With meticulously detailed interviews of Barbie's few surviving victims,  with resistance heroes and/or saints and civilian sinners, Ophuls creates a  schizophrenic picture of France during the Occupation, as its deeply ingrained  anti-Semitism clashed with individual acts of heroism. The wonder is that --  with one notable exception -- Ophuls is able to keep the pressure on but the  touch ironic, not thundering. This is Mozart, not Wagner.  </P> <P> Chilling for Americans are the interviews with ex-CIA or Army Intelligence  cowboys, as it becomes clear that their anti-Communist zeal helped to keep  Barbie a free man an unconscionable length of time. With a 4 1/2-hour running  time, Ophuls has ample time for a multilayered portrait in this infinitely  civilized and sophisticated work. The wonder is that so few untainted souls  emerge by the time he is through. He has dedicated the film to one of them, a  Frenchwoman who risked her life to try to save one of Barbie's child-victims.  </P> <P> "Let's Get Lost," produced by Bruce Weber and Nan Bush, is as gorgeous-looking  as Weber's camera work can make it, which is pretty gorgeous since Weber is the  photographer behind the Calvin Klein ads, but it's vapid in the upper story.  With the fullest cooperation of trumpeter/singer Chet Baker himself, Weber  squints at the tragic arc of the great jazz musician's life and produces a  myopic film in the vein of purest exploitation.  </P> <P> Even Baker's music is made to suffer. More than once, during footage of an old  recording session, the film makers cut him off before the end of a phrase, to  meander off after one of his wives or ex-girl-friends, ragging on each other,  or to persuade Baker to tell another of his tall tales of his drug excesses.  </P> <P> With their constant comparisons between Baker's handsome  Jack-O'Lantern-cheekbones at 24, and the skull-like burned-out remains left now  that he's in his 50s, you feel the film makers are mourning the loss of another  pretty face far more than they are the unraveling of a singular talent. Already  stuffed with banal non-interviews, the film reaches its lowest point as Baker's  customary supply of Methadone is interrupted in Europe for more than a week. In  the face of Baker's obvious pain, a questioner asks him unctuously, "How do you  feel, Chet?" Probably no worse than a Baker lover by the end of this film.  </P> <P> "Promises to Keep" is a lively, angry film by Ginny Durrin. It centers around a  volatile activist for the homeless in Washington, D.C., the mustachioed Mitch  Snyder, whom one on-camera Washington bureaucrat tries to compare with the  infamous Jim Jones. The comparison is apt only in that many of the 600-odd  homeless in the downtown Washington shelter are black.  </P> <P> Snyder is a diplomat of the Leo Durocher school of sweet-talking; that much the  film makes clear. (He even seems to have put off Martin Sheen, who played him  in a TV miniseries, although not enough to keep Sheen from narrating this  film.) But a less abrasive man might have crumbled in the face of the federal  government's years-long opposition to the shelter that Snyder captains, right  in the shadow of the White House. Neither creative bureaucratic neglect nor  President Reagan's outright reneging on his promise to fund the pilot shelter  seems to faze Snyder, willing to risk his life in a 45-day fast for his cause.  You may still not completely understand him by the film's end, but you have  certainly watched him in every kind of physical and psychological weather.  </P> <P> "Who Killed Vincent Chin?" is a question to which film makers Renee Tajima and  Christine Choy knew the answer well before they began work. As one witness says  bluntly, "An auto worker who was out of work beat up a Chinese guy he thought  was Japanese." The fascination of the film is the skill with which every issue  behind that act is laid bare; the tensions in East Detroit that prompted a  43-year-old laid-off Chrysler foreman and his stepson to take a baseball bat to  27-year-old Chin on the night of his bachelor party.  </P> <P> No tenet, no person will emerge unscathed, certainly not the American judicial  system. Not even the Detroit-born Chin himself, who, because his lifelong buddy  was white, naively let himself believe that other fellow auto workers were  equally casual and enlightened. Part of the horror of the film is getting to  know Ron Ebens, the hefty, blond, slightly run-to-seed foreman, seeing how  easily his rage disappears behind his "regular guy" affability.  </P> <P> There are also a range of motives visible within the Chinese community,  prompted to nationwide action after Ebens' appeal of his 25-year sentence sets  him free. Finally, we may even question the film makers' use of Mrs. Chin's  tragic inconsolableness as, over a four-year period, her freshets of tears are  used again and again, at rallies and banquets, to set her community's outrage  off anew.  </P> <P> So this is the lot. And while we are brooding about omissions, let us not  forget "Vincent," a soaring biographical portrait of Van Gogh by Paul Cox,  which challenges the boundaries of the form no less than "The Thin Blue Line,"  and perhaps to greater emotional effect. And there was the coolly dispensed wit  and vitriol in Dennis O'Rourke's brilliant, hilarious "Cannibal Tours." Either  of these could make a berth on any "A" team worthy of the name.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Samir Ja'ja', commander of the </F> Lebanese Forces, by Salim Badawi in the studio on 10 January;  place not given--recorded]    [Text] [Ja'ja'] I am not going to quarrel with anyone. But  when you have a house with three doors that lead only into this  house and they deploy militarily or place barricades at these  entrances, call it what you will. However, what I wanted to say  is that by behaving like this and striking at the last string of  the credibility that it may still have, the Lebanese government  is not leading to anything. This means that it is widening the  gap between it and its people. This is not good and will not  lead to anything. The Lebanese government is destroying itself  by this behavior, when it has many greater concerns on the  national level, on security violations, current events, the  Middle East peace process, and on many other (?levels.)  Instead, the entire government is engaged in -- and I apologize  to the listeners for using this phrase -- political  inconsistencies [dhabdhabat] and practices that do not become  the state in any form.    [Badawi] In your view, what is the reason behind erecting  military barricades today, especially in front of the Lebanese  Forces positions and the Samir Ja'ja' headquarters in Ghidras?    [Ja'ja'] I have no clear answer, but such practices become  larger or smaller in accordance with the Lebanese Forces'  political stand. This is not acceptable. The government should  not have anything to do with the political stands of any  political group in the arena in any form whatsoever. Otherwise,  conditions become as you can see them and therefore, the  credibility of the government will be destroyed and ...    [Badawi, interrupting] Can we link today's operation to the  news conference you held following the massacre at the Sayyidat  al-Najat church and the stands you expressed at that time?    [Ja'ja'] Apparently, from now on the question has become  that  of analyses and inferences. Yes, it is possible. I do not have  any other explanation. This is the situation and these are the  facts. As to the reasons, I do not know. But I know these  practices harm the state in the first place.    [Badawi] Dr. Ja'ja', I would like to know your preliminary  reaction to remarks by General Michel 'Awn in the newspaper  AL-HAYAH today. 'Awn says a federation should be established in  Lebanon, or a form that is above the religious denominations,  that is, a secular regime. What do you think of this. Do you  not see in it a repetition of your previous proposal for  federation in Lebanon?    [Ja'ja'] We originally proposed the decentralization, or  federation, after a careful and deep study of the Lebanese  situation, the historical and the political situation in  general, the sociological conditions. It was not just a remark.  It was the result of a long process of fermentation in the  Lebanese political situation. I hope the rest of the political  groups -- before we again suffer through this and pass through  this experience for the second, third, fifth and tenth time --  will really study the real situation. Eventually they will  reach a clear conclusion like General 'Awn's conclusion, because  this is reality. There is nothing magic about it. One reads  the reality today, the other reads it two years from now, the  third reads it after ten years. All this will be a waste of time.    [Badawi] Thank You, Dr. Samir Ja'ja'.    [Ja'ja'] You are welcome.</p>

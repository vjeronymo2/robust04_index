			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television ITV launches a new series about gifted children, A Class Of Their Own (7.00), with a programme about Katherine Merry who ran the fastest 100 metres ever recorded by a 14 year old. Now, at 16, her ambition is to win an Olympic gold medal. World In Action shows what happened when a road sweeper's job was recently advertised in Manchester: 1,460 people applied (8.30 ITV). BBC2 screens a 1965 television version of EM Forster's A Passage To India (8.40) with a remarkable cast: Sybil Thorndike, Zia Mohyeddin, Virginia McKenna, Cyril Cusack and more. Channel 4's documentary series Secret History returns (9.00) with an account of deep sleep therapy as practised in Australia between 1963 and 1978. The billing for Panorama declares 'In the wake of the Maxwell scandal there are fears that pension funds are vulnerable to theft and sharp practice'. There's no fooling Panorama. Another questionable billing is that for C4's weird serial Northern Exposure (10.00): 'Cult American comedy drama' it says. It is now watched by less than 4 per cent of the population. Not a 'cult' in my book.</p>

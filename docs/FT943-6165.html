			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Observer: Over to Hills So has 63-year-old Roderick Hills, chairman of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission in the mid-1970s, found a resting place at last? Hills and wife Carla, President Bush's trade negotiator, have found a new stable. Both have become partners of the Washington office of Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander &amp; Ferdon, where Richard Nixon once practised. As well as being another name to add to his immense biography, it has a solidly international practice. Let's hope it works out better than his last two sojourns. In 1989, Hills had turned up at Donovan Leisure as managing partner of the DC office. 'They really did need help,' he recalls. Trouble was, Hills was also engaged in a regulatory job at Drexel Burnham Lambert, clearing up after the junk bond saga. In due course it emerged that his new legal colleagues were representing some of the Drexel employee partnerships that had invested in the junk bonds. So in 1992 Hills headed off to posh New York firm Shea &amp; Gould. Oh no] Two years later, 'they (the firm) decided to commit suicide' and he and Carla, who was also aboard by this time, were seeking fresh challenges. Shea &amp; Gould's break-up was blamed on squabbling between partners over a multitude of problems including succession. But there were whisperings anyway that the Hills' energetic expansionary efforts overseas were less than fully appreciated. If Mudge Rose is curious as to how the competition conducts, or conducted, itself, they now have a resident expert.</p>

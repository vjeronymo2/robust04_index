			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Arts: Singing in snippets - BBC 'Cardiff Singer of the World' A basic unfairness of the biennial Cardiff singing competition is something its team of judges can do nothing to rectify: that is, that the human equivalent of a cello should be required to compete against that of a piccolo, bassoon against violin, xylophone against trombone. (There is an even more basic unfairness - that singers in the business of forming themselves as artists should be pressured into seeking this artificial boost up the career-ladder at all - but as it is intrinsic to all musical competitions, even I hardly dare hold the 'Singer of the World' originators responsible.) Still, this year's event did make clear just how highly this competition now rates internationally. The seven-person panel of judges, chaired by the Welsh National's Matthew Epstein and including Joan Sutherland, Marilyn Horne and Gerard Souzay, was distinguished. Twenty-five countries had sent a singer each to Cardiff; to judge from last week's nightly television evidence of the five semi-finals (of which more later), not one fell below a certain level of professional competence, and I have a hunch several unrepresented in the St David's Hall final on Saturday will go on to have useful careers. Best of all - or worst, depending on one's view of the seemliness of first prizes in such circumstances - the five finalists were all singers of considerable merit. Different merit, that is: different artistic ambition, stage of vocal development, quality of personality. The winner was Inger Dam-Jensen (29, Denmark): this was a safe, popular and eminently arguable choice, since she has charm of person, a 'finish' to her clean, bright, agile high soprano, enviable efficiency of delivery in the spotlight. I found her range of colour and emotional expression oddly limited (in the Mozart concert aria 'Misera] dove son?' particularly). Myself, I should have lobbied hard for the other Scandinavian soprano, Nina Stemme (30, Sweden), plainly a front-rank Wagnerian and Straussian in early bloom, with soft-textured warmth in her tone, gracious, long-lined phrasing, and a top that shiningly filled the hall without forcing. Maybe her choice - Lia's air from Debussy's Enfant Prodigue, Mimi's 'D'onde lieta usci', 'Leise, leise' from Der Freischutz - was too unshowy, her whole approach too 'inward'; but then, such marks of artistic seriousness are seldom competition advantage-points. I should also have been prepared to accept the case for the Ukrainian-born, Kirov-based baritone Vassily Guerelo (30), whose out-of-form discomforts (he had a cold) could not disguise the grandeur, tonal substance and old-fashioned clout of a truly significant vocal instrument, yet another in the astonishing recent Kirov baritone line. Paul Whelan (26), a giant New Zealander, took the Lieder prize. He had offered both the most adventurous programme and the greatest versatility; at this young age his hugely promising big bass-baritone is not yet 'true' throughout its range. Tito Beltran (27, Chile) cultivated audience favour by closing with 'Nessun dorma'; he too has youthful promise (notably a clean, unforced top, as shown in Faust's cavatina), and charm of person, not enough of which seems to filter into his stock of Latin-tenor emotions and vocal postures. In the hall on Saturday evening one could at last judge each of these singers 'as is'. This was a relief after the five preceding BBC-2 programmes, not one of which I had been able to watch without mounting rage. Each was 50 minutes long yet by no means a full or even reasonable sampling of the semi-final singers. Instead, we were given programme Presentation with a capital P: much interspersed chitchat, pretty pictures of Cardiff arcades, a liberal smearing of 'feel-good' jollification. The habit of snipping of singers' items to make room for all the 'context' touched its anti-artistic nadir on Friday, when Guerelo's Macbeth excerpt was shorn of its aria proper. The expert commentators seemed to be placed on oath not to utter any word of meaningful vocal criticism (but Elaine Padmore on Tuesday and Mark Elder on Wednesday managed to sneak wise comment under the barbed wire). Television accounts of cricket, tennis or snooker competitions are not subjected to so shaming a brand of popularisation-sweetening. That it should be deemed necessary for opera says a lot about current levels of culture at the BBC. 1993 competition sponsored by BP</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Christmas too early for MPs? Sir, If the parliamentary timetable is so tight that the government is obliged to introduce guillotine motions to ensure the passage of its legislation this week and the opposition has decided to withdraw pairing co-operation ('Labour halts co-operation with Tories', December 10), why is parliament starting its Christmas recess on December 17, one week before most of the rest of the country commences its Christmas holiday? Michael Henderson-Begg, Bartholomew House, 66 Westbury Road, New Malden, Surrey KT3 5AS</p>

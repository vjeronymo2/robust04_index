In attendance were Comrade Ha Dang, member of the party  Central Committee and head of the party Central Committee's  Ideology and Culture Department; Comrade Nguyen Van An, member  of the party Central Committee and deputy head of the party  Central Committee's Organization Department; Comrade Phan Dien,  member of the party Central Committee and director of the office  of the party Central Committee; Comrade Nguyen Thi Xuan My,  member of the party Central Committee and deputy head of the  party Central Committee's Inspection Department; and 183  delegates from various party organizations in the enitre armed  forces.

After the national anthem was played, Senior General Doan  Khue, member of the Political Bureau and deputy secretary of the  party Central Committee's Military Commission, and minister of  national defense, delivered an opening speech.    [Begin Doan Khue recording] Dear the meeting presidium: In  compliance with the party statute and a party Central Committee  Secretariat directive, the all-army midterm conference of party  organizations is due to open today. The conference will be in  session for four days, from 1-4 March 1994.    Although it is not a congress, the all-army midterm  conference of party organizations is very important as it is  designed to thoroughly study the resolution of the midterm  national party congress, review efforts to provide guidance for  the implementation of the national defense tasks over the past  two and a half years, and determine the course of action, tasks,  and an action program for the next two years -- 1994 and 1995 --  to, together with the entire people, implement the party  congress resolutions successfully and move the country's  renovation process toward new, greater successes. [end recording]    Afterward, on behalf of the party Central Committee's  Military Commission, Comrade Doan Khue delivered a political  report with some suggestions. He asked the conference to  concentrate on thoroughly studying the party Central Committee's  political report at the midterm national party congress. His  report contains two parts with the first part evaluating the  implementation of the Seventh Party Congress resolution and the  second part discussing the orientations, tasks, and targets for  the remaining period of the term of office of the Seventh Party  Central Committee.    In the first part, after outlining the international and  domestic situations, Comrade Doan Khue pointed out three major  achievements that consist of:    1. Having overcome by an important step the socioeconomic  crisis.    2. Having been able to continue to maintain and  consolidate political stability.    3. Having broadened foreign relations, improved the  prestige and position of our country in the world, and created  favorable international environment for the cause of national  construction and defense. Our achievements scored in the  renovation process have further generated the people's elation  and confidence in the party leadership and created more strength  and stature for our national revolution to continue to make  headway.    As for weaknesses and resulting problems, after pointing out  the weaknesses in the economic, cultural, and social domains,  his report also mentions a number of weaknesses directly related  to national defense tasks. For instance: Although political  stability has been firmly maintained, there still exist numerous  complex factors we cannot ignore. Many party and state  organizations have failed to build themselves into clean and  steadfast organizations. Political security has not been firmly  maintained, and public order and safety have not been guaranteed.    Judging from advantages and difficulties, Comrade Doan  Khue's  political report arrives at an important conclusion that  although there still exist numerous weaknesses to be overcome,  those important achievements scored have been, and are creating  premises with which to shift the country to a new stage of  development -- the stage in which we move toward national  industrialization and modernization. These premises involve a  series of factors, both strength and stature, both material and  spiritual needs, and those economic, political, social, and  cultural factors at home and abroad. These are a particularly  important issue and also a new, striking point of the situation,  and a development of the policy set forth by the Seventh Party  Congress.    Regarding the orientations, tasks, and targets for the  remaining period of the term of office of the Seventh Party  Central Committee, after discussing great challenges and  opportunities for the entire party, people, and armed forces,  Comrade Doan Khue pointed out the overall targets that call for  motivating the entire party, people, and armed forces to be of  the same heart and mind, to exert their extraordinary effort to  uphold their sense of independence, sovereignty, and self  reliance, to broaden international cooperation, to practice the  motto of industry, thrift, integrity, righteousness, public  dedication, and detachment, to exploit advantages, dispel  dangers, overcome ordeals, successfully achieve the overall  targets already set, and accelerate the pace of achieving those  targets set forth in the strategy for economic stabilization and  development until the year 2000 in a bid to build a propserous  people and an equal and civilized society.    To achieve these targets, his politial report points out  eight essential tasks for the period ahead as follows:    -- effecting a change in the economic structure toward  industrialization and modernization.    -- consistently carrying out the policy on multisectoral  economic development.    -- uniformly building a market mechanism under the state  management along the socialist path.    -- taking good care of cultural and social issues.    -- strengthening national defense and security.    -- continuing to broaden foreign economic relations.    -- building a law-govering Vietnamese state of the people,  by the people, and for the people.    -- carrying out party renovation and rectification.    Dealing with the task of strengthening national defense and  security, Comrade Doan Khue said:    [Begin Doan Khue recording] Against a situation where the  enemy force is conspiring to intensify their sabotage activities  on a large scale, we must attach importance to national defense  and security and must satisfactorily perform our duty of  defending our fatherland and our national independence,  sovereignty, territorial integrity, and firmly maintaining  political and social stability and the course of socialist  development.    We must undertake a universal, all-out, and long-term  struggle in all fields of activity to foil the schemes and  actions of hostile forces in their peaceful evolution strategy  and their rebellious and subversive attempts. [end recording]    The all-army midterm conference of party organizations will  continue its discussions designed to thoroughly understand those  essential issues in the political report of the midterm national  party conference.    The conference will continue in session until 4 March.</p>

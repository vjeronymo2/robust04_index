			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Management: Size isn't everything - Christopher Lorenz looks at pressure to trim head offices From General Electric and Dow Chemical in the US to British Petroleum and ICI in the UK, countless large Anglo-Saxon companies have noisily reduced the size of their head offices in the last few years. But according to the authors of a comprehensive new study many corporate HQs in Britain are still bloated, bureaucratic and, above all, muddled. Too often, says the study, they confuse three separate roles: advising top management; co-ordinating and controlling the company's constituent businesses; and supplying those units with a wide range of optional advice and services - for which too few HQs charge fees. These damning findings contradict the widespread view that UK companies are graduating smoothly to a more efficient world of slimline HQs, where everything from information technology and taxation to pensions and purchasing is 'outsourced' to external suppliers. The two-volume study, which was conducted by the Ashridge Strategic Management Centre* among 107 companies with between 2,000 and 200,000 employees, suggests that some 'corporate centres' - the fashionable term for HQs - are costing more than 1 per cent of sales. That often represents more than 10 per cent of pre-tax profits. The obvious implication is that every company - not just large multinationals with HQs costing more than Pounds 300m a year - should scrutinise carefully the size, scope and operations of its head office. But HQ reviews should not just concentrate on cost-cutting, emphasise the authors of the report, David Young and Michael Goold. The aim should be much more ambitious: to increase the value which the centre adds to the company as a whole. To do this, they argue, head office activities should be tailored more effectively to the company's particular strategy, structure, business portfolio, and top management style. In most cases that will mean further cutbacks, but in some it will involve an increase. The Ashridge team's other findings include: That the head offices of financial services companies tend to be three times as large as for consumer or industrial companies. This is partly because most do not distinguish clearly between HQ functions and services to their businesses. That, even after some cutbacks, the HQs of privatised companies are, on average, six times as large as for others. Young and Goold attribute this partly to their traditionally centralised way of operating, but also say that such companies have yet to experience real external pressure. That 'outsourcing' is less widely practised than all the hype would suggest, although it is certainly increasing; nor has it necessarily led to a reduction in cost. That the shifting of corporate centre staff out into operating businesses, or to separate service units, may often be a sensible way of subjecting them to market pressures. And that companies should 'benchmark' their head offices against others, but only with care. A company with a relatively integrated - or interdependent - set of businesses, similar to Shell, should not try to model itself on one with businesses that share few linkages, such as BTR. The former may need a sizeable head office, the latter a mere skeleton. Surprisingly, only two HQ functions are common to all 107 companies surveyed: financial reporting and control; and company secretarial/legal. Only four others exist in the HQs of over 80 per cent of multi-business companies: treasury; taxation; pensions/pay administration; and 'strategic development' - a term used to cover economic analysis and forecasting, strategic planning, and mergers and acquisitions. By contrast, less than half the HQs in the survey include such functions as property services, recruitment, industrial relations, research and development, and purchasing. Some companies define such activities as lying outside HQ - a variation in definition which limits the survey's value somewhat. The idea that companies need to increase the value of their head offices, rather than simply cut costs, is shared by most which have recently slimmed them. But this does not mean that their redesigns came easily; outside pressure was often required. Nor have many reviews been adequate the first time around. For instance, ICI cut its HQ a decade ago, only for the numbers to creep up again through the rosy 1980s. The sudden threat of takeover by Hanson in 1991 then prompted the chemical company to split itself into two, and in the process take a more radical look at the role of HQs than it had done before. Trevor Harrison, who has just retired as head of planning at ICI, agrees that 'we ought to understand more about the value a head office adds - I got very interested in that when Hanson was around'. The traditional view that 'the role of any HQ is to support the board' is no longer adequate, he adds. Unilever is showing signs of a more rapid rethink. In February it unveiled a redesign and slimming of its HQ which was so limited - just 10 per cent - that it drew catcalls from investors in the City of London. 'One of the less successful aspects was our mismanagement of expectations,' admits Michael Fox, who headed the review team. 'I don't believe we've got it right,' he adds. Its HQ 'will be subject to continual review - none of the posts in it is guaranteed for over a year'. But he stresses that 'it's not a numbers game - it's a question of ensuring that the centre serves the businesses'. Another instance of a company reviewing - and cutting - its HQ several times in quick succession came to light at a conference this month organised jointly by Ashridge and the Strategic Planning Society. Humfrey Smeeton, a director of Ocean, described what he called the 'balls-aching detail' of a two-stage process by which the industrial services group has reduced its head office by more than half, to 62 people, over the past 14 months. One of the sparks for Ocean was a 'ready reckoner' which Ashridge has produced to help companies make quick comparisons between the size of their head offices. It gives different weightings by company size, sector and geographic spread. As Ocean found, it concentrates the mind wonderfully. *Effective Headquarters Staff Pounds 30.

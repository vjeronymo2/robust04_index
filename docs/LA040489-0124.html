Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> DALTON, REDGRAVE WIN LIBEL SUIT  </P> <P> James Bond star Timothy Dalton and actress Vanessa Redgrave won undisclosed  libel damages today for newspaper allegations that he was rude to his producer  and that colleagues dreaded her arrival on a movie set.  </P> <P> Their lawyer, Oscar Beuselinck, told High Court Judge Michael Davies the  settlement had been reached with Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd.  </P> <P> The Sunday Mirror alleged in October that Dalton was rude and behaved  unprofessionally toward producer Cubby Broccoli during filming of "License to  Kill." The newspaper also claimed that Redgrave "was in the habit of making  life impossible whenever she appeared on a film set." The Sunday Mirror  withdrew the allegations and apologized.  </P></p>

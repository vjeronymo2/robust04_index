The survey was carried out by  interviewing respondents on 12 and 13 March.    The poll found that the support rate for the Hosokawa  cabinet  stood at 61.5 percent, only 1.3 points lower than in the last  survey in December. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has been  often criticized for his indecisiveness -- as seen, for example,  in announcing and then scrapping a "national welfare tax" plan,  and in giving up a planned cabinet reshuffle. But, his cabinet  still maintains a support rate of around 60 percent. This is  the fifth- highest rate found for a cabinet (since the Sato  cabinet) in opinion polls which include three carried out on the  Hosokawa cabinet since last summer.    However, the proportion of respondents who did not support  the Hosokawa cabinet increased by 7.5 points to 31.9 percent,  the worst such rate for the Hosokawa cabinet. The respondents  who cited "Hosokawa's lack of leadership" as their reason for  disapproving of the cabinet almost tripled to 31 percent  compared to the last poll. The number can be a sign that the  popularity of the highly popular Hosokawa cabinet may be falling.    As for political parties, the rate of support for the  Liberal  Democratic Party dropped slightly compared to the last poll,  apparently because of the arrest of former Construction Minister  Kishiro Nakamura concerning a corruption scandal involving a  general contractor. Meanwhile, the support rate for Sakigake  [Harbinger], which fought the removal of Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura from the cabinet, rose substantially to 7.2  percent. When asked their reasons for supporting the present  cabinet, 31.9 percent (32.6 percent in the previous poll) of  those who supported the cabinet replied "there is no other  appropriate person to head the government," and 23.9 percent  (20.9 percent in the last poll) said "we trust the prime  minister."</p>

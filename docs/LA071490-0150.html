			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LILIES ADD A VARIETY OF COLORS TO THE GARDEN  </P> <P> One of the good standard lilies is "Black Dragon," which produces, from a  mature bulb, a stem six feet or so with 10 or 15 white trumpets well spaced in  a circular pattern, the outside of the flowers flushed with a more or less dark  color.  </P> <P> Sometimes the outside color is simply dirty-looking, sometimes reddish, but  variable, as these lilies are seedlings, not raised from offsets or scales. The  original plant had a decidedly dark exterior, but I noticed 25 years ago that  some of its seedlings were handsomer than the original clone.  </P> <P> A clone, by the way, is simply a group of plants identical in genetic makeup,  whereas seedlings all vary in their genes. That is because seedlings are  sexually produced (male pollen on female pistil) and result from a combination  of two sets of genes. Even if a flower is fertilized with its own pollen, the  resulting seedlings will (or may) vary widely.  </P> <P> But if the plant is propagated by cuttings, offsets from the parent plant, or  layers (part of the plant is rooted while still attached to the parent plant),  or grown from tissue of the original plant, then the resulting plants will be  identical.  </P> <P> In lilies, or indeed any other plant, only the non-sexually propagated  offspring are properly called by the original parental name, since they alone  have no new genetic material introduced into them. The sexually produced  offspring (that is, from seeds) should not really be called "Black Dragon," but  "Black Dragon" Strain, and often such seedling strains are quite uniform  provided the seedlings are culled -- the ones not resembling the original  parent closely are discarded.  </P> <P> Another common trumpet lily is a strain of beautiful canary yellow or deeper  yellow flowers lumped together as "Golden Clarion" Strain. Both strains are  excellent garden plants. The bulbs may be planted in November or April.  </P> <P> Varieties of day lilies are endless, and a beginner with them should consult a  good catalogue and choose the cheapest. The most expensive ones are all very  well for fanatical fanciers but are quite similar to cheap varieties.  Tremendous improvements were made in the decades following World War II, but  advances have been less startling in recent years.  </P> <P> The beginner will certainly want to plant a few pink and cantaloupe-colored  varieties. My own preference is for those along with light lemon-colored kinds,  but the buffs, canaries and chromes are beautiful, and so are some of the  near-whites. The purples are admired by many gardeners and are handy for  contrast, but as a group they are dull in effect. The reds, by contrast, are  striking in brilliance, especially in warm climates, but in cool foggy places  they usually are muddy-looking. They do well in the lovely warm summers of  Washington.  </P> <P> I am lost in admiration again at the pink forms of a native waterlily, Nymphaea  odorata. Of the hardy waterlilies I have tried, my favorite is one collected  (and presumably a wild plant) by a friend in the Midwest and called "Shupac  Pink." Today mine had six open flowers of rich sparkling pure pink, unclouded  and vibrant. From time to time I prod my friend to introduce this plant  commercially. There are other pink variants of the wild odorata that are almost  as beautiful.  </P> <P> For the second year an allegedly hardy palm, said to pull through winters in  Zone 6, has begun flowering with me. It is Rhapidophyllym histrix, with  fan-shaped leaves. My plant is about waist high, and I am cautious when weeding  near it, as the trunk has sharp spines. The flowers resemble a fist-size fuzzy  grayish-tan mop, starting almost at ground level. Later the pea-size seeds are  borne in a densely fuzzy cluster about a foot high. I have had no success  growing any from seed. I gave some to another palm enthusiast and hope he has  had good results.  </P> <P> For the past five or six weeks my favorite large-flowered clematis has been  blooming, "Perle d'Or." It has only four petals, or segments, and is not very  large as clematis go, just covering the palm of the hand. They are  lavender-blue, and in the garden a sheet of these flowers will give a  distinctly blue effect. I saw this clematis once in a village garden in East  Anglia, and was not surprised that one of the world's leading commercial  growers used that particular plant on the cover of his catalogue. I now know  that "Perle d'Azur" naturally makes sheets of bloom. It does not repeat in late  summer or fall. It blooms once a year and shuts up shop.  </P> <P> From the commercial grower I received a few plants of petunias called  "Primetime" and have found them exceptionally good-natured and showy. My own  favorites are the virtually wild petunias in off-white, off-pink and  off-lavender that you find growing sometimes in alleys or in cracks in a  sidewalk or curb. Those are beautifully perfumed at night.  </P> <P> But the two sorts of "Primetime" that I grow are lavender-pink with a darker,  almost red star in the center, and a solid shocking pink kind. I grow them  together and they are more free-blooming than any petunias I have seen. They do  not run about but remain clumpy and the flowers touch, concealing the leaves.  </P> <P> Through carelessness I planted them near two old day lilies, the melon-pink  "Okay" and the yellow, dark-eyed "Nashville." "Nashville" is quite a rare  color, a kind of saturated buff, so distinct that once seen it is always  recognizable. "Okay" is, I suppose, out of commerce and is a routine flower. I  always liked it because it so strongly resembled another day lily, "Frankly  Fabulous," which was popular at the same time.  </P> <P> Anyway, the strange strident pink colors of the petunias with the day lilies  and a few wild blue tradescantias are fine together. They are all beside water  troughs containing small pink and yellow waterlilies.  </P> <P> For a time I was not sure what to do with these horse troughs, as their  galvanized steel exteriors strike me as ugly. They are two feet deep and sit  atop the ground. In the past I have sometimes enclosed them in brick and I have  seen them enclosed in wooden planks. While thinking what to do the birds solved  the matter by dropping seed of the Boston ivy, which quickly covers every inch  of the exterior. When it tries to send shoots into the water, I whack it back.  </P></p>

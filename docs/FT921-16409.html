			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Ups and downs on Wall Street FT-SE Index: 2,492.8 (-0.3) Wall Street's extraordinary year-end performance has doubtless left investors more confused than ever. The trigger for the rally was the Federal Reserve's decision a fortnight ago to cut the discount rate to 3.5 per cent. It is a matter of debate whether the cut was made in belated recognition of a US economy on its knees; or whether the Fed believed it could tip the balance decisively in favour of recovery. But with the equity market now around 8 per cent higher, the argument appears to have reverted to that familiar topic of 1991, the timing of recovery. The latest signs from the real economy show just how grim things remain  - yesterday's manufacturing purchasing managers index and construction spending figures both indicated renewed weakness. It was perhaps surprising that Wall Street did not react more negatively, but the suspicion that the rally was founded on sand nevertheless gained credence. The retail investors who pushed the market along have been reacting more to lower rates on their money market funds than to any well-founded perception that shares are cheap. Indeed, this year's prospective multiple on the S&amp;P Composite index is already steep at around 22 times earnings. Short-term considerations such as the cost of money are not an informative guide to the dividend streams which traditionally underpin equity values. But the dilemma for the market is that interest rates could yet come down again, fuelling further paper asset inflation - all the more so since there still appears to be plenty of foot-loose money in the money markets.</p>

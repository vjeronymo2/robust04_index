			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "National Property Fund Presidium in New </F> Composition"]    [Excerpts] Bratislava--An extraordinary 28th meeting of  the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] was convened  yesterday, on the initiative of NRSR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic,  to decide on the composition of new supreme bodies of the  National Property Fund [FNM] of the Slovak Republic. [passage  omitted]    The deputies decided by secret ballot that Rudolf Janac will  be president of the FNM Presidium and Viliam Vaskovic vice  president. A total of 92 ballots were distributed; the two votes  were then held separately. Rudolf Janac, who had been proposed  by the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], received 77 votes,  and Viliam Vaskovic (proposed by the "Center" coalition) won the  support of 76 deputies.    A third secret ballot determined that Zoltan Zimmermann  (Christian Democratic Movement), Pavol Kinces (Center), Juraj  Kamaras (Center), Karol Pittner (SDL), Frantisek Szomolay  (Coexistence/Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement), and Igor  Mathe (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) became members of the  FNM Presidium. No other candidate won the needed more than 50  percent of vote. The seventh member of the FNM Presidium will  therefore be elected at the next meeting of parliament.    After the promulgation of the results of the secret ballot,  NRSR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic declared the extraordinary meeting  of parliament closed. The next, 29th, NRSR extraordinary  meeting, which will open on 12 April, will be devoted to the  Slovak Government's Policy Statement. [passage omitted]</p>

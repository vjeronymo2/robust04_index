			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rosi Ahuaxin] </F>   [Text] On 6 January, Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential  candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI],  proposed for the consideration of presidential candidates of the  various political parties the possibility of issuing a joint  declaration on the recent developments in Chiapas. Colosio  already sent the draft text based on agreements reflected in the  statements of the various candidates in condemning violence in  the State of Chiapas.    The text, if approved by all parties -- Cecilia Soto of the  Labor Party, Marcela Lombardo of the Popular Socialist Party,  Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party,  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano of the Democratic Revolutionary  Party, Jorge Gonzalez Torres of the Mexican Green Ecologist  Party, Rafael Aguilar Talamantes of the Cardenist Front for  National Reconstruction Party, and Pablo Emilio Madero of the  Mexican Democratic Party -- the joint declaration would state:    No conflict, no difference, no aspiration should be reason  to  break social peace and jeopardize the life of Mexicans. The  declaration adds that violence only generates rancor, division,  and loss of human life; everyone loses with violence.    The joint declaration of the presidential candidates adds  that social underdevelopment [rezagos] angers everyone; it is a  national priority to overcome this. We can only achieve this,  however, when there is stability and harmony in community life.  We are a nation that loves liberty, that believes in dialogue  and peaceful coexistence, and that rejects bloodshed as a means  of settling differences.    The declaration also states that the repudiation of violence  in Chiapas reaffirms the humanistic nature of our people. We  urge, the declaration states, those who are operating outside  the framework of the law to respect the legal state that we  Mexicans established and thus achieve the lofty goals of the  nation.</p>

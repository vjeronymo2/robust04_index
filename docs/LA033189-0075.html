			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: SAN DIEGO ENTERTAINMENT BRIEFS  </P> <P> Ex-Martha Graham principal Ellen Segal will return to the Westminster Theater  on May 18-20 with "Mostly New Garage Dances," a concert that picks up where the  dance maker left off last year. As the title suggests, most of the works on  this program will be premieres, including a work by guest artist Betzi Roe of  Three's Company. Also scheduled for this concert is a revival of an early Segal  signature work, "Teaming," which comes to grips in pure dance terms with the  crippling illness that sidelined Segal for more than a decade.  </P></p>

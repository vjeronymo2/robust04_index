			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Six state polls prove gruelling test for Rao: If Congress does badly, intra-party bickering could worsen NEARLY a third of India's voters are going to the polls this month in six state elections in the north of the country that are proving the most important electoral test for Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, since he launched wide-ranging economic liberalisation in mid-1991. While myriad personal and local rivalries will colour the outcome in many of the 1,123 constituencies, the results will be a significant test for the ruling Congress (I) party and for the main opposition party, the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party, which plunged Indian politics into turmoil a year ago when its supporters tore down the Ayodhya mosque. If Congress does well, the party could rally behind the prime minister and the reforms. But if it fares badly, the intra-party bickering which has plagued Mr Rao for the past year could get worse and undermine the government's ability to handle pressing national problems, including the Kashmir crisis, relations with Pakistan, and further economic reform. If Congress does badly, the BJP has pledged to demand early general elections. In the words of one expert: 'The state elections will set the political tone for some time to come'. Opinion polls suggest Congress is likely to do better than its leaders expected earlier this year. Then, the party was reeling from a wave of support for the BJP, compounded by the political impact of the riots which followed the Ayodhya troubles and the bombings in Bombay. The past six months have seen no surge of support for Congress but they seem to have witnessed a modest ebbing in the BJP's popularity. BJP leaders badly need electoral success to rekindle the enthusiasms created by their fight to claim for Hindus the Ayodhya mosque site, but early indications are they may not get it. Congress fared so badly in the last state elections, when the BJP seized control of four of the six states, that it seems certain this time to improve its showing, however little. If it wins back control of even one state, Mr Rao will be able to claim he is turning the BJP tide. The polls' timing is the product of the Ayodhya crisis. The BJP-controlled governments in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh were dismissed mid-term last December by the central government for allegedly encouraging the mosque's destruction. Mr Rao put off calling elections immediately, for fear the BJP would benefit from the post-Ayodhya turmoil. He could not postpone the day of reckoning indefinitely, but the delay seems to have worked in his favour. Largely for administrative reasons, polls are also being held simultaneously in the city of Delhi and Mizoram, in India's remote north-east. Polling is spread throughout November: Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan have already voted; Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh vote this week, Mizoram next week. The ballot boxes from the early elections are being held under lock and key until after the vote in Madhya Pradesh, to ensure results from one state do not influence those in another. Party leaders are enduring an exhausting cycle of public rallies held hundreds of miles apart and separated by long journeys. For many candidates, campaigning hinges on persuading a party leader to pay a visit, however brief, and make some spectacular promise: a new school, a road, an international airport. The last example is not an invention, but a serious demand from mango-growers in Uttar Pradesh who want to export their fragile fruit without subjecting it to a 500-km lorry ride to Delhi. Personal position matters more than party. Film stars and the children of former maharajas do particularly well. So do the wives, sons and other relatives of politicians. Money is needed for everything from securing a party ticket to transporting voters on polling day and providing refreshments. Violence is not uncommon; thousands have been placed under preventive arrest, including some candidates. National issues are obscured in the electoral fray but are not entirely obliterated. Congress speakers do mention economic reform, albeit often in passing. They prefer to discuss vague subjects such as the party's role in building the Indian nation. Life-size cut-out figures of Mrs Indira Gandhi and Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the assassinated former prime ministers, are displayed, usually more prominently than those of Mr Rao. The BJP's campaign centres on attacks on the Congress party's social policies which it claims favour India's Moslem minority at the expense of the Hindu majority. Ayodhya figures prominently, but less so than a year ago. Speakers also berate the government for its handling of the month-long siege in the troubled northern state of Kashmir where the security forces have surrounded Moslem militants in a mosque. BJP leaders say Mr Rao should have flushed the militants out long ago. In most constituencies, the fight is mainly between Congress and the BJP. But in Uttar Pradesh, two powerful alternative groupings are also in the running, both left-of-centre and both strongly anti-BJP. One is Janata Dal, led by Mr V P Singh, a former prime minister, and the other the Samajwadi Janata Party, headed by Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav, a socialist popular with the lower castes. Since Uttar Pradesh is India's largest state and the historical crucible of north Indian culture, its poll result will be especially significant. As one local official says: 'When people vote here, Delhi cannot afford to ignore them'.</p>

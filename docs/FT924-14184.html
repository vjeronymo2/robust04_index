			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Air strike in Bosnia as ban defied SERB military aircraft at the weekend defied a United Nations ban on military flights over Bosnia, bombarding two Bosnian strongholds in the north of the former Yugoslav republic. The air strike took place during a Moslem and Croat counter-offensive to close the Serb corridor through Bosnia. A UN resolution creating a no-fly zone over Bosnia, agreed by the Security Council on Friday, envisages only the monitoring of flights but does not authorise the use of force to punish violators. Bosnian radio said 19 people were killed on Saturday in a Serb bombardment of Gradacac, one of the two strongholds. It said Serb aircraft took off from Banja Luka, in north-west Bosnia, the military headquarters of the self-proclaimed Serb Republic. Bosnian Serb leaders attending peace talks in Geneva at the weekend said their aircraft were grounded in Banja Luka, dismissing the reports of bombardment as propaganda in an attempt to force foreign military intervention in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Serbian commanders on the ground said Bosnian reinforcements had crossed over the River Sava from Croatia into Brcko. Bosnian forces on Saturday cut through the Serb corridor which runs east-west across northern Bosnia, from Banja Luka to the Serb border in the east. Lorries, buses and cars waited near Brcko for Serb forces to re-establish control over the corridor. Mr Milan Panic, Yugoslav prime minister, has asked for the despatch of international monitors to airports in Serbia, Montenegro and Banja Luka. Reuters quoted diplomatic sources in Geneva yesterday as saying Croatia and the rump Yugoslavia had reached agreement on allowing such observers at their airfields. Bosnian military leaders said yesterday they would pull out of UN-backed talks on ending the siege of Sarajevo because Serb rebels were preventing crews from restoring water and power to the city, AP reports from Sarajevo. Military officials from the Moslem-led Bosnian government, the Bosnian Croats and the rebelling Bosnian Serbs had agreed to meet in Sarajevo today to discuss the demilitarisation of the city. Meanwhile, the Red Cross in Sarejevo said it was trying to organise a convoy to carry 3,000 women and children out of the city tomorrow.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A new party will be set up in the political center.  The New National Center [Uusi Kansallinen Keskusta], UKK,  intends to contest the next Diet elections with full candidate  lists in all election districts. UKK calls for the  implementation of a policy independent of European Union  legislation and the pursuit of an independent foreign and  security policy based on neutrality and the Finnish desire to  defend the country.    The chairman of the temporary board which is preparing for  the registration of the party is Ilkka Hakalehto from Helsinki.  Pentti Kettunen, a former Diet deputy of the SMP [Finnish Rural  Party] from Kajaani, is deputy chairman. Both men also belong  to the leadership of the Finnish People's Independence Front,  which opposes membership in the European Union.</p>

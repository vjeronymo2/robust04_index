			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (4): Electorate turns cynical - Politics AS A flash of lightning reveals all on a dark night, this February's parliamentary by-election in the affluent south Auckland suburb of Tamaki illuminated the main contours of New Zealand's political landscape. The by-election in this 'blue ribbon' National (Conservative) seat was caused by the resignation from parliament of Sir Robert Muldoon, prime minister from 1975 to 1984. Sir Robert was the last of New Zealand's 'borrow, tax and regulate' leaders: his defeat unleashed the programme of modernisation and liberalisation dubbed 'Rogernomics', after Sir Roger Douglas, Labour's radical finance minister, which in five years turned the country upside down. The electorate thought it was voting for a breather when it turned back to National in 1990. But Mr Jim Bolger's government has taken Rogernomics into pastures new, notably industrial relations and welfare. For all the controversy caused by reforms such as the Employment Contracts Act, deregulating labour relations, or part-charges for hospital visits, the leaders of both main parties unite in their rejection of the ancien regime. Sir Robert's departure, after years of ineffectual carping on the sidelines, laid the ghost of an era. For Mr Bolger, with a trail of broken election promises and a deeply unpopular welfare-cutting budget to defend, a by-election defeat at Tamaki seemed likely. Significantly, the challenge came not from Labour, but from a new rainbow 'Alliance' of five parties - including Greens, defectors from both main parties, and Mana Motuhake, a Maori party - thriving on popular discontent with both main parties. Yet on the day National squeezed back with a greatly reduced majority. The run-up to polling day saw a succession of favourable economic indicators; and the cohesion of the Alliance crumbled under the media spotlight. The real loser, though, was Mr Mike Moore's Labour party, which came a poor third, unable to pick up the protest vote. Polls still show Labour ahead in the race for the next election, due by November 1993. But a recent survey put the parties neck-and-neck and Mr Moore has neither the credibility (as a member of the Rogernomics cabinet) nor the inclination to play the populist card against Mr Bolger. The Alliance, with a steady 20 per cent in the polls, can be relied on to do that, boosted perhaps by Mr Winston Peters, a Maori National MP sacked from the cabinet last year, who appears to be angling for expulsion from the party with a series of vitriolic attacks on the supposed misdeeds of its business allies. But remember Tamaki. Labour and the Alliance will be up against the same problems in the next election, with National starting from a higher base. The Alliance lacks not only coherent policies, but even a leader - and the favourite for the post, Mr Jim Anderton, a 1980s defector from Labour's left, is unlikely to strengthen its appeal to the middle ground. As for Labour: 'we will win because we are the conservative party', says Mr Moore, pointing to the array of interests antagonised by the latest dose of reform medicine. Perhaps, but the generally perceived strength of the economic upturn is working to National's advantage, while Mr Bolger's evident capacity to trim to the tide - as in the succession of back-downs from especially unpopular aspects of Ms Ruth Richardson's 1991 budget - is softening the edges of antagonism. The odds, therefore, must be on Mr Bolger surviving next autumn with a small majority. However, for both main parties an arguably more critical test is less than two months away, in the shape of a national referendum on proportional representation. A shift from first-past-the-post to a form of PR would break the mould of New Zealand's two-party system, with fragmentation, coalitions and inter-party wheeling and dealing the most likely consequences. Suffice it to say that National and Labour are campaigning side by side to preserve the status quo - which fact alone may be enough to ensure its destruction, say the cynics. In a bid to avert that, the government has erected a veritable obstacle course to electoral reform. On September 19 voters have to choose between five systems - first-past-the-post and four more or less proportional alternatives. If there is a majority for change, a further referendum will be held on the same day as the next general election, offering a straight choice between the existing system and the reform option gaining most support in the first poll - which is most likely to be the 'mixed member' system, a variant on that used in Germany. The politicians are hoping that even if a majority vote for change first time - which appears likely - the disparate pro-reform movement will have run out of steam in a year's time. In case it does not, the issue is to be complicated further still by a third referendum, on restoring New Zealand's second chamber, to be held in tandem with the second and the general election. The revival of the upper house, abolished in 1951, is a pet scheme of Mr Bolger's. He supports it for traditional Tory reasons (mature reflection on legislation and so on), but there is even less agreement on the form of a new second chamber than on a new electoral system. So constitutional revision is very much in the balance. But it is important to remember why it is on the agenda at all. Neither main party felt it could face the last election without offering voters the chance to change the system, and PR, endorsed by a royal commission in the 1980s, was and is the most popular panacea. Panacea for what? Mr David Lange, the former prime minister, says bluntly: 'It is deep- seated cynicism about politics and parliament. It is massive alienation of the electorate from the elected. It is lack of confidence in our system.' Unless they can restore confidence, no amount of clever footwork will save New Zealand's politicians from a still stronger backlash. And with or without PR, their best hope of salvation lies in prosperity.</p>

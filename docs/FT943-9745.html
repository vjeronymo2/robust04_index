			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kennecott under attack over diamond sampling Canadian geologists and mining analysts have strongly criticised Kennecott, the US subsidiary of UK mining group RTZ, in the wake of disastrous sampling results from one of the most prominent properties in the Northwest Territories diamond rush. The results have burst the bubble of euphoria which has enveloped the search for diamonds across a wide swathe of northern Canada during the past two years. Share prices of companies involved in the stampede have crashed since Kennecott announced last Friday that results from the highly-touted Tli Kwi Cho kimberlite pipe were far below expectations. Some of Kennecott's junior partners have lost more than 80 per cent of their market value. For example, Kettle River Resources plunged to CDollars 1.99 early yesterday from CDollars 11.75 just before Friday's announcement. Mr John Idt, analyst at Dominick and Dominick Securities in Toronto, said yesterday the Tli Kwi Cho project was dead. 'Somebody might go back and look, but it will take a few years,' Mr Idt said. Kennecott owns 40 per cent of the DHK joint venture, which was rushing to prove that Tli Kwi Cho could rival the nearby Lac de Gras area, where a consortium comprising Australia's BHP Minerals and Dia-Met Minerals of Canada is expected to give the go-ahead later this year for North America's first diamond mine. 'In hindsight, Kennecott advanced the project too fast,' said Mr Chris Jennings, president of SouthernEra Re-sources, which has a 10 per cent interest in Tli Kwi Cho. 'The mentality of catching up to BHP and Dia-Met cost them a lot of money, and at least a year,' said Mr Jennings. Tli Kwi Cho is about 40km south-east of the BHP project. Criticism centres on Kennecott's decision to go ahead with costly underground tests on the basis of samples which weighed less than 2 tonnes and were retrieved from about 50 narrow-diameter drill holes. Kennecott has spent an estimated CDollars 15m (USDollars 10.9m) on the underground programme which involved bulk samples of 5,000 tonnes. Mr Jennings said that Kennecott had 'assumed an air of secrecy' towards other joint-venture participants. He alleged that the US company refused to allow its junior partners to visit its sampling plant at Yellowknife. He also said that Kennecott failed to carry out a promise to advise them well in advance if results failed to live up to expectations. Two principal kimberlite bodies were analysed from the Tli Kwi Cho pipe. The higher-grade body was especially disappointing, with fewer than 30 per cent of those diamonds more than 2mm in diameter classified as gem quality. Kennecott concluded that the results were not sufficiently encouraging to justify further bulk sampling from Tli Kwi Cho. Mr Jennings, who has wide experience in diamond exploration, said there was an 'outside chance' that the samples were not representative of the whole pipe. The joint venture is, however, now pinning its hopes for diamond exploration on other nearby pipes.</p>

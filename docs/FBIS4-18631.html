			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris (DPA) -- Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), French  Aerospatiale, and British Aerospace have agreed on joint  research for a new supersonic passenger plane. This program,  PERS, has the goal of producing a follow-up model for the  French-British Concorde in the next century, the companies  announced on Thursday [7 April].    The work, which extends over several years, would be  financed  by the three companies in equal shares. According to the plans,  the new plane is to have a range of 10,000 km and be able to  carry 250 passengers. It is to fly with a speed of 2,000 km per  hour (Mach 2). The companies pointed out that long-distance  flying is increasing constantly. It is estimated that, in the  year 2005, 50 million people per year will fly either across the  Atlantic, from Europe to Asia, or from Asia to North America.  Given the fact that 500 to 1,000 planes will then probably be  wanted on the market, only some kind of supersonic plane can be  profitable.    The three companies pointed our that, within a greater  framework, in which U.S., Italian, Japanese, and Russian  companies are included, they also participate in research for a  second-generation supersonic passenger plane. The development  costs for such a plane are estimated by experts at $12 to $15  billion.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: ZF joins forces with German carmakers Germany's biggest vehicle makers and a leading parts supplier are planning to join forces in an ambitious co-operative venture which could mark a breakthrough in the automotive industry's drive to cut costs. The scheme provides for ZF, a transmissions and steering specialist, to pool its resources with Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz in an operation which will supply both vehicle makers with jointly-developed steering gear. According to ZF, which unveiled the plan yesterday, the project would reduce steering equipment costs. It would also be open to other automotive groups, the company said. ZF has been nominated as the project's industrial leader, and its division based at a newly-opened factory in Schwabisch Gmund has been designated as the manufacturing base. If the venture is approved by the companies' boards and the cartel authorities, it could lead to Mercedes and Volkswagen buying in most or all of their steering gear rather than making it themselves as at present. All German vehicle makers are keenly examining all possibilities for reducing costs by increased out-sourcing, and greater use of common components, especially those parts under a vehicle's bodywork which do not directly affect a prospective buyer's judgment. At the same time, the domestic components industry is under heavy pressure from customers to cut costs, which has led to a wave of losses and intensive merger and co-operation talks. ZF, which last year made an undefined operating loss after tumbling German sales cut its global sales by DM400m to DM5.4bn (Dollars 3.2bn), was recently refused permission by the cartel authorities to take over General Motors' subsidiary, Allison Transmissions. Shortly after the refusal it announced plans to open a new factory in Alabama to supply front and rear axles for a new Mercedes factory in the state which is due to start production of cross-country vehicles in mid-1997. Daimler-Benz is to pay DM424m to buy out the Bavarian government's 8.58 per cent holding in its aircraft and defence systems subsidiary, Deutsche Aerospace. The price, announced yesterday, was 'extraordinarily satisfying', said Mr Edmund Stoiber, the Bavarian prime minister, who recently suggested he was looking for DM300m to DM350m. The deal marks a further stage in the state's privatisation programme, announced last year, and started earlier this month with the takeover of the Bayernwerk energy utility by Viag for a cash consideration of DM2.3bn plus a blocking minority stake in the enlarged Viag group. The next move will be the disposal of a holding in the Rhine-Main-Danube canal management company, which will complete Bavaria's assets sale. Mr Stoiber stressed that privatisation of state and local government-owned savings banks was out of the question. Publicly-owned banks were important to help the financing of local small and medium-sized industries which often entailed higher risks than those acceptable to private sector financial institutions, he said.</p>

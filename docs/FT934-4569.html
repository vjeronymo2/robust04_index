			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Insurers to pass on 3% tax cost Most consumers seem likely to face increased costs for home and motor insurance next year as the country's largest companies digest the implications of the introduction earlier this week of a 3 per cent premium tax. Prudential and Pearl, two companies predominantly concerned with life insurance, have been quick to promise customers that they would absorb the costs by means of improvements in efficiency. But the composite insurers, which have a larger share of the 'personal lines' insurance market, say costs must be passed on to their customers. 'Somehow the cost will have to be passed on to the policyholder. I can't see how we can afford to absorb it,' said Mr Mike Jones, head of public relations for Sun Alliance, the largest insurer of homes in the UK. 'At the moment, the market is not keen to reduce rates when we are still rebuilding. We are not in the business of making rash promises,' he added. Mr Roy Randall, head of corporate relations at Royal Insurance, the second largest home insurer, said his company would also pass on the tax to buyers. Royal fears that the 3 per cent rate may be increased in future years, aligning it with the premium tax rates which are common elsewhere in Europe. Legal &amp; General, a company mainly concerned with life insurance which has a sizeable slice of the home insurance market, also insists that the costs must be passed on. 'Those companies who claim to be able to absorb the additional cost have not fully thought through the implications, particularly to shareholders,' the group warned. 'This is the thin end of the wedge. When it comes to taxes, chancellors are like starving men - they can never get enough,' added Mr David Prosser, group chief executive.</p>

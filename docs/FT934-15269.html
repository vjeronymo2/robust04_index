			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Russia's future may be decided in a day THE FUTURE of all Russia's democratic institutions is likely to be decided on December 12 following indications yesterday that President Boris Yeltsin would opt for a presidential poll in December. This would coincide with elections to both houses of the federal assembly, or new parliament and to the regional and republican councils. Earlier, Mr Yeltsin had insisted that presidential elections be held in June to guarantee stability in the country over the parliamentary election period. However, Mr Georgy Satarov, a presidential aide, was quoted yesterday by the official Itar-Tass news agency as saying that Mr Yeltsin, presently on a visit to Japan, was now looking more favourably on the December date. The latest opinion polls suggest Mr Yeltsin has gained in popularity, and many of those advising him believe he should stand while he remains popular and while his popularity would benefit those parties and groups which support him. Several supporters, including Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the mayor of St Petersburg and Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister with responsibility for finance, have called on him to stand in December. The biggest uncertainty facing the December polls is whether there is enough time left for them to be organised. Boundaries have to be drawn, electoral commissions appointed, party lists made up and rules on media coverage published. Many parties and some papers remain banned during the state of emergency - due to end on Sunday. Mr Satarov said yesterday that another possibility was to move all elections to a later date. However, the main forces of the far right and left now seem likely to participate. Mr Sergei Baburin, a nationalist deputy and a former deputy chairman of the banned National Salvation Front group, said yesterday he would call on his comrades in the Russian Popular Union - a smaller party of which he was also chairman - to put up candidates because 'it is important to participate . . . in order to make the federal assembly, which is now purely decorative, into a real organ of representative power'. Mr Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist party, said that of the 120 nationalist/communist parties, only a few had been banned - and that communist and nationalist candidates could use the legal parties for their campaigns. He said that the Agrarian Union and the trade unions would also serve as vehicles for these forces. However, the main trade union federation - the Russian Federation of Independent Unions - said yesterday it wished to be free of all political affiliations. On Monday, its praesidium accepted the resignation of Mr Igor Klochkov, the federation president - apparently as a 'peace offering' to Mr Yeltsin, whose policies Mr Klochkov had strenuously opposed and whom the unions now fear may confiscate all or a large part of its property holdings. Meanwhile, several key Russian regions, until now broadly opposed to Mr Yeltsin, are falling into line with his plans. The diamond-producing republic of Yakutia yesterday dissolved its local parliament and has set December 12 as a date for fresh elections. In the Siberian city of Irkutsk, local politicians promised to reform their legislature, as Mr Yeltsin has demanded.</p>

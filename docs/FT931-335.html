			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (8): Capitalism is a bitter pill - Profile of LEK A PLAQUE above the entrance to the Lek pharmaceutical company's elegant, 10-storey headquarters in the industrial suburbs of Ljubljana records the proud opening in 1991. But 1991 was a bad year to take on board such an expensive addition to fixed costs. Former Yugoslavia was disintegrating into a patchwork of warring mini-states with inconvertible currencies and hyper-inflation. Comecon markets, and especially the former Soviet market, were in a state of shock following the switch from the rouble to hard currency trade. For Lek, like other Slovene exporters, these developments threatened the 40 per cent of sales which used to go to Yugoslav markets and much of the remaining 40 per cent of output exported to Comecon, third world and other markets. The pharmaceutical industry has suffered less than producers of goods that can more easily be substituted or for which purchases can be deferred. But output from Lek's six plants fell 25 per cent last year, according to Mr Metod Dragonja, the managing director. Higher domestic prices on the Slovene market helped boost local sales from 20 to 30 per cent of the lower total. However, the rest of former Yugoslavia is now taking only 32 per cent of sales. Pharmaceutical exports to Serbia are exempt from the UN trade embargo. But sharply declining real incomes, hyper-inflation and inconvertible currencies mean that an increasing portion of the declining trade is taking place on a barter or semi-barter basis. The unchanged 40 per cent of exports to other markets reflects limited success in switching trade from Comecon to western markets. Lek has licensing agreements with several western firms. These include Merck and Eli Lilly of the US, Fisons of the UK and Knoll of Germany, as well as a long-standing Bayer-Pharma joint venture with Germany. Most sales to western markets are generic drugs and bulk products. The search for new markets and niche products for future growth has been accompanied by a cost-cutting programme and a 10 per cent drop in the labour force to 2,100. Last year this helped Lek remain in the black with an 8 per cent pre-tax profit on turnover of about Dollars 200m. But times are hard for small central European pharmaceutical companies such as Lek and Krka, its larger Slovene competitor. Both face growing domestic competition from western firms and uncertain prospects for recovery in the once insatiable and undemanding markets of the socialist east. To survive, they will need closer links with foreign drug companies. The forms these take have still to be defined. But once privatisation legislation is approved, the search for new partners, new products and new markets will intensify.</p>

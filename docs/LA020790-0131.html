			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS MULL BUYING LAGUNA LAUREL LAND;  </P> <P> OPEN SPACE: THE COUNTY WILL SEARCH FOR FUNDS TO PURCHASE THE SITE FROM THE  IRVINE CO. WITH PRICE ESTIMATES UP TO $110 MILLION, THE GOING MAY BE DIFFICULT.  </P> <P> In what could be a step toward public ownership of thousands of acres of  pristine canyon country, the Orange County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday  unanimously agreed to look into ways of buying the controversial Laguna Laurel  development site from the Irvine Co.  </P> <P> "Everyone agrees that purchasing the site is an acceptable alternative to  building on it," said Tom Mathews, an aide to Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who  proposed a feasibility study. "But we are talking about a large amount of  money, $50 (million) or $100 million."  </P> <P> Mathews said the county would search for state bond money, grants or federal  funds to buy all or part of the proposed development site.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, environmentalists who have waged a decadelong battle to block the  controversial housing project in Laguna Canyon between the San Diego Freeway  and Laguna Beach, welcomed the Board of Supervisors' decision as a move toward  preserving the environmentally sensitive Laguna Canyon.  </P> <P> "It's a very important first step, and I am thrilled with the vote on the part  of the supervisors," Laguna Mayor Lida Lenney said. "It reads very positively."  </P> <P> Supervisors also authorized the county staff to get an independent appraiser to  help in setting a value on the property. Depending on who is quoting the  figures, the value has ranged from $50 million to $110 million.  </P> <P> In order to raise enough money to buy the Laguna Laurel site, a ballot measure  would be needed. But it would be doomed from the start unless the board scales  back its demands that the Irvine Co. pay for road improvements related to the  San Joaquin Transportation Corridor, some observers said.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. and the city of Laguna Beach, a leading opponent of the  development project in Laguna Canyon, agreed last month to ask supervisors to  explore the possibility of placing a measure to buy the Laguna Laurel site on  the November ballot.  </P> <P> "It could be considered the first step in a purchasing program to put the  canyon in public ownership," Riley said.  </P> <P> "While we all might agree that purchase of the site is an acceptable  alternative to development, I believe it is only prudent to study the  feasibility of bond financing and other methods of purchase before we consider  putting the issue before the voters," he said.  </P> <P> During a recent meeting between Laguna Beach and Irvine Co. officials, Riley  said he was asked whether he thought purchase of the site would be acceptable  to the county.  </P> <P> "My opinion at the time, and to date, is affirmative, provided that public  benefits negotiated as part of the development agreement between the county and  the Irvine Co. would not be lost," Riley said.  </P> <P> Those benefits include the Irvine Co.'s commitment to provide right of way for  the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor and grading for the tollway, and  improvements and widening of Laguna Canyon Road.  </P> <P> Of the 2,100-acre site owned by the company, 1,300 acres have been dedicated  open space under the development agreement signed in 1988. The actual  development area, with 3,200 proposed homes and a golf course, is only about  800 acres. The rest of the land, including the pristine 550-acre Laurel Canyon,  could not be developed. There are three natural lakes on the property.  </P> <P> The property would fit nicely into an existing network of parks, including  Crystal Cove State Park, Irvine Coast Wilderness Regional Park and Aliso/Wood  Canyons Regional Park. The parks would total nearly 16,000 acres.  </P> <P> Although environmentalists and the developer have been warring over the project  since the early 1980s, the battle has intensified in recent months.  </P> <P> In November, more than 7,000 people converged on the Laguna Canyon to protest  plans by the Irvine Co. to build the project. Many of the marchers came from  outside the Laguna Beach area, stirring hopes among politicians that the  preservation of the canyon may be of countywide concern, making a ballot  measure more viable.  </P> <P> Some warned that the cost of the land may be too high because many of the  public benefits that the Irvine Co. agreed to are in the price of the 800  acres.  </P> <P> "If it didn't include all the extras and it was just to raise enough money to  compensate the Irvine Co. for the land, the property would probably get down to  a reasonable price," said Carolyn Wood, president of the Laguna Canyon  Conservancy. "I think they are trying to glob too much into it and it makes the  property too expensive."  </P> <P> Although many support the land being protected as open space, others have  expressed doubts that voters in financially conservative Orange County would  support a tax increase to purchase open space.  </P></p>

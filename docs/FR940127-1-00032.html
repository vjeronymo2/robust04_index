			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1993, the Forest Service released its Scientific Analysis Team Report (Thomas  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993). In this report, the Forest Service proposed several interim measures designed to preserve options for management of marbled murrelets and their habitat until the Marbled Murrelet Recovery Plan could be completed and implemented. These measures include: (1) The protection of all marbled murrelet nesting habitat within 35 miles of the marine environment in California and Oregon south of State Highway 42, and within 50 miles of the marine environment in the remainder of Oregon and in Washington; and, (2) the protection of amounts of ``recruitment'' habitat (young stands likely to develop into suitable habitat) equivalent to 50 percent of the total amount of existing suitable habitat in the above mentioned zones. Also, seasonal restrictions on operations in and near suitable habitat were identified to avoid disturbing nesting marbled murrelets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In July 1993, the Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, and Environmental Protection Agency released the Report of the Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment Team (FEMAT Report) (USDA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993a). From this report, the President identified Option 9 as the Proposed Northwest Forest Plan, described in the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on Management of Habitat for Late-Successional and Old-Growth Forest Related Species Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl (DSEIS) as Alternative 9 (Alternative 9) (USDA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993b). Within the range of the marbled murrelet, Alternative 9 would designate a system of Late-Successional Reserves, which provides large areas expected to eventually develop into contiguous, unfragmented forest. This reserve system was constructed in part around the LSOGs designated by the Scientific Panel. In addition, specific measures were included to protect all forest sites occupied by marbled murrelets outside the reserve system. These measures include surveys prior to activities that affect habitat and protection of contiguous marbled murrelet nesting and recruitment habitat (stands capable of becoming suitable within 25 years) within 0.5 mile of areas occupied by murrelets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service recognizes the value of the Proposed Northwest Forest Plan (USDA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993a) and acknowledges that it can play an integral role in marbled murrelet conservation. The Plan complements this critical habitat proposal by stressing the need for protection of large, unfragmented areas of suitable nesting habitat that are well-distributed throughout the species' range, with special emphasis on areas close to the marine environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

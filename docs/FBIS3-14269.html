We may even sympathize with this  young couple who rule the White House and wield the helm of  world events, or so we think. We understand the nervous  pressure and frayed confidence of the strongest man in the world  when his job is placed on the line and his position is  jeopardized by a scandal that threatens to drown him in  Whitewater, a scandal reminiscent of President Nixon's Watergate.    We may also sense the influence and see the fingerprints of  some U.S. officials who are concerned with the Middle East  crisis on Washington's tendencies, policies, statements, and, of  course, decisions. Among these officials are Dennis Ross, the  chief coordinator; Daniel Kurtzer, deputy assistant secretary of  state; Martin Indyk, National Security Council and White House  official; and Aaron Miller, Ross's assistant.    But there are things that we fail to understand, comprehend,  or even imagine and, therefore, find unacceptable and  objectionable.    For example:    -- We fail to understand why President Clinton should try to  emerge from his dilemma at the expense of the truth, why he  should make an offer for which someone else would foot the bill,  and why he should present Jerusalem as a sacrifice at the alter  to please certain people, hoping that they may then back him and  make the Whitewater affair disappear before it ends his career  as Watergate ended Nixon's.    -- We find it unacceptable and objectionable that the judge,  partner, and mediator should hand down his final verdict in the  case before the defense has ended its presentation, before the  case is summed up, before the contestants are brought into  court, and before the rivals face each other at the negotiating  table.    -- We object to Clinton's issuing a unilateral decision that  undermines the international order, violates the legitimacy of  its resolution, and slaps the members of the international  community in the face.    -- We find it incomprehensible and bewildering that  President  Clinton should break with his country's tradition and turn his  back on its known positions for the past 27 years. That is,  from June 1967 until Clinton declared unified Jerusalem as  Israel's capital.    For 27 years, for more than a quarter of a century --  President Johnson, who instigated, planned, funded, armed, and  orchestrated the 1967 aggression, could not declare or state  that Jerusalem was Israel's capital; and Presidents Nixon, Ford,  Carter, Reagan, and Bush stopped short of what Clinton, all of a  sudden and with bizarre timing, did.    On the contrary, for a quarter century resolutions were  issued, statements were declared, and positions were stated by  successive U.S. Administrations, the UN General Assembly, and  the UN Security Council, all of which emphasized that East  Jerusalem is part of the Arab territories occupied in 1967.    An element of flexibility had been advocated by James Baker,  the former U.S. secretary of state, who maintained that the  peace process should begin by addressing the easy issues. This,  he reasoned, should lead to progress and generate momentum that  could be useful in addressing the difficult and intricate issues  at a later stage. The idea, then, was not to make concessions  and compromises for their own sake, but to expand the areas of  agreement through discussion of less thorny matters. That is,  once a climate of understanding and a spirit of mutual  confidence had been created, difficult matters would be brought  to the table.    President Clinton's declaration, although made during a  private meeting with U.S. Jewish leaders, does not show the  astuteness of a "professional" statesman as much as it betrays  the opinion of an "amateur politician". There's a big  difference between amateurism and professionalism.    Amateurism is a whim, a personal inclination motivated by  bias and fed by emotions. Professionalism is a job, work, and  responsibility.    Professionalism means calculations, assessments, and rules.  It has principles and codes of conduct. Anyone who disregards  them breaks the rules. If he circumvents them, he violates the  law. If he breaks the rules and transgresses, he is taken to  account.    Governing -- particularly on a very high level, on a state  level, indeed on a universal level, as the case is with the U.S.  President -- must signify justice and responsibility. It must  never be an attention grabbing "arbitrary move" that shifts the  focus from Whitewater to Jerusalem, or from the Hebron massacre  to an assault on a Lebanese church or a monastery in al-Qusiyah,  Egypt.    Governing should signify decisions and statements that have  been thoroughly thought out, sober conduct, and a word of reason  at this difficult, embarrassing time.    During a recent meeting with Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] --  at  a time when his chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th had just returned  from Washington following lengthy meetings with Christopher and  his aides -- Abu-'Ammar disclosed part of the news Sha'th had  brought to him from the U.S. capital. Among the things he  revealed were some of the reasons for the obstruction of a UN  Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre. The most  important of these reasons was a "firm, stern, and emphatic U.S.  refusal to allow any direct or indirect reference to Jerusalem."  There was a U.S. commitment to "banning the word Jerusalem from  the draft of the resolution and subsequently from the resolution  itself."    Everyone was perplexed by this strange attitude and this  intransigence and insistence because the draft resolution  included nothing new about Jerusalem. It added nothing new,  made no new request, and did not emphasize a principle that some  people were trying to obliterate.    All that the Palestinians asked for was that the draft and  the final wording of the resolution should include a passing  reference to Security Council Resolution 799 of 1992. It was  meant to be a reference to that resolution in the wake of the  Hebron massacre. Resolution 799 speaks of implementing the  fourth Geneva Convention pertaining to territories and residents  living under occupation, including occupied Palestinian  territories in the West Bank and Gaza, including Jerusalem.    This reference to a binding UN resolution and a firm  international principle -- a resolution and principle accepted  by the United States when the vote on Resolution 799 was taken  in 1992 -- was now unacceptable, prohibited, and a taboo.    No one knew at that point the reason for the prohibition of  something which had, in fact, been accepted and agreed upon as a  matter of course.    It was to be a Palestinian reference, a necessary one after  the Hebron massacre proved that Palestinians under occupation  enjoy no form of protection whatsoever.    People became apprehensive at this point and the  Palestinians  realized something "was being cooked up" in the dark. The  perplexity and fear persisted until President Clinton revealed  his intentions and "detonated his bombshell" in the dark.  Israel Radio then lifted the veil and "laid it bare".    This attitude to the resolution and its draft form, to which  the U.S. negotiators adhered throughout the Security Council's  deliberations, was based on frank, definite, and clear  instructions from the White House. It does not reflect the U.S.  Administration's calculations. It rather shows "a deception."  It reflects a circumvention and contradiction of former  positions and commitments. It shows an abandonment of the  responsibility the United States bears as a full partner in the  peace process.    This position reflects a bias, indeed a U.S.-Israeli  alliance, against the Arabs.    Perhaps this maneuver or change in the U.S. position would  have been acceptable before Oslo and before the signing ceremony  at the White House. Perhaps this position could have been the  subject of discussion, argument, and negotiations before the  Hebron massacre. But after the signing ceremony at the White  House and the festival of martyrdom in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque,  it is impermissible for the United States -- irrespective of the  personal reasons of President Clinton and his wife Hillary -- to  adopt such a stand, unless the game is much bigger than this,  the deception hides behind it a greater tragedy, and the peace  process for which we are sincerely working is a big lie.    I am afraid that President Clinton's calculations and  assessment of the overall situation were the result of political  amateurism and not responsible professionalism, which is  necessary for one who occupies this high position at the center  of the empire that runs the affairs of the entire world.    This political amateurism may have been nurtured or  attracted  by an easy or naive calculation based on the facts and  developments at that moment. This naive and tempting  calculation may have been based on dealing with the situation in  light of the material relations between the forces. These  material relations say that Israel is now the strongest country  as a result of its alliance with the United States, its military  arsenal, nuclear bombs, and internal cohesion, despite the  internal struggle for leadership and power.    The material relations also say that the Arabs are now at  the  peak of their division and weakness. They also say that this  weakness and disintegration have led many Arab states to run  after Israel, seeking science, knowledge, experience, money,  gain, and good administration. Many of the Arabs have rushed to  compete for the Israeli treasures.    This is the general picture of the relations and balance  between the forces in the area. There are those who seek  progress, wealth, and knowledge from Israel and those who have  placed security in the back or front of their minds as their  main concern and have imagined that a military alliance with  Israel in the near or distant future will spare them from the  evil of troublemakers among their Arab brothers who covet their  territory and wealth. They also imagined that this will spare  them from the evil of the troublemakers among the Muslim  brothers in the neighboring countries who are seeking to restore  past glories by establishing a Muslim empire that transcends  borders. This, as we said, is the material calculation, the  calculation based on the relations and balance between the  forces. This is a misleading calculation as much as it is  tempting. Furthermore, there is a difference between weakness  resulting from a defect in relations between the forces and  capitulation, which is out of the question.    Therefore, the reality is very different and the reasons  for that are many. For the foreseeable future at least,  military superiority has become ineffective. Nuclear and  military potentials have, to a large extent, become inoperative  and useless. We have the example of the second superpower, which  broke down and collapsed on itself while possessing the largest  weapons arsenal of all kinds. It also had the largest supply of  resources, expertise, and scientists on the face of the earth.    We have the second example in South Africa, which was  founded  as a racial state in the same year as racial Israel was founded,  1948. Both of them came to be part of the post-World War II  arrangements.    The whites established their racial state there and deprived  around 30 million people, that is the black Africans and sons of  the area, of their land. The whites armed themselves with  everything and deprived the others of everything. They armed  themselves with education, monopolized work including  agriculture, built an atomic bomb, set up a military arsenal,  and at the end of the road, discovered that the world had  changed.    They found out that arrangements made after World War II had  collapsed and were being replaced by post-Cold War arrangements.    They discovered that they were up against the wall and had  no  other option but coexistence, dismantling the racial state, and  building a democratic state. They discovered that bullets were  blank and grenades had no triggers.    They changed and decided to bravely join the rest of the  world, led wisely, expertly, and with good intentions by de  Klerk. They made way for free elections for all -- for the  blacks, the whites, and the coloreds -- elections that will take  place on 27 April.    They decided to go ahead despite the fact that they know the  results beforehand -- the black majority will win. However,  they did not withdraw, as Rabin is doing today.    The noticeable fact is that the two racial states, Israel  and  South Africa, were founded in 1948.    Also, in both cases peace negotiations based on change  started in 1992.    The difference is the regression, through massacres, in  Palestine and the progress, despite problems, in South Africa.    The second fact in the unseen, intangible, and invisible  formula is that when Israel accepts or shows readiness to accept  a part of the land under a just peace, it should do so on the  condition that the Palestinians regain their rights and land,  topped by Jerusalem.    This condition is binding, not only to Israel, but even to  those who have competed to sign secret agreements with Israel,  be they security or cooperation agreements.    The region and its people have accepted peace as a condition  for cooperation -- a just, fair, and equitable peace.    Anything less than this is rejected and unimplementable; no  one can impose it on them.    Therefore, the real calculations of the superpowers do not  rely on material and military relations. In actual fact, they  rely on general popular acceptance by all the countries and  peoples in the region. This is the effective and decisive  factor. Anything less than this, is a fancy flitting through  the minds of amateurs.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Markets: Risks of joining the gold rush - Serious Money THE TOP seven performing unit trusts in July were gold funds and over the past year, an investor in Mercury Gold &amp; General could have trebled his money. Even Waverley Australasian Gold, which for a long time propped up the unit trust performance tables, gave investors an 122.6 per cent return over the year to August. If you spotted the gold rally a year, or even six months, ago, congratulations. But the true nature of the gold market was illustrated this week when the bullion price suddenly plummeted. Having reached Dollars 409 per ounce on Monday, the metal touched Dollars 372 at one point on Thursday. It is easy to be blinded by science with talk of the Chinese enthusiasm for gold, its 'safe haven' status in times of turbulence, such as the ERM crisis and the like. The fact is that gold is just a commodity, and a commodity where there is the equivalent of 10 years' demand stored away in government and central bank vaults. A world gold council report, published on Thursday, showed that there was a significant slackening of demand in the Middle Eastern and Indian markets during the second quarter of this year. However, it was not that report, but rumours that the Chinese central bank was offloading gold, which helped provoke Thursday's price fall. Prices are still well above the Dollars 330 per ounce level, where they stood at the start of the current rally. The market had been dead for so long that it was almost the ultimate contrarian play; combine that with the reputation of the world's current favourite financial guru, George Soros, and the desire of some US investment funds to find fresh homes for their money and you had the recipe for a bull run. But a rally built on sentiment can falter on the same emotion. It is really difficult to see how gold can be a sensible home for the long-term money of private investors. The metal itself pays no income and even though gold mining shares offer a dividend yield, many of those are concentrated in the politically sensitive market of South Africa. Even if you were worried about inflation (and believe, in the face of little recent evidence, that gold is a reliable hedge against it), there are better vehicles for protecting yourself, such as index-linked gilts. Over the last 10 years, the best-performing gold unit trust has returned just 85 per cent, compared with 139.7 per cent from the worst-performing UK equity income fund. So by all means punt on the gold market, if you are sufficiently wealthy, and can afford to risk 5 per cent of your portfolio; there may well be further profitable short term gyrations in the market. But for long term, serious investments stick to bonds and equities. ***** EVERY TIME journalists highlight the benefits of fee-based, rather than commission- related, advice, we receive aggrieved letters from advisers who feel we are maligning the standards of their profession. Surveys such as the one recently conducted by the consumer magazine, Which?, show why journalists stick to their guns. Which? sent researchers to 30 banks, building societies, insurance company representatives and independent financial advisers to ask for advice on investing a Pounds 25,000 lump sum redundancy payment. The researchers were asked to make it clear that they had no job lined up, and no source of income other than the Pounds 25,000 lump sum. According to Which?, and it is hard to disagree, the best advice for such a person is to put the money into a savings account until their employment situation is clear. After all, they may well need to live off their capital. Even so, half of those approached recommended that the researchers invest anything from Pounds 3,000 to the full Pounds 25,000 in an investment bond. This buys units in a fund run by an insurance company and could easily fall in value, if the stock market declines. Furthermore, there is a charge of 5 per cent which is likely to result in a loss for investors if they withdraw their money early. So why were investment bonds so widely recommended? Which? argues that the reason was commission - advisers can earn around Pounds 1,400 for selling a Pounds 25,000 bond. If they recommend putting money into a building society account, they will probably get nothing. Two-thirds of the advisers did not ask what risk the client was prepared to take and nine failed to say whether they were tied to one specific insurer or were independent. Some advisers, says Which?, made statements which were factually wrong or misleading such as assertions that investment bonds are tax-free or risk-free. Small samples can be misleading and I am sure that there are many very good commission-based advisers. Nevertheless, we believe that paying advisers a fee avoids many of the problems described above.

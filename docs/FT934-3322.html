			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Balladur claims partial victory in US trade talks: French prime minister turns pressure on EU Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, yesterday declared a partial victory in trade talks with the US, and said he would put any overall Gatt accord before parliament early next week in a vote that he seems confident of winning. 'We have emerged from our isolation without conceding anything essential,' he told cheering deputies from his conservative coalition. Opposition Socialists and farm union leaders complained, however, of a cave-in. Agriculture 'is no longer an obstacle' to agreement because Europe's deal with the US this week was 'satisfactory in a great deal more than half' of it, he said. His most positive statement to date on Gatt helped push the franc back through its former European exchange rate floor of FFr3.4305 to the D-Mark, which France was forced to abandon in August. Mr Balladur, however, is keeping up pressure on his European Union partners to compensate France for what it failed to get from the US. 'I hope for a Gatt agreement, but I cannot give you the certainty of one,' he told French deputies. He said the next three days, covering the EU summit starting in Brussels on Friday, 'will be decisive'. Mr Balladur rang Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, on Tuesday night and Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, yesterday morning to lobby them on French demands for tougher European protection against unfair trade and for more money to compensate farmers. Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister who also holds the key political job of secretary-general of Mr Balladur's RPR Gaullist party, warned that the EU might have to increase the farm share of its budget, a move sure to be resisted by Britain and the Netherlands. By maintaining his tough stance to the end, Mr Balladur seems likely to carry with him most of his ruling coalition which has an overwhelming majority in the National Assembly. He has virtually ensured this by making next week's vote an issue of confidence in the government. French farm unions, however, remained unconvinced by what they called yesterday 'the so-called advances' on agriculture. The CNJA young farmers' union warned its members might take to the streets again. Meanwhile, US and EU negotiators in Geneva began a series of bilateral meetings explaining details of the US-EU deal to other countries involved in the Uruguay Round of international trade talks. Gatt officials moved to finalise texts for a global trade accord that has until now been blocked by US-EU disagreements. Mr Germain Denis, who chairs the Gatt committee drawing up a global market access deal, briefed a group of less than 20 countries on a tentative final package that he hopes to table before all 116 countries in the round this morning. With a tariff-cutting market access deal close to settlement, negotiators moved on to the outstanding disputed issues - mainly efforts to open up financial services markets, and controversial US proposals enabling tax discrimination against foreign companies.

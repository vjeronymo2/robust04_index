			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Treasurer's departure prompts Keating reshuffle Australia's prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, yesterday used the departure of Mr John Dawkins as treasurer to change his cabinet for the first time since his Labor government was re-elected in March. Eleven ministers or parliamentary secretaries moved. The new cabinet has a more balanced appearance, giving prominence to some supporters of Mr Bob Hawke, the last Labor prime minister, and easing up on the rewards for previous Keating support. Mr Ralph Willis, 55, former finance minister, takes over from Mr Dawkins in a widely anticipated move. A competent if uncharismatic man, he has been an MP for more than 20 years and was treasurer briefly in 1991. 'What we want to do is to accelerate the growth (in the economy) and the job growth that comes with it, and to get the unemployment numbers down. That's our number one priority,' he said yesterday, adding: 'All that's to be done within a responsible fiscal policy and. . . we remain absolutely committed to the deficit reduction strategy.' Mr Willis will be replaced as finance minister by Mr Kim Beazley, previously responsible for employment, education and training. He was formerly finance minister in 1991. The employment portfolio passes to Mr Simon Crean, minister for primary industries and energy since mid-1991, who recently oversaw reorganisation of the wool industry. With the jobless rate in double figures, the post is likely to be a high-profile one. Mr Crean was president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in 1985-1990. The large transport and communications portfolio is being split, with communications being taken over by Mr Michael Lee, 36, a relative newcomer at ministerial level. He is adding it to his existing tourism portfolio. Mr David Beddall takes over resources, previously handled by Mr Lee, and Mr Laurie Brereton, a close associate of the prime minister, will add transport to his industrial relations responsibilities. The decision to give communications to Mr Lee and transport to Mr Brereton has surprised many pundits, who believed it would be the other way round. Communications has been extremely sensitive of late, with the government embarrassed by the near-farcical 'auction' of satellite pay-TV licences and questions about the way in which foreign investment limits have been applied in the print media. Completing the circle, Mr Bob Collins - who previously held the transport and communications portfolio, and had been heading home to Darwin on Wednesday night before being recalled to Canberra - takes over Mr Crean's job at primary industries.</p>

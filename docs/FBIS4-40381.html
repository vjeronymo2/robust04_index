			<p>BFN     [Text] First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin has  described Russia's military expenditure for 1994 as totally  unacceptable and absurd. Kokoshin took part in a nationwide  conference on the development of avionics in St. Petersburg  Wednesday.    Kokoshin told Interfax that the budget proposed by the State  Duma would not only fail to lead the defense industries out of  the standstill, but would completely ruin them.    Pointing out that Russia could still trade arms, including  warships, Kokoshin said that the problem was to find a buyer  rather than to sell the equipment at a profit.    During his stay in St. Petersburg, Kokoshin visited the  holding company Leninets, developing military electronic  products, and the dock Severnye Verfi to see the construction of  several warships.    Kokoshin is leaving for Minsk to meet Belarusian Prime  Minister Vyacheslav Kebich on June 16.</p>

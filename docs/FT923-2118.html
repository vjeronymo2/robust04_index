			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Cultures before Columbus - An ancient art with a modern feel THE quincentenary of Columbus's landfall in America has been the source of considerable soul searching in the US. While mainstream Mr and Ms America may be happy to celebrate Europe's Transatlantic leap, the original new worlders (not to mention the watchdogs of political correctness) are demanding apologies and penance for the devastation which the 'white gods' from the east wrought on the indigeous peoples they encountered. There is then a timeliness in The Art of Ancient Mexico, a fascinating and worthy celebration of the arts of the Olmecs, Mayas, Aztecs and other cultures which dominated Mesoamerica for some 3,000 years before the arrival of the Spanish. The works have been assembled from the major public collections of Mexico, judiciously supplemented by the British Museum (Museum of Mankind). It has been over 20 years since the last major exhibition of ancient Mexican art in London, and an innocent eye is in this case not a bad way to confront cultures at once so alien and yet visually accessible. By eliciting reactions we normally expect only from modern western art, Precolumbian art stoutly refuses to be approached in a narrowly archaeological or even historical mindset. A palma of Brancusi-like simplicity and elegance demands to be admired as pure form, despite its presumed religious or practical function. A Totonac sculptor carves a head in which only one half of the face is shown, the other half left undefined and emerging from its stone casing. It is all one can do to resist images of Michelangelo's bound figures in the Louvre. The Chac Mool reclining on his elbows, was so thoroughly imbibed by Moore that it seems here strangely familiar and modern. So too the Huastec sculptures and a Veracruz jaguar mask which have a futuristic primitivism that is pure Star Wars. Mexico can surely boast some of the most alien of all human art and it is no accident that Eric von Daniken found here so much fodder for his extra terrestrial dreamings. Mayan art, widely regarded as the high-point of the Precolumbian achievement, took the decorative and iconographic principles established by the Olmecs in the centuries before Christ to a new level of delicacy and refinement. Jaina ceramic figurines of a women, priests and warriors are exquisite genre studies whose faces are to be seen all over the Yucatan to this day. Jade was exploited to lavish effect in relief carvings and, most spectacularly, in human masks. The so-called 'eccentric flints', fashioned by knapping the brittle stone with extraordinary skill into bizarre forms, remain something of an enigma. Disappointingly, there is not a single piece of 'narrative style' Mayan pottery, in which the native American's show a remarkable facility for two-dimensional naturalism - an unexpected foil to the mainstream spirit of strict iconographical formalism. One surprise is the virtual silence in which the exhibition passes over the revolution currently taking place in Mayan studies from the decipherment of the Mayan hieroglyphic script. Since the script is itself a pictorial code whose understanding is intimately linked to the symbolism of Mayan art, this new insight lifts a veil from Mayan iconography too. As in Egypt, much ancient Mexican art needs to be deciphered in as precise and literal a way as writing. The more official and ceremonial pieces are interspersed with pottery and other items of everyday use, including rare wood-carvings. These are much more spontaneous and imaginative, showing the exuberance of the household or village craft tradition. In the human- and animal-shaped vessels of the Colima potters lies a virtual menagerie of local wildlife and domestic scenes - a baby, an emaciated hunchback, an acrobat - keenly observed with real sympathy and inventively adapted to shapes that can also function as vessels. The show has been laid out with a keen eye for design and lighting, with adequate wall tests including evocative quotations from ancient Mexican texts. The designers have made the most of an awkward ramp at the entrance by arranging a series of intimidating Huastec statues in sentry-like rows. The layout of material is by regions, which only partly correspond to the major cultural entities (Olmec, Maya, Aztec etc.) and cuts across both media and periods. No system is perfect but this is a half-way measure which fully serves neither an archaeological nor an artistic end. The handsome catalogue is itself no small design achievement whose superb illustrations provide much food for further thought and admiration. Alas the text - a direct translation of the Spanish version - is rather idiosyncratic in its selection of themes and suffers from the user-unfriendly focus of academics. The short bibliography ignores most of the major English-language studies. The gold which fuelled the Conquistadores ravages is conspicuoulsy absent from The Art of Mexico. This is only partly the result of the mindless orgy in which the finest handiwork of the American goldsmiths was consigned wholesale to the melting pot by the Spanish invaders. Unlike their South American contemporaries, the Classic and earlier cultures of Mesoamerica did not much value the yellow metal, importing it from the south only sparingly. The Hayward show rightly avoids any hint of gold lust, focusing instead on the myriad other artictic achievements of these most ill-fated of peoples.

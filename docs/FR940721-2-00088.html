The transaction, which is the subject of ongoing agreements among INRD, CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), and the City of Bloomington, IN, is to be consummated either by July 21, 1994, or at a later date to be agreed upon in writing among the parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The project involves INRD's relocating a portion of its Bloomington Southern Branch track and operations in Bloomington, Monroe County, IN, from the present location to a nearby track owned and operated by CSXT. The relocation of operations covers 3.05 miles on the CSXT line. INRD and CSXT propose to consolidate rail traffic over the CSXT line extending from the CSXT&hyph;INRD ``Uptown Connection'' between the CSXT line and INRD's main east-west line to the CSXT McDoel Yard connection to INRD's Southern Branch near Country Club Road. As part of the relocation INRD will remove a 1.2 mile portion of its Southern Branch track extending south from INRD's main line. INRD trains will operate over the CSXT track to reach industry located on the Southern Branch in southwestern Bloomington. INRD states that a trackage agreement is being formalized with CSXT and copies will be filed with the Commission when the agreement is completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The line relocation project will eliminate excess and duplicate railroad facilities, remove unnecessary railroad-street crossings, and furnish the City of Bloomington with a needed roadway corridor to be accomplished by the removal of INRD track. INRD asserts that service to shippers will not be affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission will exercise jurisdiction over the abandonment component of a relocation project, and require separate approval or exemption, only where the proposal involves, for example, a change in service to shippers, expansion into new territory, or a change in existing competitive situations. See, generally, Denver &amp; R.G.W.R. Co._Jt. Proj._Relocation over BN, 4 I.C.C.2d 95 (1987). The Commission has determined that line relocation projects may embrace trackage rights transactions such as the one involved here. See D.T.&amp; I.R._Trackage Rights, 363 I.C.C. 878 (1981). Under these standards, the embraced incidental trackage rights component requires no separate approval or exemption when the relocation project, as here, will not disrupt service to shippers and thus qualifies for the class exemption at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights agreement will be protected by the conditions in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate, 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on INRD's counsel: John H. Doeringer, 20180 Governors Highway, Olympia Fields, IL 60461.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Decided: July 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By the Commission, David M.

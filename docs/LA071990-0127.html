			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRASS-ROOTS ARTS COLLECTIVE TAKES HOLD;  </P> <P> HIGHLAND PARK: THE FLEDGLING GROUP IS HOUSED IN THE OLD SKATELAND BUILDING.  </P> <P> The enthusiastic crowd of 400 that showed up at an art exhibit opening in  Highland Park's old Skateland building on York Boulevard recently overwhelmed  Adolfo V. Nodal, the top arts official in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Nodal, general manager of the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, said  later that the crowd reminded him of the alternative arts movement of the  1960s, when artists joined together to set up studios and galleries on their  own.  </P> <P> "It's time we opened up this kind of place, huh?" he said to the approving  crowd of residents and artists from throughout the Los Angeles area who had  come to see "Dialogue: Prague/Los Angeles," a touring art exhibit that opened  in Highland Park on July 6.  </P> <P> "Yeah!" the people called out.  </P> <P> Nodal said in an interview that he was excited and inspired by the energy  present at the exhibit opening.  </P> <P> The presence of Nodal, who is known for wielding the arts as a tool to spur  social change, signaled to members of Highland Park's Arroyo Arts Collective  that their fledgling, grass-roots group had won the cherished commodity of  visibility.  </P> <P> "Something like this just doesn't happen in this part of town," said an elated  Diane Alexander, one of three co-founders of the collective, which sponsored  the exhibit. Featuring the work of 26 Czechoslovakian and American artists, the  exhibit also has been at the Otis/Parsons Gallery on Wilshire Boulevard and the  Santa Monica Museum of Art.  </P> <P> The exhibit's Highland Park opening marked the arts inaugural of the  7,000-square-foot former roller rink, which the collective has occupied for  about three weeks with the permission of the building's owner, Disneyland  executive Clare Graham.  </P> <P> The collective, which formed 11 months ago to try to unify and revitalize  Highland Park through the arts, was given use of the building rent-free last  month after a friend of Graham's, local artist Larry Davis, asked him about it.  </P> <P> "We feel it puts Highland Park on the map," said collective co-founder Matt  Marchand, who edits the group's newsletter. "It's the first gallery that's been  in this community in a long time."  </P> <P> But the sudden, unexpected chance to use the huge exhibition space has become  an equally huge burden for the still-developing collective, which has grown to  130 members.  </P> <P> At the group's first membership meeting last week, Alexander announced that the  collective must raise more than $18,000 by the end of the year to cover the  costs of operating the building as an exhibition space.  </P> <P> Among the costs are insurance, utilities, renovations -- such as track lighting  -- and security, she said. The group is applying for nonprofit status to make  it eligible for grant money, but in the meantime the group must rely on  membership fees and private fund raising, Alexander said. Those fees have not  been set.  </P> <P> More uncertainty emerged when Graham, senior managing art director for  Disneyland's entertainment/marketing division, said Monday that the collective  needs to show him a well-thought-out plan for the building's management and use  before he will commit it to their use.  </P> <P> Graham, a sculptor who hopes to turn the building into a personal studio in  about five years, said he is willing to let the collective use the building in  the meantime provided they show him a good plan. So far, Graham said, he has  heard little more than a plethora of disjointed ideas.  </P> <P> Marchand acknowledged that obtaining the use of such a big building was so  unexpected that collective members at first didn't know what to do with it. The  group attracted the "Dialogue: Prague/Los Angeles" exhibit by advertising the  exhibition space in its newsletter.  </P> <P> "This whole idea of a building just sort of landed on top of us, and we had to  figure out what to do," Marchand said Monday. "It's so overwhelming that we  haven't grasped the whole reality of it yet."  </P> <P> The collective's newly formed, eight-member board of directors drafted a  proposal Monday that they will present to Graham at a meeting scheduled for  Saturday. The proposal lists the organizational experience of its board of  directors and describes events the group wants to host in the building.  </P> <P> Painter Carol Colin, a member of the board, said she thinks the board's  experience in arts management will allay Graham's doubts. For example, Colin  and board member Robert Gero, who would oversee the building's day-to-day  operation, each operated successful studios downtown before moving to Highland  Park.  </P> <P> Gero said he thinks the building will allow the collective to consolidate the  pursuit of three separate goals in one place. The collective's aims are to  bring talent-filled shows and artists into Highland Park, to showcase local  talent and to offer the community an arts center for art workshops, lectures  and poetry readings.  </P> <P> "It gives us a focus point and it gives us a chance to really come together,"  said Gero, a sculptor.  </P> <P> Some of the events the collective hopes to host in the building include Art  Golf, a tournament in which local artists will design the holes; a masked  costume ball for artists; a Cajun dance fund raiser; an art auction and an  exhibition of Latino artists native to Highland Park.  </P> <P> Capitalizing on the visibility the building has given its group, the collective  is pushing ahead with plans to sponsor arts events in cultural centers  throughout the area. Two exhibits featuring Arroyo Arts Collective artists will  open elsewhere within the next three weeks, said co-founder Hendrik Stooker,  senior curator for Occidental College's art department.  </P> <P> "New Visions of the Arroyo," which opens tonight at The Art Store Gallery in  Pasadena, features 20 paintings, drawings and basket art pieces depicting five  artists' impressions of the current Arroyo Seco River basin. The baskets are  made of materials gathered in the basin, from branches to seeds, Stooker said.  </P> <P> An exhibit of abstract art, "Contemporary Abstractions," features the work of  10 local painters and sculptors and opens Aug. 5 at Occidental College.  </P> <P> The collective's most extensive project, however, will be coordinating open  tours of Highland Park art studios as part of the Los Angeles Festival in  September. For a $5 fee, people will be given maps depicting all participating  studios and describing their art, so that people can decide which studios they  wish to see, Stooker said. About 25 studios already have signed up, he said.  </P> <P> The group also hopes to co-sponsor events with established cultural centers in  the area, such as Southwest Museum, the historic Charles F. Lummis house and  garden, and Art in the Park, a city program that exhibits artwork in parks. The  collective co-sponsored an arts, crafts and book sale with Southwest Museum in  the spring at the Casa de Adobe, a replica of a Spanish residence next to the  museum.  </P> <P> Collective members say the arts colony they are trying to build in Highland  Park would be an alternative to the upscale galleries and studios downtown and  on the Westside.  </P> <P> "They don't want to be trendy," Alexander said. "They don't want to be another  Melrose or Westwood, but more or less a small, sophisticated village with  families."  </P></p>

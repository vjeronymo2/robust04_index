Utkin, leading </F> researcher at the United States and Canada Institute of the  Russian Academy of Sciences: "United States--West Europe: The  Changing Role of Germany"]    [Text] There is no doubt that the West European region, due  to its social propinquity to the United States, is important for  the realization of a policy ensuring a world order favorable for  the latter. However, Atlanticists and their imitators are  gradually losing the exclusive positions they once held in the  U.S. political arena as well as in American political science.  It would be an exaggeration to present this process as a massive  turn away from Europe, as an unequivocal rejection of solid  political, economic, and military ties with the West European  region. There is hardly any need to convince anyone how  important for the United States are NATO, OECD, GATT, and the  annual forum of the seven most developed countries. But it is  equally important to point out the significant changes being  observed in the U.S. ruling elite in terms of the vision of the  American place in the future world. In the past, the  pro-Atlantic strategists saw it in the creation of a "North  Atlantic Community" (the blueprint for which was drafted by J.  Kennedy in 1962) as the first stage of all other combinations.  Now the very issue of institutionalizing the ties with West  Europe has been practically abandoned and it is indicative that  among the variants of development for the year 2000 (and beyond)  one does not see anything that would assume some sort of North  Atlantic statehood. The people who chart the U.S. foreign policy  course see many different roads ahead, but not this one--it has  lost its attraction.    In the final analysis NATO will probably exist for some  time,  but the loss of a common goal, the asymmetry of the bloc, the  disengagement of interests will further reduce the  attractiveness to the United States of the West European region  as a global ally. Washington is facing a practical question:  With whom specifically to do business in Europe? There is a  lively debate underway in the United States as to who should be  America's main partner in Europe. There are three contenders:  Great Britain, France, and Germany. But the old "special  ally"--Great Britain--has lost economic positions, having become  somewhat marginal in the process of West European integration.  France chose to reorient itself towards Bonn, and the United  States was left with practically no choice.    It is logical in every sense that a significant number of  political scientists name Germany as a key partner. It would be  orientation towards the largest country in West Europe, a  potential future predominant force in the region. The choice is  almost certain--but just as certain are doubts that the new  Germany will be as loyal and convenient a partner as the old FRG  had been. Overall, the Americans are aware that when the  communist East Germany disappeared in October 1990, the old West  Germany, the familiar and ready-to-help ally, also disappeared.  Even the strictly pro-German researcher R. Livingston  acknowledges that increasing the FRG population by 16 million  provides grounds not only for quantitative but also qualitative  changes: It is clear that "the united Federative Republic will  inevitably be more powerful, but it is not yet clear how it will  use this might."[.sup]1[/] By all parameters (with the  exception of nuclear weapons) Germany is already perceived in  the United States as the future leader of Europe. But while the  United States is willing to count on the new Germany as its main  privileged ally in Europe, it would be somewhat premature to  speak of reciprocal willingness on the part of the Germans.    "The German corporate approach allows it, as it does Japan,  to concentrate its economic might towards achieving political  goals abroad."[.sup]2[/] The hasty recognition by Germany of  Slovenia and Croatia is a clear example of how the new, more  powerful Germany will (at least periodically) act in its own  interests, without looking not only to the opposite shore of the  Atlantic but even to neighboring Paris and London, let alone its  small neighbors. The recognition of Croatia in 1991 is seen as a  distant thunder: Germany has regained the self-confidence it  lost with the defeat of Hitler. American experts predict that  Germany will dominate East Europe (and even see in it already a  source of Russian-German conflicts). And the fact that  Chancellor Kohl already has demanded the right to use troops  outside the NATO sphere of action cannot fail to suggest certain  food for thought.    In the past the United States looked for and emphasized the  common in the political climate and mentality between Germany  and the West as a whole. Now it carefully emphasizes the  peculiarities of the largest country in West and Central Europe.  In particular, American specialists note that Germany lacks  universities that could produce an internationalist elite, as  Oxford and Cambridge do in England, the Ecoles Superieures in  France, and Tokyo University. In the opinion of the same  Livingston, with unification Germany once again assumes the  historic role of a Central European power, whose interests in  the East are no less serious than in the West. West Germany  oriented towards the Atlantic, the way we knew it during  1949-1990, was a deviation from the norm of German history.  Russian power is currently on the wane once again in East  Europe. And, as has happened more than once in the past, German  power is replacing it here."    What do Americans see in the Germanized East? Small states  of  Croatia and Hungary type already are awaiting directives from  Germany. Slovakia, acquiring independence, immediate fell into  the German orbit. The Czech Republic and Poland are in  inevitable economic captivity. Ukraine may also end up there.  Russia is looking for an economic foothold, and may find it only  in Germany.    Germany has surpassed all Western countries taken together  with respect to credits, subsidies, and credit guarantees for  the entire East Europe. The former Soviet Union alone had  received 75 billion marks by the middle of 1992. Another 30  billion marks went to other East European countries. German  investment in the East is incommensurably greater than that of  others, and the FRG's trade with the East surpasses all Western  trade taken together.    While in the European Union ((EU)) Germany tries to act  together with France, and in NATO--in coordination with the  United States, in the East Germany has a free hand. Neither do  the Americans fail to notice that the EU is becoming practically  a German domain. In 1991, despite the strain caused by  absorption of five Eastern lands, Germany accounted for 53  percent of the entire EU market (is it comparable with the U.S.  share of 6 percent?). Now Germany has a population that is twice  as large as that of its historical rivals--France and Great  Britain. The population of the united Germany grew to 80  million, and Germany's economic share in the EU has increased  from 26 to 31 percent. Kohl immediately used the factor of  Germany's increased might and began to demand that the German  language be given a status equal to that of French and English  in the EU. There is no doubt that acceptance into the EU of such  countries as Austria or the Czech Republic (now Germany's  client) will increase the proportional weight of Germany even  more.    The United States and NATO, maintains Livingston, formerly  vitally important for vulnerable West Germany, will now be  relegated to the second or third level of priority, since with  the end of the cold war Bonn has less need of an alliance with  Washington.    The situation is far from simple. On one hand, the Unites  States has sufficiently strong positions in Germany--not only  military-political, but also economic. Let us recall that direct  American investment in the German economy comprises $25 billion,  while direct German investment into the American economy  comprises $34 billion. Germany, which exports one-third of its  gross domestic product [GDP], and the United States, whose  exports have exceeded 10 percent of GDP, are becoming  increasingly more interested in a world system of free trade. On  the other hand, it is quite obvious that Germany is in no  particular rush to compete for the right of the United States'  most-favored partner in the West when it has such prospects in  the East. And this policy towards the East has deep historical  roots.    Before World War II Germany owned one-quarter of all trade  with East Europe. It is not surprising that now Germany is again  becoming a leading trade partner for Russia, Hungary, Poland,  the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Germany's positions probably  will be strongest in the Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovakia, and  the Baltics. American economists, historians, and political  scientists see in the future a Germany which will find a huge  new (old) sphere of influence all the way to St. Petersburg,  expand this sphere of influence, and the memory of old friends  across the ocean will remind it only of the old days of  humiliation. Americans note that Germany has already begun to  "play down" the importance of NATO by creating pan-European  organizations, such as the North Atlantic Cooperation Council,  which includes states of the former Warsaw Pact. Now it is  Germany that is lobbying to accept into the EU Hungary, Poland,  the Czech Republic, and Slovakia.    The objective result of Bonn's new external activities  certainly is not neutral with respect to the United States.  Germany is actually acting in its own name rather than "on  behalf of the West," as a vanguard of the union led by America.  The results of this are already affecting the European  disposition of forces. In W. Hyland's opinion, in Europe  "American influence is falling, German, rising."[.sup]3[/]  Some American specialists have no doubt that the most important  factor is Washington's nonparticipation, induced by  circumstances, in forming the new Europe.    One way or the other there is a growing conviction in the  United States that the German question not only has not been  resolved but that it is only now emerging in all its complexity.  The question is which direction German foreign policy will move  from here. Who will control Central Europe, and hence, the  entire continent?    At this point the dark forebodings and fears are entertained  predominantly by historians, political scientists, and  economists, but not the general public, which still believes in  "German loyalty." Even among those who remember the history of  the 20th century, attitudes have not yet taken final shape. Only  the results of Germany's behavior in Europe will dot all the  "i's."    Hyland reassures his compatriots regarding Germany:  "Fortunately, Bonn of the 1990's is not the Weimar of the  1920's. The unified Germany is fixed in the structure of unions  and organizations; its democracy has deeper roots; its foreign  ambitions and wishes have been fulfilled. No more of the 'knife  in the back' legend; no more of the irredentist movement."    Germany is different now, but what is it? It is already  clear  to everybody in Washington that as a result of Germany's rise a  global shift of forces has occurred. What conclusions should we  draw from this? Specialists' opinions diverge. Some want to  extract some gain for the United States by establishing special  relations with Germany; others advocate measures to nip the  geopolitical rise of Germany in the bud.    Energetic supporters of the former, "pro-German" approach  are  the aforementioned R. Livingston, E. Pond, General W. Odom, and  P. Tarnoff. They argue the need for rapprochement with Bonn.    Livingston, director of the German Research Institute at  Johns Hopkins University, believes that fears of a unified  Germany are exaggerated. It has changed in a fundamental way  during the postwar period, he says. Its foundation--West  Germany--over four decades has been "de-Prussified, Westernized,  and highly commercialized." It has moved a great distance away  from the Kaiser, Weimar, Nazi country that challenged the world  and has sublimated its nationalism in the pathos of European  build-up.    E. Pond works on the premise that in the new 1990's system,  which is currently in the process of being built, the two  critically important forces are the United States and the  European Union led by Germany. The researcher believes that NATO  has already become a "postnational" institution, and advocates  shifting the burden of the main efforts in this union to the  European half as a whole, and within that--to Germany first. The  Americans should welcome this positive self-assertion of its  "partners in leadership," she writes, urging them not to worry  (as the nervous French do) "about the subject of Germany  creating a special sphere of influence in its  region."[.sup]4[/] If not Germany, who will be able to  mobilize the immense resources of Europe to the defense of the  common interests of the West, or even the North as a whole in  its developing confrontation with the developing South?    General W. Odom, director of the Hudson Institute's Security  Issues Research Program, has no doubt that "Germany is the key.  The Atlantic house, which includes Britain, France, and some  other smaller countries, cannot ensure peace; it must include  Germany... When ties between Germany and the United States are  solid, Europe is stable. The absence of such ties leads to  war."[.sup]5[/]    Famous political scientist and futurologist P. Tarnoff also  provides arguments in favor of Washington's orientation toward  the European capital that will determine the course of history,  that is, Bonn. Washington can still delude itself for some time  regarding the dominant function of its "special relations" with  London, but this already constitutes a disengagement from  reality. For the third time in the history of the 20th century  the United States must choose among the European elite, and this  time the choice must be Germany.[.sup]6[/]    The Americans (like many before them) hope that the Germans  will not forget the good deeds: the Marshall Plan, the aid  during the Berlin blockade, and the help in the cause of German  reunification. Let us note that in its time Russia also (in  1870) counted on Bismarck's gratitude. As did Gorbachev, for  that matter. Livingston believes that by taking upon itself the  role of Western bulwark in Central and East Europe, Germany will  enable the United States to be active in the Near East, Latin  America, and the Pacific Ocean basin. America, on the other  hand, should not encroach on its partner in the latter's sphere  of influence. In the final analysis, believes R. Livingston, a  Europe reaching to the Urals is so big that it will tie up  German energy for many decades to come. The only question is  whether Germany will stop there. (The creators of Locarno also  dreamed of Germany "having its hands full" in the east.)    Many Americans count on German gratitude for the fact that  in  1989-1990 it was distant America, less burdened by European  historical experiences, that supported German reunification to a  much greater extent than its nearby European neighbors. They  also point out how many Germans have found their new homeland in  the United States: The biggest ethnic community now is German  (according to the results of the 1990 census there are 58  million persons of German descent living in the United States,  as compared to 38 million of Anglo-Saxon origin and 32 million  Irish).    Still, wary American observers note that neither World War I  nor World War II resolved the issue of accommodating Germany in  the European order of powers. Now this question arises again, in  the 1990's. Moreover, the disintegration of the Soviet Union  intensified the issue of the future place of Germany in Europe,  where it no longer has a powerful Russian counterweight.  Alarmists recall that it was a combination of the unification  and industrialization of Germany under Bismarck that caused  World War I and all subsequent misfortunes of our century. It  was then that Germany forced the countries of the world to face  a choice: agree to Germany's unprecedented power or fight it.  Then, as in 1941, the world chose the former. Now the United  States faces a similar choice.    Another side of the issue is whether Bonn will agree to have  "special relations" with Washington. American critics of the  "pro-German" course note that such a union would put the Germans  in a deliberately subordinate position. It is unlikely that they  will be willing to consciously fix their dependent status. More  likely, they will seek Western support first and foremost in the  practically dependent France.    A supporter of the latter approach--critical with respect to  Germany--L. Xiang (Yale University) notes that "latent  anti-American and anti-NATO feelings among Germans are a  tremendously important part of the outlook of both the left and  the right in Germany, although they are kept beneath the  surface. United Germany has proved to be a fertile soil for  xenophobia. There are no grounds for excessive faith in the  restraining nature of NATO... As the 'Russian threat'  disappears, there is nothing for the United States to do in  Central and East Europe, where the vacuum is being filled by  another superpower."[.sup]7[/]    And the United States has been at war with this new  superpower twice in this century.    The critics of the pro-German preoccupation feel that a  special accent on the German direction is a mistake. "Germany  did not choose to form close ties with the United States during  the postwar (after the cold war--A.U.) period. It should be  noted that Germany, while providing $6.6 billion in the course  of the Gulf War, completely refrained from participating in  combat operations, shifting all the burden onto the United  States. At the same time there are no historical or cultural  factors that would make cooperation between America and Germany  inevitable. On the contrary, many well-informed Germans are  against the presence of foreign, especially American, troops on  German soil and, as pressure along the East-West line weakens,  question the very necessity of it."[.sup]8[/]    Those representing the critics dismiss the hopes that  preserving NATO would be enough to keep Germany's development  under secure control. Currently nobody in Europe can exert  serious controlling influence on Germany. Only the United States  has the real power to do so, but its resolve is waning. Xiang  puts the question straight: "Is NATO up to the dual task of  maintaining Germany's orientation toward the West and containing  the growing German nationalism and ambitions?"    Yes, the geostrategic situation of Germany has changed  beyond  recognition in the early 1990's. For the first time over almost  half a century Germany can again concentrate on Central Europe,  which was its main sphere of interest in 1914 and 1939; on that  very historic "Mitteleurope" which was the base for Germany's  designs for world domination. As for the United States, for the  first time in half a century it is facing a question: Will a new  powerful Germany not choose leading positions in Central Europe  over a subordinate place in the West?    American political scientists, who take a stand against  encouraging such a turn by pointing out the danger of alienating  the German superpower, emphasize the weak point in the current  American policy: On one hand the United States apparently  guarantees Germany's security through NATO, but on the other  opens for it the freedom of practically uncontrolled action in  the eastern direction, where such newborn countries as the Czech  Republic, Slovakia, and Croatia are agreeable in advance to a  German protectorate. In a certain sense the situation today is  such that the United States in a way is pushing Germany to move  in eastern and southern directions instead of its previous  course towards the Atlantic peace. An increasingly greater  number of German analysts link their future and the future of  their country with the creation of a German zone of influence  aimed at turning the former Yugoslavia and the countries of the  former Warsaw Pact into grateful German clients.    Belatedly, American analysts have indeed discovered that  both  the left and the right in Germany (from their own positions,  guided by different aims and plans) have come to the conclusion  that the future of the country may lie to the east. Their former  pan-European stance has acquired a complex Central European  coloration. As a result, both of the largest parties in the FRG  currently have a special vision of European development--they  link it with the return to a zone of "historical influence."  German propagandists still energetically vouch for their  adherence to Atlantic peace, but harsh facts of modern times  tell us that German nationalism is on the rise and the false  German pan-European stance may turn out to be a cover for the  nationalistic upturn in the unified country.    How naive the old serious academic conclusions which  contended that the FRG has lost its German identity now  look.[.sup]9[/] Now, thanks to U.S. and NATO support, German  nationalism is gaining momentum utilizing respectable moral  baggage. Nationalists in England and France look like dinosaurs,  but in Germany they use the West's victory in the cold war as a  justifying premise for moving forward. Membership in NATO allows  Germany to expand its sphere of influence in the east and south  without alarming the objects of its political offensive as they  are being absorbed. For this, Germany should be grateful to the  United States. But should the United States be grateful to its  shortsighted politicians? The United States also practically  ignored the reaction of the first victims of Germany's  elevation--Great Britain and France. The Americans found  consolation in the fact that neither London nor Paris ever  figured out what to do over those months and years when Germany  was regaining the Bismarck zone of influence. Now, however, the  unified Germany has rendered practically meaningless the  Gaullist idea of preserving strategic independence. And no  matter how much the French may want now to strengthen NATO ties  (contrary to the theory and practice of Gaullism), "the bird has  flown the cage." This was pointed out as early as 1990 by the  experienced Flora Lewis--THE NEW YORK TIMES correspondent in  Paris.[.sup]10[/]    London, on the other hand, being in strained circumstances,  while holding back European integration in fact reserved the  right to turn to Washington so that, by remaining its closest  European ally (in the event of frightening turns in Europe) for  the third time in this century is finding salvation in ties with  the United States. The Americans saw clearly that London was  much more irritated by German unification than Paris, which left  everything to fate. England sort of froze, looking at America,  quietly hoping that NATO would still work as an Anglo-Saxon  brake on Germany. But London already began to see in the German  "pressing in favor of a United States of Europe (cynics talk  about a "Federal Republic of Europe") the pursuit of old  nationalist goals by new methods."[.sup]11[/]    And what about America?    Berkeley University Professor A. Wolfe predicts that  "suspicion toward communism, which has left such an imprint on  the American past, may turn into suspicion combined with envy  toward Germany and Japan as they become increasingly important  players in the world arena."[.sup]12[/]    American specialists believe that "the conflict between  American and German interests will acquire an acute form at a  time when the need will arise to resolve the problem of the  future of American arms in Germany."[.sup]13[/] It is being  noted in America that already many Germans are speaking of the  inevitable death of NATO, since it does not create conditions  for realizing their dreams of Mitteleurope. But NATO must 'die a  natural death only after it has served its purpose for German  national interests.'"[.sup]14[/]    Germany has in the future the same three options to choose  from as it has had over the preceding century and a half: 1) act  alone; 2) union with Russia; 3) union with the United States.  Twice in this century the Germans have attempted to take the  first option, and twice were defeated. At the time, union with  Russia helped Bismarck and Hitler (in 1939), but neither was  able to preserve German primacy in Europe. Germany chose union  with America only under Adenauer in 1949, and it produced as a  result the reindustrialization of Germany, its unification, the  introduction of democracy, a long period of peace, and most  importantly, Germany gaining its true place in Europe.    Still, the question remains: What will be the Germans'  current geopolitical choice? To what use will they put the  freedom of action they have gained for the first time? They have  all the old options open to them; they may consider desirable  both union with Moscow and their own way of strengthening  influence in East Europe. "A dark past and decades of foreign  military presence have reinforced deep-seated feelings,"  believes General Odom, "which in Germany may turn out to be  stronger than a cool-minded appraisal of objective interests."    Alarmed Americans say that this is precisely the time, when  many Germans are still afraid to be left without the umbrella of  NATO, to exert a decisive influence on the evolution of  Germany's foreign policy course. Fear of an unknown future may  still help the Americans. American support for Paris and London  could help rein in German ambitions. The French could become a  particularly good conduit of Western influence. Actually, Paris  does not have any choice: Otherwise, it will find itself  completely in Germany's shadow.    Is this not the time to revive the old Gaullist ideas of a  "directorate"--a multilateral governing body that would include  the United States, England, France, as well as Italy and  Germany--asks Xiang.    The weakness of this idea is in that it is odiously  undemocratic in its intent to "lure" Germany into this new  structure that would give it new opportunities. Hastily hatched  plans to find anti-German support in London and Paris have a  downside as well. Yes, American researchers admit that much  depends on West Europeans. However, if England, France, Italy,  and others begin to get nervous at the sight of the new German  might, Germany will turn to East Europe and possibly to Moscow  as well. For the United States this would be the worst-case  scenario.    Great Britain and France, however, do not have that much of  a  choice. As in 1914, they are facing the fact that the two of  them cannot contain the German colossus. The revival of German  nationalism would inevitably reverberate in London and Paris.  This time America will not have that much time to make a choice.  A traditional question: "What will be the future of Germany?" is  hanging like a sword of Damocles over the pacified Europe, which  had so many hopes for a "golden age" after the end of the cold  war. The possibilities of the Swiss, Japanese, and Swedish model  of political development of the FRG are being considered.    By now, however, such discussions look obsolete. Realism  does  not permit us to see Germany as merely "a big Switzerland."  Meanwhile, given West German money and East German ties, truly  mind-boggling prospects are opening in the east. Germany  strategic interest in the EU may wane in light of these eastern  prospects. It is hardly a matter of contention that the  emergence of German might was the most important factor of  European history of the 20th century. The point of contention is  how the Germans will use their new might this time.    Most American specialists believe that the United States  could solve the German problem only by strengthening NATO--a  sort of "straitjacket" for Germany. But merely choosing Bonn as  the most important partner actually does not resolve the problem  but rather begets new ones. New difficulties are arising for the  Americans. First, this time they are not the ones to hold the  initiative--it is in the hands of the Germans. Second, both  France and especially Great Britain find it difficult to adjust  to living in the German shadow. This factor will inevitably  affect inter-Atlantic relations. Third, Moscow "in its  misfortunes" may turn to a benevolent Germany, and this will  again bring back the feelings of 1922 and 1939. Finally, fourth,  NATO may simply disintegrate, and the Americans will have no  effective levers left to influence the common European process.  According to G. Treverton, a staff member of the New York  Council on International Relations, "nobody on either side of  the Atlantic knows how to reform American ties with Europe after  the disappearance of the Soviet threat, and whether they need to  be revised in the first place. Americans still see NATO as the  most serious defense alliance that provides the United States  with the ability to influence the development of events in  Europe. But NATO is not suitable for solving the future problem  of European security: New Yugoslavias are expected here, rather  than Soviet troops marching into the North German  plains."[.sup]15[/]    At the current stage the United States is leaving Europe in  the military sphere, but increasing pressure in the economic  one. (For instance, during the Uruguay round of GATT  negotiations, for instance, it is demanding that subsidies to  European agricultural producers be cut by 75 percent over 10  years--in a way, America demanded from Germany payment for  consent to unification). There is no doubt, however, that as the  new Europe with a new leader comes of age, relations between  "the benefactor and the grateful recipient" will change  radically.  Footnotes    [.sup]1[/] R.

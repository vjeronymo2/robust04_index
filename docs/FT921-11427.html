			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / World Bank asks western donors to support Sri Lanka THE World Bank has asked the 'Aid Sri Lanka' group of western donors to pledge Dollars 860m (Pounds 475m) - Dollars 630m for projects and the rest for balance of payments support - when they meet in Paris next week. Last year Sri Lanka received an all-time high of Dollars 1bn. The World Bank has told the government it must limit the budget deficit to 8 per cent of gross national product; 'commercialise' three state-owned banks, and the tea and rubber plantations run by two state corporations; devalue the Sri Lanka rupee; reform labour laws to facilitate retrenchment; introduce higher interest rates; and impose a stricter monetary policy. A US delegation led by Senator Larry Pressler recently spoke of Sri Lanka as 'a fine example of how to use development aid' and commended the trend towards 'privatisation and free market economies'. The US has pledged Dollars 55m and 20 per cent of the World Bank support. However, some EC countries and Canada are critical of the government's failure to negotiate a settlement of the 15-year-old Tamil separatist insurgency in the north and east. A parliamentary delegation from Canada, one of the leading critics of the government's human rights record, offered to mediate. But the offer was rejected, largely because President Ranasinghe Premadasa has come under furious attack from majority Sinhala groups openly backed by the Buddhist clergy. A 'new-right' Sinhala Defence League (SAS) has been launched by a former general secretary of the ruling United National Party, who resigned over the India-Sri Lanka 'peace accord'. The SAS insists that the Tamil 'tigers' should be militarily defeated before any concessions are made. The policy has been taken up by a new party formed by three former ministers who were sacked when their plan to impeach Mr Premadasa collapsed. While the donors and the World Bank are worried that defence spending exceeds 5 per cent of GDP, a western ambassador said the opposition made the president look 'moderate and sensible'.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Gilts After their decline of more than a full percentage point this summer, it seems nothing can stop long-gilt yields falling further. Not only has recovery got under way at home without rekindling inflation; the climate also looks unusually positive abroad. US bonds have been boosted by dwindling inflationary fears, while in Europe the Bundesbank stands determined. Its reluctance to cut its discount rate does not help short-dated European bonds, but, by damping inflationary expectations, it does maintain downward pressure on long-term yields. A sense that the UK may have beaten inflation, too, has reduced the yield premium international investors traditionally demand to hold gilts. This has happened just when long-term rates are anyway falling elsewhere. The Bank of England has further helped by restricting supply to the long end of the gilt market so that UK institutions are short of paper. In theory, there could be room for further gains if inflationary expectations are poised to settle at 3 per cent or even less. Real rates could fall as uncertainty abates, a development which would benefit index-linked as well as conventional gilts. Just the same, the fact that the market has continued to advance amid diminishing expectations of tax increases in November suggests an air of unreality. Not just in the UK, but around the industrialised world, government finances are in a mess. Bond markets are in dangerous territory when they start believing that does not matter.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Safe to slip into the lederhosen The truth about Mr John Major is slowly dawning on a fractious Conservative party. The prime minister is draped in Europe. His government has no strategy that is not European. If it succeeds in maintaining Britain's position at 'the heart of Europe', it may well survive to the end of the decade. If it fails over, say, Maastricht, it fails altogether. The flurry of questions that followed Mr Major's statement on the Lisbon summit yesterday should have demonstrated as much to the Commons. Never mind the details of his replies on this or that technical interpretation of subsidiarity. Here was a man steeped in the dealings of the European Community. 'I am not prepared to see this country sit on the sidelines,' he said - rubbing the obvious into the noses of the new puppies behind him. This is not to say that the prime minister is an enthusiastic proponent of what would, if Maastricht were ratified, be called the European Union. Clearly he is not. Quintessentially English, he would prefer as few rules as possible, although he recognises that on transnational matters, such as the establishment of the single market, transnational legislation is unavoidable. But a Europe of dominant central institutions is not attractive to the inhabitants of its offshore islands. The very idea is anathema to the Tory party. The prime minister cannot but be aware of this. That is why he talks the language he does: of moving away from the nightmare of a superstate. It is what he needs to say and, I suspect, what he believes. Europe expressed as a congeries of freely co-operating nation states is more appealing to him, as it is to all politicians of his cast of mind. If this is so, his Conservative opponents continue to ask, why did he do the deal at Maastricht? If you have to put the question you understand neither Mr Major's thought processes nor the nature of what was agreed. The deal was done because it was the best that could be negotiated at the time. Britain had to take part in the negotiations, in good faith, or be left out of the process. Outside, it would be unable to do anything at all about the plans being hatched by its continental neighbours. The essence of Britain's policy, as expressed by Mr Douglas Hurd and accepted by both Mr Major and Mr Norman Lamont, is that it is the government's job to find out what the continentals are up to and put a stop to it. If that cannot be achieved, damage limitation is the next best option. This strategy is not as effective as most Conservatives would like. For example, Maastricht undoubtedly extends the potential powers of the European Commission. Worse, from the nationalist point of view, it lays the foundations for monetary union. If everything works, the end result is to be the creation of a single bank and a single currency. Plenty of dominant continent-wide central institutions there. From the point of view of Mr Major, the answer is clear. The subsidiarity clause creates opportunities to decentralise. The structure of the new European union, which keeps defence, foreign policy and internal security separate from the Treaty of Rome, is a step away from the evolution of a superstate. I wonder if the underlying argument will ever be completely resolved. As a new book* by the pro-European Labour MP, Mr Giles Radice, reminds us, doubts about Britain's place in Europe have plagued political leaders of both major parties for half a century. In the end they all had only one option: to get in, or try to, and do deals - usually along the lines the others preferred. Lady Thatcher's weekend outburst, highly entertaining though it was, expresses nothing new. She was irritated by the Germans when she was prime minister, and, now that she is out of office, her pronouncements are more apocalyptic than ever. Yet when she was in Number 10 Downing Street the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher was just as pragmatic as Mr Major is now. She screamed and shouted, but her government bludgeoned the Single European Act through the Commons. That act gave rise to most of the recent directives from the Commission. It might as well be relabelled the Nooks &amp; Crannies (Enabling the Commission) Act. It was also Mrs Thatcher who presided when Britain joined the exchange rate mechanism. Had she not been ejected from office in November 1990 she may have refused to sign at Maastricht, but her track record suggests that she would have caved in after further argument and accepted, say, a treaty of Lisbon. It is the opinion of certain French officials that this would have been more to the centralisers' taste than the deal negotiated by Mr Major. He is now stuck with that deal. The derision that would be poured upon his head if he abandoned it at the first sign of unrest on his own backbenches would so diminish his stature that his effectiveness as prime minister would be neutralised. In any event, the danger that he will go to the Commons with a bill, only to have it rejected, is slight. He will not move unless the French vote 'yes' in their referendum in September; nor will he present the bill unless there is a clear strategy to bring the Danes on board. Even then, the whip in him is likely to prevail. He will have the vote sewn up before it is taken, or it will not be taken. All this presupposes that the opposition remains immobilised by the shock of its election defeat. It may not be. On July 18 there will be a new leader, Mr John Smith. He is likely to encourage his party to join with Conservative rebels in opposing a guillotine on debate. That would be damaging for the government. The parliamentary timetable would be upset. In the end, however, Mr Major would make it a matter of confidence and have his way. As it happens, the prime minister should have little to fear from the benches opposite him. The Liberal Democrats are the most pro-European group in the house. And, as Mr Radice points out, the next Labour leader 'has been a convinced European for more than 30 years . . .'. In theory Mr Smith may be tempted to unite his party around a call for a referendum. Today's conventional wisdom is that Labour would be deeply split by such a proposal. The prime minister can therefore safely don his lederhosen, his plumed cap, his onion-necklace and his other continental apparel when he becomes Community president tomorrow. The rebels behind him are loud, and persistent. They are not invincible. *Offshore - Britain and the European Idea. Giles Radice. Published by I B Taurus.</p>

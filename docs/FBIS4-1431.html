			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with State President F.W. de Klerk and Marike de </F> Klerk by SABC correspondent Conrad Burke at Arcadia, Pretoria --  live]    [Text] [Burke] Good morning, Mr. de Klerk. Good morning,  Mrs. de Klerk. If you could share some thoughts with us on this  historic day, really. People are buoyant here.    [F.W. de Klerk] It's a great day for South Africa. It is the  day that we have been working for, for more than five years,  really, but specifically, since I became president, I started to  work for this day. We promised this day to the people, and with  the help, through negotiation, also of others, we've achieved  what we set out to achieve. Today is the beginning, really, of  a new era. Yesterday already augured it in, but today all South  Africans are flooding to the polls. I'm glad that there is such  enthusiasm. It augurs well for the future. It will ensure that  this government of national unity will be fully representative  of all the people, and that those who boycott this election will  be clearly identified as a very small minority. It will forge,  also, all the people into the nationhood which we need to build.  I'm confident that the next five years will be five formative  years, in which South Africa will establish itself as a country,  which offers great hope to all its people.    [Burke, in Afrikaans] A word from you, Mrs. de Klerk?    [Marike de Klerk, in Afrikaans] It's a wonderful day to be  voting for the new South Africa. We hope that in the new South  Africa we will be able to maintain the values which we have  cherished up to now as very important, our cultural values, our  family values, our religious values, and that there will be room  in the new South Africa for everyone.    [Burke] Mr. De Klerk, you've always voted here at Arcadia.  Has it got a special place in your heart?    [De Klerk] Well, I'm voting as a citizen today, not  president. Everybody's vote counts exactly in the same manner  and has the same weight. This is the nearest polling booth to  where I live, to where I work. I've always voted here since I  became president and a minister. I also live near here, and I  decided not to make too big a show, and to vote where it would  be natural for me to vote, and not make a roadshow out of it.</p>

A combination of all the best features found in outdoor gliders, it  seats up to four adults, has a table for holding your drinks, the canopy shades  you from direct sunlight and it has a gentle swinging motion. Best of all, it's  easy to build when using our step-by-step plan.  </P> <P> Measuring about 94 inches high and 93 1/2 inches deep, it's more than 6 1/2  feet wide. The glider is built from fir, plywood and galvanized pipe. First,  build the frame and install the pipe, then add the seats, canopy and table (if  desired). A materials list, cutting schedule, detailed directions with photos  and diagrams will guide you.

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE'S A MOTORING CLASSIC;  </P> <P> FOR CRENSHAW CENTENARIAN, GOLD LICENSE IS A MILESTONE ON THE ROAD OF LIFE  </P> <P> Like many Angelenos, Cornelious Alphonso Murdock considers driving a metaphor  for life.  </P> <P> Murdock's road, however, has been longer than most. At 100 years old, he's  still driving.  </P> <P> On his birthday Tuesday, friends and officials of the state Department of Motor  Vehicles gathered at Murdock's Crenshaw district home to wish the retired  postal worker well as he rounded the century mark.  </P> <P> Last week, Murdock -- who wears glasses only for reading and has just recently  began considering using a hearing aid -- took the written test to renew his  right to navigate on the state's byways. He scored 95%.  </P> <P> Murdock drives infrequently now, sticking mainly to short jaunts through his  neighborhood in a 10-year-old sedan.  </P> <P> At the birthday party, the DMV officials promised Murdock a "gold" driver's  license -- which differs from a regular license only in that it is issued to a  centenarian. Murdock's is the second to be presented in California.  </P> <P> Murdock said he started driving in Los Angeles when he was 23. He first drove a  Ford truck on his job as a parcel post delivery man. Then there was an  eight-cylinder Mitchell, a Hudson, a Buick and some Chryslers.  </P> <P> He also remembers, with particular fondness, a "GM Regal underslung," circa  1915.  </P> <P> "This was my pleasure car," Murdock said. "The springs were underneath; it made  the car ride very low. It was pretty popular at the time."  </P> <P> From a motorist's vantage point, Murdock measured the changes in the city, its  roads and its people.  </P> <P> "We used to go on Sunday drives for the fun of it," he said. "We used to enjoy  life. Now Los Angeles is a madhouse. People have very little respect for one  another. Cutting in and out of traffic, everybody seems to be in a hurry. . . .  </P> <P> "It's not much of a pleasure going out for a drive any more. You use driving  now as a means of getting from one place to another. And when you get back  home, you just have to be thankful," he said.  </P> <P> But Murdock added that, through it all, he has done a good job of avoiding  life's SigAlerts.  </P> <P> "I've been driving since 1913 and I haven't had an accident yet," he said. "I  don't really have a secret for it. Maybe it's because I have a sense of  anticipation. I sort of know what the other fellow is going do, and I can avoid  mixing it up with him."  </P> <P> He has made some compensations for his age. Just last year, for instance, he  gave up driving on weekends to Las Vegas.  </P> <P> "Now, I take the bus," Murdock said.  </P></p>

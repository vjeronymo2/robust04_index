			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Susanna Reinboth: "Pilot Who Brought in </F> Amphetamines Got Six Years Imprisonment"]    [Text] The pilot who smuggled in a 4 kg package of  amphetamines was sentenced in Helsinki Circuit Court to six  years in prison. Three other men with him in the rented small  plane were given suspended prison sentences.    The 29-year-old Helsinki pilot Hannu Soppela in August 1993  brought 4 kg of amphetamines from Estonia to Helsinki's Malm  Airport. He had arranged with a couple of other men to bring in  the substance. The case involving these is still not completed.    Soppela received 1 kg of amphetamines as pay for his courier  trip, and he further distributed this amount. Some 140 grams was  confiscated from him. In connection with further investigation a  total of around 1.2 kg were seized.    The court took into account as a mitigating factor that  Soppela had cooperated with authorities in solving the case.    A 30-year-old Riihimaki pilot who had been along as a  courier  received a suspended prison sentence of two years. That pilot  denied the guilt during the entire trial, saying he did not know  that the smuggled substance was amphetamines. He claimed he  understood that they were bringing hormones from Estonia.    In the opinion of the court, the flyer understood at least  when he was in Tallinn that amphetamines were involved.  According to Soppela, he had shown the substance to the other  pilot before the trip home. He and Soppela had together planned  concealing the amphetamines in the body of the airplane.    The court gave two other men suspended prison sentences for  complicity in a felony narcotics crime. A 31-year-old Helsinki  fireman received a term of one year and nine months, and a  29-year-old Helsinki porter one year and six months.</p>

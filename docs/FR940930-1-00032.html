The proposed revisions both clarify existing law and substantively expand the scope of certain prohibitions. The proposal also includes a number of technical and structural revisions to make the rule easier to apply and use. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should be received on or before November 29, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should be submitted to the Office of the General Counsel, Legal Services Corporation, 750 First St., N.E., 11th Floor, Washington, DC 20002&hyph;4250. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Victor M.

At the July 15 meeting in Washington, DC, the Committee approved a draft to be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  as a proposed rule for public comment and agreed to extend the customary 30-day comment period to 60 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Committee recognizes that Congress is currently considering reauthorization legislation for the Corporation. Whenever Congress does pass a new LSC Act, the Corporation's regulations will be revisited and revised accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A technical correction has been made to the authority section. The reference to &sect;2996f(b)(2) is incorrect and has been replaced by reference to &sect;2996f(b)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1608.1&blank;Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No change is proposed for this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1608.2&blank;Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of ``attorney'' is based on the one found in Part 1600. It would apply to attorneys employed by a recipient as well as to PAI attorneys who are providing services to eligible clients referred by a recipient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``political'' in Part 1608 is intended to supersede the definition of ``political'' in 45 CFR Part 1600. The term applies only to restrictions in this part and needs revision to better reflect the scope of the statutory provisions implemented by this regulation. The definition is also revised from the definition in Part 1600 to delete references to ``ballot measures'' and ``publicity and propaganda.'' Part 1608 implements several statutory restrictions on a variety of electoral political activities, so it is difficult to have a definition of political activities that is true to the meaning of the specific political activities regulated in each statutory restriction. Therefore, instead of a definition that refers to specific activities such as ballot measures, a more general definition is retained and ``ballot measures'' are dealt with in the section that sets out the restrictions on those activities. In addition, the term ``publicity and propaganda'' generally refers to grassroots lobbying activities which are not directly implicated by any of this part's restrictions and are better dealt with in the Corporation's regulations on lobbying, 45 CFR Part 1612.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``legal assistance activities'' is proposed to be deleted. It has been difficult to interpret and is not based on any statutory language. The language is instead incorporated into the only provision (the proposed &sect;1608.7) that uses the phrase. Nothing in this part is intended to suggest that an employee may not use his or her own salary to make personal contributions to political organizations or campaigns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A definition of ``staff attorney'' is added and is intended to supersede the definition of ``staff attorney'' currently found in 45 CFR Part 1600. The definition is modified to clarify that a ``staff attorney'' means an attorney who is a salaried employee of a recipient and not a private attorney who has contracts with a recipient to provide part-time legal services to program clients. Section 1608.3 Attorney-client relationship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section has been moved from &sect;1608.7 in the current regulation to make it clear that all of the restrictions and prohibitions contained in Part 1608 are subject to the exception for legal representation. This section would apply to PAI attorneys when they are engaged in legal assistance activities supported by a recipient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1608.4&blank;Prohibitions Applicable to the Corporation and to Recipients <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The only change to this section is the addition of language intended to better reflect the statutory prohibition. The revision clarifies that no resources of the Corporation or of a recipient may be used for political activities or purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1608.5 Prohibitions applicable to all employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current &sect;1608.4, which applies to all Corporation and recipient employees, and most of the current &sect;1608.5, which applies to Corporation employees and staff attorneys, have been merged into &sect;1608.5 in the proposed rule. The Committee believes that the rule's prohibitions concerning the misuse of official authority and coercion should apply to all Corporation and recipient employees. Section 1608.6 Prohibition applicable to Corporation employees and to staff attorneys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), we, therefore, preliminarily conclude that our proposed action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. We invite and will consider comments on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under Section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We estimate that an average of 2.5 burden hours will be required to complete the proposed Form OP&hyph;1 and provide pertinent supplemental evidence, as compared with 4 burden hours for the application form currently used. This expected reduction in response time is attributable not only to elimination of the public need/public interest evidence requirements for non-household goods motor property applicants, as mandated by TIRRA, but also to the simplified response format and the self-contained application, supplements, and instructions. Accordingly, we anticipate that the reduced completion burden will be realized by applicants in all motor carrier industry segments, not merely those directly affected by TIRRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The annual reporting burden ascribed to the Form OP&hyph;1 in the current OMB inventory is 64,000 hours, based on an estimate of 4 burden hours per filing and 16,000 Form OP&hyph;1 filings per year at the time the estimate was submitted. We anticipate that this annual reporting burden will be reduced to approximately 42,500 hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This estimate is based on our expectation that licensing application filings will rise slightly over those recorded in fiscal year 1993 (to approximately 18,000). This projection reflects at least a short-term increased interest in obtaining motor common carrier authority due to TIRRA's elimination of individual tariff filing requirements for non-household goods motor property carriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The estimated burden hours include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The reduced reporting burden estimated here does not reflect further reductions in the Commission's overall reporting burden occasioned by the elimination of ETA filings and the significant projected reduction in TA filings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information collection requirements contained in this proposal will be submitted to OMB for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and 5 CFR Part 1320. Comments concerning the paperwork burden and burden-hour estimates in this proposal may be directed to OMB and the Commission, respectively, at: Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Attn: Ed Clark, Desk Officer, (Forms-3120&hyph;0047), Washington, DC 20503 and Interstate Commerce Commission, Forms Clearance Officer, 1201 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20423.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 49 CFR Part 1002  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Common carriers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Freedom of information, User fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 49 CFR Part 1160  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Brokers, Buses, Freight forwarders, Maritime carriers, Motor carriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 49 CFR Part 1161  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Buses, Motor carriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 49 CFR Part 1162  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Maritime carriers, Motor carriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 49 CFR Part 1163  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Motor carriers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Decided: October 5, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Phillips, and Commissioners Simmons and Morgan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Vernon A.

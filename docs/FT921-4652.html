			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Property Trust restructures Property Trust, the property investment and development company, is proposing a financial reconstruction and property sale to put the loss-making group on a sound footing. It also announced an interim loss of Pounds 6.32m following provisions on its investments. The company plans to consolidate 200 of its 1p shares into one Pounds 2 share to be reclassified as one 25p share and one deferred share of Pounds 1.75.

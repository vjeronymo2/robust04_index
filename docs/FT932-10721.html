			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Arts: Cyril Huve - Recital To his Wigmore Hall debut on Tuesday the young French pianist Cyril Huve brought not just himself but his piano as well - an 1828 Pleyel, beautifully cased, expertly restored, and a pleasure to hear in every note it produced. Chopin favoured (according to the New Grove) the 'suavity' of the contemporary best French pianos, and particularly the Pleyel. In this concert one heard why - and was led, in Huve's group of Chopin pieces, through a treasure-house of sounds utterly beguiling, intimate, many-coloured and 'personal' in character. From an ear trained by the dominance and predominance of the modern Steinway to expect a pianist's smoothly processed homogeneity of tone, reliable evenness of finger-action and limitless and near-uniform carrying-power, the first few minutes of the recital demanded mental adjustment. But once that was made - and it was, easily and quickly - constant refreshment was brought by the instrument to Chopin's lyrical lines and his figuration. The distinctness of the Pleyel's registers prevented any rigid, automatic repetitiveness in either the singing or the accompanying of Chopin melodies. Chopin as great harmonic adventurer was a proposition here eloquently argued. An instrument is in the end, of course, only as rewarding to encounter as the person who plays it. Huve made this a rewarding encounter; but I gained the impression that on another, more relaxed evening he would surely make it even more so. In the opening pieces - C minor Nocturne, B minor Scherzo, A flat Ballade - there were constant smudges and fluffs; and to add to these, in the closing Op. 28 Preludes, a number of memory-lapses. But even when rising above these, as he did for long stretches of the B flat minor Sonata, one gained no very certain intimation that for Huve the playing of a Chopin piano had afforded a powerful revelation of authentic Chopin style. Rhythm was seldom treated sufficiently freely; melodies lacked the spontaneous, singing rubato for which Chopin was unrivalled. Huve is obviously a lively, engaged, sensitive artist; he also has imaginative ideas about programming - for instance, switching at midpoint to the Wigmore modern grand for an account of James Dillon's angularly poetic Spleen (1979-80), an invigorating notion in itself and a source of teasing contrasts and historical reflections.</p>

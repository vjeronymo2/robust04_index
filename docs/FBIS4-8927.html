			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 19 April reports,  besides the Serbian attacks on Gorazde, on combat activities in  other parts of the republic:    Correspondent from Brcko Hamiz Deronjic reports that  "Dubrave, Jagodnjak, Tulumovici, Poljaci, Krajinovici,  Vitanovici, Bajici, Djukici, Kladje, and the central part of  Brcko's defense in Vranovaca and Boderiste have been the targets  of chetnik artillery today. The most intense artillery attacks,  merely a preparation for fresh infantry attacks on the defense  lines, were aimed against Boderiste and Vranovaca. With the  substantial support of tanks and artillery, chetniks in the  region of Boderiste tried twice to break through defense lines,  but were on both occasions forced to withdraw with losses in  manpower. At approximately 1300 chetniks moved in for a fierce  tank-infantry attack in the Vranovaca region, supported by  artillery and self-propelled antiaircraft artillery. After  major battles that lasted until 1420 the enemy was forced to  retreat." Deronjic then reports that "a transport helicopter"  arrived to "evacuate seriously injured enemy soldiers" after the  battle. In conclusion, he also expresses the opinion that, in  the shadow of the situation in Gorazde, "the chetniks are trying  to quickly fix the problems on the battlefield that have caused  them the biggest headaches."    Correspondent from Bihac Mirza Sadikovic reports that  "Karadzic's fascists are today attacking Buzim and the nearby  areas; they also continue to attack and attempt infantry  breakthroughs on the defense lines in this region, the 5th Corps  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's zone of responsibility."    Sadikovic further reports that "throughout the day Abdic's  paramilitary formations have been shelling the border regions in  the Cazin area at various intervals, provoking infantry clashes.  The aggressor indiscriminately shelled other defense lines in  the 5th Corps' zone of responsibility and the Headquarters of  the Croatian Defense Council, especially in the Bosanska Krupa  area of the battlefield, and opened fire with antiaircraft  artillery and heavy machine guns."    A report from the Srebrenica Press Center claims that "the  Serbian aggressor has been systematically exhausting Srebrenica.  Beside exhaustion through starvation, he is also increasing  provocations along the lines of encirclement and at the same  time concentrating manpower and military hardware on the  occupied territory of (Vlasenica), (Vratovac), and Srebrenica in  the direct vicinity of the demilitarized zone. Recently the  aggressor has been carrying out [word indistinct] propaganda  activity in Srebrenica and also stepped up surveillance of this  [words indistinct]."    An announcer-read report on the situation in Sarajevo notes  "increased concentration of manpower and arms around the town."  It is reported that "four 105 mm howitzers, two antiaircraft  guns, two self-propelled antiaircraft artillery pieces, and four  76 mm ZIS [expansion unknown] are positioned in the region of  Pavovac; two ZIS are placed behind the Lukavica barracks. All  the weapons are dug into the ground and turned [word indistinct]  in the direction of Sokolovic Kolonija and Hrasnica. The enemy  today continued with infantry arms provocations along defense  lines and in the suburbs."</p>

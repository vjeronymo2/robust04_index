			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Unidare settles early on US buy Unidare, the Dublin-based industrial group, yesterday announced it had reached agreement and completed a transaction with the former shareholders of Nasco to satisfy its obligations under the share sale and purchase agreement in respect of the deferred and performance-related consideration. Unidare bought Nasco, a US welding and safety distribution business in May last year. The settlement, which is 15 months ahead of the date provided for in the agreement, was for a total payment (excluding costs) of IPounds 7.1m (Pounds 7m) which, under the purchase formula implies operating profits at Nasco of Dollars 8.1m (Pounds 5.32m) in the year to June 1995. Half of the payment was funded with bank debt, with the balance being satis-fied from cash accumulated in Nasco since its acquisi-tion. Following this payment the total cost to Unidare of the purchase is IPounds 32m, including debt assumed. The directors said the outcome had considerable benefits for Unidare, including the elimination of uncertainty as to the potential gearing and goodwill written off in the balance sheet and removal of potential conflict of interest for the management - nine of whom shared in part of the proceeds of the deal. Following the transaction, Unidare's gearing at September 1994 is expected to be between 50 per cent and 60 per cent, with a fall to about 40 per cent by September 1995. Unidare also announced it had reached a settlement in respect of a dispute between Nasco and the US Internal Revenue Service, the effect of which would be that Nasco would incur no tax charge in the current financial year and would realise total tax savings of about Dollars 2.4m, which were not foreseen at the time of the acquisition. The shares rose 10p to close at 265p.</p>

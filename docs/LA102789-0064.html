AFRICAN MISSILE IS DENIED  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir denied a report that Israel provided technology  for a nuclear-capable missile that reportedly was test-fired in South Africa in  July. Shamir told Israel Radio there is "no truth" to the NBC News report,  which said Israel has been engaged in a partnership with South Africa to  develop nuclear missile capability. The South African government refused  comment on the report. NBC cited unidentified intelligence sources and a CIA  document in reporting that Israel provided the missile technology in return for  a continuous supply of enriched uranium.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 8 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank  approved today a loan of 200 million U.S. dollars to support  China's efforts to protect its forests and increase timber  production.    The loan will be used to "help preserve biodiversity in five  key nature reserves in China and reduce soil erosion and  flooding," the bank said in a statement.    The project, totaling 356 million dollars, is expected to  generate six billion dollars in China's domestic wood products  in 33 years, the bank said.    China is the world's third largest consumer of timber, using  300 million cubic meters a year. Burgeoning demand and limited  supply are creating a worsening imbalance.    About 500,000 hectares of forest area are lost each year in  China.    The loan will build 620,000 hectares of managed timber  plantations, set up 280,000 hectares of multiple-use forests,  strengthen biodiversity conservation, and support technology  transfer, the bank said.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs attack pit closure programme THE GOVERNMENT and British Coal were heavily criticised yesterday over the pit closures programme as a cross-party committee of MPs called for all 31 mines to stay open until there had been full consultation on the economic, industrial and social consequences for the nation and for communities. The department of trade and industry under Mr Michael Heseltine was criticised by the Commons employment committee for secrecy in talks with British Coal before the announcement, for allegedly failing to consult with the employment department and for misjudging public opinion. Mr Greville Janner, committee chairman and Labour MP for Leicester West, said British Coal had made 'monstrous mistakes not to comply with the law'. Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC's new competition commissioner, confirmed that he may give Britain the flexibility to grant subsidies to the coal industry until 1995. He stressed that negotiations had not yet begun. His comments to MEPs on Wednesday did not mean that a deal had been struck. In a further development two pit unions called off a High Court hearing after claiming British Coal had withdrawn threats to reduce redundancy payments to miners after the end of this month. Mr Janner's criticisms were rejected by Mr Neil Clark, British Coal chairman, who said it was impossible to go through the normal consultation process for pit closures - the High Court ruled that the law had been broken  -without affecting redundancy payments. The Department of Trade and Industry said it would consider the committee's report before publishing its white paper on energy, scheduled for next month. However, the focus of the white paper is the energy market, rather than the economic and social consequences of pits closures. The Commons committee of six Conservatives and five Labour MPs called on the government to take account of the full financial costs of the pit closures, including the effects on public expenditure, and to publish its findings. 'The true national costs should be taken into account especially when large-scale redundancies are to be created in a publicly owned industry such as coal.' Challenged by MPs on the report at Commons question time, however, the prime minister countered by saying the government's aim was to create 'a viable coal industry for the future'. In criticising the 'secrecy' of British Coal and the DTI in their talks before the closures announcement, the committee rejected the argument that the lack of warning benefited employees. Much more time was needed to allow communities to adjust to a change in the structure of employment, the report said. The decision to close the pits could jeopardise the employment of up to 100,000 people, with little hope of alternative jobs, but the employment minister had had 'little if any role' in the discussions prior to the closures announcement. The MPs called for special government assistance to areas with factories affected by closures but outside 'mining areas'. Letters, Page 12</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Tighter controls for factory ships The government yesterday announced measures to tighten controls on foreign fish factory ships, 'Klondykers', operating in Scottish waters. This follows the grounding of the Russian-registered Pionersk off the Shetland Islands on Monday. Klondykers will be required to apply 28 days in advance for a licence allowing them to receive fish from fishing vessels. At present they may apply retrospectively.</p>

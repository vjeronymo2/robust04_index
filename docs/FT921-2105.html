			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Japan cuts voluntary ceiling on cars to US THE Japanese government yesterday responded to mounting trade friction with Washington by sharply cutting its self-imposed ceiling on automobile exports to the US. But the move was greeted with derision by the US motor industry, with Ford chairman and chief executive Mr Harold Poling declaring that Japan had 'learned nothing' about the need to balance its trade with the US. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) lowered the ceiling from 2.3m to 1.65m vehicles for the fiscal year starting next month. Bilateral trade restraints limiting automobile exports were first agreed between the US and Japan in 1981. Japan, however, unilaterally maintained an export ceiling when the agreement lapsed. The current ceiling of 2.3m vehicles was fixed in 1985. However, the practical effect of the cut will not be that great, in that Japanese exports to the US have in any case been falling steadily - against the background of a severely depressed US new car market. Exports to the US from Japan last year are estimated at only 1.73m vehicles, compared with 1.85m in 1990. The decline, however, has been more than offset by increased local production. Japan's share of the US market has risen to more than 30 per cent. Honda said yesterday it could tap spare production capacity at its Ohio plant if demand warranted, while Nissan is bringing new facilities on stream this summer in Tennessee. It is actions such as these which prompted General Motors yesterday to decry the export cut as 'misleading'. 'It only stimulates the building of more capacity in an industry already saddled with world-wide over-capacity', said a GM spokesman. Ford's Mr Poling said it 'will not do a thing to help the trade balance and it's a voluntary limit anyway. A limit of around 1.3m or less would have shown that Japan understood the need to change its trading relationships'. Chrysler, whose chairman Mr Lee Iacocca is one of the fiercest critics of Japanese trade policies, said the ceiling should have been cut to 1m if the Japanese were serious about 'a level playing field'. Vehicles and vehicle parts account for about 75 per cent of Japan's trade surplus with the US, which rose to Dollars 43bn last year from Dollars 41bn in 1990. Mr Atsushi Kawashima, director of Miti's automobile division, said the ceiling was lowered in order to keep exports on a declining trend. With the Japanese and European markets both sluggish, Japanese makers may otherwise take advantage of the expected recovery in the US economy by boosting exports, he said. Accepting that it would be difficult for Japan to raise the ceiling again, some measure of relief should be provided to the US industry when its market starts to emerge from recession. However, in terms of the financial balance, even this could be countered by the fact that the cars Japan exports have been moving steadily 'upmarket', with higher unit values. The reduction plan announced yesterday will stoke fears that the world's free trade system is being gradually eroded by a series of managed trade deals. The European Community has recently criticised US-Japan agreements in automobile parts and semiconductors. With Japan's domestic car market also faltering for the first time in years, and exports to the US and Europe restricted, Japanese vehicle makers are under increasing pressure to find additional outlets for their products, with South America and other developing areas gaining more of their attention. Mr Kawashima said the decision was 'based on the recognition that the automobile industry is one of the industrial pillars of both Japan and the US, and that healthy development of the automobile industry in both countries is vital to advance further the good relationship between the two countries and maintain the overall free trade system'. Mr Kozo Watanabe, Miti minister, however, admitted that the decision was open to criticism on many grounds. 'We have four options - whether to maintain the ceiling at the current level, to scrap it, to cut it to the level of fiscal 1991 exports, or to reduce it below that. We've known none of them can be satisfying enough for everybody concerned.' Mr Watanabe acknowledged that the ceiling may have to be abandoned depending on the outcome of the Gatt trade negotiations, where efforts are being made to ban all 'grey area' trade controls. He argued however that the voluntary trade restraint would in the end promote free trade by giving breathing space to allow a recovery at General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler in the US. This he said would help to stem protectionism. The Japanese automobile companies yesterday greeted the new ceiling with resignation, saying it was unavoidable in the current political climate. Miti has yet to allocate quotas to individual companies. The Bush administration yesterday sent a direct plea to Japanese businesses to ease antagonism over the trade imbalance by doing more to provide equal business opportunities to US companies, AP reports from Tokyo. The US ambassador, Mr Michael Armacost, warned a gathering of senior Japanese executives tensions could grow worse if more was not done to counter Japan's surging trade surplus.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO SAVE ON TAXES WHEN YOU WORK AT HOME;  </P> <P> DEDUCTIONS: YOU MAY BE ABLE TO CONSIDER A PORTION OF YOUR UTILITIES, FIRE  INSURANCE, PROPERTY TAXES AND MORTGAGE INSURANCE AS LEGAL WRITE-OFFS.  </P> <P> Operating a full- or part-time business from your home may be more profitable  than you think. Or perhaps your employer does not furnish suitable work space  and requires you to work from your residence.  </P> <P> If you qualify, part of your home utilities, fire insurance, repairs, mortgage  interest, property taxes and even depreciation of your business area in the  home can become tax-deductible as business expense.  </P> <P> Internal Revenue Code 280A(c) allows home business tax deductions if your home  office or shop area is your principal business location and is used to meet  clients or patients. If you are an employee, your use of your home for business  must be "for the convenience of the employer."  </P> <P> However, your home business does not have to be a full-time job. But it cannot  be just a hobby or an avocation.  </P> <P> In the leading Tax Court case, a dermatologist who worked at a hospital and  managed his real estate holdings from his home was entitled to deduct some of  his home office expenses (73 TC 61).  </P> <P> But in the Moller case (553 Fed.2d 1071), a stock and bond investor was denied  "office at home" deductions because the court felt such investing was not a  business. Other examples of nonqualifying circumstances include a realty  salesperson who works at home and at an office where the broker provides a desk  and phone.  </P> <P> Employees have an especially difficult time deducting home business expenses.  Schoolteachers, for example, who bring work home, generally cannot deduct part  of their residence expenses if their school has suitable work space, since the  school is considered the teacher's primary business location.  </P> <P> But a few Tax Court decisions do allow home office deductions for teachers  whose schools do not provide quiet and safe office space.  </P> <P> When your home is your principal business location for your full- or part-time  business, or if your employer requires you to work at home, the next test  requires you to have an "exclusive business area."  </P> <P> However, this area need not be a separate room. Several Tax Court decisions  have accepted deductions for part of a room, such as a desk and file cabinets  located in a bedroom. But the business area cannot also be used for personal  use, such as a den used by the family as well as for an office.  </P> <P> When you qualify for the home business use tax deduction, a portion of your  "business area" expenses become tax deductible as business deductions. Even  renters can deduct part of their rent for the business portion of their  apartment or house.  </P> <P> Strictly business expenses such as a telephone line coming into your home  business area are deductible. Another fully deductible example would be  painting your home office or shop area.  </P> <P> The apportioned deductions can be calculated either on a square-footage basis  or by room count. To illustrate, if you have a 1,600-square-foot home and your  400-square-foot extra bedroom is used exclusively for business, then 25% of  your applicable home business expenses, such as insurance, utilities and  maintenance, become tax-deductible. In addition, you can depreciate the  "business area" of your home by using the 31.5-year straight-line commercial  depreciation rate.  </P> <P> You may even be able to deduct your automobile business mileage if you start  your business day from your office at home. In the recent Leitch decision of  the Tax Court (TC Memo 1989-549), auto travel expenses were held to be  deductible for a building inspector whose home office was the "focal point" of  his daily business activities.  </P> <P> The 1986 Tax Reform Act imposed limits on home office deductions. The maximum  deduction is the net income earned from the home business activity. Employees  required to use their home for business can deduct qualified business expenses  that exceed 2% of their adjusted gross income.  </P> <P> For example, if you earned $10,000 net income from your home business activity,  then your maximum home business deductions would be limited to $10,000, even if  you can justify a higher deduction.  </P> <P> Home business deductions cannot create a tax loss to shelter your ordinary  income from tax. But any leftover non-deductible home business losses can be  carried forward to future tax years. Consult your tax adviser for more details.  </P></p>

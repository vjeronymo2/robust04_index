			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: ORANGE BLOSSOM BALL IS 'IN' EVENT FOR ELITE  </P> <P> Just drop "The Ball" and cognoscenti know of which gala you speak.  </P> <P> Yes, the ball -- the Orange Blossom Ball that benefits the Orangewood  Children's home -- has become the glitzy night out that is de rigueur for the  county's social elite, the Board of Supervisors and a smattering of senators  and congressmen.  </P> <P> And it's a mere babe of 5. How have they done it?  </P> <P> According to William Steiner, it's been a piece of cake. "Because we have an  incredibly good cause that is recognized by the entire community," said the  director of the Orangewood Children's Foundation. "And we've had incredible  catalysts -- ball chairwomen such as Judie Argyros, Kathryn Thompson and Willa  Dean Lyon."  </P> <P> In 1985, when the ball was brand new, $68,000 was raised. In each of the next  two years, it netted $100,000. Last year, proceeds more than doubled, with a  staggering $203,000 realized.  </P> <P> "That's almost a 300% increase within four years," Steiner marvels.  </P> <P> How did it make the megajump of an additional $100,000 last year? The  underwriting party staged at Willa Dean and Gen. William Lyon's mansion made  the whopping difference. One month before the ball, Orangewood supporters  shared a regal night out with cocktails served up in the Lyons' automobile  museum and dinner served up under the stars.  </P> <P> Afterward, a laid-back auction was conducted with supporters bidding on chances  to pay individual ball costs.  </P> <P> The good news: On May 6, supporters will gather again at the Lyons' to bid on  the ball's underwriting expenses.  </P> <P> The bad/good news: Even without an invitation in the mail, the June 10 gala at  the Irvine Hilton and Towers is a sellout.  </P> <P> A Yankee Doodle Dandy: She likes to play the celebrity down, keep a very low  profile. But Theresa Cagney Morrison, niece of actor James Cagney, has begun to  take some baby steps on the local social circuit.  </P> <P> Recently, the Newport Beach resident was spotted at a Roundtable West event at  the Balboa Bay Club. And only last week she was among the dressed-to-the-nines  crowd at a fashion show in Irvine staged by the Sophisticates, a support group  for the Assessment and Treatment Services Center.  </P> <P> Corner her for a second, and she'll share a memory or two of her famous uncle.  "I spent several summers at Martha's Vineyard with him -- from 1965 into the  '80s. He was a caring person -- about the environment and about people.  Actually, he was one of the first crusaders for the preservation of the  environment."  </P> <P> The supremely polished superstar came from a hungry background, Morrison said.  "His parents died early. So the children (Cagney, his three brothers and  Theresa's mother, Jean) had to really pull together as a family."  </P> <P> That hunger was something Cagney never forgot and something his niece is  helping to assuage among the poor in Orange County. She serves on the board of  directors of the Food Distribution Center in Santa Ana. And yes, her uncle's  deprived childhood is one of her reasons for becoming involved.  </P> <P> Thanks for the memory, Ruth: Few will forget Shirley Temple's visit to Orange  County last November when she appeared at the Irvine Marriott to sign copies of  her autobiography, "Child Star." The Thanksgiving-themed event -- attended by a  galaxy of Temple's co-stars -- was the highlight of the holiday social season.  </P> <P> But the benefit for the American Cinema Awards Foundation might not have been  so memorable if it hadn't been for comedian Milton Berle's wife, Ruth, who died  of cancer last week at the age of 67.  </P> <P> Learning that the gala was so oversold that committee members planned to divide  the crowd into two rooms at the Newporter Resort, Ruth flipped. She said:  "Noooooooo way!" according to John Crean of Newport Beach, co-host of the event  with his wife, Donna.  </P> <P> Ruth knew a house divided would rob the starry night of its magic. After all,  guests had signed up to hang out next to the stars, to break bread right beside  them in one glittering ballroom. And besides, how could her dear Uncle Miltie  be expected to run back and forth, telling gags in one room and repeating them  in another?  </P> <P> "She insisted we move the event so we could all be together," John Crean said.  </P> <P> It wasn't easy. Hundreds of "we've moved" notices had to be hustled together  and mailed, and arrangements had to be canceled and then made again.  </P> <P> But it was worth it. The star-struck crowd absolutely wallowed in 5 hours of  sublime togetherness. And they departed with stacks of signed books in their  arms and thanks-for-the-memory smiles on their faces.  </P> <P> Thanks for the memory, Ruth.  </P></p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): Regular payments, and no shocks - They are likely to suit people in retirement and basic-rate taxpayers / Fixed interest 2: Guaranteed Income Bonds GUARANTEED IS a comforting, if unexciting, word well suited to describing the nature of guaranteed income bonds (Gibs). The comfort derives from knowing that your income is fixed, and that there will be none of the surprises (or shocks) which equity investments or variable interest rates can produce. Most guaranteed income bonds are offered by smaller life companies. Your money is invested with the company for a fixed period, and in return you are paid a guaranteed rate of interest. The best rates tend to be on bonds paying out interest yearly, but some Gibs pay at monthly, quarterly and twice-yearly intervals. The rate paid depends on the amount invested and the length of time the capital is to be tied up, usually one to five years. As with all fixed-rate products, the attractions of Gibs depends on your view of where interest rates are going. They will be most attractive at a time when interest rates look as if they are about to fall, enabling you to lock into a higher rate. The lower table shows the difference in the best rates on offer over yearly intervals to the month of June, over the past five years. Someone who locked into 8 per cent for a three-year bond in 1988 will have done particularly badly; but unless interest rates rise substantially, an investor who bought a five-year bond in 1990, at 10.5 per cent interest, looks as if he will have made a shrewd investment. Gibs hold out the most appeal to people who are looking to fix their income, such as those in retirement, and are good for basic-rate taxpayers. Although they tend to be issued by the smaller life companies, they are regarded as safe investments. As long as the life company is a member of Lautro, the regulatory organisation for the life industry, up to 90 per cent of the investment will be covered under the Policyholders Protection Act. Their closest rivals, in terms of fixed-rate investment, are gilts; but according to Robin Bloor, of Chase de Vere, the independent financial advisers who specialise in Gibs, for basic rate taxpayers, 'the net return on Gibs is always better than on gilts held to redemption'. This is because most people who buy gilts lose out on the capital gains that can be made by knowing when to buy and sell or when to hold them to redemption instead. In addition, the insurance companies which issue Gibs have tax advantages which they pass on to investors in the rate of interest paid. Gibs are unsuitable for non-taxpayers, because basic rate tax is deducted at source and cannot be reclaimed. A non-taxpayer seeking a fixed income will be better off buying Capital Bonds from National Savings which, though subject to tax, pay interest gross. (Series D is paying 10.75 per cent per annum on maturity if held for the full five year term.) At any one time, the different life companies offer a variety of rates, so it is important to shop around for the best. These are tracked regularly by Baronworth, based at Ilford, Essex, and Chase De Vere, in London. The table above shows the best rates recently on offer. These are below the best bank and building society rates, with which Gibs are often compared, but deposits with banks and building societies produce variable income. However, Gibs have an advantage over banks and building societies, because the interest on Gibs is not grossed up for tax purposes. Your tax assessment is based on gross income, but since the GIB is calculated on the quoted (net) rate, your income for tax purposes will be lower with a Gib investment than that from a bank or building society. Robert Jackson, of Baronworth, says this is one way in which higher-rate tax payers can show reduced income. Most higher-rate taxpayers looking for a fixed return will more naturally be drawn to National Savings certificates, on which they pay no income and capital gains tax; but they could turn to Gibs once they have the maximum NS holdings. Gibs have a further advantage as a tax-planning tool for the higher-rate taxpayer, because the bond defers higher rate tax liability until the end of the term. If you are a higher-rate taxpayer and know that you will fall into the lower rate band, Gibs can, through judicious timing, enable you to avoid paying the higher rate tax. A higher-rate taxpayer due to retire in, say, three years time, can buy Gibs due to mature in four and five years time when his income falls into the lower rate tax band, thereby avoiding paying the higher rate tax. Most Gibs are bought by older people looking for a known, secured return; but Mr Bloor warns that care must be taken not to fall into the age allowance trap. The age allowance is given to people over the age of 65, and is not payable to those whose income exceeds Pounds 15,710 in the current tax year. Your tax liability with a Gib is delayed until the end of the term of the bond, when you will be assessed on five years' worth of income. If you are near the age allowance threshold in the year when the bond matures, you could see your age allowance eroded as a result of the sudden increase in income. Careful planning will be needed to avoid this happening. A series of bonds, maturing in different years, can be taken out to avoid a lot of income falling in one year. Investors taking out Gibs must be sure that they will not need their capital until the bond matures. Some insurance companies will not return the investment, and the majority that do impose steep penalties.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------             BEST GUARANTEED INCOME BOND RATES (ANNUAL INCOME)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 Net int                                                      Deposit       rate Company                                             (Pounds)        (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1-year    Acuma                                  1,000-1,999       7.40           Consolidated Life                      2,000-4,999       8.05           CCL Assurance                         5,000-19,999       8.10           American Life                        20,000-49,999       8.25           American Life                              50,000+       8.30  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 2-year    Aegon Fin Services                     1,000-1,999       7.10           Consolidated Life                           2,000+       8.05  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 3-year    Premium Life                           1,000-1,999       7.50           Consolidated Life                     2,000-14,999       8.05           Prosperity Life                      15,000-24,999       8.25           Prosperity Life                            25,000+       8.30  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4-year    Aegon Fin Services                     1,000-1,999       7.50           Consolidated Life                           2,000+       8.15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5-year    Aegon Fin Services                     1,000-1,999       7.70           Templeton Life                        2,000-24,999       8.25           Aetna                                25,000-49,999       8.35           Aetna                                      50,000+       8.40  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Rates at July 8 Source: Baronworth Investment Services  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         LEADING GUARANTEED INCOME BOND RATES AT JUNE (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   1987      1988      1989       1990       1991 1-year            7.50      8.00     11.30      12.00       9.35 2-year            8.00      8.00     10.40      11.25       9.40 3-year            8.20      8.00     10.25      10.90       9.30 4-year            8.00      8.50      10.0      10.50       9.80 5-year            9.20      8.50      10.0      10.50       9.60  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Chase de Vere Investments  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Tax relief on government-funded schemes - Training This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. THE VAT relief available to training providers participating in government funded training programmes is to be widened under budget proposals. From April 1 supplies of all such training, including the provision of work experience, will be exempt. The Chancellor's intention is to minimise the impact of Vat on government funded training and to introduce greater uniformity in tax treatment. Training providers affected by the change will need to consider how it affects their tax status. Some may make only exempt provision, in which case they will be unable to reclaim any input tax but they will no longer need to be registered. Other training may become partially exempt, in which case providers will no longer be able to reclaim all their input tax. The changes will be made by way of the Value Added Tax (Education) Order 1993. The estimated revenue effect is an annual loss of around Pounds 25m. The Chancellor proposes to exempt from tax the value of outplacement services provided to employees. This will apply to employees made redundant yesterday or after, or to outplacement services bought from yesterday onward. The proposal is that: counselling services provided to employees who are or become redundant will be exempt from income tax; employers paying for counselling services for these employees will get a tax deduction for these payments. The intention is to improve labour market flexibility. The measure responds to widespread representations, particularly from employers' representative bodies and from employees themselves. The proposal will allow employers to provide outplacement services free of tax, whether or not the total redundancy package is worth more than Pounds 30,000. The exemption will apply for employees whose employment ends on or after 16 March, irrespective of when the counselling services are provided. It will also apply for those made redundant before 16 March where expenditure on counselling services is incurred on or after that date.</p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> RELAXED REDS RUN INTO BETTER BRAVES, LOSE, 8-6  </P> <P> The Cincinnati Reds, relaxed and on a roll, went into Atlanta Monday to play  the team with the worst record in the National League.  </P> <P> After Mariano Duncan hit a two-run home run and Glenn Braggs one with the bases  empty in the third inning, the Reds led, 5-1.  </P> <P> But Cincinnati, season-long leaders of the West, had not seen the Braves in  more than three months and found the club has changed. They found the Braves  are no longer pushovers.  </P> <P> New faces such as Dave Justice and Francisco Cabrera and some talented young  pitchers have transformed the Braves into a respectable team.  </P> <P> Justice and Cabrera had key hits as Atlanta knocked out Tom Browning, then  broke a 6-6 tie on doubles by Andres Thomas and Jeff Blauser for an 8-6  victory.  </P> <P> Relievers Mark Grant (2-2) and Jeff Parrett held the Reds scoreless on three  hits in the last six innings.  </P> <P> "You can see the change in this club since Bobby Cox took charge," said Grant,  who won for the first time since being obtained from San Diego in mid-July. "We  think we can win."  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 4, Philadelphia 1 -- Doug Drabek (18-5) pitched a four-hitter at  Pittsburgh to become the league's first 18-game winner. His fifth complete game  in his last eight starts kept the Pirates within a half-game of first place in  the East and gave him a 9-1 record since the All-Star game.  </P> <P> Drabek struck out six and -- for the third consecutive game -- did not walk a  batter. He is 4-0 in his last five starts with an earned-run average of 1.19.  Drabek is trying to become only the third Pirate 20-game winner in the last 31  years.  </P> <P> "(Pirate Manager) Jim Leyland doesn't know how lucky he is to have a guy he can  run out there every five days like Doug Drabek," Phillie Manager Nick Leyva  said. "He's outstanding. The way he's getting the breaking ball over he might  be the best pitcher in the league right now."  </P> <P> Jeff King, breaking out of a two-for-21 slump, had two doubles and drove in two  runs to give Drabek all the support he needed.  </P> <P> New York 9, St. Louis 3 -- The Cardinal hitters didn't bother Dwight Gooden at  St. Louis, but the 96-degree weather did.  </P> <P> Gooden (15-6) gave up six hits in seven innings to earn his 12th victory in his  last 13 decisions, but he was removed after throwing a couple of warm-up  pitches in the eighth.  </P> <P> "I was really happy to see (Manager) Bud (Harrelson) come out," Gooden said. "I  was beat. I feel old."  </P> <P> The Cardinals didn't think he was old. "Gooden was better than good today,"  Manager Joe Torre said. "It seemed that every time he needed it he reached back  for something extra."  </P> <P> The Mets pounded Bob Tewksbury (9-5) and two relievers for 12 hits, including a  home run and six doubles.  </P> <P> Kevin McReynolds hit his 20th home run and had a double, driving in four runs.  New leadoff hitter Tommy Herr had three hits, including two doubles. Darryl  Strawberry also had three hits, two of them doubles.  </P> <P> Montreal 3, Chicago 2 -- In his second start since surgery, Rick Sutcliffe went  six innings, giving up five hits and two runs.  </P> <P> But the Expos prevailed in 12 innings at Montreal on Andres Galarraga's with  the bases loaded. The Cubs intentionally walked .238 hitter Larry Walker to  load the bases for Galarraga.  </P> <P> San Francisco 5, San Diego 4 -- Tony Gwynn hit into a double play to end the  game at San Diego, ending the Giants' four-game losing streak and giving Kelly  Downs his first victory of the season.  </P> <P> The Padres had the tying and go-ahead runs on base when Jeff Brantley got Gwynn  to bounce to second.

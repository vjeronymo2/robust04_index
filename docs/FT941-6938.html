			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: Barbaric Branca Glenn Branca's Symphony No. 10 for massed electric guitars follows in a long tradition of barbaric New York art. As an extension of the pleasure through pain principle of sound sculpture exquisitely executed by the likes of the Velvet Underground in the 1960s, or the pleasantly numbing hypnosis of minimalists such as Reich and Riley, Branca's 'music' has found a suitably uncomfortable place in the tasteful lofts of Manhattan. In what might be described as the aural equivalent of auto-asphyxiation, the slab of sound created by the rhythmic thrashing of eight guitars and a brutal bass drum, starves the listener of melodic and harmonic oxygen on the way to its cathartic conclusion. The first movement begins and finishes, much like the other three, with an unremitting subway roar from the keyboard and the ensemble's overamplified and crappy guitars screeching overhead at speaker popping volume. By way of conducting, Branca stands with his back to the audience shaking clenched fists at the 'score'. There is a pause for restringing and the renewal of earplugs in the audience before the sonic attack resumes. At its best and most climactic, the listener has the calm feeling of being in the eye of the storm as an almost Wagnerian chorus appears from the vortex. At other times it is, as John Cage had it, fascistic and totalitarian in its intensity. The last movements were cheerlessly subtitled Final Problem and The Horror by Branca who, by the coda, was clawing at his eyes and convulsing in a kind of spastic dance. Is it any good? Yes, when it stops, to coin the old joke. Sponsor: The Contemporary Music Network, The Arts Council</p>

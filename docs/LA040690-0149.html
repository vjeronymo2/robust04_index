			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> ALCOHOL-TREATMENT TEAM TO VISIT LATVIA  </P> <P> Four alcoholism-treatment specialists from Orange County will leave Saturday on  a two-week trip to Latvia to conduct a seminar on substance abuse for Soviet  doctors.  </P> <P> The trip is designed to explain to Soviet physicians the latest American  treatment programs for female alcoholics and is one of an increasing number of  exchange programs between medical experts of the two countries.  </P> <P> "The alcohol problem (in the Soviet Union) is much larger than the one we have  here," said Karen Stockman, a director of New Directions for Women, a  nonprofit, residential treatment program in Costa Mesa. "What they're doing (in  treatment) now isn't working."  </P> <P> Stockman, along with Kay Brown, executive director of New Directions, and Costa  Mesa therapists Rita McCabe and Tom Gullett will make the trip to Riga, the  capital of the Republic of Latvia.  </P> <P> The seminar will stress family involvement in alcohol treatment and attempts to  erase the stigma often associated with substance abuse.  </P> <P> "Much of this is a new concept to them," Stockman said. The Soviets treat  alcoholism "in a more punitive sort of way than we do."  </P></p>

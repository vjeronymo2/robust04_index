			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Gaziz Aldamzharov, member of the Finance and </F> Budget Committee, leader the Socialist Party of Kazakhstan  faction, and cochairman of the Progress group, by Vasiliy  Gryaznov; place and date not given: "Parliament's First Steps  May Be Viewed Variously"]    [Text] He was born in 1947. A Kazakh. A graduate of a  technical school, institute, and the CPSU Central Committee  Academy of Social Sciences. He was a mechanical engineer of a  kolkhoz, chief engineer of a fish industry association, first  secretary of a rayon party committee, secretary and first  secretary of the Atyrau Oblast Party Committee, chairman of the  Atyrau Oblast Soviet of People's Deputies, deputy chairman of  the Committee of the Supreme Soviet for Economic Reform, Budget,  and Finances, and chairman of the Control Chamber.    In the present parliament he is a member of the Finance  and Budget Committee, leads the Socialist Party of Kazakhstan  faction, and is cochairman of the Progress group.    [Gryaznov] Gaziz Kamashevich, the first months of work of  the  new Supreme Council have passed. How may they be evaluated, in  your view?    [Aldamzharov] We spoke a great deal last year about a  professional legislative authority. And a new Supreme Council  has been elected and has begun to operate on a permanent basis.  What we were dreaming of has come to pass, it would seem: A  professional parliament has been formed.    But whether it corresponds today to our requirements or not  is another matter. And the first stage of its activity could be  viewed variously, most likely.    The start of the work of the Supreme Council has not been to  the liking of many of people, perhaps. To some extent it does  not satisfy us either. This situation may be excused, of course,  and it could be said that the new parliament is composed of new  people that demanded first and foremost the solution of all  organizational questions. And only after this, the basic  conditions for work having been created, will the Supreme  Council begin to consider the laws that society needs.    If we evaluate the situation from this viewpoint, everything  becomes understandable and acceptable.    But it has to be seen from the other side also.    [Gryaznov] It is this, other, side that is predominant in  society. The life of the majority of the population of the  republic is deteriorating by the day, processes that could have  unpredictable consequences are maturing....    [Aldamzharov] Yes, whereas earlier we said that the economy  was on the edge of the abyss, it may be shown today with figures  in hand that it is now falling into this abyss at full tilt. And  this is defined not only by the decline in production but also  by the appreciable deterioration in the living conditions of the  whole population of the republic. The minimum wage here recently  was 40 tenge, today it constitutes 100 tenge. At that time the  dollar cost 4.5 tenge, today it is 10 times dearer.    It should be mentioned immediately that such an increase in  the minimum wage is wholly unsubstantiated and has been taken  "as a rough guide." In no way does it today reflect the  subsistence level and is almost 20 times lower than the rational  consumer budget. The socioeconomic situation is further  characterized by the fact that the solution of many questions  has today simply been put in abeyance.    [Gryaznov] To what do you refer?    [Aldamzharov] Even the spring field work, say, has been  performed in less organized fashion in the present year than in  past years. The areas sown to practically all crops have  diminished.    [Gryaznov] We have somehow stopped talking about the  difficulties of the countryside, forgetting that foodstuffs and  raw material that is most important for man's life are created  here.    [Aldamzharov] Yes, we are attempting, as before, to resolve  all problems at the expense of the countryside. And are hereby  violating all the principles of economics.    Agriculture provides us with more than 50 percent of our  national income. In destroying it we are depriving ourselves of  these resources. But we are continuing this policy, wiping out  society's motivation to labor. And if people are, in fact, still  working, it is due to habit: Spring is here, the land is calling  the master, he needs to go into the field. But such patience is  not limitless.    In the first quarter of the present year the price of  agricultural products increased 17-fold, and of machinery and  equipment for the countryside, by a factor of 20.7. Mineral  fertilizer has become 23 times more expensive, motor vehicles,  25 times more expensive, and so forth. It is curious, but the  cost of agricultural products today is almost twice as high as  the selling price. In other words, whatever we produce on the  land, everything is unprofitable, nothing justifies itself. And  saying under these conditions that our agriculture has some  prospects and that the reforms being undertaken in the country  are benefiting it is simply immoral.    [Gryaznov] It is hard to imagine even to what the collapse  of  agricultural production would lead.    [Aldamzharov] Nonetheless, it continues. From 1 April of  this  year the price of energy was, as we all know, raised once again.  Gasoline has become three times more expensive, diesel fuel,  three and one-half times more expensive, and electric power, 10  times more expensive. We have calculated that for the sum total  of consumed energy alone the countryside has to give back 11  million tonnes of grain. And the machinery, mineral fertilizer,  building materials, and wages, finally? It will be good if the  year proves productive. But what if there is a drought?    As of this time agriculture is the most aggrieved sphere in  our society. We have always said that the countryside is in  essence, by nature, and according to the evolved traditions  conservative. This is so, and it is not always a bad thing. The  countryside represents our common sources. For Kazakhs  particularly. After all, our main traditions and language have  been preserved thanks to the countryside, the village.    And now no one is saying a word in its defense. The  intelligentsia should be doing so, it would seem. But it has one  foot in the country, the other, in the town, and is incapable of  expressing a steady opinion or of defending the interests of  some one social stratum.    The rural population is today suffering most of all. It has  the lowest wages, which, in addition, it does not receive for  five or six months at a time, and inadequate treatment and diet.  And the countryside is not going on strike, it still has  hope--in God, the president, and those who govern it--and  believes that concern is being displayed for it and that  tomorrow life will be better.    But the state and the government have yet to find any  solutions to the crisis situation. All eyes are turned as yet in  one direction--toward foreign credit. But they are being used  other than as intended and are not working for the future. We  are simply eating our way through them and once again making  shuttle trips to all countries and going with outstretched hand.    [Gryaznov] But let us return to agricultural production.  Judging by the Socialist Party's program, you also see the  development of private farming as a solution of the problem.    [Aldamzharov] Yes, the process of the disbandment of the  kolkhozes and sovkhozes is being introduced persistently. We  believe, however, that it should proceed in evolutionary  fashion. The traditions of collective management in our  people--both Russians and Kazakhs--go very deep.    In tsarist Russia the peasants lived as a commune, the  Kazakh  people, as one clan. And both peoples always saw the pooling of  efforts and mutual support as the salvation from adversities.  Today they are being told: Separate and thereby save yourselves  from catastrophe. This is a distortion of the truth. And we  believe that the kolkhozes and sovkhozes that are producing  successfully and providing their people with normal living  conditions should be left alone.    Our attitude toward the unprofitable farms is different. But  if they are producing what society needs, we should, like it or  not, subsidize them.    As far as private farming is concerned, there are more fine  words uttered at podiums here than there are deeds. The state  does not today have even a concept of farming. We have to think  that peasant and mortgage banks could have been created and that  the question of the possibility of the land leased by the farmer  being mortgaged and of credit being obtained on the strength of  this could have been solved in past years. People who know how  to work well on the land could have had title to it transferred  to them. Not in wholesale fashion, like much that we are doing  here today, but with profound economic calculations. These  problems will have to be tackled sooner or later, all the same.    Thus in making a general evaluation of today's state of  agriculture it has to be affirmed that this sector has no  future. But it could have. It is necessary for this that the  state know what it wants from the countryside. It is necessary  to clearly determine how much in the way of grain, milk, meat,  and other products it needs. And give out a government contract  on the strength of these quantities and pay the money in stages.  Thirty percent of the total amount in spring, say, a further 30  percent in the fall, and all the rest, at the time of the final  settlement. The result would be a kind of interest-free loan on  the strength of the future harvest. We, however, are forcing the  farmer to take out such a loan in a commercial bank at 400  percent annual interest.    Further, if the money for the government contract is not  paid  out in stages, at the end of the year the state must purchase  the products from the peasant at the price that has by this time  evolved on the market.    In addition, having received what was contracted by the  government, it should have nothing else to do with the rest of  the products: Their producer will himself determine where he  should sell them and how.    Processing industry requires serious attention on the part  of  the state. The kolkhozes and sovkhozes themselves are not in a  position to create it, earmarked credit is needed for it. And  the state must have a precise program--what kind of plants and  shops it requires, how many, and where--and attract foreign  investors on the strength of it.    A similar situation is shaping up in many sectors of  industry  also.    [Gryaznov] What, in your view, should parliament's role be  under these conditions?    [Aldamzharov] We need once again to proceed from today's  realities. At a meeting of the cabinet last fall the president  declared that we had made a mess of the anticrisis program.  Shortly after this, a national currency was introduced. In any  country a strict policy of economic support for the national  currency is devised prior to such an action. We lack such a  program. Finally, in April, the president, by edict, required  the government to draw up a program for the present year. We do  not have this either yet.    Suppose such a program appears. Adopted at such an unstable  time, it will inevitably conflict with current laws. Revisions  will have to be made to dozens of them since the program will  not work without this, for people would comply with the laws,  not the program. But the discussion and revision of legislative  instruments takes quite a long time.    It has to be observed that the government has had time to  prepare such documents. And had it been used rationally,  parliament would as of this time have gotten a great deal done.  In that case, I believe, the well-known statement of the Supreme  Council would not have seen the light of day. But there is still  no national program around which all of society could  consolidate.    Further, we should clearly recognize that formulating a  program that would satisfy absolutely everyone is impossible.  This has never been the case anywhere in the world.  Consequently, we need not only a program but also people  devising it and prepared to answer for its realization. They  would determine the appropriate tactics also.    These are indispensable conditions. They are not being  observed here.    How do we devise a program? Four or five people are involved  in this, usually. Then the document is discussed, amendments are  made, and it is approved and begins life. But the people for its  fulfillment are chosen not by the person who draws up the  program, not the prime minister, but the president, since,  according to the constitution, he is both head of state and head  of the government.    We propose adjustments to this procedure.    The president is the head of state, who stands above all  three branches of power. The head of the executive is the prime  minister devising the program and selecting for it executants  that think the same way he does. Here we would know clearly who  was responsible for what. And, in addition, the dual control--of  both the president and the prime minister--would strengthen  executive discipline.    Similar changes should affect the administration chiefs  also.  Today some of them are trying first and foremost to please the  president. And if they have done so, that's it, nothing else is  of any interest to such a chief. People could write hundreds of  complaints about him, the situation will not change. The  president himself will not check every such instance, and  persuasion is brought to bear on the person doing the checking.  Lack of responsibility to the people engenders a general lack of  responsibility. We propose, therefore, that all administrators  should be elected by the people or the councils. This would  strengthen discipline. And provision could be for the  preservation of presidential influence on the situation locally  for a structure of presidential representatives, as has been  done in Russia, for example.    Thus the formulation of a national program of a way out of  the crisis, the selection of its executants, and the  establishment of a legislative base for and the corresponding  adjustment to the political structure should, in our view, be  effected simultaneously. The Supreme Council would occupy a  fitting place in this process also.    [Gryaznov] Thank you for the interview.</p>

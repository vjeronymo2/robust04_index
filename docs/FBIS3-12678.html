These vile crimes eloquently demonstrate the extremely racist  nature of the Zionist enemy, which is hostile to all that is  humanitarian and good in this world, while it brags about  peaceful solutions.    The Hebron massacre and the bloody confrontations that  followed it in the occupied territories reaffirm our party's  unwavering stand on the illusion of peace with the usurping  enemy. They also represent further evidence of the principles  that what has been taken by force can only be retrieved by force  and that there is no final solution to the Palestinian issue  other than the liberation of all its territories from Zionist  desecration. Our party stresses that Zionists' ruses will not  deceive the Arab people. There is nothing that can make us  differentiate between the Zionist settlers' actions and the  practices of the occupation gangs. All of them were involved in  shedding Arab blood during the month of Ramadan in the Ibrahimi  Mosque and in the steadfast towns of the West Bank and the Gaza  Strip. It is logical for Rabin to attempt to depict the bloody  massacre as an action of an irresponsible individual and to ask  the Palestinians to exercise self-restraint and not stage  provocative acts against him?! However, it is shameful for the  Egyptian Foreign Ministry to issue a statement describing the  bloody massacre as part of the extremist acts that are engulfing  the world, as if it is the government's duty to look for excuses  and justifications that absolve the Zionist gangs from the  martyrs' blood. Still worse is the Egyptian Government's  determination to continue to deceive the Arabs and tame them so  as to accept the humiliating capitulation to the Zionist enemy.    These regrettable incidents have proved the weakness and  naivete of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which places the  Palestinian people firmly in the Zionist enemy's palm. They  have destroyed for good all the illusions that have been  propagated about living under the Zionist spears and among tense  and racist settlements. It is a glaring idiocy for some Arab  rulers to call on the Zionist enemy to protect the Palestinians  in the occupied territories when the occupation forces protected  the killers while they broke into the Ibrahimi Mosque and are  still firing the bullets of treachery at the Arab demonstrators  in every Palestinian village and town.    The time has come for the Arab rulers to wake up from their  slumber, stop squandering the rights of the Arab people in  Palestine, shake off their submissiveness to U.S.-Zionist  orders, and voluntarily abandon--before being forced to do  so--the suspicious propagation of plans of capitulating to  Zionist ambitions.    Our party calls on the Arab masses to declare their anger,  profess their solidarity with our kinsmen in the occupied  territories through all available means, and fully condemn  attempts to impose capitulation to Zionist ambitions. We call  on the Arab masses to boycott all forms of normalization with  the Zionist enemy. The NADP declares its full support for the  Arab people's intifadah in Palestine, which is one of the  noblest expressions of Arab rejection in an age of government  subservience to Zionist arrogance.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ REJECTS IRAN PROPOSAL TIED TO POWS  </P> <P> The Iraqi government Saturday rejected Iran's latest proposal for peace in the  Persian Gulf, declaring that the offer to swap prisoners if Iraqi troops pull  out of occupied zones along the border amounts to "human barter."  </P> <P> "The position adopted by Iran over the issue of the prisoners of war is a  position of blackmail. We refuse to be blackmailed," Iraqi Foreign Minister  Tarik Aziz told reporters.  </P> <P> The announcement appeared to end any immediate hope for a resolution to the  nine-year-old conflict and left each side again blaming the other for the  protracted deadlock in peace negotiations.  </P> <P> Iran made its latest offer last week, even as U.N. envoy Jan Eliasson was  admitting failure after a 17-day shuttle mission between Iranian and Iraqi  officials that resulted in little more than plans for more indirect talks.  </P> <P> Iran proposed a swap of about 100,000 prisoners held by the two sides -- 70,000  of them still captive in Iran more than a year after the August, 1988,  cease-fire -- if Iraq agrees to pull out of the more than 386 square miles it  occupies on the border.  </P> <P> Aziz, saying that international law requires immediate release of prisoners  without military conditions, criticized Iran for what he said was an attempt to  barter prisoners for territorial objectives.  </P> <P> "They want to use human beings as hostages to achieve political ends," he  complained at a news conference. "I am not surprised to see the Iranians do  that. They do the same things with the hostages in Lebanon."  </P> <P> Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati had called the proposal "a move of  good will and a bid to break the present artificial impasse which benefits no  one." But it was clear that his offer fell short of Iraq's longstanding demand  that Iran remove itself from the Shatt al Arab waterway, the point where the  Tigris and Euphrates rivers merge and cut a wide path into the Persian Gulf,  providing Iraq's only major access to the sea.  </P> <P> It is the Shatt al Arab that Iran and Iraq had been fighting over for years,  and Aziz affirmed Saturday that it is unlikely there will be any lasting peace  in the Persian Gulf until full sovereignty over the waterway is returned to  Iraq.  </P> <P> Though he downplayed the likelihood of resuming active hostilities along the  tense, 750-mile-long border, Aziz said the failure to conclude a peace  agreement leaves that possibility open.  </P> <P> But Iraq is not likely to make the first hostile move, he added. "After eight  years of war, Iraq would not resort to the use of force to resolve a matter  that can be resolved, and should be resolved, through peaceful means."  </P> <P> More than 200 journalists flew to Baghdad for the press conference, most of  them Egyptian reporters who had expected Iraq's response to an exodus of  Egyptian workers from Iraq, many of them complaining of poor treatment and  difficulty in getting their money.  </P> <P> More than 20,000 Egyptians have left since the beginning of October, when a new  Iraqi regulation took effect barring unskilled Arab workers from transferring  more than 10 dinars a month (about $55) out of the country.  </P> <P> Despite additional daily flights between Baghdad and Cairo to airlift the  workers home, thousands remain lined up at Baghdad's airport seeking passage  home, and tension among the workers left in Iraq is escalating.  </P> <P> According to unconfirmed eyewitness reports, four Egyptians were killed and  three were injured Friday night when a massive street celebration over Egypt's  victory in a soccer match with Algeria erupted into a near riot.  </P> <P> Two Egyptians who witnessed the disturbance said that an estimated 2,000  Egyptian workers had poured into the streets near Baghdad's Little Cairo  shortly before 7 p.m. when a truck they described as an army utility vehicle  bore down on the celebrants. They said the crowd attempted to disperse but was  unable to get out of the way in time, and the vehicle ran over three of the  workers. It stopped briefly, then moved on and struck four more people.  </P> <P> Iraqi officials have refused to confirm the report.  </P></p>

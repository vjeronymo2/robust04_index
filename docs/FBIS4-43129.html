			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, June 13 (AFP) -- The European Union  [EU] has reached "essential political agreement" to sign a  partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia, diplomats  said during a meeting of EU foreign ministers here Monday [13  June].    The agreement is scheduled to be signed by EU leaders with  Russian President Boris Yeltsin during a European summit on the  Greek island of Corfu on Friday and Saturday next week if two  last-minute hitches are overcome.    "This means that President Yeltsin should be ready to come  to  Corfu next week to sign," the chairman of the European Union's  Council of Ministers, Theodoros Pangalos, said.    Officials here said that the ministers had reached an  "essential political agreement" to wrap up the accord, but that  two hitches remained.    The Netherlands said it was still waiting for confirmation  in  writing of a Russian assurance that two Dutch banks already  licensed to operate in Russia would be freely allowed to gather  Russian clients.    And the diplomats said there might not be time to translate  the agreement into the European Union's nine official languages  and Russian by the time of the summit.    In that case, a French official said, President Yeltsin  would  probably be invited to the Corfu summit to endorse a declaration  saying that the agreement was settled and would be signed later  when the translations were complete.    The sole outstanding problem of substance concerned the  European Union's insistence that five EU banks be exempted from  a Russian law restricting their right to attract Russian clients  in Russia.    Two of the banks are Dutch. A Dutch diplomat said the  Netherlands was not satisfied with a Russian assurance at the  weekend that the exemptions would be granted. "We want it in  black and white," he said.    The partnership agreement, under negotiation for two years,  is a key part of Western attempts to bolster the Russian  economy. It offers Russia greater access to the EU market and  more political dialogue.    It also holds out the prospect of a Russia-European Union  free trade zone after 1997 if Moscow has made enough progress  towards a market economy by then.    Meanwhile, the European Union confirmed that it would sign a  similar partnership and cooperation agreement with Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk on Tuesday.    Two accords will be signed -- an overall agreement which  faces a lengthy ratification process in Russia, all EU countries  and the European Parliament, and an interim economic pact which  will come into effect immediately.    In separate but related negotiations, the European Union is  also trying to persuade Ukraine to close down the dangerous  Chernobyl nuclear power station, the site of the world's worst  civilian nuclear accident in 1986.    The European Union has pledged to help mobilise Western  countries to pay the costs of closing down the plant, and partly  finance two new nuclear power stations to replace the Chernobyl  output.    But the two sides have not yet reached agreement on the cost  of the Chernobyl closed-down, or the share of the bill to be met  by the West.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vice-President of Kazakhstan Erik Asanbayev said  that President Nursultan Nazarbayev will not attend the CIS  summit not because of "a diplomatic disease," but due to an  acute bout of Radiculitis. He said that the illness struck  during Nazarbayev's visit to Japan. "The president was  struggling, but the aggravation did not pass, therefore he is  staying in bed," Asanbayev told INTERFAX upon arrival in Moscow  on Thursday.    Asanbayev noted that he supports all economic documents  prepared for the summit, but he has some remarks concerning  drafts on the rights of ethnic minorities.    Asked an INTERFAX correspondent whether Alma-Ata [Almaty] is  embarrassed that Nazarbayev's idea of a Eurasian Union caused a  mixed reaction, Asanbayev pointed out that "in general, there  are no simple answers in the world, everybody has his own point  of view on the same phenomenon."    "We are following closely the reaction to this proposal and  at the same time trying to work on it in detail," the  vice-president said.</p>

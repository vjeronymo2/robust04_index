			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Nissan UK's claim on franchise loss rejected: Arbitrators' decision severe blow to Botnar NISSAN UK, the former British importer and distributor of Nissan vehicles, controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, has lost its claim for damages totalling several hundred million pounds against Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker. International arbitrators have ruled that Nissan Motor was justified in terminating NUK's lucrative distribution franchise at the end of 1990 and have dismissed NUK's claim for compensation. The arbitration ruling is a heavy setback for Mr Botnar, the 79-year-old chairman of both Nissan UK Holdings and Automotive Financial Group Holdings, its associated company, which is one of the largest retail motor groups in Britain. An NUK spokesman said last night: 'Our reaction is one of disbelief that the efforts of a major company like Nissan UK, that built up the franchise with great success to the benefit of Nissan over 20 years, could be plundered and the company destroyed without a penny in compensation.' The arbitration was carried out under the rules of the Japan Commercial Arbitration Association as stipulated by the 1971 distribution agreement between NUK and Nissan Motor. Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal in London ruled that the case should be handled by the JCAA despite NUK objections. A warrant, issued by the Inland Revenue at the end of January last year, is still outstanding for the arrest of Mr Botnar, who has controlled one of the most profitable privately-owned business groups in the UK with profits of Pounds 130m in the year to July 1991. Mr Botnar was abroad when the warrant was issued and now lives in Switzerland. The trial is due to begin shortly in London of two of Mr Botnar's main business associates, Mr Michael Hunt and Mr Frank Shannon, who were arrested a year ago at the same time that the warrant was issued for Mr Botnar's arrest. Mr Hunt, deputy chairman and assistant managing director of NUK, and Mr Shannon, a former NUK finance director, are charged with corporation tax fraud related to the manipulation of NUK profits. The unanimous ruling against NUK by the three international arbitrators  - two from the US and one from Japan - ends one part of the complex, long-running legal battle between Nissan Motor, Japan's second largest carmaker, and NUK, its importer/distributor since the beginning of the 1970s. NUK had built the Nissan franchise into one of the most lucrative automotive businesses in Britain, accounting consistently for around 6 per cent of the UK new car market from the mid-1970s to the end of the 1980s. Nissan Motor said the three international arbitrators had ruled that NUK had 'violated' its distribution agreement with Nissan. The main violation concerned NUK's transfer of shares in its car retailing subsidiaries to the associated company, Automotive Financial Group Holdings, without Nissan Motor's consent, and the subsequent transfer, also without consent, of a 71 per cent stake in AFGH to the Luxembourg subsidiary of Union Bank of Switzerland. The NUK spokesman said last night that the UBS transaction was 'a complete red herring' which Nissan Motor had known about 'from day one'. The arbitrators ruled that the breakdown of business relations between the Japanese carmaker and its former UK importer also justified termination of NUK's franchise agreement. 'The behaviour of NUK with respect to its relations with Nissan Motor Company, taken as a whole, constituted a compelling reason for the agreement's termination and an alternative justification for termination,' said the arbitrators. The dismissal means that Mr Botnar has lost without compensation the main substance of Nissan UK Holdings.</p>

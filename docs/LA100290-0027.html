			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> POLICE CHIEF RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Oxnard Police Chief Robert Owens has returned home from the hospital, where he  was rushed last week after his heart apparently stopped beating, officials said  Monday.  </P> <P> Owens, 59, was fitted with a permanent pacemaker Thursday, said his physician,  Dr. S.N. Charles Cho.  </P> <P> He was released from St. John's Regional Medical Center on Saturday, hospital  officials said.  </P> <P> "He is in good condition, and he's in good spirits," Cho said.  </P> <P> Owens, who joined the Oxnard Police Department more than 20 years ago, may be  able to resume his duties in one to two weeks, Cho said.  </P> <P> Owens collapsed Sept. 23 after returning from a conference. Cho said he and  cardiologists believe a cold virus had infected and inflamed Owens' heart  muscle, causing it to stop functioning correctly. CAROL WATSON  </P></p>

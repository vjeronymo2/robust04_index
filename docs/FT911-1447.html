			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Mr Angus Scrimgeour OUR REPORT last Saturday concerning Edington, the merchant banking arm of Henry Cooke, referred to 'the departure' from Edington of Mr Angus Scrimgeour, its co-founder. We are asked to point out that Mr Scrimgeour remains with Edington as non-executive deputy chairman, and to stress that he had nothing to do with the fraud on Edington referred to in the report. We regret any misunderstanding that may have arisen.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / European Elections - June 9 and 12: Red rose party blooming with confidence - Local activists astonished at the change in fortunes Mr Roy Kennedy, Labour's European campaign organiser in the east Midlands, can hardly believe his luck. Until a few months ago he and his fellow activists believed Labour had no chance of winning the redrawn constituency of Leicester in Thursday's European elections. They believed recent boundary changes had converted a safe Labour seat to an equally safe Tory one. Local Conservatives thought they had acquired a nice working majority of 60,000. Even the sitting Labour MEP, Ms Mel Read, decided to seek election in the neighbouring constituency of Nottingham, believing that she had no hope in Leicester. But this week Mr Kennedy was ebullient. 'It is becoming increasingly clear that we are going to win here,' he said, running through canvass returns in his campaign office. With less than a week to polling day Mr Kennedy's confidence is typical of Labour campaign managers and candidates nationwide. In many of the party's target seats Labour activists believe they are on the verge of victories which would have seemed unthinkable this time last year. In Cumbria, a tight Tory marginal, Labour's Mr Tony Cunningham predicted this week that he would win with a 10,000 majority. In Hertfordshire Mr Andrew Dodgson, Labour campaign manager, was yesterday confident of victory, saying there were repeated signs of Tory voters moving to the Labour camp. Even in Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes the Labour team is confident of success against Mrs Edwina Currie, the high-profile Tory candidate. Mr Janos Toth, local Labour organiser for the European elections, said: 'We are about to have the first Labour representative in this part of the world since 1979. The party has never been in a better position than this.' The optimism may be pre-election bravado. But in all these constituencies Labour activists who were cautious during the local elections are pointing to the same factors pushing the vote their way. By attacking the government on domestic issues Labour has focused the electorate's mind on unpopular Tory policies. In Milton Keynes, for example, Labour has concentrated on attacking tax rises which affect middle-class voters. In Cumbria the party has highlighted job losses in defence-related industries. Yet although Labour is certain to take a handful of seats, two factors may stop the party making the more sweeping gains needed to prove it can win the next general election. First, Labour must ensure that it can get its supporters out to vote in what has been a lacklustre election campaign. In some constituencies Tories believe the turnout on polling day may save them from defeat. Mr Paul Ellis, Tory agent in Cumbria, said: 'If we can get out just half of our people on the day, we will win.' Labour officials are also concerned that their supporters may not bother to vote because they are so confident of victory. According to one constituency agent yesterday an opinion poll showing Labour with 54 per cent of the vote was 'as much a matter of concern as congratulation'. Secondly, there is uncertainty over whether Labour can throw off the Liberal Democrat challenge where it exists. The result in Hertfordshire, where the parties are locked in a close three-way contest, will be an important test of whether Labour can withstand that pressure. Throughout the past few weeks Mr Peter Truscott, the Labour candidate, has tried to underline that he is the main challenger to the Tories. But yesterday the Liberal Democrats were not giving up hope, claiming that disaffected Tories were more likely to come over to them. In neighbouring Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes, campaigners for Mrs Currie believe that the Liberal Democrats could foil a Labour victory. One thing is clear. There are few signs of Tory party workers going out to battle with Labour. Mr Michael Cufflin, president of the Tory Euro-association in Leicester, said: 'We are finding it difficult to motivate our workers in the same way we did for the last general election.'</p>

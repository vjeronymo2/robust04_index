			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Hosokawa on tax reform at a </F> press conference from the prime minister's official residence in  Tokyo -- live]    [Text] I feel sorry that you are invited to this news  conference at such a late hour of the night.    With regard to the tax reform, the ruling parities have  today  entrusted me with the task of working out measures to handle  this issue. In this connection, I have prepared a program for  an overall reform of the taxation system as stated in the press  release that has been distributed among you, and I would like to  submit this program to the Diet.    Now, let me explain the major points of this program: First  of all, the reduction of such taxes as the income tax and  resident tax will amount to a total of 5.5 trillion yen, and  this tax cut plan will be put into effect on 1 January 1994.  Second, we will create a national welfare tax, though in only a  small amount, and abolish the consumption tax. And this plan  will be put into effect on 1 April 1997. The taxation rate will  be set at seven percent.    At the meetings of representatives of the council on  economic  issues and of leaders of both the government and ruling  coalition that were concluded just now, I obtained their  understanding that I am going to submit this program to the Diet  as a government proposal. As a result of the implementing this  program, revenue for the national finances will be reduced by 18  trillion yen in three years, In other words, the increase of  income for the household economy in the amount of 18 trillion  yen in three years will have the effect of an upturn in business.    At present, Japan is becoming an aging society at a pace  which is several times faster than in the United States or in  European countries. And it is our responsibility to build our  society into an affluent one that will never lose its vitality,  even when becoming an aging society. On New Year's Day, I  announced a vision for greeting the 21st century, and I would  like to build an affluent society with vitality by promoting  this vision. And in the course of promoting this vision, I will  take measures to ensure social security and improve our living  environment and social infrastructure. And it goes without  saying that it will take an enormous amount of expenditure to  carry out such a vlsion.    In studying the existing taxation system -- in other words,  the framework as to how our people share the burden of taxes --  it is noted that too much emphasis has been imposed on income  taxation, and too much of a burden has been imposed on those who  are in the prime of life. This fact has been pointed out  frequently, and if such a situation were left as it is, more and  more of a burden would be imposed on those who are in the prime  of life, and as a result, they are bound to lose vitality. And  I have been repeating that this [current] system will certainly  result in such a situation. To support the aging society, we  must somehow reduce the burden imposed on those who are in the  prime of life. In other words, I feel that we will have to  reduce taxation on incomes but raise the rate of taxation on  consumption so as to work out a framework based on all the  people sharing the cost of supporting the aging population.  Since we will be asked to take responsibility for the future, I  believe that when viewed from the standpoints that I have just  stated, we should never leave the existing taxation system as it  is now.    And since I delivered my policy speech to the Diet, I have  persistently stated at the Diet sessions held so far that it Is  necessary to promote an overall tax reform based on the Tax  Commission's recommendations so that a system of well-balanced  taxation an incomes, assets, and consumption can be worked out.    With regard to the issuance of deficit-covering bonds, for  which no sources of repayment can be secured, I have repeatedly  stated that it must be handled with the greatest caution. I  have made such remarks repeatedly because I feel that our future  generations, who will support the aging society, should not be  asked to pay for this burden. At the same time, it goes without  saying that the top priority task for the cabinet is to  eliminate an idea that future prospects for the economy still  remain opaque, and also to ensure that economy will recover in  fiscal 1994.    Based on these views, I have just obtained an understanding  at the meeting of representatives of the council on economic  issues and of leaders of the government and ruling coalition  that the government will submit the program, a copy of which has  been distributed among you, to the Diet as an official program.  And I would also like to seek the understanding of all our  people.    This Is the report I wanted to make to you.</p>

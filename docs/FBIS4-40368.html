			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS--The acting prosecutor general  Alexey Ilyushenko has lodged an appeal with the State Duma,  asking to deprive the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy of his parliamentary immunity.    The request was made in connection with the fact that the  Russian prosecutor's general office believes that Zhirinovskiy's  book entitled "The Last Breakthrough to the South" gives grounds  for instituting criminal proceedings against Zhirinovskiy. This  was announced by the chairman of the State Duma, Ivan Rybkin, at  its session today.    The Duma Council is expected to look into the appeal on  Thursday.</p>

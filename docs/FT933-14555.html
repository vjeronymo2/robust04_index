			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / World Trade News: US-Mexico push for border funds THE US and Mexico will seek to raise Dollars 15bn-Dollars 20bn from the private sector for investment in roads, housing, energy generation, construction and environmental projects along their 2,000-mile border, Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, said yesterday, Nancy Dunne reports from Washington. Five members of each country's cabinet are to sell the border's economic future, at a conference at San Antonio, Texas, tomorrow and Friday. The idea is 'to do deals' at a meeting of public officials, investment bankers and engineering and construction companies, and this came from Mr Brown. He then quickly won the enthusiastic backing of his Mexican counterpart, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta. 'Too many people have looked on these infrastructure efforts as a drain on tax revenue,' said Mr Brown. 'We're trying to demonstrate that it is the private sector we are looking to, that these are projects which make sense and ought to be able to generate financing.' Mr Brown, a successful former chairman of the Democratic party in the US, is now pushing the old Republican party notion of 'a public-private partnership'. This a particularly attractive to the two countries' cash-strapped governments, looking for ways to create jobs, and to a private sector with much to gain from the investments.</p>

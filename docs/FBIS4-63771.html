			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vitaliy </F> Makarchev and UKRINFORM correspondent Aleksey Trotsenko]    [Text] Kiev, 24 May -- The domestic political situation in  the Ukraine and a number of international problems of interest  to both sides were at the center of attention during talks that  took place here today between the Ukrainian and British foreign  ministers. Douglas Hurd, head of the British Foreign Office, is  in Kiev on a one-day official visit.    Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko described the  atmosphere at the meeting as constructive and open. Answering a  question about the situation in the Crimea following the  adoption of a new constitution by the Crimean parliament, he  said his position on this has been set out in a letter to the UN  secretary general. The decision of the Crimean parliament is  illegal and contradicts the Ukrainian Constitution, Zlenko  stressed.    For his own part, Hurd said Great Britain supports the  Ukraine's integrity and sovereignty of its present borders and  he hopes the dispute between Kiev and the Simferopol authorities  will be resolved "by peaceful means and without the use of  force." The British minister said he discussed this problem  with Russian leaders in Moscow this morning. He said Russian  President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  hold a similar point of view and consider that the problem must  be resolved without the use of force.    Hurd also hopes bilateral relations between Ukraine and the  European Union and NATO will develop successfully.</p>

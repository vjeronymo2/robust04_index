			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HAHN URGES MORE POOL INSPECTIONS  </P> <P> Supervisor Kenneth Hahn said Tuesday that Los Angeles County's 16,700 public  pools ought to be inspected at least once a year, even if annual pool licensing  fees have to be raised to hire more inspectors.  </P> <P> Hahn issued a press release two days after The Times reported that the county  has just eight pool inspectors -- the same number as it had 20 years ago when  there were half as many public pools.  </P> <P> Forty-one percent of the public pools in the county have not been inspected for  at least three years; almost 5,000 pools have not been inspected for at least  four years.  </P> <P> Hahn said he will introduce a motion at Tuesday's board meeting calling for  county staff to prepare a report by Oct. 16 on the situation, including  recommendations for fee increases.  </P> <P> "Unsafe conditions at any county facility cannot be tolerated and every effort  must be made to ensure public safety," Hahn said.  </P></p>

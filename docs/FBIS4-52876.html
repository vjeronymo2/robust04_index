			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- May 15 is the day of  geological prospecting in Korea.    The working people in this domain are significantly greeting  their holiday with sizable achievements.    The state has directed sustained efforts to geological  prospecting for tapping underground resources for the  development of the national economy.    According to Chu Kil-chun, vice-director of the underground  resources survey department of the Ministry of Natural Resources  Development, the deposits tapped last year were 8.7 times the  plan in coal, 1.5 times in non-ferrous metal and rare metal ores  and 1.3 times in nonmetallic minerals.    Yanggang and Chagang Provinces, northern inland areas of the  country, discovered abundant gold deposits.    Yanggang Province found out a promising coal field, which  will make it possible to meet the province's demand for coal by  itself.    A coal field of more than 130 million tons was discovered in  the depths of the existing coal mines in Anju area, South  Pyongan Province.    Meanwhile, prospecting corps have discovered boron, gypsum,  apatite, silica, zirconium and other underground resources in  different places.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- A leader of the ruling  coalition Monday urged the formation of a new joint political  alliance in the House of Representatives to support  newly-elected Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. Keigo Ouchi,  chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), said, "We  should create a strongly united grouping to support new Prime  Minister Hata."    He said he wants to see a new bloc to be established among  such parties as Hata's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Japan  New Party (JNP) and New Party Sakigake [Harbinger]. Ouchi made  the call in a meeting of DSP legislators.    Shinseito, the JNP headed by the just-resigned former Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and the four-member Kaikaku no Kai  of a parliament group in the lower house decided to join the new  bloc, named "Kaishin (Innovation)," party sources said.    However, Sakigake head Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet  secretary in the Hosokawa cabinet, rejected the scheme.    Some 130 lower house members are expected to take part in  the  new group, including splinter groups that recently left the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party, such as New Party Mirai and  the Liberal Party.</p>

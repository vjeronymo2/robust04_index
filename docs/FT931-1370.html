			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / De Klerk to crack down on violence PRESIDENT FW de Klerk told a joint sitting of South Africa's parliament in Cape Town yesterday that he would mobilise military reservists in a crackdown on what he called 'barbaric' political violence. Mr de Klerk has recently been facing a public outcry over attacks on whites by blacks, in which several people, including schoolchildren, have been killed. His ministers have raised the fear that such attacks could spark revenge violence, and spiralling inter-racial conflict. Mr de Klerk said a solution to political violence should top the agenda at multi-party democracy talks due to begin again next week. Parliament would be asked to vote on suspending the moratorium on the death penalty adopted three years ago. He favoured the death penalty for certain extreme crimes, but MPs would be allowed to vote according to their conscience. Recalling the slaughter of six black schoolchildren near Pietermaritzburg earlier this month and last Friday's killing of a mother and two children near Johannesburg, he said: 'This is barbaric and totally unacceptable in a civilised society.' Reservists would be mobilised to boost security forces manpower in an unspecified 'action plan' to stabilise troubled areas. Mr de Klerk called on the radical Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) to distance itself from guerrilla attacks by its military wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA), and said police had arrested 18 APLA members. More arrests would follow. The government would hold the PAC responsible for APLA's actions, he said, but refrained from repeating an earlier government insistence that the PAC repudiate APLA as a condition of its participation in next week's talks. Black gunmen have killed 10 whites since December in attacks on commuters, a club, a restaurant and a farm.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Key figure in France's Habash row quits MRS Georgina Dufoix, one of the key figures in the French political crisis precipitated by last week's brief hospitalisation in Paris of the Palestinian leader, Mr George Habash, yesterday surrendered to pressure from her critics and announced that she would resign from the presidency of the French Red Cross. Mr Habash's treatment last week was arranged through the French Red Cross, and yesterday Mrs Dufoix made an attempt to take the blame for the crisis. She claimed that her 'great error' was that she had not informed any of her political superiors at the Elysee Palace and the prime minister's office. 'I should have informed didn't do it, nor Hubert Vedrine (secretary general at the presidential Elysee Palace) nor anyone at the Elysee nor at the (Prime Minister's office at the) Hotel Matignon. It was a mistake.' Last week Mrs Dufoix resigned as a presidential adviser after the Habash crisis blew up. She has been a close associate of Mr Mitterrand for many years, and held junior ministerial positions in previous Socialist governments, before losing her parliamentary seat in the 1988 elections. But there was no sign yesterday that her departure, nor her virtual admission of responsibility, would succeed in calming what is turning into a serious political storm threatening the Socialist government of Mrs Edith Cresson. On the contrary, pressures for ministerial resignations, and even for a complete change of government, remained intense not only from the conservative opposition but also from leading members of the Socialist party.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Tees clean-up plan threatened Plans for one of the UK's biggest estuary clean-up projects, intended to help transform the Tees into a salmon river, are being reconsidered. This follows Du Pont's announcement that it is to close five Teesside plants acquired last year from Imperial Chemical Industries. Northumbrian Water and ICI had proposed a Pounds 100m scheme for an effluent treatment works on a disused ICI waste-disposal site to deal with sewage from 400,000 Teesside residents and industrial discharges from the Wilton petrochemicals complex, occupied by ICI and others. The project was to be financed by Northumbrian, with ICI and other chemical companies paying for each tonne of waste treated. It was linked to the National River Authority's goal of bringing migratory salmon back to the Tees by 1996. A planning application was submitted to Cleveland County Council in May. But the news a fortnight ago from Du Pont, the world's largest nylon maker, that it will close five nylon intermediates plants at the Wilton site in early 1997 has forced Northumbrian to re-evaluate the scheme's economic feasibility. Discussions have been held between Northumbrian and ICI and the project is now under review. Its first Pounds 50m stage included construction of a Pounds 35m, eight-mile underground sewer along the Tees' south bank, to discharge sewage nearer the river mouth, from beside the Wilton site. But the cut in Du Pont effluent resulting from the closures means pollution from the Wilton site into the Tees will be substantially reduced, diminishing the proposed treatment works' commercial spin-off. Should the project be abandoned, Northumbrian is committed to reducing pollution into the river, but the timescale will be longer. The NRA has expressed concern this could mean the Tees may not be re-established as a salmon fishery until the next century.</p>

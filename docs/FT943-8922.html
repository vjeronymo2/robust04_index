			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Councils 'ignore care volunteers' Local authorities have ignored help from volunteer groups when implementing community care, a report says today. Community Service Volunteers, which co-ordinates voluntary groups, said that only 28 per cent of councils in England and Wales had plans to use help from the voluntary sector in community care for this year, while only one-third had staff with specific responsibility for dealing with offers of voluntary help. It suggested that the government's controversial care in the community programme could work better and more cheaply if councils took advantage of help offered without charge by individuals. Although 93 per cent of councils said they planned to work with voluntary organisations, far fewer actually made use of help from volunteers. Of a sample of 60 authorities contacted by the organisation, 45 per cent said they made no use of volunteers. Ms Elisabeth Hoodless, executive director of the group, said that councils should be barred under the Citizen's Charter from ignoring offers of help. She said: 'Volunteers have proved they are a vital force in lengthening and strengthening our public services, but the majority of authorities still deny them a chance to serve.' CSV said its survey of plans showed that where volunteers were already involved, councils were making increased use of them, mostly with a range of client groups. Volunteers: Partners in Care.

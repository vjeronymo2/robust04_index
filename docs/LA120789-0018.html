			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 900 SUSPECTED DRUG SMUGGLERS IN IRAN COULD BE EXECUTED  </P> <P> Iran said Wednesday that 900 suspected drug smugglers face the gallows in a  year-old narcotics crackdown in which more than 1,000 men and women already  have been executed.  </P> <P> The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, quoted a senior  official as saying that 14,000 people, including 569 Afghans, have been  arrested since March for major drug offenses.  </P> <P> Iran's anti-drug campaign could eventually dam up what has become a major  narcotics pipeline into Western Europe and the United States.  </P> <P> Human rights organizations have condemned the large number of executions in the  ruthless crackdown.  </P> <P> But a campaign that cuts the volume of heroin flooding into the West could help  President Hashemi Rafsanjani's efforts to end Iran's isolation and restore  relations with the West.  </P></p>

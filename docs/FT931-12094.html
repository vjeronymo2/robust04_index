			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / How to Spend It: Quick, slick cover ups - Lucia van der Post with tidy tartans I HAVE only recently come to see the inestimable qualities of 'throws'. At their best they are soft, warm, durable and beautiful. They are the quickest, simplest and cheapest way of recovering a sofa - just throw one over the existing fabric, and there you are, a new cover. They can be used for concealing unexceptional or even ugly tables, for revitalising a colour scheme and can double as shawls or rugs. Melissa Rigby has built a business round the throw. She takes fine worsted yarn and hand dyes it with natural vegetables dyes in small batches. She uses traditional dyes such as indigo (blue), madder (red) and weld (gold) to produce the rich colours shown in the photograph here. The results are beautiful contemporary classics. Before starting Rigby Hues, the company which produces the textiles, Melissa rigby spent some 18 months travelling and researching those cultures which still retain the old traditions of naturally dying cloth. Her aim now is to go on designing and producing fine naturally dyed textiles - in the pipeline and on sale probably in about eight months time are vivid textiles from Hungary (traditional hand-block-printed 19th century designs), traditional double weaves from Wales as well as embroidered textiles from Transylvania and Bangladesh. Meanwhile, anyone wanting the throws, which measure 72in by 54in and are fringed, can find them at George Trowark, St Christopher's Place, London W1; Idonia van der Bijl, 25 Museum Street, London WC1, at Pounds 130 a time. Although Melissa Rigby's throws are very special almost every furnishing accessory company at the moment has come up with a version of their own - photographed here is one of a new range from Osborne &amp; Little, the company primarily known for its fabrics and wallpapers. In fine textured pure wool worsted the combination of small and large checks is designed to work with the other colour ranges in the fabric collection. Pounds 85.75 from Osborne &amp; Little, 304-308 King's Road, London, SW3 2UH.</p>

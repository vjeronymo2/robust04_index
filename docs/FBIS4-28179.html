			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 7 KYODO -- North Korea will "never"  allow special international inspections of its two undeclared  nuclear facilities suspected to be part of a secret nuclear arms  development program, a North Korean diplomat said Tuesday [7  June].    Yun Ho-chin, North Korean delegate to the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, criticized a recent IAEA  report which said Pyongyang has made it impossible to determine  whether plutonium has been diverted for nuclear weapons.    Yun, meeting reporters at the IAEA headquarters, said the  nuclear watchdog can carry out satisfactory inspections by  checking fuel rods removed from a 5-megawatt reactor in the  Yongbyon nuclear complex 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang.    His remarks came at a time when an IAEA Board of Governors  meeting was in session and likely to demand that North Korea  accept inspections of the two sites as a possible alternative  means of finding out if it has been developing nuclear arms.    Meanwhile, North Korea sent a letter to the IAEA on Monday,  suggesting it may withdraw from the nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty if the U.N. agency continues putting pressure on  Pyongyang over the issue.    North Korea had rejected the IAEA's demands to stop removing  fuel rods from the reactor, which the nuclear watchdog said  would spoil chances to determine if plutonium had been secretly  taken from the rods to manufacture nuclear weapons.</p>

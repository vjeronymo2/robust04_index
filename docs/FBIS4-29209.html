			<p>BFN     [Text] Nagoya, June 15 KYODO -- Japan's top automaker  Toyota Motor Corp. said Wednesday [15 June] its automobile  production in June is likely to mark the first year-on-year rise  in 13 months, fueled by brisk demand for the newly introduced,  low-priced RAV4 recreational vehicle.    The company said June production is expected to top the  previous year's level of 313,000 units, the first year-on-year  rise since may last year.    "There is a strong possibility that domestic automobile  sales  will begin to pick up in the latter half of this year, spurred  by the marketing of new models," said Iwao Isomura, vice  president of the company.    The company said orders for the RAV4 model totaled 17,000 in  the first month after it was marketed, far surpassing the  monthly sales target of 2,000 units.    It said it plans to introduce restyled versions of  medium-sized cars "Vista" and "Camry" in July at prices  comparable to their old models.    Isomura expressed hope that Toyota's car sales will expand  in  July, enabling the company to attain its sales goal of 2.16  million units this year.</p>

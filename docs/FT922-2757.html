			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (5): Bush takes a tougher stance - Foreign trade: human rights cast shadow over talks with US A senior Chinese textile official was recently reported in the US as suggesting that Beijing was considering a joint venture in offshore garment production: factories would be built in the US and, perhaps, Mexico, with Chinese technology and machinery and local labour and raw materials. The timing of the report, mid-May, gave it a ring of authenticity. The suggestion was made two weeks before President Bush was due to issue his annual renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. Ever since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre the renewal has been more difficult for the US president to justify to Congress, so things tend to happen around renewal time: long-sought laws on intellectual property rights are published while Beijing promises to increase imports. To extend MFN - which gives China the same tariff treatment as most other nations - the president must certify that Beijing is not in violation of US human rights standards. Failing that, he can waive the criteria, stating that MFN would substantially promote free emigration. Thanks to the benefits of MFN, the US trade deficit with China was Dollars 12.7bn in 1991 - the second largest US deficit after Japan's - and it is still growing. Textiles and clothing account for about one quarter of Chinese exports; the rest are mostly consumer goods such as bicycles, costume jewellery, toys, games and sports and electrical equipment. Removal of MFN status would deal a significant blow to China's exports and to the economy of Hong Kong. To fend off last year's attempt by Congress to impose conditions on China's MFN, Mr Bush began to get a little tougher with Beijing. He vowed to impose sanctions if Beijing did not agree to protect intellectual property rights, support Taiwan's membership to the Gatt, cut illegal textile and apparel shipments, and strictly monitor goods thought to be produced by prison labour. Licenses to sell high-speed computers and satellites to China were to be disallowed until China promised to adhere to international non-proliferation standards. The policy produced results. Hours before the US was prepared to impose sanctions on Dollars 300m-Dollars 500m worth of Chinese products for Beijing's failure to protect intellectual property rights, a deal was reached. China promised to improve protection of computer software, sound recordings, pharmaceuticals and agri-chemicals. It vowed to join the Berne Copyright Convention by next October and the Geneva Phonogram Convention in June 1993. Last October, the US Trade Representative initiated a Section 301 investigation of Chinese market access barriers. Talks can go on for a year before the president orders retaliation. The four core issues to be resolved are China's extensive import licensing system; lack of transparency in its trading rules; bans or quantitative import restrictions; and the use of technical standards and certification as trade barriers. After first making slow progress, US officials described the most recent market access talks last month as 'the most constructive and productive ever'. Beijing offered to phase out import licensing requirements for more than 50 product categories and promised to provide 'an exhaustive and authoritative' list of Chinese import bans, controls and quotas within two months. Substantial differences remain, but the Chinese appear to be convinced that sanctions will happen if they do not co-operate. The US diplomatically presents the 301 talks as an exercise to help China prepare for Gatt membership. The unspoken threat is that Taiwan will be ready before China is. In another slap at Chinese trade practices, the US Customs Service has launched one of its largest investigations in an effort to contain the flood of Chinese exports seeking to avoid quotas or to use prison labour. In May, customs officials announced indictments of four Chinese businessmen and three companies for undervaluing textile imports with the intention of defrauding the US government of import duties totaling Dollars 120,000. Agents blocked in US warehouses 10 shipments of goods allegedly made with Chinese prison labour. Ultimately charges for duty evasion could reach Dollars 2bn. All this activity is supposed to convince Congress that US-Chinese trade problems should be addressed directly and not through cancellation of MFN. One of Mr Bush's principal supporters on the MFN issue, Senator Max Baucus, the Democratic chairman of the Senate trade subcommittee, has begun to hint of defection unless the Administration agrees that the North American Free Trade negotiations will include more on environmental issues. Some congressmen are working hard to make MFN conditional on human rights improvements. There is talk of setting up a middle category of duties for China - higher than the MFN level and lower than that accorded to the former Communist countries. Ms Holly Burkhalter of Human Rights Watch has proposed higher duties on selected products, the number of which would be tied to release of political prisoners or other human rights gains. Penalties on products could be selected among those produced by state companies. To end China's MFN, Congress would have to muster a two-thirds vote in both houses. That is unlikely to happen. But this is an election year, and the Democrats will not miss one more opportunity to portray Mr Bush as a wimp on China.</p>

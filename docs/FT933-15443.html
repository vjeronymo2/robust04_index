			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks gain as inflation worries abate Wall Street A RETREAT in commodity prices eased investors' inflation fears yesterday and helped leading US stocks post solid gains, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.74 at 3,475.67. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.40 firmer at 442.83, but the Nasdaq composite weakened 3.43 to 698.79. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 253m shares. At the end of last week shares were hit by economic worries following a poor June employment report; and at the start of this holiday-shortened week prices fell further on inflation fears as the Commodity Research Bureau index rose sharply. Investors yesterday put their economic worries aside - news of a 1.7 per cent rise in May wholesale sales provided some rare cheer - and, aided by a decline in the CRB index, began buying stocks again. Demand, however, was not particularly strong, with much of the buying restricted to investors looking for bargains among the bigger-capitalised companies. There was no lead from the bond market either, with Treasury prices ending little changed yesterday. Advanced Micro Devices firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 24 after the company reported that net income in the latest quarter jumped 55 per cent. AMD also unveiled a micro-processor product. Elsewhere in the technology sector stocks were mixed. IBM eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 46 5/8 after Mr Louis Gerstner, the company's chairman, was reported to have decided against a major restructuring of IBM's sales force. Among other leading technology issues, Hewlett-Packard advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 77 1/4 , but Digital Equipment lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 39 1/4 . Airline issues continued to be hit by selling amid concern about demand for air travel. AMR, parent of American Airlines, declined Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 59 5/8 , USAir slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 15 1/4 , Delta shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 46 3/8 and UAL fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 124 3/8 . Also in the transportation sector, Airborne Freight dropped Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 21 5/8 after broking house Robertson Humphrey lowered its short-term rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'hold'. Newmont Mining, which on Tuesday jumped on higher metals prices, retreated sharply by Dollars 3 to Dollars 55 1/2 . On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 83 3/8 in volume of 5.6m shares after Goldman Sachs reduced its earnings estimate for the company. Sequent Computer Systems plunged Dollars 5 to Dollars 11 3/4 in volume of 7m shares following the profits warning from the company late on Tuesday. Canada TORONTO ended lower after fairly heavy trading. The TSE 300 index slipped 11.6 to 3,972.7 and falls outscored rises by 452 to 300. Volume came to 64.2m shares valued at CDollars 660.5m. Only six of the 14 sub-group indices, however, lost ground. The energy group had the day's biggest decline, 1.41 per cent, making a retreat over the past four sessions of 6.1 per cent. The mining group shed 0.99 per cent as Inco fell CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 28 7/8 and Alcan eased CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 25. Both stocks were downgraded in ratings by SG Warburg. The golds and industrial products sectors posted fairly sizeable declines.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investment and Saving): New issues A Wiltshire-based regional brewer this week became the latest victim of the bruised new issues market, writes David Blackwell. Ushers, a product of the government's anti-monopoly ruling, intended to raise around Pounds 50m to clear debt through a placing and open offer, but the issue was pulled on Thursday - the very day the issue price was due to be announced. Institutions were willing to put up only three-quarters of the necessary money and the group felt that, unless the shares were placed fully ahead of the public offer, it would risk a bad after-market. That seems wise following the surreal events at United Carriers which, on Monday, issued its second profits warning since flotation in February. The first cited a lack of parcels; the second, an excess. The shares fell 79p to almost half the flotation price. RAP Group, a rubber and plastics distributor, yesterday curbed its ambition to raise Pounds 4.6m from a placing, settling instead for Pounds 3.55m. The shares were priced at 142p, giving a market capitalisation of Pounds 15.08m. Meanwhile, investors thinking of going for shares in BSkyB should be aware of this week's report from Henderson Crosthwaite suggesting the flotation greatly over-values the satellite television venture.</p>

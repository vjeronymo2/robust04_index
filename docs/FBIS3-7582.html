			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- Japan will strive to come  up with more concrete measures to further open its markets by  the end of June to help conclude stalled bilateral trade talks  with the United States, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura said Wednesday. "It is enormously important for the  Japanese Government to put all its energy into compiling such  measures in June, because the U.S. is focusing on our June  package," the top government spokesman told a news conference.    Takemura's comment came after U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor rejected as inadequate a fresh Japanese  market-opening package unveiled Tuesday. "We have reviewed  these measures and they do not meet (our) concerns," Kantor said  at a White House news conference Tuesday.    Takemura said Kantor's negative assessment of the Japanese  package is regrettable. But he also expressed hope for an early  resumption of the stalemated "framework" trade negotiations  saying he is paying attention to Kantor's remark suggesting  there remain possibilities of resuming the bilateral trade talks  if Japan makes further concessions.    Kantor said, "we are not discouraged. The Government of  Japan has described this as a first step and we see it as a work  in progress."    On Tuesday, Japan announced a set of market-opening measures  designed primarily to pare down its lopsided trade surplus with  the U.S., which amounted to some 60 billion dollars last year.    The package features tax cuts and other macroeconomic steps  to spur domestic demand, market-opening measures in four sectors  and voluntary overtures in three priority areas of the trade  talks with the U.S.    The chief cabinet secretary denied that Tokyo plans to send  a  special envoy to Washington to officially explain Japan's  efforts to boost foreign access to its markets and slash its  trade surpluses.</p>

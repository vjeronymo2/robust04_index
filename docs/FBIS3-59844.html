In fact, both democracy and human rights  are being violated around the globe. It must be mentioned that  violation of human rights is the main problem in this world. We  want to portray a true picture of the oppressed nations. But  before doing so, we want to say a few words regarding the  statement made and the role played by President Bill Clinton of  the United States, who is the champion of democracy and human  rights.    On the occasion of Human Rights Day, which was observed on  December 10, President Clinton made a statement and said that  every man has some inalienable rights. These include the right  to live; the right to personal freedom and security; the right  of not being detained without trial; and the right to remain  free from oppression. The Declaration of Human Rights also  guarantees political, religious, and cultural freedom to every  individual. Under no circumstances can these rights be violated.  Every individual is entitled to lead a free and respectable  life. The West has no idea of how to improve the environment for  making a better life for human beings.    Along with President Clinton, his assistant secretary of  state, John Shattuck, also stated that the United States  respects the cultural and historical differences existing  between different nations. He reiterated that all the people of  this world are entitled to enjoy the same fundamental and basic  human rights. No one should be subjected to oppression. He  further said that no man was born to be jailed for expressing  his views.    We agree with the statements made by the president and his  assistant secretary of state. Both democracy and human rights  are protected in the United States. But what is happening  outside the United States? If we look at the recent incidents  which occurred in the areas inhabited by the Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Somalia, it appears that the  statements made by President Clinton and his assistant secretary  of state are nothing but a satire of democracy and human rights.    Is the brutal killing of several hundred thousand unarmed  Muslim men and women in Bosnia by Christian Serbs not a  violation of democracy and human rights? It is unfortunate that  the developed nations, which advocate the cause of democracy and  human rights, have never raised any protest against such  incidents. The Middle East problem is the most complex issue in  the world at present. But the U.S. Administration has adopted a  dual policy regarding this issue. The largest human rights  organization of the United States is Human Rights Watch. In its  recent report, the group alleged that although President Clinton  criticized various activities of Iraq, Iran, and Libya, he is  not saying anything against their ally Israel. President  Clinton's human rights policy regarding Israel is much weaker  than that of former President Bush. The Bush administration was  willing to impose economic sanctions against Israel with a view  to achieve its objective. But President Clinton has adopted a  very liberal policy towards Israel. Recently he gave an  assurance to the Israeli prime minister, Mr. Rabin, that an  amount of $3,000 million in assistance will be given to Israel  every year. The Human Rights Watch report further states that  Washington did not criticize Israel for the expulsion of 415  Palestinians to Lebanon. On the other hand, the U.S. secretary  of state made efforts to reach a political understanding with  Israel in this regard.    We feel that this report by Human Rights Watch is sufficient  to unmask the administration of President Clinton. Since the  birth of Israel, the United States has contributed to its  development by extending financial assistance. At present, the  main problem in the Middle East is Israel. From the very  beginning, this Jewish state has been making attempts to grab  the countries of the region. For this purpose the United States  has equipped Israel with arms and nuclear weapons. Some people  have remarked that Israel is itself an atomic bomb in the Middle  East. Realizing this fact, Iran, Iraq, and Libya have taken up  an anti-Israeli stand. Their stand led to the recent outbreak of  the Gulf War. It must be mentioned that economic sanctions were  imposed against Libya centering a trifling issue. Two Libyan  citizens were accused for the accident of a PanAm airliner. The  United States, Britain, and France have demanded extradition of  these two people to face trial. The United Nations imposed  sanctions against Libya since it refused to comply with their  demand.    The Libyan citizens denied that they are involved in the  mishap of the PanAm airliner. Hence, Libya has not committed any  offense by refusing to hand over its citizens to face trial. For  this refusal, several hundred thousand Libyan citizens have  become victims of the sanctions imposed by the United Nations.  Isn't this a violation of human rights being committed by the  United Nations, which is influenced by the United States? Hence,  the masks of those who claim that they are champions of the  cause of democracy and human rights should be opened. Fresh  initiatives should be taken for the establishment of real  democracy and human rights in the world. For this purpose,  efforts should be made to build a new world order.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Michel Moutot] </F>   [Excerpts] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Feb 2 (AFP) -- From  their lookout high above this besieged Moslem enclave, the 12  Swedish peacekeepers of the Tango 2 observation post scan the  horizon for Serb guns, able only to count the shots, even when  they are the targets.    From their post, located 15 kilometres (nine miles) from the  airport of this major northern Bosnian town -- which the United  Nations plans to reopen, by force if necessary -- the Swedes  were able to determine the exact position of Serb artillery  which shelled the airport and the nearby NORDBAT 2 Scandinavian  battalion base Tuesday [1 February].    Seated high in his sandbag bunker, in front of an enormous  pair of binoculars, Private Fredrik Thorgren, 26, explained  Wednesday what the peacekeepers witnessed.    "Yesterday, we saw shooting behind this hill, near Borogovo.  We didn't see the detonations," he said. "There were  speculations that it was near the base. One hour later we heard  on the radio that it landed on the airport and 100 metres  (yards) from the camp."    Serb artillery controls access to the Tuzla airport from  three different positions, with several hundred artillery pieces  at its disposal.    Tuesday afternoon, nine shells fell on the airport zone,  including one within one kilometre of the main runway. There  were no casualties.    "The nearest Serb position from the airport is 10 kilometres  (six miles), so they could shoot with guns, mortars or tanks,"  said Tango 2 platoon leader Lieutenant Jan Almgard, 28. [passage  omitted]    "A grenade landed on the roof. The Serbs are aiming at us,  it's obvious. We have a blue flag with a light on it, it can't  be a mistake," Almgard said, pointing out the blown-away tiles  on their UN-leased villa. "The soldier on duty at the  binoculars had time only to jump down. It's a miracle we had no  casualties." [passage omitted]    "The problem is that the Serbs here think that we fight with  the Bosnian Army and that we're part of their defence system,"  explained Almgard. "We tried to establish a radio link with them  but they refuse to use it." [passage omitted]</p>

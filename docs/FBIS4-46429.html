			<p>BFN     [Text] Greece's most subdued pre-election period in living  memory took a bloody twist on Friday night, when a man  concealing a knife in a bouquet of flowers stabbed three Greek  Communist Party [KKE) candidates for next Sunday's  Europarliament elections.    Right at the end of a party rally in the centre of  Thessaloniki, the attacker had approached the speakers' stand  and suddenly pulled out the 12-inch (30 cm) knife.    Eurodeputy Vasilios Efraimidhis, Greek General Confederation  of Labor (YSEE) secretary Ioannis Theonas and KKE Central  Committee member Mikhail Spiridhakis were rushed to the nearby  AHEPA [American-Hellenic Educational and Progressive  Association] hospital, with deep stab wounds in their hips and  thighs.    The assailant was later identified as Manolis Theodhorakis,  54, a Greek emigrant worker who had recently returned from  Germany, and his suspected accomplice, ironsmith Evangelos  Radhos, 26. Immediately after the attack, outraged supporters  beat Theodhorakis who is now in critical condition in hospital.    All parties condemned the attack and demanded a full  investigation, the apparent motive for the brutal attack still  unknown.</p>

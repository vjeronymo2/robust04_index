			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Belgium talks up role of the EMI The Belgian presidency of the European Union yesterday called for a stronger role for the European Monetary Institute in the co-ordination of monetary policies and the management of the exchange rate mechanism. Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, said the ERM crisis and introduction of wider fluctuation bands last summer made closer co-operation imperative. Without 'a significant qualitative improvement' in this area, the goal of monetary union by the end of the decade could be at risk. In a speech to the European Finance Convention in Brussels, Mr Maystadt also admitted that the January 1, 1999, deadline was more realistic than the original 1997. He offered several proposals for filling the political vacuum in the wake of the August crisis which led to the introduction of 15 per cent fluctuation bands for ERM currencies. The EMI should be given 'an explicit role' in decisions leading to the entry or realignment of an ERM currency. States with low inflation might consider aligning their monetary policies to a 'common intermediate target', in which case the EMI might be allowed to issue joint statements on national policy decisions taken by central banks in this low-inflation zone. The ERM should be strengthened, possibly through a more equitable sharing of potential exchange rate losses arising from open-ended interventions. This is a response to Bundesbank criticism that its obligations to defend other currencies was undermining its domestic monetary policies.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (3): After the cold war - David White on the cost of military aircraft WHY CAN our air forces not make do with simpler aircraft? Why is it necessary to push technology - and costs - to such extremes? The questions, frequently asked nowadays in a climate of declining defence budgets, are not new. If governments had taken the advice given to them in 1917 by Cyril Hall, in his book By Land, Sea and Air, they would have stuck to biplanes. In a section on Modern Weapons of War he pooh-poohed the hopes that Germany, in particular, had vested in the monoplane. 'The monoplane,' he wrote, 'has a very limited speed range. It maximum speed may be anything up to 120 miles an hour, but its minimum is seldom less than 90 miles an hour. You can see what a grave disability is this high speed. Accurate observation is impossible, because the observer is travelling too fast clearly to see what is taking place on the ground. And it is too high for bomb-dropping, For what sort of chance of hitting the place at which it is aimed has a missile dropped from an aeroplane travelling at 90 miles an hour?' This argument seemed to justify his conclusion: 'It is highly unlikely that the development of the monoplane will be carried further.' Its echoes can be heard today. The end of the cold war has, in the past couple of years, brought a whole series of new combat aircraft projects under criticism and scrutiny. Because of the time needed nowadays to bring new aircraft into production, the fighters now under development were all conceived when the cold war was at its height. In the US, industry has sensed the imminent crunch. General Dynamics' sale to Lockheed late last year of its Fort Worth aircraft operation, maker of the successful F-16, means that there are now two primary poles for design and manufacture - McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed. Lockheed was already linked with General Dynamics in the F-22 project, the top-of-the range fighter designed to succeed McDonnell Douglas's F-15. Until the F-22 award in 1991, Lockheed seemed to be in the process of being sidelined after the completion of its F-117A stealth aircraft programme. Now the Fort Worth acquisition, says Mr Dan Tellep, Lockheed's chairman and chief executive, has 'fundamentally transformed the landscape of military aircraft in the US.' Even if the F-22 project were cancelled - one of the options, if not the most likely, under consideration at the Pentagon - Lockheed would count on a role in whatever took its place. 'It wouldn't devastate us,' says Mr Tellep. Priority has been given by the new Pentagon team to sorting out the four new tactical aircraft projects planned for the US Air Force and Navy. All are clearly not affordable in the same timeframe. The odds favour the F-22, although possibly with a curtailed and slower programme, and the new E/F versions of McDonnell Douglas's carrier-borne F/A-18 Hornet. This would be at the expense of plans for a new multi-role fighter and the A/F-X naval strike aircraft, successor to the A-12 project, cancelled two years ago. Northrop's B-2 strategic stealth bomber programme has already been cut to 20 aircraft, and the Pentagon has threatened to stop the McDonnell Douglas C-17 heavy transport aircraft and find an alternative to the troubled Dollars 41bn programme. Other options for heavy airlift, if the contractor fails to meet requirements, are versions of Boeing's 747 and 767 airliners, a life-extension of the current Lockheed C-141 Starlifter or a restart of production of its C-5 Galaxy. Europe's moment of panic appears to have passed with the patching-up last December of differences between Germany and Britain on the future of the European Fighter Aircraft. The existence of three new-generation European fighters - the Swedish JAS 39 Gripen, the French Rafale and the Anglo-German-Italian-Spanish Eurofighter, all of similar delta-wing design with 'canard' foreplanes - may seem excessive. But all are now secure, even though Germany still places a question-mark on its commitment on the production phase of Eurofighter. The lightweight, multi-role Gripen (JAS is an abbreviation for fighter, attack and reconnaissance) is the furthest down the road. This is despite the setback suffered in 1989 when its first prototype crashed (not a unique occurrence: the US F-22 had a similar mishap in April 1992 at Edwards Air Force Base in California). The first production model of the aircraft - single-engined, in contrast to the twin-engined Rafale and Eurofighter - flew in March, and 140 are on order for delivery between now and 2001. Dassault's Rafale, launched at the same time as the Eurofighter, has stolen a march on its heavier four-nation rival inasmuch as it at least has prototypes flying. But the programme could be vulnerable to cuts or further delays in purchase plans. Three different versions are being built - one-seat and two-seat aircraft for the air force and a carrier version for the navy. Current plans are for some 320 in total with the first navy squadron entering service late in 1998 and the first air force squadron at the end of 2000. Preliminary discussions are already under way on new collaborative arrangements for the next generation. British Aerospace has begun contacts with Saab on a possible aircraft to fill the gap in the market now being successfully occupied by the Hawk trainer-cum-fighter. It has also talked to the French on the next frontline fighter to succeed the Rafale and Eurofighter. France cannot afford to go it alone again, and British industrialists and officials believe that any future project on this scale in Europe can be undertaken only on the basis of Anglo-French co-operation.</p>

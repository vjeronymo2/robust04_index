Those people were killed simply  because they were National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola, UNITA, sympathizers. According to our correspondent in  that area, women were brutally raped and the men were killed.    Also in Bengo Province, MiG-23 combat fighters have bombed  the areas of Pangualuquene, Quibaxe, Piri, Nambuangongo, and  Quibaco, killing 125 people, wounding another 84, and destroying  seven homes.    The following is the balance of MPLA-PT atrocities against  the people of Bengo Province during January: 328 people were  cruelly massacred by the Futungo de Belas soldiers.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SMOKING FOE SAYS ROLE IS HER DESTINY  </P> <P> At first blush, Nampet Panichpant-M might seem an unlikely lieutenant in Orange  County's new war on smoking and tobacco use.  </P> <P> Petite and manicured and looking younger than 41, she is the scion of a wealthy  tobacco family from the fertile land of the Golden Triangle, an area where  Thailand, Laos and Burma meet and where tobacco and opium grow on lush farms.  </P> <P> "My family has been involved in the tobacco plantation for some time. My  mother's side is still involved," said Panichpant-M, director of the county  Health Care Agency's immigrant services.  </P> <P> "They call me the Pat Reynolds of Thailand," she quipped in a reference to the  wealthy R.J. Reynolds tobacco heir who has become a leader in the national  anti-smoking movement.  </P> <P> In her drab cubbyhole of a county office on 17th Street, Panichpant-M is  helping to map the county's strategy for a two-year, $2.9-million anti-tobacco  campaign targeted at minorities. The effort will be paid for with the county's  share of the Proposition 99 statewide tax, which added 25 cents to the cost of  a pack of cigarettes in January, 1989.  </P> <P> The money will be used to build a network of educational and counseling  services, including a 24-hour multilingual hot line. Panichpant-M will help  shape the program for the county's 200,000 Asian-born residents -- a diverse  group with 17 distinct populations.  </P> <P> "That's going to be a real tough challenge," Panichpant-M said. "It's hard to  find a really relevant -- culturally relevant -- program for Asians whether it  be in drugs or alcohol or nicotine.  </P> <P> Panichpant-M was also named last week to a state advisory committee on  addiction and alcoholism within the Asian community. Panichpant-M, who  maintains her Thai citizenship despite her high-profile job here, said she sees  a karmic order to her calling as an anti-smoking advocate.  </P> <P> Karma is the Buddhist precept that one's actions determine one's fate,  Panichpant-M explained. Her maternal grandfather, she says, became a rich man  in the Golden Triangle but was killed by a shot to the back by business  associates who double-crossed him.  </P> <P> Her father, a high government official in Thailand, for a time ran the state's  monopoly on the production and sale of whiskey. He died of esophageal cancer,  commonly linked to alcohol.  </P> <P> "I have learned from the life experiences of my family," Panichpant-M said.  "There is some truth to that" Buddhist teaching.  </P> <P> She has had a wealth of life experiences herself.  </P> <P> Panichpant-M has spent time in more than 30 countries, traveling extensively as  a child, and speaks five languages and many more dialects. After postgraduate  work in health administration at UCLA, she returned to Thailand for a stint as  a journalist, working for an international business and political affairs  magazine.  </P> <P> She moved back to Southern California in 1980 rather abruptly, she said,  shortly after predicting a military coup that came to fruition the subsequent  autumn.  </P> <P> Since then she has returned only for visits. Back in the United States, she met  her college sweetheart, whom her parents had rejected a decade earlier as  marriage material.  </P> <P> In the intervening years, both she and her former boyfriend had been married to  -- and divorced from -- someone else. Neither had children. Now, they are  married to each other and have one daughter and one son.  </P> <P> Says Panichpant-M: "Yes, there is a certain order to things." ROSE ELLEN  O'CONNOR  </P></p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Start-up costs leave Perry lower The cost of three start-up operations had an adverse affect on Perry Group, the motor dealer, and its pre-tax profit was halved to Pounds 553,000 in the opening six months of 1992. Profits generated from existing businesses almost matched the previous year, said Mr Richard Allan, chairman and chief executive. New vehicle profits improved on unchanged volumes, but used car volumes and margins were down, and servicing and body repairing also fell. The parts operation 'did well' to match last year, he said. The half year profit was made on turnover of almost Pounds 151m, and compared with Pounds 1.11m generated from Pounds 154.1m. Earnings per share were halved to 2p but the interim dividend is again 2.75p. Mr Allan said August sales were similar in size to last year, but the dealerships were reporting improved results.</p>

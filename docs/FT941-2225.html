			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Stanhope tries to overturn sale of stake to British Land The struggle for control of prestigious London office properties intensified yesterday when Mr Stuart Lipton, chief executive of Stanhope, a troubled property company, launched a legal action to block the sale of 29.9 per cent of his company to British Land. Mr Lipton is attempting to overturn a deal struck last month in which British Land bought into Stanhope with a view to putting pressure on it to sell its properties at Broadgate and Ludgate. British Land intends to transfer the stake to the Pounds 500m British Land Quantum Property Investment Fund, the joint venture formed last June between it and Mr George Soros, the US investor. Mr Lipton is challenging the share sale on the grounds that he had pre-emption rights which gave him first refusal over the block of shares. He is taking legal action against British Land, Bank of Nova Scotia, which sold the shares, and Olympia &amp; York (UK), which originally owned the shares. British Land's proposals have dismayed Stanhope because they would leave its shareholders without any interest in Broadgate Properties, which consists of some of London's most prestigious modern buildings. 'British Land's proposal would be very good for British Land,' said Lord Sharp, Stanhope's chairman. 'There is very little in it for Stanhope's shareholders.' Stanhope is hoping to wrest control of the shares away from British Land, leaving it free to pursue restructuring proposals with other parties. Stanhope said it had been approached by two other consortia offering more generous terms. British Land responded to Stanhope's action by suggesting that Stanhope's financial difficulties could force it to agree a deal. 'We are quite sure that the Stanhope banks and other shareholders are awaiting the board's proposals with bated breath,' said Mr John Weston Smith, a director. 'Litigation is quite a slow process.' Stanhope, which has a review of its banking facilities at the end of the year, was hopeful of an early hearing. The administrators to Olympia &amp; York (UK) said the action was unlikely to affect plans to wind up the company, which they set in motion yesterday by serving a petition to put it into liquidation.</p>

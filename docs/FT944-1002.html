			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Go-ahead for Halifax merger Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is to allow the merger plans between two of the UK's largest building societies to go ahead without reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The decision was welcomed yesterday by both Halifax and Leeds Permanent, the UK's largest and fifth biggest societies, which announced last month plans to merge and then to convert to a public limited company with a full banking licence. If the deal goes ahead, it will create the third-largest high street bank, with about Pounds 90bn in assets. The two societies have about 20 per cent of outstanding UK mortgage balances and about 24 per cent of new mortgage business. Now that an MMC inquiry - which could have delayed the deal by about three months - has been avoided, the next certain stage for the merger process to go ahead will be the approval of the 10m members of the two societies. Halifax and Leeds plan to issue information in early February before the special meetings of the two organisations which are expected to take place in late March. But the Building Societies Commission, the statutory regulator, may insist that before the merger decision, the two societies' members are told about the likely distribution of free shares when the combined society becomes a plc. This could mean a court hearing before the special meetings in order to clarify whether the plans are within the legislative restrictions on how shares can be given to members. When Abbey National, the former society, became a public limited company it distributed shares on a flat rate basis, but Halifax has signalled that it is looking at other methods of allocation. Meanwhile, Leeds confirmed last night its 5,500 staff had received a 7 per cent profit-related pay bonus as a result of the society's performance in the financial year to the end of September. The society said the payment had been decided before the merger plan with Halifax was announced and was unconnected with the move.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Iceland There are different ways of peeling the same banana in the food retailing sector, as Iceland's perky trading record illustrates. By sticking to limited-range high street stores, Iceland has long defied conventional wisdom. Its latest decision to open 48 outlets within Littlewoods' stores typifies its lateral thinking. By opening an additional 60 stand-alone stores, Iceland will increase its total trading space by about 20 per cent this year. That represents one of the fastest growth rates in the sector, as the market has been quick to appreciate. But with speed comes uncertainty. Opening so many new outlets imposes great demands on the management's adaptability. Making the Littlewoods' space sweat may also prove trickier than expected. A dedicated food retailer should certainly squeeze better returns than Littlewoods did. Nevertheless, it seems odd to create a combination resembling a poor shopper's Marks and Spencer when the wisdom of such joint trading formats is coming under scrutiny. Iceland's share placing is also puzzling. Its progress in reducing gearing to 41 per cent suggests it could easily have coped with the Pounds 20m cost of fitting fridges at its Littlewoods sites. Iceland is clearly giving itself leeway to buy further parcels of stores - with the shrinking Gateway being the most obvious seller. But it will have to tread carefully.</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> MELODRAMA: WAS THIS 'STELLA,' A LOONY MIDLER REMAKE, REALLY NECESSARY?  </P> <P> "It's a great life if you don't weaken," intones Bette Midler as the noble  heroine of "Stella" (citywide). Ugh.  </P> <P> Do we really need to be put through another version of "Stella Dallas"? Is this  the vehicle that Bette Midler thinks will reclaim her serious-actress status?  If so, she's greatly misunderstood her gifts, which stand in raucous,  subversive contrast to everything this sudsy weepie represents. Directed by  John Erman, freighted with a musical score of soaring banality, this 20-year  saga of an uneducated, working-class single mother who sacrifices everything to  give her daughter the chance she never had is so recklessly shameless it verges  on camp parody.  </P> <P> No one involved in "Stella" is quite in on the joke, however, with the possible  exception of screenwriter Robert Getchell who, based on such past scripts as  "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" and "Bound for Glory," surely must recognize  the difference between honest sentiment and slop. There's a giddy,  what-the-hell quality about a few of his sequences, as if he had decided to  throw caution to the perfumed winds and indulge his affection for the excesses  of '40s women's films.  </P> <P> I'll say this much for "Stella." It's got more loony oomph than all those Joan  Crawford/Lana Turner vehicles that it superficially resembles. It plays out our  own giddy fantasies of those films in much the same way that the great Carol  Burnett movie tear-jerker parodies on TV did, but without the redeeming saving  grace of wit. The movie is crazy without knowing it.  </P> <P> When we first spot Stella, she's tending bar in a rough, chummy dive in  Watertown, N.Y. Nursing a beer in that bar is Stephen Dallas (Stephen Collins),  a handsome, well-to-do medical resident specializing in kidney diseases. (The  filmmakers missed a camp metaphorical moment by not making him a cardiologist.)  Turned on by Stella's mock striptease atop the bar, he ends up convincing her  to reassess her opinion of "fancy" men and have dinner with him. A giddy  dalliance follows. So does a baby daughter.  </P> <P> Stella, you understand, has already rejected what appeared to be a sincere  offer by the kidney doctor to make her an honest woman, or failing that,  support her and the child. (That's why there's no "Dallas" affixed to this  "Stella.") As a result, she has to scrimp and slave to raise her daughter (the  lovely Trini Alvarado) solo. We're supposed to regard her rejection of Stephen  as righteous but, really, it's a bonehead decision, particularly since Stephen  is portrayed as a pillar of virtue. Stella snubs him because if she didn't,  there wouldn't be a movie.  </P> <P> Stella's character suggests psychological entanglements that have no way of  being addressed in a movie this ding-a-ling-y. Her obsessive single-motherhood  has a self-punishing quality. So does her walling off of any subsequent suitors  -- and we're talking 20 years here. Despite her mock stripteases and sensual  heft, this Stella is basically a prig. She lives to toil and suffer.  </P> <P> We're cued to recognize all that suffering as noble rather than masochistic.  And that's where the movie really turns into a crock. Self-sacrifice makes  Stella angelic. She mostly makes her living selling beauty supplies door to  door, and the irony is not lost on us: She may look like a rumply harridan on  the outside, but inside she's beauty incarnate. Does this dumb dichotomy  explain why the film makers have gone to such great lengths to make Bette  Midler look so unappetizing? From some angles, she might be Ben Franklin in a  blond fright wig.  </P> <P> The uglification serves another dubious purpose. It's a quick-read visual aid  to class consciousness. In the fluffy never-never land of "Stella," where one  registers the progress of the decades only by the pop tunes on the sound track,  the working class is peopled exclusively by chubby louts and punks. Even  Stella's mainstay buddy, the good-natured, alcoholic Ed Munn (John Goodman),  spends most of his time barging in on her, stomach first. The film makers are  so concerned that we recognize Stella's passion to rid her daughter of poverty  that they turn poverty into a species of dementia.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Stephen and the book-publisher whiz (Marsha Mason) he intends to  marry are impeccably groomed, inside and out. They are what money was made for  -- to savor the finer things. The film makers can't even allow for the  possibility that Stella might have it in her to appreciate those finer things  for herself. Early on, Stephen in tow, she disrupts a classical voice recital  by literally throttling herself with boredom; later on, the film scores points  against her by pointing up her ignorance of Harold Pinter. (She buys tickets to  a Pinter play for Christmas Eve!)  </P> <P> The upwardly mobile pretensions of this film are, to put it gently, unseemly.  The last "Stella Dallas" was filmed with Barbara Stanwyck in 1937. America may  now be more class stratified than it's been since the '30s, so there is, I  suppose, a mite of justification in doing an updated remake. But the class  consciousness of "Stella," just like its weepy, wronged-woman moralism, seems  extravagantly musty.  </P> <P> Bette Midler may have misjudged her talents in "Stella," but the other  possibility is that she's indulging that awful, moony, bag-lady-on-a-park-bench  side of her that she showed off in the Magic Lady sequence in her one-woman  concert movie "Divine Madness." Midler may believe that being a great actress  means devolving into a heap of tears but, as the ineffable "Beaches" already  demonstrated, she doesn't make a very convincing suffering lady. She'll never  be Joan Crawford, and why should she want to be? Midler, in "The Rose," gave  what is probably the most startling and voracious debut performance I've ever  seen in a film. There's real fire in her torch songs if only she'd light the  flame.  </P></p>

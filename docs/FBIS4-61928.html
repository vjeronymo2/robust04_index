			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Marina Ryklina] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- A group of experts from the  Russian Ministry for Emergencies flew to the Tanzanian capital  of Dar es Salaam on Wednesday. At the request of the office of  the U.N supreme commissioner for refugees, Russia will  participate in the operation to provide those who are fleeing  the bloodsoaked Rwanda with humanitarian aid.    According to a spokesman for the Russian Ministry for  Emergencies, the experts will examine the routes and conditions  for Russian drivers who are expected to deliver foodstuffs and  medicines for Rwandan refugees.    The Russian transport team has already worked in the former  Yugoslavia. However, the tropical climate, health hazards,  difficulties with the delivery of heavy-duty Kamaz trucks by air  and unloading them require specific preparations.    The Russian drivers are expected to start the deliveries  this  month.</p>

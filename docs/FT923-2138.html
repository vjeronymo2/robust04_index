			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / People: Clinton-Davis appointed to AMA Lord Clinton Davis's election as president of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities will add some weight to the hoarse voice of local authorities in London. A former EC Commissioner and long-time Labour MP, Clinton-Davis is no stranger to local government. After a long stint on Hackney council in the 1960s, he was mayor in 1968. However, given the parlous state of local government, some of the wits at the AMA were pointing out yesterday that his chief qualifications for the job lie in his other public appointment: chairman of the Refugee Council. Created a life peer in 1990, Clinton-Davis is Labour's transport spokesman in the Lords. His bread and butter comes from the City solicitors S J Berwin &amp; Co, whose environment law team he heads. The AMA represents 36 metropolitan districts, 30 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation. With Rodney Brooke, the dynamic former chief executive of Westminster, as its secretary, its profile is fairly high; but with a central/local government rapprochement in full swing, anything Clinton-Davis can do to endear it to suspicious Tory ministers will be warmly welcomed.</p>

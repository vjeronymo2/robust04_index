			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Wessex Water Wessex has a habit of increasing its dividend faster than its rivals. While its unregulated waste business is producing decent profits - in contrast to others in the sector - such generosity will not worry the regulator. If landfill prices continue to harden, the joint venture with Waste Management International may yet deliver an operating margin of 20 per cent on turnover of Pounds 100m this year. Since Wessex is one of the minnows of the sector, that alone would be useful protection against the threat of tougher regulation to come. It is less clear that Wessex's water business is especially well placed going into next year's regulatory review. Holding operating costs steady for the second year, with the promise of the same this year, looks impressive. But all water companies face a trade-off between operating costs and capital spending. Without more information, the extent of genuine efficiencies is difficult to judge. Ofwat will doubtless want to sort the wheat from the chaff before setting price limits for the second half of the decade.</p>

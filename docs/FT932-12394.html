			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Precious metals prices slipped from morning levels as gold, which had led the rally, fell from its highs on profit-taking. GOLD was fixed at Dollars 351.40 a troy ounce in the afternoon, Dollars 1.40 lower than the morning's eight-month high fix of Dollars 352.80. But dealers said gold's upside target was still around Dollars 360. They also said that following Sir James Goldsmith's large purchase of gold options, the underlying market could expect a period of increased volatility. SILVER also fell in afternoon trade after fixing at a ten-month high of 410.25 cents. London's robusta COFFEE futures closed higher as the market's sharp reversal of its downward trend continued, aided by more constructive indications on both fundamentals and charts. The drop of more than 100,000 60-kilo bags in the latest US certified stock figures and the good absorption of May New York arabica delivery notices helped to fuel the upward move. Short-term charts were also seen as reasonably constructive, with technicians looking for a close above 60.50 cents a lb for New York's July contract to reinforce bullish formations. There has been little sign of origin selling. Compiled from Reuters</p>

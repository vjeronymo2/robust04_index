			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Councils plan on being Tour de France winners Southern England's local authorities were hoping last night that the balmy weather would last a little longer and that Briton Chris Boardman would continue to wear the yellow jersey as leader of the world's greatest cycle race. Kent, Hampshire and East Sussex councils, along with towns such as Dover, Brighton and Portsmouth, are paying between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m to bring two stages of the Tour de France to Britain for the first time in 20 years, and hoping to recoup the cost through a visitor bonanza. Although Boardman is given little chance of winning the 2,400- mile, three-week race, which attracts an international television audience of 950m, it is hoped he will cling to the yellow jersey for the two British stages tomorrow and Thursday. The organisers, Societe du Tour de France, have taken the tour to countries near France in recent years to broaden its interest. The last time it came to Britain was in 1974 when a stage was run around Plymouth. It was not a success. This time, a stage will run 128 miles from Dover through Kent and East Sussex and end in Marine Parade, Brighton. A second stage will see the 189 riders cover 113 miles in a Portsmouth to Portsmouth run through Hampshire. To get the tour, towns where a stage begins or ends have to pay a fee to Societe du Tour de France. Brighton has paid Pounds 90,000, for example, plus Pounds 36,000 to Sport For Television, the British company which has the UK television rights. Portsmouth and Hampshire County Council are spending Pounds 500,000 on the tour with a standard Pounds 90,000 going to Societe du Tour de France. The rest is for signposting, promotion, road closures, policing and other incidentals. East Sussex County Council has budgeted Pounds 100,000, including Pounds 78,000 for road closures and special cycle tracks in places such as Ditchling Beacon. But the 'investment' as Mr David Knight, project manager in Portsmouth has called it, could reap substantial returns. Mr Graham Tubb at East Sussex Council says: 'We are being cautious and only estimating 200,000 visitors. Others are talking about 500,000 in East Sussex alone and possibly 1m visitors overall. You only need half a million visitors spending five pounds each and you have more than covered your costs.' Ms Deborah Grubb, the head of arts and leisure at Brighton district council, says: 'We have had to pay Pounds 150,000 to get the tour and we consider it a snip. We will get hundreds of thousands of visitors. If they spend Pounds 20 each, we will make millions.' Chris Boardman picture, Page 11</p>

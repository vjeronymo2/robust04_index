			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Loan shark attack in Taiwan: Illegal money lenders are becoming increasingly sophisticated and disruptive, writes Laura Tyson Cash is the lifeblood of Taiwan's small businesses, which form the backbone of the island's economy. But in a country where access to short-term financing through legal channels is limited, the price of money is dear - and often dangerous. Tolerated by authorities, illegal money-lending has long been a fixture of Taiwan's financial landscape, dominated by highly conservative state banks. Despite reforms in recent years, gaping inefficiencies remain in the formal banking system. Black market finance operations in various guises are finding new, improved niches and proliferating. Such lenders are becoming bolder and often place advertisements in newspapers offering 'car loans', 'credit card loans' and 'housing loans'. Small business people complain that as a rule existing financial institutions are unwilling to extend loans for small amounts, especially without some form of collateral. It takes at least a week to process an unsecured short-term consumer-type loan from most Taiwanese banks, which will usually require that two people serve as personal guarantors to the borrower. Such barriers are insurmountable for many people in need of quick cash. A Taipei real estate agent explained: 'Say you have to meet a payment deadline at three o'clock Wednesday afternoon. But one of your customers failed to pay you on Monday, and you can't raise the cash until Friday. You can either default or go to the underground banks. Unless you want to watch your business go under you have no choice.' Last week the government swooped on underground banks and netted nearly 100 illegal money lenders in an island-wide raid. Mr Ma Ying-jeou, justice minister, was quoted as saying that their activities were badly affecting the operations of legal financial institutions. The widespread use of enforcers - often triad-linked - to collect bad loans posed a threat to public order, he said. Mr Liang Kuo-shu, governor of the central bank, said earlier this week that monetary authorities would seek to establish consumer finance companies. Such financing remains scarce in Taiwan although Citibank has successfully pursued consumer finance and car loans. Lending for mortgages and cars is becoming more common among innovative local banks. Most underground banks are loan sharks operating out of trading companies, pawn shops, jewellery shops and car showrooms lending at interest rates which start at 2.5 per cent per month and often escalate far higher, depending on the creditworthiness and desperation of the customer. The loans sharks are intermediaries; the ultimate lenders are said to be wealthy individuals in politics, government or business. One rampant form of illegal lending which especially worries authorities is the use of credit cards to obtain loans. Twenty-five 'merchants' offering such services were caught in last week's raid. Credit cards are a relatively new phenomenon in Taiwan, and have become widely used only in the last two or three years. Instead of goods or services, the merchant gives out cash - for a minimum commission of 10 per cent. The credit risk is passed on to the bank that issued the card. Compared to black market rates, credit card cash advances are attractive. Another advantage is that the Mafia is not involved. It is feared such practices will lead to an increase in bad credit card debts, affecting social stability, causing problems for banks and threatening the development of the credit card industry in Taiwan. The operations of underground banks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, the Justice Ministry's investigation bureau has said. Records are computerised and put into code, so investigators have difficulty finding the names of the ultimate lenders and borrowers. In newspaper advertisements, only a telephone number is provided and the call is then automatically forwarded to the lender's cellular telephone. Credit cards are swiped and loans extended by the roadside.</p>

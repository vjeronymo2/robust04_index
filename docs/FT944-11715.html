			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Maverick who thumbed his nose at respectability and the establishment - John Plender and David Wighton chart a career which led from Paddington station to an international business turning over more than Pounds 5bn After 33 years' fighting opponents inside and outside Lonrho it always seemed unlikely that Mr Tiny Rowland would go quietly. However, maintaining his reputation for unpredictability to the last, he appears finally to have agreed to do just that. He once said that the last thing he wanted was for Lonrho to be respectable but he has, at last, succumbed to the forces that want to make it so. Born Roland Walter Fuhrhop, of a German father and Anglo-Dutch mother, Mr Rowland is a natural outsider and maverick. He has never been accepted by the UK business or political establishment and seemed to enjoy his controversial reputation. In 1973 when Edward Heath, then Prime Minister, famously described him as 'the unacceptable face of capitalism' he replied that he would not want to be the acceptable face. Educated first in Germany, then briefly in England, he was detained on the Isle of Man during the second world war, when he was suspected of Nazi sympathies. His experiences after the war, which included compulsory employment as a porter at Paddington station in London, as well as business ventures in which he fell foul of the Inland Revenue, were not designed to endear him to his adopted country. In his early thirties, Africa provided an opportunity for a new start. Yet, here too, he met with a mixed reception. When he acquired effective control of Lonrho in 1961, he did so in the face of considerable hostility from the Rhodesian establishment. Just over 10 years later came the notorious boardroom power struggle, which caused the outburst from Mr Heath, in which Sir Basil Smallpeice and a group of directors known as the 'straight eight' sought without success to unseat him from executive office. The pretext was Mr Rowland's failure to reveal to his board the granting of options to Mr Alan Ball, the chairman, and Mr Angus Ogilvy, executive director and husband of Princess Alexandra. Mr Ogilvy had been instrumental in introducing Rowland to Lonrho. Part of the effect of the granting of options was to reduce the two men's ability to act independently of Mr Rowland. While Mr Rowland ultimately won the vicious battle for control with the support of small shareholders, he lost Mr Ogilvy, who resigned from the board. He also alienated most of the City and the wider British establishment. He has never been squeamish about upsetting public opinion either. In 1992, he sold a stake in Lonrho's hotel chain to the Libyan government which was subject to United Nations sanctions following the Lockerbie bombing. In an article in The Observer, then owned by Lonrho, he declared that he hoped to give 'a lot of enjoyable annoyance to everybody'. During the 1980s Mr Rowland became increasingly distracted by a vigorous pursuit of those he perceived to be his enemies. When Mr Alan Bond had the temerity to plan a takeover bid for Lonrho Mr Rowland ruthlessly exposed the Australian entrepreneur's shaky finances. However, Mr Rowland's main adversary was the Egyptian-born Mr Mohamed Fayed, a former director of Lonrho, who with his two brothers had acquired, in the mid-1980s, the House of Fraser stores group, owner of Harrods, which Mr Rowland had long coveted. In 1977, Mr Rowland first drew up a plan to take over House of Fraser. Four years later he made a Pounds 226m bid which was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the grounds that it was against the public interest. In 1984 Lonrho sold its Fraser shares to the Fayeds who Lonrho believed were 'neither qualified nor capable' of bidding for the whole. However, they gained control with a Pounds 615m bid which became the subject of a highly critical Department of Trade and Industry report and prompted years of legal wrangling. In the vendetta against the Fayed brothers Lonrho's cash was diverted to the cause, weakening finances already stretched by years of acquisitions. Mr Rowland built Lonrho from a turnover of Pounds 4m in 1961 to a group with sales of more than Pounds 5bn and profits at their peak of Pounds 272m. Yet from the shareholders' point of view the lucrative period was chiefly confined to the 1960s. This was despite the disadvantage of a heavy concentration of mining assets in Southern Rhodesia at the time of Ian Smith's Unilateral Declaration of Independence. Mr Rowland attracted a strong following of loyal private shareholders whom he kept sweet by paying, what turned out to be, unsustainably high dividends. When he was finally forced to cut the dividend last year he may have sown the seeds of his eventual departure. In a characteristically capricious move Mr Rowland suddenly made peace with Mr Fayed a year ago. By then Mr Rowland was also fighting an internal battle with Mr Dieter Bock. A little known German property dealer, Mr Bock was brought into Lonrho by Mr Rowland as heir apparent, but relations quickly turned sour. Before long Mr Rowland was attacking Mr Bock in public. Last October he said: 'I'm still waiting for some performance from him. So far he hasn't delivered a stroke of business. Frankly, he hasn't a clue.' Mr Rowland also questioned the financial backing which enabled Mr Bock to acquire his 18.8 per cent stake in the company. But in the end Mr Rowland was outmanoeuvred. One of the most flattering verdicts on Mr Rowland was delivered in the first and most weighty of the Department of Trade's successive reports on Lonrho. According to the DTI inspectors, he was a man who had 'vision, negotiating ability, determination and personality in unusual measure with unbounded energy to apply his talents'. At 76, that energy is still all too evident, but he will shortly have to find new uses for it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patricia Schuller] </F>   [Excerpts] Regional Development Under Secretary Jorge  Rodriguez Grossi called upon the Metropolitan region mayors to  "begin a clean policy at home" and to "become champions of  administrative probity and moral leaders."    Rodriguez met at the Santiago City Hall -- for the first  time  since he assumed his post -- with 24 of the 34 mayors that form  the Mayors Regional Coordinating Council. [passage omitted]    Rodriguez Grossi said that city halls "are the best organs  to  solve the problems of the people in view of their close  relationship with the neighborhoods." He said they "have the  duty to be morally efficient," adding, "municipal efficiency  will encourage decentralization."    Rodriguez Grossi added: "Clear policies and administrative  probity are essential to the democratic system. Nobody has the  right to mishandle public assets." [passage omitted]</p>

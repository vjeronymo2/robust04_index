			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Spanish flights hit by protests Flight cancellations, delays and scattered clashes between ground staff of the state-owned Iberia airline and police yesterday at Madrid's Barajas airport were a foretaste of the chaos that could afflict air traffic to Spain in the days ahead. Some 30 Madrid-Barcelona shuttle service and other morning rush-hour flights to Spain's main cities were grounded as police took four hours to restore calm to the domestic terminal. At several airports, works committees began sit-ins. International flights were not affected yesterday but airlines were bracing themselves for a worsening situation next week. 'We're not cancelling anything at this stage and we'll just have to wait and see,' said Air France. Yesterday's incidents were caused by Iberia employees affiliated to minority unions. The disruptions are likely to increase on Monday when the main unions will join the protest against a drastic restructuring plan drawn up by the management that involves redundancy notices for 20 per cent of the company's 25,000 employees and the sell-off of most subsidiaries. The powerful Iberia pilots union, which had so far stood back from the dispute, said it would support strike action and would also take the airline's management to court if it pressed ahead with the break-up of the company. The main concern is that wildcat action could close domestic airports. Extremists are calling on Iberia employees to block runways and to cause disruptions similar to those during the violent Air France strike a year ago. The airline is expected to lose Pta44bn (Pounds 218m) and it could face bankruptcy next year unless it severely reduces its costs and raises fresh capital through disposals.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Senate wants more cuts in US aid THE US Senate is planning even deeper cuts in the already dwindling US contribution to the International Development Association, the World Bank unit which provides low interest rate loans to the world's poorest countries. Senator Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Senate subcommittee in charge of foreign aid spending, said yesterday he would cut the US contribution to IDA for the coming year to Dollars 957m (Pounds 621m). The House of Representatives had already slashed the contribution to Dollars 1.024bn, itself 20 per cent down from the amount the US had promised - Dollars 3.75bn over three years - during international negotiations last year over the replenishment of the IDA fund. Like the House, the Senate will provide nothing for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, eliminating the Dollars 70m the US was to pay this year. Mr Leahy's full foreign operations bill, expected to be pushed to completion before the US fiscal year ends on September 30, reflects a severe shrinkage in US foreign aid. The aid bill totals Dollars 12.49bn, Dollars 500m lower than the bill passed by the House and Dollars 2bn less than President Bill Clinton had requested. Aid programmes have been squeezed even further by the need to accommodate a request from Mr Clinton in April, after the budget had been submitted, for an extra Dollars 1.8bn in aid for Russia and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. The version drafted by Mr Leahy and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the senior Republican on the subcommittee, provides more flexibility to move funds to other newly independent republics and away from Russia. It specifically earmarks Dollars 300m for Ukraine. Other than the former Soviet Union, the only area to receive more money is refugee work, where Mr Leahy has marked up Dollars 671m.</p>

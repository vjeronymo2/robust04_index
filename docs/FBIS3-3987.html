Sharing a 97-kilometer border line with Vietnam, the city is  187 kilometers north of Hanoi, capital of Vietnam, and 231  kilometers south of Nanning City, capital of China's Guangxi  Zhuang Autonomous Region.    Now Pingxiang has two import and export posts managed by the  state and five exit posts managed by local government.    Its railway and highway connect with those in Vietnam and  the  city now has become one of the major passages from China to  Vietnam and other countries in Southeast Asia.    In 1992, the State Council approved making the city an open  city at the border and to set up a border economic cooperation  zone of 7.2 square kilometers.    From 1984 when China and Vietnam began to normalize their  relations, the border trade between Pingxiang City and its  Vietnamese counterpart has increased rapidly.    The transaction volume of the trade between the two sides  reached 776 million yuan last year.    Moreover, Pingxiang City held a border commodity fair in the  year, which was attended by about 3,000 Chinese and foreign  businessmen. The fair's transaction value was about 2.3 billion  yuan.    This July, Pingxiang will also sponsor a national border  trade fair.    It is learned that more than 1,000 units and individuals  from  both at home and overseas have sent letters to the organizing  committee of the fair to register to participate in the fair.</p>

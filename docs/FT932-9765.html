			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: GWR Great Western Resources, the US-based oil, gas and coal company which almost collapsed last year following litigation with its largest customer, showed significant improvement over the six months to end-March, when pre-tax losses were reduced from Dollars 13.6m to Dollars 2.03m (Pounds 1.3m). Total revenues of the USM-quoted group improved from Dollars 34.7m to Dollars 59.1m, the bulk of which was derived from the coal operations, which contributed Dollars 45.5m against Dollars 18.5m last time. The dispute with the South Carolina Public Service Authority has now been settled, and the net loss for the period, after a tax credit of Dollars 518,000 (Dollars 610,000), was Dollars 1.51m (Dollars 13m). Losses per share came out at 2 cents (15 cents). The company said it had signed a new credit agreement with Citibank, which permitted a Dollars 34m capital programme for the year. Of this, Dollars 16.9m was spent in the period.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In a commentary today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH  writes on the fighting raging in Yemen. It stresses that this  war, which is not in the interest of Yemen or its people, could  have been averted.    After explaining the effects of this war on Yemen's economy,  AL- THAWRAH calls on the Yemeni leadership to rise to the level  of its national and pan-Arab responsibility, and to respond to  the homeland's call and the UN Security Council's demand to stop  the massacres and destruction.    The Yemeni people, who are concerned about unity, are  certain  that what is taking place is not for the sake of unity, which  they chose and sought for their future so that they might enjoy  safety, security, and progress in all walks of life.    AL-THAWRAH stresses that the continuation of this war  threatens the fabric of the Yemeni homeland by fomenting  sedition and hostility among the sons of the one homeland.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: The Yemeni leadership must take  into consideration the results of continued fighting in terms of  casting doubts on the possibility of achieving Arab unity, and  consequently, damaging the credibility of the principle of Arab  unity, and harming the Arabs' image in the world.</p>

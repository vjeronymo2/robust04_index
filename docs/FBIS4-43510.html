			<p>BFN     [Text] Just after he arrived in Bonn, his first visit  abroad, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi submitted a proposal:  Italy wants to create an autonomous task force to defend human  rights against suffering. But Prime Minister Berlusconi's visit  has also given rise to controversy from the German Left on the  presence of neofascist ministers in the Italian Government.  Giovanni Masotti, our correspondent, reports from Bonn:    [Masotti] Silvio Berlusconi is making his first visit  abroad,  to Bonn, and the prime minister is again under pressure over the  delicate matter of National Alliance ministers in the  government. The controversy has been reopened by the German  Social Democrats who are in serious difficulty following their  defeat in the European elections and by the Greens. The  left-wing opposition is asking Chancellor Kohl both to distance  himself from Berlusconi and to stop Forza Italia from joining  the European People's Party in the European Parliament. The  accusation of having opened the door of government to the  neofascists is rejected by the prime minister in an interview  published today in the Bonn daily newspaper GENERALE ANZEIGER.  Berlusconi says that the National Alliance party fully accepts  and respects the Italian Constitution and the laws of the  democratic state. It has nothing to do with Le Pen or the  German extreme right-wing. The first goal that my government  has set itself, Berlusconi stresses, is that of realizing and  respecting the state of law. A press conference will be held in  the afternoon by the prime minister. He will then immediately  leave for Rome.</p>

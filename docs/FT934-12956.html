			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Tennis: Hong Kong produces another winner PERHAPS it was an omen of better times ahead for Chris Patten in his delicate negotiations with China. When the governor of Hong Kong lunged for his winning backhand volley on the centre court at Victoria Park, the packed stands rose to acclaim him. For a man who has only recently resumed his acquaintance with tennis after a long absence, it had been a brave decision in the first place to agree to appear alongside India's Vijay Amritraj in the One Million Dollar Challenge. This charity match against US ace Roscoe Tanner and the chief secretary of Hong Kong, Sir David Ford (no mean player himself, by the way), was part of the festivities at the annual Marlboro championships to mark the 21st year of professional tennis in the colony. I have to report that the governor has a respectable forehand and a cunning lob on the backhand, plus the ball sense and movement of a natural athlete. He also possesses the sort of determination and shrewd tactical awareness that one would expect from a man who faced constantly faced with having to make difficult decisions. The occasion was suitably worthy: the presentation of a HKDollars 1m cheque to the Tennis Foundation of Hong Kong, a non-profit organization within the Hong Kong LTA which exists to further junior tennis development. Together with the surplus from this year's tournament - which, like the Wimbledon surplus, is ploughed back into the grass roots of the local game - the foundation will have collected some HKDollars 10m since it was formed in 1988. Times were not always so prosperous, nor organised so smoothly. 'We took the plunge in 1972, the fifth year of open tennis,' remembers Ken Catton, a one-time Hong Kong government servant and former president of the HKLTA who has been responsible for bringing the professionals to Hong Kong every year since. 'The total prize money that first year was Dollars 10,000. Our star player, Pancho Gonzales, was flown out from Los Angeles by Cathay Pacific, our joint sponsor, but when I went to meet his flight I discovered that Pancho was not on it. Total panic] 'Frantic phone calls revealed that a family tragedy had delayed him but, true professional that he was, he arrived the next day and duly reached the final where he lost a marvellous match against the Australian Davis Cup stalwart, Mal Anderson.' The ambitious decision in 1973 to join the newly formed Grand Prix, with a Dollars 25,000 tournament as part of the embryo Asian circuit, posed further problems for Catton. The only suitable site, in Victoria Park, had five tarmac courts and no seating accommodation. 'We improvised with centre court stands built of bamboo scaffolding and planks. It was not very comfortable for the spectators, but at least we found a sponsor in BAT and I managed to persuade Rod Laver, the double Grand Slam winner, to play and he became our first champion. Despite the problems, everyone seemed to enjoy it. What's more, we broke even - a triumph for us at that stage.' The following year, a star cast included Ken Rosewall, John Newcombe and Tanner. But there was no final. Torrential rain washed out play altogether and Jack Kramer, the father of post-war professional tennis who had been flown in to commentate on the final for television, found himself under an umbrella. Back in Hong Kong as a guest of this year's anniversary tournament along with Fred Perry, Neale Fraser and ITF President Brian Tobin, Kramer was in reflective mood. 'It was such a shame,' he said. 'They had worked so hard to produce a fine tournament and had sold all the tickets.' More difficult was the decision about distributing the prize money. 'There was nothing in the rules,' said Catton. 'Eventually, we agreed to divide it equally among those still left in.' After a Dollars 50,000 loss in 1975, carried jointly by Catton and a local benefactor, the late MW Lo, a decision was made the following year to form the Hong Kong Tennis Patrons' Association which, it was hoped, would involve the local business community in supporting the annual tournament. That aim was achieved quickly but, even with the support of two blue chip sponsors, Colgate Palmolive and Seiko, the next 12 years were spent frustratingly in the wilderness of the second-tier Grand Prix events. Seven successive appeals to the Men's Professional Tennis Council, to be included in the Super Series category, were denied. In 1988 the HKTPA, supported now by Philip Morris, decided reluctantly to become a special event outside the official circuit under the Marlboro banner. The decision proved an instant success. With the best players now available, the crowds flocked to Victoria Park to see some memorable matches involving former world No. 1 Stefan Edberg, the ever-popular Chinese-American Michael Chang, the Czech stylist Miloslav Mecir (who won in 1988 and '89) and the three-time defending champion, Ivan Lendl. This year's Marlboro, which finishes tomorrow, has included the world's top doubles teams to add a new dimension to an already successful formula. In the true innovative spirit of Hong Kong, the HKTPA have produced another winner as professional tennis in the colony comes of age.</p>

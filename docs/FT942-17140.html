			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Survey of Business in Dorset (11): Forming close links - Education and training Education in Dorset has a proud new symbol, in one of Britain's newest universities. But Bournemouth University, which attained its new status in 1992, has also demonstrated the problems afflicting the new universities which have been created throughout the country. The county's further education system, which last year went through the spasm of reform known as 'incorporation', when colleges were removed from county council control, is also expanding rapidly, but not without teething problems. However, all of them are exhibiting a new entrepreneurial zeal, and forming close links with local industry wherever possible. The university itself says in its mission statement, set in stone in the entrance hall, that it is a 'vocational university'. It therefore shies away from more traditional academic courses in favour of subjects more directly relevant to employers, such as public relations and retail management. About half its students come from Dorset, while the remainder come from various locations around the country. Courses reflect the needs of the local area. One of its specialist courses, in stonework conservation, was inherited from Weymouth where the specialism had been developed to serve local Portland quarries. The department undertakes highly complicated repairs of eroded or damaged stonework from churches. Its courses in travel and tourism remain the most popular in the UK, and cater for a pronounced local need, with most students moving on to work in the travel industry. The newly established Dorset Business School aims to serve local business and operates an executive placement scheme in conjunction with Dorset Tec. It will place unemployed managers, who have been jobless for at least six months, with host companies which have potential projects to be developed. The placements last three months, follow a month-long course at the business school, and could help ensure the county's resources are used to the full as it attempts to emerge from recession. Part-time MBAs are on offer, along with specialised qualifications in export performance and 'European Enterprise Management' - courses which also reflect the county's broader economic concerns. But the university has come a long way since it was founded as the Dorset Institute of Higher Education, in Weymouth, in 1971. It subsequently became the Dorset Institute and, in 1990, was converted into the Bournemouth Polytechnic. Only two years later it was recognised by the government as a university. Dr Bernard McManus, who guided the university throughout this hectic expansion, having taken over as principal in 1983, resigned last month. The university's governing board differed with him over the need for further change, and suggested consolidation was in order. A lecturers' union, Natfhe, had conducted a survey which found that its members had felt 'under stress, undervalued and under fire', while the university governors said that the time was right for consolidation rather than further expansion. Most of the work has been done, and the university now has a striking wooded campus on the outskirts of the town, a succession of bars to keep students entertained, and a ready and willing supply of accommodation from Bournemouth's hotels and boarding houses. Bournemouth and Poole College of Further Education is a rather less glamorous institution, but it is one of the 20 largest in England and Wales, with more than 20,000 students, and is spread across several sites around the conurbation. It has more students than all the county's other further and higher education institutions put together. It has a Services to Business section which provides consultancy for small companies, along with short courses mostly aimed at allowing employers to cope with new regulations or to introduce new technology. For example, foreign language training is available for telephonists, while one-day health and safety courses cover all the recent EU directives which could affect business. The college retains a strong public service ethic and keeps a large bank of computers and word-processors open for use by members of the public to try to improve computer literacy. Much energy goes into improving links with local businesses via the Tec and the chamber of commerce. The new Dorset Business Link should make the college more accessible for employers and most of its specialisms - such as catering, and hairdressing and beauty therapy - cater for Bournemouth's services-led economy. The county's third significant supplier of training and education for employers is Weymouth College, in west Dorset. Occupying buildings vacated by the Dorset Institute when it decamped to Bournemouth, it offers A-levels to Weymouth's 16-year-olds, as well as taking a heavy burden of vocational training. It offers the Flexible Learning Centre, which has tailored courses for businesses, often using interactive media and distance learning - useful for employers in Dorset's rural area where trainees might find it hard to make daily trips to Weymouth. The college's Investors In People award, which it won in 1992, is another powerful signal of its intent to make itself as useful a tool as possible for local companies. However, staff acknowledge that they have a hard task. Weymouth's economy is in poor health, and following the decline of the defence industry, the college itself is probably now the largest employer. It will measure its success by how many new employers it can support.</p>

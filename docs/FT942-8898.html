			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Telemetrix Telemetrix, the supplier of specialised electronic components, test equipment and services, saw its share price fall 3p to 92p yesterday as the company issued a profit warning. Mr Arthur Walsh, chairman, told the annual meeting that 'although it is expected that second half earnings will be above those for the first half it is unlikely that full year earnings will exceed last year'. Last month the company announced that results from its US subsidiary were lower and the shares fell sharply.</p>

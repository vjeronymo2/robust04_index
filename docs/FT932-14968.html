			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Party may fire heads of Spanish companies SPAIN'S conservative opposition party, the Partido Popular, which is believed to be slightly ahead of the ruling Socialist party in opinion polls, is raising doubts about whether the chairmen of some of Spain's largest companies would keep their jobs if the PP won the general election on June 6. The party has said it would leave until after the election any decision on the future shape of the boards of public and semi-public companies. The uncertainty could upset a partial privatisation programme of public companies drawn up by the Socialist government. It includes flotations of shares in Repsol, oil and energy group, sale of up to 24.9 per cent of Argentaria, the state-owned banking group, and, possibly, a further reduction of the stake in the tobacco monopoly Tabacalera and Endesa, the electricity utility. In the case of Repsol and Argentaria, institutions leading the flotations have relied heavily on the experience and capabilities of their respective chairmen - Mr Oscar Fanjul and Mr Francisco Luzon, founding chiefs of the companies - to generate interest among foreign investors. Both men are closely identified with the Socialist government, particularly the finance ministry. Repsol has just rushed through a flotation of 13 per cent of its stock. Wings of song, Page 19</p>

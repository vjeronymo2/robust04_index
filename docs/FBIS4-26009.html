			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  said here today that he expects his upcoming European trip to  help increase understanding and trust as well as cooperation  with the countries he is to visit.    Following the Foreign Ministry's announcement of Li's  official visit to Austria, Germany and Romania from June 29 to  July 12, the premier met with the ambassadors of the three  countries this afternoon.    Li said that China enjoys sound relations with the three  countries and China's friendly cooperation with them is  expanding constantly.    "A long-term, stable and comprehensive cooperation between  China and the three countries is not only in line with their own  interests, but beneficial to world peace and development as  well," he said.    Hoping the coming visit would further push forward Chinese  friendship and cooperation with the three countries, Li said he  expects to exchange views on a broad range of major world issues  with the leaders of these countries.    The Chinese premier said that trade and economic ties take a  major position in China's relations with the three countries,  and China attaches much importance to developing this  relationship, Li said, and this can be well demonstrated by the  fact that a large group of entrepreneurs from major Chinese  enterprises will be with him during the trip and will discuss  trade and economic cooperation with their partners there.    Romanian Ambassador Romulus-Ioan Budura said Li's scheduled  visit to Romania is of major significance and he will be  accorded the most courteous reception.    The visit will exert a positive influence on Romania-China  relations and the regional situation as well, the ambassador  said.    Austrian Ambassador Dietrich Bukowski said that the Austria  visit, the first one made by a Chinese premier, will bring  bilateral relations to their highest point since the two  countries established diplomatic ties 23 years ago.    He expects the visit to speed up the development of  bilateral  relations, especially trade and economic ties.    German Ambassador Armin Freitag said that he believes Li's  visit to Germany will play an important role in furthering trade  and economic cooperation, increasing political dialogue and  promoting cultural exchanges between the two countries.    He said that Germany expects much to result from Li's  upcoming visit and wishes it a great success.</p>

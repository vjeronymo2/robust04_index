			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's global vision No US President has proclaimed more fervently than Mr Bill Clinton the central importance of international economic policy to his country's welfare. In an increasingly interdependent global economy, his choice of priorities is correct. Yet his administration's record in matching words with deeds has been patchy. Mr Clinton deserves much credit for steering the Nafta treaty through Congress and working for the successful completion of the Gatt Uruguay Round last year. Since then, however, his policies have lacked coherent direction  -nowhere more obviously than in his dealings with Asia. He has vacillated over China, while US relations with Japan have been dominated by a myopic obsession with its bilateral trade surplus. In both cases, the US stance has been heavily influenced by narrow, sometimes conflicting, domestic concerns. As a consequence, the administration has seemed not to appreciate fully the bigger national and global interests at stake, and has sometimes pursued contradictory objectives. It has talked enthusiastically of its wish to co-operate more closely with the fast-growing Asian economies of the Pacific rim, while pursuing policies which have severely strained relations with the region's two largest and most powerful count-ries. There are signs that Washington may now be starting to recognise the drawbacks of its approach. One is that Mr Clinton looks increasingly likely to renew China's most favoured nation trading status in the next few days, albeit with possible qualifications. At the same time, his administration has conspicuously toned down its rhetoric towards Japan. US officials have indicated that they are rethinking their tactics in an effort to restart negotiations on a 'framework' trade agreement with Tokyo, which broke down in February. Modest concessions The most plausible explanation in both cases is that US failure to think through its policies at the outset has steadily reduced its available options. Having failed to extract more than modest concessions from Beijing on human rights, Washington appears only now to have realised just how damaging would be the consequences of following its own logic to its conclusion by refusing to extend MFN. In Japan, continuing political instability makes it increasingly doubtful that the country's minority government can deliver macro-economic reforms and market access measures on the scale demanded by Washington, even if it wanted to. Meanwhile, recent US jitters about an uncontrolled slide in the dollar mean that trying to force up the yen is not an option. Offending countries As a result, President Clinton's revival of the Super-301 trade mechanism - apparently in an effort to buy time for further talks with Japan after February's breakdown - looks in danger of backfiring. Mr Clinton must name offending countries, liable for trade sanctions, by September 30. Not to do so would risk accusations at home of weakness; doing so would escalate the confrontation with Japan, without improving the prospect of winning more concessions. Washington's best hope must thus be to stitch up some kind of deal before late September, declare victory, and move on. This would also be the most positive outcome - providing it leads Washington to place future relations with Japan on a more rational footing. US insistence that its economic growth is seriously threatened by closed Japanese markets is overblown. Even if last year's bilateral deficit had been halved entirely through increased US exports - an improbable scenario - it would have added only 0.5 per cent to US gross domestic product. That hardly seems a large enough prize to justify the political effort expended, or the threat US tactics pose to the world trade system. The most important lesson for the US is that the recent problems in its dealings with both Japan and China are, for different reasons, largely of its own making. If they are not to be repeated, President Clinton needs now to clarify and give real substance to his commitment to international economic policy. America's trade partners have every incentive to encourage him in that objective.</p>

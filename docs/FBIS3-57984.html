That is why  some of them are strenuously opposing moves to obtain legal  advice on the issue.    Three of those members, the United States, Britain and  France, are extremely sensitive about the legality of nuclear  weapons. Britain and France, in particular, owe their  precarious position as permanent members to their past status as  great powers and to their possession of nuclear arms.    A request by the UN General Assembly to the International  Court of Justice (ICJ) -- the "World Court" -- to advise if the  threat or use of nuclear weapons is in any circumstances  permitted under international law, Resolution L25, has been  dropped. But another, asking if use of nuclear weapons would be  a breach of international law, including the constitution of the  World Health Organisation (WHO), is still being considered.    Although only confined to the health and environmental  aspects, the question is causing deep unease. The U.S. State  Department has reportedly set aside $800,000 to challenge the  submission of the question to the ICJ. From 17 to 26 January,  the executive board of the WHO meets to discuss its agenda for  the 1994 World Health Assembly session in May. The U.S. State  Department is working "flat-out" on a counter-resolution, saying  the question lies outside the WHO's competence.    Although a straightforward challenge to the legality of  nuclear arms has therefore failed, an indirect one, via their  longterm health and environmental effects, could succeed.  Chemical and biological weapons are already banned by  international conventions. The declared nuclear powers have a  vested interest in banning these weapons, which are easier for  less-developed countries to make, while preserving a  near-monopoly on nuclear weapons (Israel excepted), even though  nuclear weapons are, potentially, more destructive. Making them  illegal could have profound implications: it would give the  nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), up for renewal in 1995,  a legal basis -- which it lacks at the moment.    Existing conventions ban weapons which release poisonous  gases, affect neutral states, cause widespread, severe and  long-term environmental damage. The prevalent view is that in  some circumstances it is acceptable to blast, burn or slice  people to death, while it is never acceptable to poison them,  irradiate them or infect them with deadly microbes.    But nuclear weapons do have some characteristics that have  led to chemical and biological weapons being outlawed --  long-term and indiscriminate effects. Such effects are the  target of a fundamental challenge to the privileged and  increasingly anomalous position of nuclear weapons.    Suggestions that big nuclear weapons could be made illegal  while small ones should be allowed have run up against the  awkward fact that in big weapons the effects of blast and heat  predominate, whereas below about 10 kilotons radiation effects  predominate. So small nuclear weapons are less acceptable to  conventional military morality than big ones.    The British government's attitude to resolutions on the  legality of nuclear weapons has been robust. Asked about the  fate of L25, the Minister of State at the Foreign Office, David  Heathcoat-Amory, said on 24 November: "The resolution was, in  the end, not put to a vote. We believe anyway that the use of  nuclear weapons would have to be judged as lawful or not in the  light of the particular circumstances in which they were used  and that therefore it would be wrong to burden the International  Court of Justice with this hypothetical question."    Robert Green, a former Navy commander and nuclear bomber  pilot turned antinuclear campaigner, has become involved in the  World Court Project, as it is known. He believes it is far from  a hypothetical question; such a technicality -- an ICJ opinion  that nuclear weapons would violate the WHO constitution -- could  completely upset the nuclear status quo and bring about a  disarmament race which Britain could lead. If it seized on this  opportunity to renounce its nuclear weapons -- the first state  to do so -- it would gain great international prestige, making a  virtue out of a new necessity.    An ICJ opinion is not mandatory, but it could cause  enormous problems for anyone in charge of nuclear weapons. The  Manual of Military Law says: "If a person...receives an order to  do some act that is manifestly illegal, he is bound under a  legal duty to refuse to carry out that order." Firing a Trident  missile would be, unquestionably, illegal.    Mr Green believes an ICJ opinion could act as a catalyst,  either isolating Britain further from changing world opinion or,  if used cleverly, be open to exploitation. If the World Court  were to deliver an oninion on the illegality of nuclear weapons  before the NPT comes up for renewal in 1995, it could have a  profound effect on disarmament.    Its opinion could reflect, and stimulate, a change in the  mindset of governments. The time might be right. It is  increasingly difficult for Britain to maintain with any  sincerity that its deterrent is "independent," When the last of  the WE-177 free-fall bombs becomes unusable, around 2006, it  will be hard to see how Britain could use any nuclear weapon  except as an arm of the U.S.    There is increasing concern about the disposal of nuclear  material, and a comprehensive test-ban treaty is also on the  cards. The technology of modelling the likely performance of  nuclear warheads has, according to defence sources, been  developed to the stage where it is no longer necessary to test  warheads to keep arsenals in working condition. But it would  presumably be impossible to develop new nuclear weapons without  some testing. Britain, having relied on U.S. facilities in the  Nevada desert, has more of a problem than other nuclear powers.    Britain and France are nervous about their permanent  membership of the Security Council. If nuclear weapons are to be  the sole qualification, then why not admit Israel? If economic  and political muscle are the qualification, then Germany and  Japan have strong cases.    Or perhaps participation in UN peace-keeping operations  around the world should carry weight -- an area where Britain  and France can claim to have done a certain amount. Whatever the  future holds, clinging to nuclear weapons as an entry-ticket to  permanent Security Council membership is looking increasingly  difficult.    Should the World Court rule that nuclear weapons are  illegal,  many people who until recently supported the retention of  nuclear weaponry might favour dismantling Britain's nuclear  arsenal.</p>

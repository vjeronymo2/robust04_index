			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nissan stated that it agrees that in-house parts and components production should be included as parts content in determining country of origin for engines and transmissions. It also stated that, as proposed, final engine assembly should be designated to begin at the point in the production process when the block and head are joined, and that for transmissions, final assembly should be designated to begin at the point in the production process at which transmission parts are assembled in the transmission casing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota stated that because an assembled engine block is not equivalent to an engine (for any piston engine, gasoline or diesel, there must also be a cylinder head), it recommends that the point of engine assembly should occur no sooner than the point at which the block and head are attached to one another. That commenter stated that assembly labor prior to the attachment of the head to the block should not be excluded, as such labor constitutes, by definition, part of the value of the individual engine block and cylinder head, neither of which by itself constitutes an engine. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BMW stated that it supports treating on-site production of engine and transmission parts in a similar manner to on-site production of parts at a manufacturer's final assembly plant. BMW added, however, that it believes the definitions for the starting points of final assembly for the engine and transmission need to be precise so that substantial variances cannot be achieved by modifying the assembly sequence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the comments, NHTSA has concluded that production of parts at an engine or transmission plant should be treated in a similar manner with respect to determining country of origin of the engine or transmission as the production of parts at a final assembly plant is treated with respect to determination of a vehicle's parts content. The agency notes that the basic value of an engine or transmission is not primarily related to either the costs of assembly or the costs of the raw materials, but is instead related to the costs of producing parts. If an engine or transmission plant was highly integrated and all parts were produced at the plant, a determination of country of origin that did not reflect the costs of producing parts would be based entirely on the costs of raw materials. The agency believes that such a determination would be of little meaning. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, however, the agency must give full effect to the congressional intent to exclude the costs of assembling engines and transmissions. NHTSA believes that the best way to accomplish this is to specify that all value added at the transmission and engine plant is excluded from the calculation of origin, with the exception of the costs of producing individual parts of the transmission/engine. Individual parts refers to the most basic level of parts used to assemble an engine or transmission and not subassemblies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to ensuring that engine and transmission assembly costs are excluded as required by section 210, the agency also believes that this approach is much clearer than the specific one discussed in the NPRM preamble. The agency believes it could be difficult or impossible to define the starting points of final assembly for the engine and transmission in ways that are appropriate for all manufacturers. NHTSA is particularly concerned that, under such an approach, manufacturers might be able to modify the assembly process in ways that would reduce the costs of assembling the engine/transmission to a nullity. This would be possible, for example, under the approach suggested by Toyota. Such a result would be inconsistent with the statutory requirement that engine and transmission origin determinations be made based on the costs of direct materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Other issues concerning determining country of origin for engines and transmissions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> AAMA stated that &sect;583.8 refers to determining country of origin for each individual engine and transmission. That organization stated that this is inconsistent with section 210(f)(10)(B) of the statute, which specifies that the following groupings are used in determining the origin and value added of engines/transmissions: engines of the same displacement produced at the same plant and transmissions of the same type produced at the same plant. AAMA noted that neither the statute nor proposed regulation defines ``type'' of transmission. It suggested that transmission type be defined as follows: In determining the origin of transmissions produced in the same plant, a type should have the same characteristics: driveline, number of forward gears, controls, and layout. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAMA also commented that the regulation should specify that country of origin is determined once a model year using same methodology as vehicles, except United States and Canada are treated separately. That organization also stated that the regulation should make it clear that calculation of origin of engine/transmission is different for determining overall U.S./Canadian content. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Honda stated that the proposed regulation does not address the appropriate groupings of engines and transmissions for purposes of calculating country of origin. It also noted that the proposed regulatory text refers to a separate country of origin determination for each individual engine and transmission, and argued that this is not contemplated by the Labeling Act and would be extremely burdensome. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Honda stated that it believes the statutory groupings in some cases may be broader than appropriate to give meaningful information to consumers. It cited the example of an engine that is available in two types, both of same displacement and both manufactured at same plant, one of which is supercharged and the other standard. Honda stated that the two engines may have very different parts sources. Honda suggested that final rule provide manufacturers discretion to make country of origin determinations for engine and transmission subgroupings within the statutory grouping framework. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA agrees with the commenters that section 210 requires country of origin determinations for engines and transmissions, for items four and five of the label, to be based on groups of engines. The agency also agrees with AAMA's suggested definition for transmission type. For purposes of consistency and clarity, the agency believes it is more appropriate to provide a definition than simply leave subgroupings to the discretion of the manufacturer. The final rule reflects these changes. The agency does not agree that it is appropriate to permit subgroupings of engines below the level specified in section 210, since the statute specifies the groups to be used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of the procedure for determining country of origin for engines and transmissions (for purposes of items four and five of the label only), the agency is specifying a similar procedure for determining country of origin of the components that comprise the engine/transmission as for making country of origin determinations for item two of the label, i.e., manufacturers may use the greatest share of value approach or any other approach that is used for customs (U.S. or foreign) purposes, so long as a consistent methodology is employed for all parts. The U.S. and Canada, however, are treated separately for making these determinations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

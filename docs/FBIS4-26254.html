			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai Municipal  Government announced Friday [17 June] the removal of the No. 2  Commerce Bureau and Aquatic Products Bureau.    This is another step taken by the government to streamline  its structure.    The dismissal of the two bureaus does not mean an emergence  of another two departments to replace them. According to the  reform program, the government has decided to set up two offices  with only 20 staff each to carry out trade management and some  administrative functions. The two bureaus had a combined  employment of 330.    The two bureaus were set up around 1960 to take charge of  the  production, sales and supply of non-staple foodstuffs.    Shanghai has established a market mechanism with the  government exercising macro-economic control while markets  determine prices. Also, cooperatives and individuals are  occupying a greater portion of the market. All these have made  some of the functions of government departments obsolete.    The closing of the two bureaus is a test in streamlining  Shanghai's government structure. According to a high ranking  official, the mode of management of enterprises is changing.  The state administration of enterprises has turned to an  indirect way. More decision making power will be given to  enterprises.    Since non-staple foodstuffs and aquatic products remain  highly sensitive to market fluctuations, these commodities still  need close government supervision. The newly established  Shanghai non-staple foodstuffs and aquatic products offices will  help to control their production and sales, keep reserves of  sensitive goods, and make better use of production and sales  funds.</p>

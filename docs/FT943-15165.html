			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Housing funds sought in Germany Representatives of UK housing associations will today invite German mortgage banks to raise finance for building inexpensive homes for rent or sale. The Housing Corporation, the quango that distributes government grants to English housing associations, is co-hosting a seminar in Frankfurt for more than 30 German banks in its quest for new sources of funding for housing associations. Associations at present raise about 40 per cent of the cost of building new homes from private-sector borrowing. They have raised Pounds 5.5bn since 1989, including more than Pounds 1bn through sterling debentures. The corporation estimates that associations will need another Pounds 7bn over the next four years, and is keen to expand the investor base. It hopes to persuade the German banks to issue sterling Pfandbriefe, long-term fixed-interest bonds, to raise funds. Speakers at the seminar, organised in association with Rheinische Hypothekenbank, include representatives of the Treasury and Department of the Environment, as well as current UK lenders.

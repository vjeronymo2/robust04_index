He also raved that  the workers, entrepreneurs and "government" should all make  every possible effort to make this year the first year of  "labor-management cooperation".    Commenting on this, a MINJU CHOSON analyst today says it is  another crafty sermon aimed at destroying the labor movement.    The news analyst goes on:    The traitor Kim Yong-sam's call for concerted efforts of the  workers, entrepreneurs and "government" stems from his ulterior  intention to benumb the fighting consciousness of workers  through tieup between the puppet authorities and comprador  business men.    He blared that workers should completely discard the concept  of the past that antagonism and struggle are the only way of  living. This means, in the final analysis, that workers should  not put any any demand, not wage any struggle but meekly obey  the acts of exploitation by entrepreneurs.    His talk about active support for the businesses successful  in "labor-management cooperation" and no profits for those under  disputes means that privileges and special favor will be granted  to the comprador businesses and that the authorities and  entrepreneurs will contain the labor moement of workers through  their tieup.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam, flocking together with the  comprador clan which battens on the sweat and blood of people,  will never stand on the side of workers.</p>

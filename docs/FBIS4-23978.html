			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marie-France Cros: "Government: Limited Options"] </F>   [Text] The reactions continue to the election on Tuesday  [14 June] of Zairian Pime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo by the HCR-PT  [High Council of the Republic--Transitional Parliament]. While  the new prime minister has announced, apparently without giving  many details, that he will seek to "restore authority to the  state," the Permanent Mission of the Tshisekedi government in  Brussels (a kind of alternative embassy) told LA LIBRE BELGIQUE  what it sees as Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo's "real strategy."  <H5>  Personal Fortunes </H5>   According to Mr. Dungia and Mr. Bakima, the next government  intends to make a big show in the social and economic fields to  "counterbalance the popularity of Etienne Tshisekedi" by  supplying drugs to hospitals (where the situation is critical),  by paying the military so that they no longer need to plunder  and demand money from their citizens, and by relieving the  overcrowding in their camps. "They also want to give $50  million a year to the [Zairian] president so that he will leave  them free to run the Central Bank."    The two men stated that this money and that to be used to  pay  ministers, and pay them well, will come from a fund set up by Mr  Kengo Wa Dondo's party, the financially well-endowed UDI [Union  of Democratic Independents], thanks to the personal wealth of  its members. "In 1991, the UDI claimed it was ready to  repatriate $900 million to help the (radical) opposition" of  which it was a member until the spring of 1994, Mr. Bakima  remembers.    And why should such a sacrifice be open to criticism?  "Because it is an imposture" Mr. Dungia replies. "What they  really want is to prevent those who have been caught out by the  "Committee for illegally acquired assets" of the Sovereign  National Council from being judged. They want an amnesty to be  able to keep what they have already got." Our interlocutors  stated that on 8 June, Mr. Tshisekedi was visited by a  delegation from the moderate opposition which "again asked for  special guarantees to safeguard its assets. He refused." On 9  June, officials of the HCR-PT decided that the prime minister  would be elected. On the 14 June, with Tshisekedi's candidacy  rejected, Kengo Wa Dondo was elected.  <H5>  Government </H5>   Whatever the situation, Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo's first job will  be to form his government. By the terms of the "special  arrangement for fair and balanced power-sharing during the  period of transition," the government will consist of 46  members: 28 ministers (including four deputy prime ministers)  and 18 deputy ministers. Ministries must also be shared out "on  an equal basis" between the radical opposition and the allied  parties on the one hand, and the presidential party on the  other, "to avoid a single political group from having exclusive  control over national interests."    The options open to Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo are therefore  relatively limited, which is not necessarily going to make his  job any easier as, according to one Zairian observer:  "Everybody seems to want to be a minister. The wrangling is  going to increase rivalries within the alliances."</p>

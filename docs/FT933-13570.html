			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / UN sees progress in Iraqi missile talks A SENIOR UN envoy said last night he and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz had made progress in talks to defuse a weapons crisis. 'I think we have cleared a large number of issues so now we have to conclude and to sum up the results,' Mr Rolf Ekeus said after a meeting in Baghdad with Mr Aziz, aimed at ending the impasse over UN demands for monitoring of two missile-testing sites. He said the two sides would conclude the discussions today. The talks were unexpectedly joined by Mr Riyadh al-Qaysi, the Foreign Ministry official who returned late last week from heading an Iraqi delegation to the UN in New York, for talks on allowing a limited exception to the post-Gulf war ban on the country's oil sales. Mr Ekeus earlier said he could draw no conclusion from Mr al-Qaysi's attendance. But the official's inclusion marks the first time Iraq has directly linked the two UN negotiations and suggests Baghdad is seeking a broader understanding rather than simply a solution to the missiles stand-off. The oil talks were suspended at Mr al-Qaysi's request. But UN diplomats suggested the two sides had produced a draft text of an agreement.</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Money Markets: French and Danes cut BOTH France and Denmark cut their short-term interest rates yesterday, giving a small lift to European markets ahead of this week's Bundesbank council meeting, writes James Blitz. The Bank of France's 50 basis-point cut in its overnight rate of lending was the fifth successive easing since the August crisis in the exchange rate mechanism, and took the rate to 7.75 per cent. Denmark reduced its 14-day CD rate from 11 per cent to 10.5 per cent, its first easing of policy since the widening of currency bands. France's move was followed yesterday afternoon by a suspension of lending through the overnight rate window for the remainder of the day. The market viewed this as a technical move rather than a signal on policy, with one dealer suggesting that the French money market had been amply supplied with funds. However, another dealer wondered whether this might be a precursor to a reintro-duction of the five to 10-day lending window, which had been at 7.75 per cent before being increased to 10 per cent in the run-up to the ERM crisis. In any event, the cut in the overnight rate was well priced in by the futures market, and the September Pibor contract dropped 9 basis points to close at 93.19. The December contract declined 6 basis points to finish at 94.27. In Germany, Euromark contracts were a little more buoyant in the run-up to this week's Bundesbank council meeting. The September contract gained 3 basis points to end at 93.55 and the December contract was up 3 basis points at a closing 94.02. The rise in these contracts was partly due to speculation that the Bundesbank would lower the discount rate on Thursday. However, few dealers believe an easing in the repo rate is likely in its wake. Call money remained at 6.90 per cent yesterday, modestly above the repo rate level. Short-term interest rates in the sterling cash market were fractionally softer, helped by the firm despatch of a large Pounds 1.85bn daily shortage and anticipation of policy easing in Germany. Three-month money closed at 5 27/32 per cent yesterday, a fraction below the 5 7/8 per cent at which it had stood unmoved last week. The December short sterling contract was up 2 basis points at 94.59.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Chairman Wolfgang </F> Schaeuble by Alfred Merta and F. Weckbach-Mara; place and date  not given: "German Blue Helmets To Sarajevo?"]    [Text] [BILD AM SONNTAG] What are the topics with which  you want to get the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian  Social Union [CSU] out of its low in the election year?    [Schaeuble] The economic situation is improving. We are  just starting to bring about a change in the labor market. The  new laws and measures improve opportunities for people looking  for jobs, especially by means of creating more part-time jobs.  The effort to provide jobs for everybody is our foremost aim.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] The Social Democratic Party's [SPD]  objectives sound very similar; are there any differences left?    [Schaeuble] Mr. Scharping has made his party look as though  it is in agreement by sweeping all controversial issues under  the carpet and avoiding clear standpoints. This can be seen  from his election program. He announces higher taxes, at the  same time saying that tax increases are very bad for economic  recovery. We will force Scharping to put his cards on the table  in many respects. For instance: Does the SPD want to go on  ruining the car industry and pushing individual transport aside  because it does not want to build any new roads but enforce new  bans instead? And the crucial question whether he is prepared  to enter into an alliance with the Greens is also something that  Scharping will not be able to avoid until polling day.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Can you promise that the CDU/CSU is not  planning any new tax increases?    [Schaeuble] The introduction of the solidarity tax on 1  January 1995 has been decided upon, and we will not reverse this  decision. But we will do everything we can to make do without  any further tax increases. In the long run, we must be aiming  at lowering the taxation level, that is, everything the state  expects of its citizens in terms of taxes, from the current 52  to 45 percent. This means, taxes must be lowered in the long  run.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] How do you want to settle the billions in  debts of the Federal Railroad, and how do you want to build  additional roads?    [Schaeuble] In building roads we will have to count on  private funding. This will mean introducing charges for the use  of certain railroad lines.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Before the summer recess, the Federal  Constitutional Court will announce its decision on Bundeswehr  missions abroad. What consequences will this have?    [Schaeuble] We will act politically on that decision. The  CDU/CSU is convinced that peace in Europe and in the world can  only be preserved by international solidarity in peacekeeping  missions. But these cannot take place if the Germans refuse to  participate. This is why we have to take part in missions abroad  assuming equal rights and duties. I am convinced that the  Federal Constitutional Court will confirm our view. Of course,  we will have to decide carefully on a case by case basis whether  and in what way we want to participate. But in principle, I do  not rule out anything.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Not even a German blue-helmet  participation in reconstructing Bosnia, if the parties concerned  want it?    [Schaeuble] If all the parties concerned want such a  Bundeswehr mission in Bosnia, we, in agreement with our partners  in Europe and the alliance, should not basically ignore these  wishes.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] You yourself have demanded that our  Bundeswehr should also be used for tasks in Germany. Do you  still hold this view?    [Schaeuble] The Bundeswehr is not a reserve police force.  But if situations occur where the police do not have sufficient  staffing and equipment and where the Bundeswehr could help, we  should discuss how this could be done. This is what has been  happening for a long time in all other countries -- from Austria  to new Zealand, from America to Holland.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Brandenburg Minister-President Stolpe has  named a witness for the defense. Does this resolve the dispute?    [Schaeuble] No, certainly not. Stolpe's example shows quite  clearly: Political standards in Germany are no longer right.  If Mr. Stolpe were a member of the CDU, he would have lost his  office of minister-president long ago. The same goes for Oskar  Lafontaine in the Saarland and Hans Eichel in Hesse, or Klaus  Wedemeier in Bremen. The worst affairs remain without  consequences in the SPD. The Stolpe case is no longer a matter  that just concerns the land organization, it has become a case  for the SPD leadership. I call on Mr. Scharping to make sure  that all the cards are finally put on the table in Brandenburg.  Scharping has to force Stolpe to tell the truth and take the  consequences. Otherwise he is damaging democracy.</p>

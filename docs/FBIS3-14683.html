[passage omitted]    He added that the council heard a report from the minister  of  state for foreign affairs on his participation in the Arab  League foreign ministers meetings. He said Jordan is very eager  that Arab meetings reflect the Arab desire and tendency to hold  a unified position.    He said Jordan believes that there are problems facing the  process of clearing Arab atmosphere and returning Arab relations  to their previous situation, saying Jordan has an open heart to  all Arab brothers who want to have relations with Jordan on the  basis of fraternity and sincerity.    Dr. al-'Anani said the Arab League Council delayed  discussing  the subject of the Arab League Charter, on which there were  several ideas presented for discussion. He said His Majesty  King Husayn was the first to demand the reconsideration of the  charter so that it can cope with new circumstances.    As for bilateral relations with Egypt, Dr. al-'Anani said  the  minister of state for foreign affairs met at the sidelines of  the Arab foreign ministers meetings with Egyptian Prime Minister  Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, and an agreement was reached to hold meetings  of the Jordanian-Egyptian higher joint committee in the second  half of April. The meetings had previously been delayed.  [passage omitted]    Answering a question on the U.S. proposal that a barge carry  out inspection at the port of al-'Aqabah, Dr. al-'Anani said the  presence of a barge in the port would conflict with Jordanian  sovereignty and that Jordan could not accept this. He said that  there has been no such proposal at all.    He said what was demanded was that a neutral international  quarter assigned by the United Nations carry out inspection of  vessels that unload their cargoes in the port of al-'Aqabah. He  said that Jordan rejects the presence of any military forces  from any party because Jordan maintains its sovereignty. Had  Jordan been willing to relinquish this sovereignty, it would  have allowed the ships that inspect al-'Aqabah-bound vessels to  cross into Jordanian territorial waters to reach the port and  carry out inspections. This was the original problem that  delayed the vessels in the past, because the government totally  rejects this.    He said we accept the presence of civilian technical  observers from a specialized neutral quarter who give  certificates that the inspected cargoes do not contain anything  that violates the economic sanctions.</p>

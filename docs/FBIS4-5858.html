			<p>BFN     [Text] Reports of illegal loggings have dropped  dramatically following the adoption of the National Forestry  Amendment Act 1993 by all Malaysian states.    The director general of the Forestry Department, Dr. Ismail  Awang, said there is a 50-percent drop in the number of cases  reported in Pahang, Kelantan, and Perak since the act was  enforced in February.    The amended act provides for a maximum 500,000 ringgit, and  the mandatory jail term from one to 20 years for those convicted  of illegal logging.    Speaking to reporters in Kuala Lumpur, Dr. Ismail said the  department had also embarked on a five-year forest management  plan as a guide for more practical forest management.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Novi Sad, March 14 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Deputy  Foreign Minister Radoslav Bulajic said that the Hungarian  minority in Serbia's northern province of Vojvodina already has  cultural autonomy so such demands by the National Party of  Ethnic Hungarians in this Serbian province are unnecessary. In a  statement to Radio Novi Sad, Bulajic specified that the  Hungarian minority in Vojvodina had classes in its mother tongue  from kindergarten to university, that it had radio and TV  programmes in Hungarian as well as its own theatres, cultural,  art and sports associations. Bulajic's statement was prompted by  his meeting with Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky in  Novi Sad on Sunday. Jeszensky urged Yugoslav and Serbian  authorities to meet the requests of the Democratic Community of  Vojvodina Hungarians (DZVM) for a cultural autonomy.    Jeszenszky paid an unofficial visit to Vojvodina to attend  the centennial commemorating the death of Hungarian  revolutionary Kossuth Lajos which was organized by the DZVM.    Bulajic underscored that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,  more than any other neighbouring country, enabled all minorities  to exercise their human rights, even beyond the standards and  norms stipulated by international documents. Commenting on the  conclusions of the U.N. Commission for Human Rights adopted at a  recent session in Geneva on an alleged violation of human rights  in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Bulajic stressed that the  commission was presented with misinformations coming from the  secessionist movement of ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern  province of Kosovo-Metohija. The Yugoslav diplomat said he was  confident that such misinformations and accusations did not  exist in Vojvodina, because human rights of national minorities  were respected in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia more than  in any other neighbouring country and even beyond international  standards.</p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE QUEST FOR NORIEGA;  </P> <P> U.S. FREES $70 MILLION FOR PANAMA;  </P> <P> ASSETS: FUNDS BLOCKED DURING THE NORIEGA DICTATORSHIP ARE RELEASED TO THE NEW  GOVERNMENT.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, pledging help to restore Panama's ravaged economy,  turned over to the U.S.-backed regime of President Guillermo Endara $70 million  in government funds that had been frozen during the dictatorship of Manuel A.  Noriega, the State Department announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the Administration soon will take  additional steps, including restoration of another $300 million in blocked  assets, to repair the damage to the economy caused by the two-week-old American  invasion and more than two years of U.S. economic sanctions.  </P> <P> "We are making the frozen Panamanian assets available to the new government of  Panama in an orderly manner," Boucher said. "Some $70 million in blocked funds  was transferred back to the Endara government over the weekend."  </P> <P> He said the government is working to restore Panama's access to programs of the  U.S. Agriculture Department, the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private  Investment Corp. He added that the United States will resume buying sugar from  Panama and restore Panama's status as a favored trading partner.  </P> <P> Boucher said a delegation headed by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S.  Eagleburger and Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson will meet today with  Endara and other top Panamanian officials to determine that nation's economic  needs.  </P> <P> He said the delegation will determine the level and the nature of a new U.S.  aid program intended "to restore democratic institutions and processes and to  promote sustained private-sector-led growth," Boucher said.  </P> <P> Although other officials said that Eagleburger has been deeply involved in  negotiations to bring Noriega to the United States for trial on  drug-trafficking charges, Boucher said the focus of the delegation will be on  economic matters.  </P> <P> "The purpose of their visit is to learn firsthand from the Panamanian  leadership about their plans for economic recovery and to make recommendations  to President Bush on ways in which the United States can be of assistance to  Panamanian recovery efforts," Boucher said.  </P> <P> He said Eagleburger and Robson will return to Washington late today but that  other members of their delegation will remain in Panama for at least a week to  continue to study the nation's economic requirements.  </P> <P> Endara, apparent winner of last year's Panamanian election before it was  nullified by Noriega, was installed as chief of state after the U.S. invasion.  Although the Panamanian election commission certified Endara's victory last  week, only about 10 nations have joined the United States in recognizing his  government.  </P></p>

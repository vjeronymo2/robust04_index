			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Chinese work deaths at 15,000 MORE than 15,000 Chinese were killed in industrial accidents last year, reflecting extremely lax safety standards that prevail throughout the country. Official figures, released for the first time yesterday, confirm fears held by such institutions as the International Labor Organisation. Chinese officials blamed the high casualty rate - the figures showed a 3 per cent increase on the year before - on 'negligence at some enterprises which tried to gain higher output at the expense of worker's safety.' Mr Sun Lianjie, director of the Ministry of Labour's safety bureau, said China's economic boom - growth in the first three quarters exceeded 14 per cent - and the commissioning of many new enterprises had intensified problems. 'Some workers have never received proper training in labour safety and know little about safety procedures or self-protection,' he said. Mr Sun called for tougher laws and regulations to 'check the increasing trend of fatal industrial accidents.' Among industrial fatalities were 9,683 miners. This was a decrease of 1.4 per cent on the year before. At the end of 1992, 148m workers were employed in industry across the country. Annual average wages reached Dollars 476, up 6.7 per cent on the year before. Road tolls were also published recently. Officially, about 60,000 people died on China's roads last year, but the road safety authorities believe the toll was probably much higher. AP adds from Beijing: Chinese police have arrested 1,580 people on suspicion of robbing tombs and smuggling the antiques found inside, an official newspaper said yesterday. The China Daily said more than 3,100 artifacts have been recovered. Feature, Page 7</p>

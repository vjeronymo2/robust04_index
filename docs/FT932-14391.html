			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / International Company News: Sappi beats expectations and pays dividend SAPPI, the forest products group in the Gencor stable, surprised the market with better-than-expected results for the year to February and with a final dividend cut of only a third, following predictions it would be passed. The final dividend was reduced to 80 cents per share from 120 cents, bringing the payment for the year to 160 cents - a cut of 20 per cent on the 1992 figure. Mr Eugene van As, executive chairman, said Sappi, which derives 63 per cent of its turnover overseas, had suffered from the turmoil in European currency markets which had driven world paper and pulp prices to uneconomic levels. He added that the adverse trading conditions had hit all areas of the group's operations. Hannover Papier, the German coated wood-free paper manufacturer, acquired last May, suffered from the recession and adverse exchange rate fluctuations. Mr Van As said it would achieve results close to break-even in the year under review. Sappi Europe, which holds Sappi's UK mills, made a loss while Sappi Trading, the international trading arm, traded profitably. Turnover for the year rose by 28.5 per cent to R4.7bn, reflecting for the first time the inclusion, for six months, of Hannover Papier.</p>

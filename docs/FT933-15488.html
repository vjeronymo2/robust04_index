			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Quadramatic price set at 123p SHARES IN Quadramatic were yesterday priced at 123p, putting a flotation value of Pounds 36.4m on the coin-handling and optical group. Based on pro-forma forecasts for the year to September, the shares are on a prospective multiple of 13.5 and offer a notional dividend yield of 4.6 per cent. The placing and intermediates offer, with Granville Davies as broker, will raise about Pounds 20m to pay off debt. No existing shareholders are selling shares, and 25 per cent of the shares on offer will go to retail investors. Quadramatic is backed by Mr Tony Gartland and Mr Jeff Whalley, two deal makers who during the eighties expanded FKI, the electrical engineering group. The company currently comprises Coin Controls International, an Oldham-based maker of coin-handling equipment, and Combined Optical Industries, a Slough-based company which moulds plastic optical products. It plans to grow by acquiring high-margin engineering companies, with a broader spread of products and markets. Mr Gartland, chairman, said the offer had been comfortably subscribed, but admitted that the shares had been priced a little more keenly than he had hoped for. He said: 'The traffic is quite congested out there in the fund-raising market for small companies. It makes some of the institutions quite picky.' Quadramatic predicts it will make pro-forma profits of at least Pounds 4.4m in the 12 months to September. Mr Gartland hopes to make an acquisition in the first year which would boost profits by 50 per cent. That, combined with organic growth, would increase earnings by 20 per cent. Applications for the shares will close on July 14 and dealings start on July 20. COMMENT Like General MacArthur, Mr Gartland has told City institutions: 'I shall return.' The group plans to expand and does not want to incur significant gearing, so further share issues are on the cards. This enthusiasm for acquisition explains the coolness of some institutions, but the group has specified its areas of interest and had no real difficulty in finding sufficient support. The core businesses are in high quality niches with good management, and the Oldham factory has sufficient spare capacity to offer a rapid pay back on the right acquisitions. The limited scope of the retail offer might help push the shares to an initial premium, but the long-term performance of the shares will depend on the quality of future acquisitions.</p>

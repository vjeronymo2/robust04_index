			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Small businesses hope for green light against red tape: An issue that is seen as more important than the weight of the tax burden - Spring Budget A SMALL manufacturing companies' investment scheme, an improved Business Expansion Scheme and an increase in the funds available for the Loan Guarantee Scheme are the sort of measures that business lobbyists would like to see in the Budget on March 16 to help small businesses recover from the recession. All three measures were introduced last time British industry was struggling out of a recession. In the Budget presented by Sir Geoffrey Howe in March 1983 they formed part of what the FT called 'probably a record number of new measures' to help small businesses. Ten years on little appears to have changed. The small-business lobbyists are pressing hard for something to replace the BES - which is due to expire at the end of this year - and for a revitalisation of the Loan Guarantee Scheme to make it more attractive to the banks and more affordable to business. Manufacturing businesses do not rank a specific mention in this year's Budget submissions but they would derive the most benefit if the chancellor responded to pleas for a more generous regime of first-year investment allowances. In 1983 engineering was considered an important enough element of the manufacturing sector to rank for special treatment. Hopes that something will be done for the makers of goods rather than the providers of services received a boost on Thursday with the strong endorsement given to the manufacturing sector by Mr John Major. Exporters may also have taken encouragement from the prime minister's evident wish to promote exports. Last week, shortly after returing from a successful trade mission to Saudi Arabia, Mr Major offered to take more businessmen with him on foreign trips if it helped to open doors. More generous government support for export credit insurance is one item on the lobbyists' shopping list. Mr Major also gave a broad hint in the Commons that small businesses would be among the main beneficiaries of any tax concessions. A study of ministerial speeches in the weeks leading up to the Budget is probably not the most effective way of divining the chancellor's intentions. The Treasury's purdah rules are unlikely to permit even the prime minister to signal the government's intentions in any detail. But inevitably the business lobbyists are attempting to read the runes of government policy as best they can. They are trying to sketch in those elements of their detailed Budget presentations which are most likely to survive the Treasury's red pencil. The constraints imposed by a ballooning public sector borrowing requirement will put a brake on the more costly measures which the small-business lobbyists have been seeking - such as cuts in the uniform business rate. Calls for a reduction in capital gains tax, which at parity with top-rate income tax is seen as a brake on enterprise, may also go unheeded. Mr Ian Peters, deputy director of smaller-companies policy at the CBI, said: 'The key is that they will be looking for issues which don't cost very much.' This squeeze on government revenues could persuade the chancellor to take the low-cost route to pleasing small businesses by cutting red tape. Administering the tax and social security system represents a considerable burden on businesses in terms of management time. Only last month the government announced a wide-ranging review of the bureaucratic burden on business, but it could take early action in the Budget to simplify the present tax system. Mr Richard Brown, policy director at the British Chambers of Commerce, said merging tax and national insurance would provide relief for small companies. The complexities of the VAT system and the harshness of the penalties imposed for errors have again featured prominently in the small-business lobbyists' submissions this year. The serious misdeclaration penalty, applied indiscriminately for simple mistakes or deliberate fraud, is still under review - after being cut from 20 per cent to 15 per cent last year - and a further easing is hoped for. The Federation of Small Businesses has suggested the elimination of VAT on transactions between VAT-registered businesses. This would cut administration costs, minimise the problem of bad debts and reduce the risk of incurring penalties without affecting the VAT yield to the Treasury. VAT is, after all, meant to be a tax on final consumption, not on business, the lobbyists say. Apparently minor adjustments to VAT administration can have quite significant benefits for small companies. Immediate relief from charging VAT on bad debts would help small businesses, given the present high rates of business failure. At present businesses can claim relief only after one year. Raising the VAT threshold from Pounds 36,600 could take businesses out of the VAT net, but a rise above the rate of inflation would need to be cleared with Brussels. In spite of the similarity between the small-companies' Budget submissions of 1993 and 1983, much has changed in the intervening decade. The important role played by small businesses in creating jobs, broadening consumer choice and stimulating innovation is now more widely recognised. But this has not prevented governments from devising tax and social security systems of excessive complexity. The annual Budget round gives the small-business lobbyist the chance to remind civil servants that simplicity and ease of implementation are, if anything, more important than the weight of the burden imposed.</p>

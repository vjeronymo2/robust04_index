			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Smith] </F>   [Text] A core of independent legislators look set to  bolster a direct challenge to Governor Chris Patten's  constitutional reform package amid growing uncertainty over the  outcome of tomorrow's historic vote.    The margin between success or failure for Mr Patten's push  for greater democracy in Hong Kong narrowed yesterday with  independent legislator Eric Li confirming he would support the  Liberal Party's alternative amendments. Mr Li, spokesman for  the Breakfast Club--a group of 10 conservative independent  legislators--said he would give his first preference vote to the  Liberal Party package. He stressed he was not speaking on  behalf of other non-aligned legislators but admitted there was  some "peer group pressure amongst these few legislators who  commonly come together".    The vote, which will determine Hong Kong's political future  and end the two-year-old Sino-British row over electoral reform,  now hinges on the decision of a handful of pro-China  legislators. If they abstain from voting Mr Patten's package is  expected to pass by a narrow vote, with latest estimates  predicting Mr Patten has 26 votes of support and 23 against.    Legislator Tam Yiu-chung, of the Democratic Alliance for the  Betterment of Hong Kong, whose vote is expected to be followed  by other pro-China members, gave no clues as to whether he would  vote for the Liberals. On Sunday he said he would consider  supporting any amendments in line with the Basic Law but last  night refused to comment on individual amendments.    Legislators said privately yesterday the Liberal Party had a  "fifty-fifty" chance of success. "Chris Patten must be  shivering in his pants," one legislator said.</p>

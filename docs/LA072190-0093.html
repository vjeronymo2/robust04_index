			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS ET CETERA: HOLIDAY BOWL ON A SATURDAY  </P> <P> For the first time in the game's history, the Sea World Holiday Bowl this year  will be played on a Saturday.  </P> <P> The 13th annual game will be played at 4:30 p.m. Dec. 29, also the earliest  kickoff in its history, the game committee announced.  </P> <P> "The weekend date means local fans will not have to battle rush-hour traffic to  get to the stadium, and those coming from out of the area will also find  Saturday a more convenient date," Holiday Bowl President L. Robert Payne said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> INDOOR SOCCER  </P> <P> Milan Mandaric, owner of the MISL St. Louis Storm, said he is optimistic that  his team will not fold, as has been rumored, and set Monday as the date a  decision will be made on the future of the franchise.  </P> <P> Mandaric, who lives in San Jose, has been looking for St. Louis investors for  his financially ailing team. He said "some" St. Louis business leaders have  come forward and that St. Louis Mayor Vince Schoemehl has begun soliciting  support on Mandaric's behalf.  </P> <P> "A lot of things are happening in the last minute," Mandaric said Friday. "The  mayor of the city and others want to give some support to the club, and I'm  waiting to see how things develop."  </P> <P> The fate of the eight-team league could hinge on that of St. Louis. Other  owners reportedly do not want to go forward with just seven teams.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SWIMMING  </P> <P> Poway High School, whose boys' and girls' swimming teams have won San Diego  Section titles the past two years, both earned spots in the National  Interscholastic Swimming Coaches of American TNT Power Ranking poll.  </P> <P> The Titan boys were ranked ninth nationally among public schools with over  1,900 students and 20th among all public schools but dropped to 28th nationally  when independents were included. The girls were ranked 14th, 28th and 33rd.  </P></p>

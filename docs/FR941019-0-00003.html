			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 28, 1994, FGIS published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 9424) a proposed rule entitled ``Fees for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Official Pesticide Residue Testing.'' These fees were established for a new service to provide official pesticide residue determinations for 29 pesticides in wheat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the early 1980's, FGIS has provided official service under the Agricultural Marketing Act (AMA) to test grain and processed grain products for three pesticide residues: carbon tetrachloride, methyl bromide, and ethylene dibromide. This service is available upon request from the FGIS Commodity Testing Laboratory in Beltsville, MD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FGIS is expanding its pesticide residue testing program to include testing wheat for 29 additional pesticides under the authority of the USGSA. The service will be performed on a request basis; it will not be required for either domestic or export shipments. All samples will be tested at the FGIS Technical Center in Kansas City, MO. A minimum of 500 grams of wheat will be required for testing. The residues (routine compounds) that will be certified are as follows: aldrin; azinphos-methyl; alpha-BHC; beta-BHC;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delta-BHC; carbofuran; chlorpyrifos; chlorothalonil; chlorpyrifos-methyl; p,p <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;-DDD; p,p <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;-DDE; 3-p,p <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;-DDT; diclofop-methyl; dieldrin; dimethoate; endosulfan; endrin; esfenvalerate; fenitrothion; fenthion; folpet; lindane; malathion; methidathion; methoxychlor; parathion; parathion-methyl; pirimiphos-methyl; and triallate. These compounds will be analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Laboratory analytical results will be provided to the applicant as soon as practicable. Generally, the testing requires a minimum of 48 hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fees will be set forth in Section 800.71(a), Schedule A. The proposed fee is $200 for each sample tested during a regular workday and $300 for each sample tested during a nonregular workday. The USGSA, as amended, (7 U.S.C. 71 et seq.) provides that FGIS charge and collect reasonable fees that cover its estimated cost of performing official inspection, weighing, reinspection, and appeal services. The fees are to cover, as nearly as practicable, the FGIS costs for performance of these official services, including related administrative and supervisory costs. The testing fee does not include charges for sampling. Sampling service fees, if required, will be assessed in accordance with the sampling rates in Section 800.71(a), Schedule A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testing for additional residues (special compounds) within FGIS capabilities will be charged at a proposed rate of $100 per hour during a regular workday and $150 per hour during a non regular workday. Testing of residues in other grains, oilseeds, and commodities may be provided as a service at a later date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major importers of U.S. wheat such as Japan, China, Mexico, and Korea have indicated a strong interest in having U.S. grain officially tested for the presence of specific pesticide residues. FGIS will be offering certification of these specific pesticide levels for export and domestic wheat. The anticipated volume of requests for this service is 500 samples per year or 10 per week. This represents approximately $100,000 per year, which will reimburse the costs of providing the service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comment Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During the 30-day comment period, three comments were filed in response to the proposal. The two comments in support of the proposal were received from a grain industry association and a state department of agriculture. A third comment in opposition to the proposal was filed by an independent (private) laboratory association and was received after the close of the comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

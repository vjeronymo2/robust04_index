			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Four shipping groups plan global pact Four of the world's top 10 container groups yesterday announced plans for an alliance linking Japan, China, Europe and North America, the globe's largest trading blocs. Mitsui OSK of Japan, Nedlloyd Lijnen of the Netherlands, American President Lines of the US, and Hong Kong's Orient Overseas Container Line, said they had started negotiations aimed at sharing capacity around the world. The lines will not take equity stakes in each other. The planned partnership is the latest in a series of worldwide agreements between shipping companies as they seek to achieve economies of scale in an increasingly competitive environment. The four aim to dominate the high value-added segment of the container shipping market which involves greater attention to customer service. 'This configuration will allow the four companies to use their ships more effectively, improving use of capacity, offering more frequent, more direct and faster sailings,' said Mr Hideyuki Sadamatsu, Mitsui OSK's deputy general manager for Europe and Oceania. The groups were still negotiating how many ships would be allocated to the alliance which should be agreed within four months and implemented within two years, he said. Mr Simon Brough, finance director of Orient Overseas, said the alliance would allow the partners to offer a frequent service to their customers. Each company would, however, be responsible for its own marketing, sales and service, he said. The new alliance could eventually include joint trucking, logistics, warehousing and inland operations as well as ship-sharing. In Rotterdam, Nedlloyd said the proposed alliance would enable it to improve services to cargo customers. 'It means we can offer a greater frequency of services, and more direct services to more harbours, than before,' Mr Hans Teeuw, senior vice-president of Nedlloyd Lines, said. He said the partnership was not aimed at bolstering freight rates but added that Nedlloyd hoped that rates would recover. The recent stabilisation of rates after sharp declines in past years, plus growth in cargo volumes, is expected to allow Nedlloyd to return to profit in 1994 after several years of losses. The shipping industry, which is highly capital intensive, is suffering from overcapacity and poor rates. This has forced operators into capacity sharing agreements to make the most efficient use of assets and improve returns. Last year, Hapag-Lloyd, Germany's biggest container company, Neptune Orient Lines of Singapore, and Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Japan's largest containership company, concluded an agreement to provide services between Asia, North America and Europe. Mitsui, which previously had a partnership for Asian-European trade with Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Hapag-Lloyd, severed its links with these companies after the creation of the alliance. American President Lines and Orient Overseas are the largest container shipper on the trans-pacific route since forming an alliance in which they share capacity, co-ordinate sailings and share container terminals. Mitsui has teamed up with the Malaysian International Shipping Corporation, Nedlloyd Lines and Compagnie Gene Maritime to provide scheduled services between Europe and the Far East. The Japanese company said the latest deal would not affect this arrangement, called the Tonnage Sharing Agreement.</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Observer: Bell's clanger John Major is not the only one on the receiving end of serious flak for the shambles over how to celebrate the 50th anniversary of D-day. Sir Tim Bell, Lady Thatcher's favoured public relations guru, has seen his reputation in Whitehall plummet as the din over commemoration of the Normandy landings has increased. It was Bell - for a trifling Pounds 60,000 of taxpayers' money - who suggested that nationwide street parties and spam-fritter frying contests would provide a suitable tribute. When protesting veterans said such events trivialised a battle which saw the death of 37,000 allied soldiers, the complaints were initially dismissed as 'their problem'. Now it is Sir Tim's problem - if the fulminations of one leading minister are to be believed.</p>

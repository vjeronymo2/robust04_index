			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Agafonov: "Kazakh Debut in Japan"] </F>   [Text] Tokyo -- President Nursultan Nazarbayev of  Kazakhstan has concluded his first visit to Japan.    The results of the visit consist in a number of economic  pledges undertaken by Japan: Tokyo has promised to give money  for Kazakh disarmament measures ($11 million) and announced the  opening of two credit lines for Kazakhstan (to a total value of  $220 million in the form of yen credits), as well as the  possibility of providing $70 million in the future for the  development of railroads and $55 million to combat atmospheric  pollution at Ekibastuz. In addition, Japan has decided to  allocate funds to insure Japanese firms' trading operations in  Kazakhstan (a reference, in particular, to Karaganda, where the  Japanese are involved in metallurgical projects).    The list appears impressive, but the trouble is that the  Japanese have given Alma-Ata [Almaty] only what they wanted to  and not what Kazakhstan was asking for. Although the Kazakh  president spoke hopefully of a series of contacts and talks with  representatives of the business world here on a number of major  economic projects in the Republic, large-scale Japanese  participation in Kazakh economic affairs is perceived at present  only as a remote prospect. According to statistics, last year  Kazakhstan's trade with Japan amounted to a modest $37 million,  and the number of projects in which real Japanese investment is  involved is in single figures -- three. The Kazakhstani side's  appeals for investment flows to be increased met with  understanding in Tokyo, but at the same time the Japanese  explained to the guests that it is necessary to improve the  investment climate in the Republic, improve legislation, and  carry out other routine work.    Nazarbayev defined the building of economic "bridges" with  Japan as the chief task of his trip. At the same time political  aspects were also touched on during the talks -- the situation  in the CIS and in Central Asia and relations with Russia.  Nazarbayev pointed out at a meeting with reporters that the  origins of the present desperately complex situation in the  former Soviet republics must be sought in the political mistakes  made earlier -- when the Belovezhskaya Forest agreements were  being prepared, and during the collapse of the ruble zone. The  Kazakh president mentioned this with bitterness, placing the  main emphasis on the desire to maintain stability and to see the  present reforms to a successful fulfillment. At the same time  he emphasized that the Russian reforms' successes are important  above all else. "In Russia," Nazarbayev said, "it is necessary  to support the reforms and stabilization, not individual  politicians. It is important for the whole world that the  processes of democratization and economic transformations  triumph in Russia."    Tokyo tried to establish what the leader of Kazakhstan had  in  mind when he advanced the concept of creating a Eurasian Union  in place of the CIS. It turned out that Nazarbayev had nothing  "in mind" -- according to him, it was an idea which had not yet  been developed and which was spoken aloud at a meeting with  Moscow State University students.</p>

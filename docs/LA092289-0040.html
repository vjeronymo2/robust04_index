			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> "Knots Landing" star Kevin Dobson found himself on the run when he visited Skid  Row this week, but for a different reason. On his way to donate secondhand  clothes to the Midnight Mission, he was confronted by a knife-wielding  transient. He broke free as two mission employees came to his aid, and police  arrested the attacker. Dobson is a regular donor to the shelter. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

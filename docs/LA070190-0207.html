			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ERICKSON PROVIDES LATE SPARK TO IGNITE GLENDALE TO 14-7 ALL-STAR FOOTBALL WIN  </P> <P> Aaron Erickson of Crescenta Valley High caught only two passes Saturday night  in the second Glendale-Burbank All-Star Football Game at La Canada High, but  they were key receptions.  </P> <P> Erickson, running a post pattern, hauled in a seven-yard touchdown toss from  Chris Bisgaard of Flintridge Prep late in the third quarter to lift Glendale to  a 14-7 win.  </P> <P> "I was telling them that I could beat them on the play," said Erickson, who was  named the Glendale team's most valuable player, "and it ended up working."  </P> <P> Earlier in the seven-play drive, the Glendale College-bound Erickson pulled  down a Bisgaard pass to complete a 40-yard play that moved the ball to the  Burbank nine. Two plays later, Erickson caught what proved to be the deciding  score.  </P> <P> "(Erickson) showed a lot of determination to make those catches," Bisgaard  said. "He really did a job and ran some great patterns. There's not much more  you can ask for."  </P> <P> Bisgaard, playing in his first 11-man game, completed only three of eight  passes, the other being a 27-yard pass to Flintridge Prep teammate David Swayne  (two receptions, 47 yards).  </P> <P> "The field is wider and there are more options (in 11-man football)," Bisgaard  said. "It makes it a lot easier to hit receivers."  </P> <P> Bisgaard and Swayne, who is bound for Duke, helped lead Flintridge Prep to the  Eight-Man Southern Section Large-Schools title last fall.  </P> <P> Paul Traughber of La Canada led the Glendale ground game, picking up 50 yards  in 12 carries, including two five-yard runs with less than two minutes to play  to help preserve the victory.  </P> <P> Montclair Prep's Greg Coile, playing for Burbank, led all rushers with 62 yards  in 10 carries. He had runs of 29 and 23 yards in the first half.  </P> <P> After a scoreless first quarter, Greg Andrachick of Notre Dame gave Burbank a  7-0 lead early in the second period with a 1-yard quarterback sneak to  culminate an 11-play, four-and-a-half minute drive.  </P> <P> Chris Afarian of Notre Dame kicked the extra point.  </P> <P> Di'Allo Frazier of Van Nuys set up Andrachick's run with a seven-yard scamper.  </P> <P> After being stopped at the line of scrimmage, Frazier broke away from the grasp  of several defenders to make his way to the Glendale two.  </P> <P> Kevin Hurley of St. Francis set up the Glendale's first score with a 51-yard  punt return to the Burbank 16.  </P> <P> Three plays later, Santiago Alvarez of Franklin scored on a five-yard run down  the left sideline with 2 minutes 51 seconds left before intermission. Ross  Allan of La Canada added the extra point.  </P> <P> The game featured seniors from 26 area high schools.  </P> <P> The inaugural game ended in a 19-19 tie.  </P></p>

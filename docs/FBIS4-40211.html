			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Popular Front leader, presidential candidate Zenon  Pozniak believes that entire Belarus should be a free economic  and banking zone. He hopes this would make his country a more  attractive place for economic activity and create additional  incentives for foreign banks and investment companies.    Pozniak's election platform says crucial to the success of  economic reform would be all the makings of statehood --  borders, customs, national currency, banking system, bank of  emission and the leverage to protect state sovereignty.    In the state sector the opposition presidential candidate  suggests dividing the functions of power and property. Power  will be vested with share-holders, holding companies and  concerns, while property management will be handed over to the  Property Management Ministry.    Pozniak believers that the share of military spending must  be  no bigger than 6 percent of the GDP.    New budget policies proposed by the Popular Front leader  imply forming the budget from below -- from the level of local  self-government, a stop to subsidizing producers, slashed  spending on the state apparatus, appropriate financing of the  law-enforcement, defence, the health service and the program to  eliminate the effects of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant  disaster.    Pozniak believes that order in the economy would help quick  transition to free trade in all goods and resources, which is to  economic reform. Without making enterprises fully independent  economically privatization, defence conversion or a social  safety net for the population would be impossible.    In order to consolidate the national currency, whose  functions will be performed at the first stage by a settlement  bill of the National Bank the opposition presidential candidate  suggests shifting all businesses to commercial operation,  introducing a law on bankruptcies and another one on the state  debt and procedures of forming and paying it, and enforcing  anti-trust policies.    Pozniak says that the privatization of land is not the end  but a means to enhance the effectiveness of the economy.    If elected president Pozniak promises to promptly set up  rural mortgage banks to credit farm producers, build homes and  social facilities.    In foreign economic policy Pozniak sees as a priority the  development of partnership with neighboring countries and steps  to conclude agreements with them on free trade, on customs and  currency unions and, in the long run, a common market. He  believes that monopoly in foreign trade must be abolished.    Pozniak blames the current economic crisis heavily on the  government's strong reluctance to conduct an independent  economic policy and the lack of political will in parliament to  map out the way of the country's development.    In case of Pozniak's election victory a future Cabinet will  be led by the leader of the Popular Accord Party Gennadiy  Karpenko, Popular Front coordinator Pozniak's election campaign  manager Sergey Naumchik. IF Note: Earlier Gennadiy Karpenko  himself was a presidential candidate, however his team failed to  raise 100 thousand signatures in his support necessary for  official registration at the central electoral committee. Under  Belarussian [Belarusian] legislation registration requires  presenting to the central electoral commission the signatures of  no less than 70 members of parliament. At first Karpenko was  supported by 78 members of parliament, however, eleven of them  -- the supporters of the Social Democrats -- changed their mind  later. Karpenko withdrew from the election race without waiting  for the central electoral committee's decision whether the  law-makers had the right to take their signatures back.    PF coordinator described Karpenko's agreement to conclude a  political alliance with Pozniak as another step towards the  unification of right-wing forces. Naumchik said that Pozniak  would benefit from the alliance with Karpenko at least because  the Popular Accord Party leader has important political  connections in Russia and enjoys certain credibility with  influential Russian statesmen.    PF coordinator has told IF that Pozniak's alliance with the  right-wing presidential candidate, ex-parliamentary speaker  Stanislav Shushkevich would be impossible. Estrangement between  the two will mount as the election race picks up pace, he said.    The coordinating committee of the Popular Movement of  Belarus  (PFB) has decided to support the current Prime Minister  Vyacheslav Kebich as the common candidate of the left-center  alliance in the 23 June presidential election. IF Note: PMB  unites 30 left-wing and centrist parties and non-governmental  organizations, such as the Communists, the Liberal Democrats,  the Slavyanskiy Sobor (Slav Assembly) party, the Officers' Union  and the republican organization of veterans. Analysts say that  the movement have local offices in all districts and regions and  is a major political force.    Apart from V. Kebich, Z. Pozniak and S. Shushkevich the  Belarusian presidency is contested by three other candidates --  the Agrarian Party leader Aleksandr Dubko, Communist Party  Secretary Vasiliy Novikov and people's deputy Aleksandr  Lukashenko. The latter is faced with the risk of being excluded  from the race for abusing the election law. IF Note: According  to reliable sources a truck carrying 20,000 color photographs of  Lukashenko and leaflets calling to vote for him was detained on  the Latvian border on 10 June. The accompanying documents said  the printed matter came from Hanover, Germany. The Belarusian  election law prohibits any direct or indirect participation of  foreign organizations or nationals in financing the campaigns of  presidential candidates or giving them any other assistance.  The central electoral commission is empowered to cancel the  registration of those presidential candidates who prove  responsible for violating this rule.    Although under the accompanying papers the cost of the cargo  is estimated at 9 million Belarusian rubles, experts say that  the real cost is more than 100 million. According the papers  the customer paid the contractor in D-marks.    Interviewed by IF the chairman of the Central Electoral  Commission Aleksandr Abramovich has said that the commission was  not empowered to decide whether Lukashenko should be banned from  the race until law-enforcement agencies officially proved  Lukashenko's complicity.    In the meantime reports from Minsk say that although the  cargo was arrested, posters identical to those detained on the  border appeared on the walls in the city center. Law  enforcement agencies believe that similar cargoes arrived in  Belarus earlier.</p>

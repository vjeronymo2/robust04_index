			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President  Jiang Zemin met with Washington Governor Mike Lowry and his  party here today.    Extending a welcome to Lowry on his first visit to China,  Jiang said he hoped U.S. guests could visit China more  frequently in the future so as to gain a better understanding of  China's reform, opening and modernization drive.    Previously, Jiang met with the governor in Seattle where he  was attending an APEC meeting last November.    Lowry and his party came to China as guests of the  government  of southwest China's Sichuan Province, with which Washington has  been a sister state since 1981.    During the meeting in Zhongnanhai, Jiang expressed hopes  that  Sichuan Province and Washington State would make greater efforts  to push forward the cooperation links between them, and between  the two countries as well.    Lowry said his visit to Sichuan was impressive and that his  delegation is "here to learn and further strengthen cooperation  with China."</p>

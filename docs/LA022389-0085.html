			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: SHOULDER CUT TRIMS BILL AT MEAT COUNTER  </P> <P> If you want to save money at the meat counter, you must get to know "chuck."  Chuck is not the name of any particular friendly and generous butcher. It is  rather the name of a large part of a beef carcass. For some reason unknown to  me, the front shoulder of the beef animal is called the chuck. Every other  animal in the world has shoulders -- lambs have shoulders, veal have shoulders,  pigs have shoulders. Beef have, instead, chucks.  </P> <P> The chuck makes up about 26% of the total carcass weight and, for the most  part, has been considered a less-tender part of the animal that generally  requires long-slow-moist-heat cooking. That there is a lot of it and that it is  generally considered tough and less desirable have made the chuck a problem for  the beef industry for years.  </P> <P> Butchers have traditionally had to discount the chuck in order to move it. That  has made it a good value for consumers throughout the years. If you have, as  grandmother seemed to, plenty of time to make stews and pot roasts using  long-slow-moist-heat cooking, the chuck is a cut that can save plenty of money  on meals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Well-Rounded Chuck  </P> <P> Nowadays, according to a recent study conducted at South Dakota State  University, you might not even need much time to save a lot of money with  chuck. Some chuck muscles from today's leaner younger beef cattle, it was  found, are tender enough to do all kinds of things with besides pot roast.  </P> <P> The research was funded by the Beef Industry Council, the South Dakota Beef  Council and the California Beef Council for the purpose of discovering if the  chuck might not have potentially greater value if sold as individual cuts  rather than as one cut with several muscles. The result of the study was  reported in the Journal of Food Science.  </P> <P> Scientists studied the eating characteristics of 34 muscles/muscle groups  within the forequarters of 16 Angus steers of similar genetic and nutritional  background. They determined the fat and lean content of each, as well as the  chemical characteristics of the connective tissue, the component largely  responsible for the chuck being less tender.  </P> <P> </P> <P> What's in It for You?  </P> <P> What the research indicated was that if the beef industry could develop  fabrication and processing techniques to allow easy and cost-effective  separation of the muscles of the chuck, its value could be significantly  increased.  </P> <P> So what does this mean to you? Two things. First, you can be sure that the beef  industry is going to be working overtime to find ways of taking the chuck apart  so the parts can be sold to you for more money. And second, if you're willing  to do a little cutting-up in the kitchen, you can take a chuck apart yourself  and do all kinds of wonderful things with the meat. You don't have to be a  scientist -- or even a butcher -- to take a chuck apart, and the results can be  surprisingly rewarding both in terms of good food and money saved.  </P> <P> After reading about the South Dakota study, I decided to do my own. I went to  the market and picked up a three-pound piece of boneless chuck roast. I would  like to have found one with the bone in, they are always a better buy, but  those are getting harder and harder to find. They must have found some way to  cross those critters with jellyfish; they don't have any bones anymore.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Lean Is Left  </P> <P> At home, I took it apart. It was more a matter of simply pulling it apart  rather than any skilled knife work. The individual muscles are separated by  connective tissue and they come apart rather easily. Then, by carefully  trimming away all fat and silvery connective tissue, you are left with several  pieces, some large and some small, of solid lean meat.  </P> <P> I don't know the names of the muscles that I cut from my chuck. I don't know  which, if any, was the Brachiocephalicus or the Longissimus dorsi or the  Triceps brachi. But it was not difficult to tell, even without cooking, which  were the more tender. Those with a finer texture, some almost like velvet, are  apt to be more tender than the muscles with a coarse stringy look to them.  </P> <P> Try this quick beef stew Italiano. It takes less than 30 minutes and tastes  like you cooked it all day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> STIR-FRY STEW ITALIANO  </P> <P> 1/2 pound well-trimmed boneless chuck meat  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 5 teaspoons olive oil  </P> <P> 1 medium onion, sliced  </P> <P> 1 medium zucchini, sliced  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons flour  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon dried basil leaves  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper pods  </P> <P> 2 medium tomatoes, seeded and chopped  </P> <P> 1/3 cup white wine  </P> <P> Polenta wedges, optional  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> Cut boneless chuck into 1/4-inch thick strips. Cut each strip into about 1 inch  pieces. Using side of cook's knife, mash garlic cloves to form paste. Combine  garlic with 2 teaspoons olive oil and add to beef strips in small bowl,  stirring to combine. Set aside.  </P> <P> Saute sliced onion in 2 teaspoons olive oil in large skillet 3 minutes.  (Good-sized black iron skillet with lid is preferred.)  </P> <P> Add beef and garlic and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add sliced zucchini and  continue cooking 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle flour, basil, salt and red pepper  over meat and vegetables. Stir in and cook another minute.  </P> <P> Add tomatoes and wine. Cover and simmer 4 or 5 minutes, just until sauce  thickens slightly. Serve over wedge of polenta. Sprinkle stew with grated  Parmesan cheese. Makes 4 servings.a  </P> <P> Note: Neva's Quick Polenta, slices of fried commercial cornmeal mush, may be  substituted for regular polenta.  </P></p>

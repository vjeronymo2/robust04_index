			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Cutting red tape MR NEIL HAMILTON, the minister in charge of the UK government's deregulation initiative, made a fine knock-about speech at last week's Conservative party conference. At one point, he produced a print-out several feet long listing 3,500 regulations burdening business and ripped it to pieces. Unfortunately, hacking back the jungle of red tape will not be as easy as tearing up a piece of paper in front of the party faithful. Everybody applauds the idea of cutting red tape in theory. But when it comes to repealing specific rules, enthusiasm can rapidly turn to hostility. The snag is that one person's regulation is another's protection. Rules are used to protect workers' jobs, consumers' health, investors' wealth and even big businesses from competition. Regulation can also be attractive to the Treasury as an alternative to public expenditure. Given the vested interests stacked up against an assault on red tape, it is not surprising that many observers believe the initiative will run out of steam. The prognosis is probably not so dire. A deregulation bill, to be introduced in the autumn with strong backing from Mr John Major, will subject every regulation to a cost-compliance test. Given that form-filling and the like is estimated to cost business 2-3 per cent of GDP, calculating administrative costs could get legislators to think twice before legislating. Ideally, some estimate of the overall economic costs should be attempted as well. Regulation can prevent managers from devising the most efficient methods of running their businesses, which is even more expensive than the crude compliance costs. But other tools are also needed for an effective campaign. One could be to adopt the US practice of 'sunset' regulation, where rules automatically expire after a certain date unless legislators make a conscious decision to renew them. Another could be to spell out the way that regulation can be counter-productive. For example, it seems likely that railway safety rules have so added to fares that passengers have switched to cars - a much more dangerous method of travel. The really radical approach would be to adopt a new philosophy to regulation. Government should set out general regulatory objectives instead of specifying detailed ways of achieving those objectives. Such an approach would, for example, allow a mass of detailed health and safety rules to be replaced by more generally-defined duties on employers to take care of workers' health. The incentive to do so would be the threat of large damages. Mr Hamilton will win easy plaudits by repealing a few dotty rules such as that requiring people baking cakes at home for charities to have two separate sinks. But the danger is that ministers will be content with such a piecemeal approach, while leaving the bulk of regulations untouched. If that happens, the conference boasts will come to nothing.</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / EU Summit: More retreat than defeat on Euro-laws Legislation on drinking and bathing water quality is to be recast into more simplified 'framework' directives, with standards that EU member states will be able to implement as they see fit, leaders decided at the weekend. This body of EU law was among a range of regulations the European Commission has reviewed in the light of the Union's subsidiarity doctrine, which in theory licenses action at European level only when national, regional or local measures would prove inadequate. The Commission agreed to repeal 16 of 22 laws on an Anglo-French 'hit-list,' itself a much scaled-down version of the 71 items the UK had originally wanted discarded. However, the Commission review document approved by the summit on Saturday was not a surrender. The political climate which has developed as a result of the nearly 300, often intrusive, Euro-laws which put the Single Market in place, and public reaction to the Maastricht treaty, has chastened Brussels and governments. Most of the legislation in the review is for recasting and simplification rather than outright scrapping. It includes a vast corpus of customs legislation, rules on takeover bids and indirect taxation, on the classification of pharmaceutical products and foodstuffs, on mutual recognition of professional qualifications, as well as the water directives dating from the late 1970s. The document warns on the water directives that 'application of the subsidiarity principle must not be allowed to lower these standards'. And it specifically excludes from the review the urban waste water directive, which Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, attacked last month on cost grounds, and officials in London had expected to be axed. Also excluded were individual social and employment Euro-laws on the grounds that the recent Commission green paper on social policy has started 'a broad debate on the future options of the Union in this field'. The so-called 'acquired rights' directive, protecting workers' rights when their company passes into new hands, is to be amended next year 'to simplify its application and enhance its effectiveness'. The change of heart is most unlikely to lead to a general roll-back of EU legislation. An underestimated aspect of the post-Maastricht climate is the more uninhibited way in which member states prosecute their national interests, and partly as a result, mistrust each other to implement agreements and laws reached jointly. This, as Brussels well appreciates, often leaves EU institutions holding the ring.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Construction group calls for Pounds 162m TAYLOR Woodrow yesterday launched a one-for-four rights issue to raise Pounds 162.4m, joining the growing number of British construction companies seeking to take advantage of a weak property market Shareholders will be offered one new share at 200p for every four already owned. Since the beginning of January, British companies have sought to raise almost Pounds 3bn from rights issues. Just over Pounds 1bn of those issues came from construction and property groups. Overall, British companies sought only Pounds 4bn from rights issues in the whole of last year. Mr Peter Drew, Taylor Woodrow's chairman, said the group would use the proceeds of the rights issue to make 'selective acquisitions' in a weak residential and commercial property market. 'Most property and housing developers have been less able than Taylor Woodrow to withstand the burden of the current recession and, as a result, opportunities have arisen to acquire property and housing assets at favourable prices. 'A number of attractive opportunities have been identified and are receiving active consideration,' said Mr Drew. The group would consider buying companies as well as individual properties and development land. He said the board considered that a rights issue was the most appropriate way to raise funds to pursue investment opportunities and still maintain a strong financial base with gearing and interest cover at reasonable levels. 'It is certainly cheaper than raising debt at current rates of interest,' said Mr Drew. Net debt represents 41 per cent of shareholders' funds, according to the group. Taylor Woodrow's share price - after an initial slide of 14p - recovered to close only 2p lower at 251p last night. Hambros Bank said that sub-underwriting for the issue, which had been fully underwritten by the bank, had been completed satisfactorily. The group's cash call is the fourth-largest rights issue to be announced by a British company this year. The biggest was by Tesco, the stores group, which at the end of January announced a two-for-11 issue to raise Pounds 572m. Last month Bass, the brewery group, announced a Pounds 557m rights issue while Redland, the UK building materials company, sought to raise Pounds 280m from its shareholders. A common theme among issues from building companies has been the need to raise cash to prepare for recovery and to take advantage of the weakness of other groups. Most companies say, however, that opportunities to buy land for housing - the sector most likely to lead the recovery - have been limited. Taylor Woodrow, like other large UK construction groups, has been hit by the collapse in residential and commercial property markets. Last month the company announced a drop in pre-tax profits of 28 per cent last year to Pounds 83.4m - the first fall at the group for 30 years. It also revealed that the value of its commercial property portfolio had fallen from Pounds 801.9m to Pounds 646.1m during the 12 months to the end of December. The group is forecasting a total dividend of 9.5p for the current year, unchanged on last year. Lex, Page 20; Tarmac falls 49 per cent, Page 22</p>

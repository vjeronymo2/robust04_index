			<p>Without   Lubricants   <F P=102> 94WS0352C Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ZEITUNG/BLICK DURCH DIE  WIRTSCHAFT in German 2 May 94 p 8 </F>  <F P=103> 94WS0352C </F> <F P=104>  Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ZEITUNG/BLICK DURCH DIE  WIRTSCHAFT </F>  <F P=105>  German </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Aachen Scientists: High-Precision </F> Heavy-Duty Lathing"; Subhead: "Using New Method Highly Stressed  Components Can Be Tooled Even Without Cooling Lubricant"]    [Text] Aachen -- Using heavy duty tooling as an alternative  to conventional production processes, scientists from the  technical college of Aachen have offered evidence that highly  stressed components can be tooled even with cooling lubricant by  using the new method. Norbert Winands and Karl-Friedrich Koch,  fellow scientists of Professor Koenig (chair and laboratory for  machine tools and operational instruction and the Fraunhofer  Institute for Production technology), introduced the new process  of "heavy duty lathing in lieu of grinding."    Whereas cooling lubricant has to be used when grinding, it  is  possible even to dry tool hardened steel components, for  example, with tools of coated hard metal, ceramic cutting  material and cubic boron nitride [CBN]. Cooling can be dispensed  with in the case of such cutting materials because of their  highly elevated temperature hardness and chemical stability. It  would even produce unfavorable results since cooling could lead  to temperature stresses that in turn entail micro-splinters and  edge-notching. Since the absence of cooling can lead to thermal  deformation, other designs have to be developed to eliminate  heat in the case of precision tooling.    Heavy duty lathing represents a sensible substitute to  grinding. Not only is complexity decisive for the choice of the  production process, so are the required dimensional tolerance  and surface finish of the component. Drawing dies, pressure rams  and inner-raceway roller bearings are not only exposed to high  mechanical stresses, but they have to satisfy extreme quality  standards. Consequently, the production stages of such  components are costly and numerous.    Heavy duty lathing appears an attractive alternative since  it  is possible to realize accuracies of International Standards  Association [ISA] Tolerance [IT] six and surface finishes from  return to zero [Rz] -- two to three micrometers using dry  tooling. Such grinding values, however, still are not up to the  highest precision standards. One significant advantage of dry  tooling using geometrically defined cutting is doing without  ecologically questionable cooling lubricant. Acquisition and  disposal costs have soared, justifying an equivalent replacement  even in terms of competitiveness. From a production engineering  optic, the high flexibility of the process yields its most  important aspect since non-form-bound tools are employed. When  grinding, for the most part, each tooling operation uses a  process adapted for it. That is why a number of chuckings are  frequently required for the tooling. In the case of heavy-duty  lathing even complex component shapes are produced with a single  chucking.    Such high process flexibility results in shorter throughput  times and can be used in both small batch production and in mass  production. Using heavy duty lathing it is currently possible to  realize dimensional tolerances that previously were reserved for  grinding. Cases from industry verify that substituting heavy  duty lathing for grinding can yield not only ecological but also  economical advantages. As much as a quintupling of basic  quantity is feasible coupled with definitely shorter production  times. This even holds true if the costs of disposing of cooling  lubricants and wheel swarfs are left out of the equation.    Fresh and further developments in the production resources  sector, such as machine tools running on fully hydrostatic  bearings and magnetic tension designs, in the future, will allow  final cutting processing of hardened components having  production tolerances that can currently be realized only with  cost intensive precision grinding or honing operations. Hence  heavy duty cutting opens up new prospects for currently proven  production processes.</p>

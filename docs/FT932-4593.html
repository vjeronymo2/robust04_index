			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (26): Casa given a capital tonic - Spain / Tom Burns on the fortunes of the state-owned group CASA, Spain's state-owned aerospace group, echoes the sector worldwide in saying the industry is going through its bleakest period for a long time but at least it has something to smile about. In February the Instituto Nacional de Industria, the state holding company which owns Casa, or to give it its full name, Construcciones Aeronauticas, finally agreed to a Pta42.3bn (Dollars 352m) capital increase. For several years fresh capital had been a priority and its arrival gives the balance sheet strength the company had formerly lacked. Last month a second boost, every bit as important, materialised when the industry ministry unveiled a Pta120.1bn investment plan, spread over six years, for the domestic aerospace sector. This has the approval of the European Community which has undertaken to supply favourable credit lines. Two-thirds of the plan is targeted at two of Casa's biggest undertakings: the Airbus programme and development of a fast turboprop passenger aircraft, the Casa 3000. The industry ministry's decision to back the aircraft came just a few weeks after Casa had determined to proceed with its design and building. The group's commitment came after nine months of exhaustive feasibility studies with prospective customers and operators. These identified what Casa believes is a niche in the market. With a cruising speed of 350 knots at altitudes up to 31,000 feet, the Casa 3000 will have a range of more than 1,000 nautical miles with a full payload of 70-78 passengers. Designed for the regional air transport market, it will be built over the next four years and the company believes it will prove the most economical replacement for small jets operating low-density routes. Casa says it will provide block times similar to jets, at a spectacularly low operational cost. However, the big selling point is that it provides jet comfort at turpoprop costs in both hub-and-spoke and point-to-point operations. The aircraft's combination of speed and short turnaround time ensures, according to Casa, a high operational flexibility and marked improvement in productivity over conventional and slower turboprops. Casa has nailed its colours to the inter-regional traffic mast. That is a sector it knows well through its existing aircraft, the C-212 and the CN-235 and in which it has built up further expertise through co-operation in the Saab 2000 programme. Like Saab and other aerospace companies, Casa has made projections for the growth of inter-regional traffic. It foresees European traffic growing at a rate of 4.9 per cent between the years 2000 and 2009, an increase of 6.9 per cent over the same period in Asia and the Pacific region and only slightly less in the American market. The Casa 3000 programme could not have come at a better time for the company. In recent months it has been in turmoil over the debate on the future of the Airbus consortium and European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) programme. A founder member of both multinational projects, Casa has placed a lot of importance on their continued progress. The company's space division may well have further cause for gloom if cuts and cancellations are implemented as a result of reassessment of the European Space Agency, particularly the future of the Columbus and Hermes programmes. Casa's maintenance division, a money-spinner for years, has also been hard-hit. Spain's defence ministry has scaled back its requirements because of big budget cuts and, worse still in psychological and income terms, the US Air Force has ended a maintenance contract that Casa had for F15 combat planes since the 1960s. Despite these difficulties, the group had a reasonable financial year in 1992. In part, that was due to an increase in sales from Pta87.4bn to Pta91.8bn. Casa was also able marginally to reduce its labour force and annual income per employee rose from Pta9.9m in 1991 to Pta10.7m last year. In 1991-1992 some 300 jobs were shed from the total of 9,338 and the company is now in the process of losing 450 through voluntary early retirement. This second round of lay-offs is likely to be followed by a third but it is an expensive business, adding Pta3.3bn to extraordinary costs this year. To a far greater extent, however, the 1992 results benefited from a 46 per cent drop in financial costs to Pta7.3bn. As a result, Casa reduced 1991 losses of Pta6.9bn to Pta3.5bn last year. This year, after seven years in the red, the group hopes to break even. The improved balance sheet after the capital increase will no doubt help to bring that objective within reach. The company is also set to benefit from successive devaluations of the peseta. The dollar, responsible for about 80 per cent of business, has revalued by about 20 per cent against the domestic currency in the past year.</p>

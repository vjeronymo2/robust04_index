			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Foes with shared values: Misleading myths divide Islamic and western states 'Have mercy upon all Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Hereticks, and take from them all ignorance, hardness of heart, and contempt of thy Word; and so fetch them home, blessed Lord, to thy flock, that they may be saved among the remnant of the true Israelites, and be made one fold under one shepherd, Jesus Christ our Lord . . .' One no longer hears that collect read in Anglican churches on Good Friday, as one used to when I was a schoolboy. At some point, well before the phrase 'politically correct' became current, it was quietly dropped. The words might be construed as offensive to the categories of people mentioned: Jews, Moslems, atheists and Christians of other denominations. And since the Church of England does not wish to cause offence, it altered its liturgy. Of course, if you really believe - as the author of the collect presumably did - that people who do not share your religious beliefs are missing their only chance of eternal bliss, you should pray for their conversion whether it offends them or not. But few Anglicans nowadays do believe that. Even the Pope, I suspect, no longer insists absolutely on the doctrine of extra ecclesia nulla salus (no salvation outside the church). He seems to regard other religions, especially monotheistic ones, less as competitors than as potential allies of Christianity in the great battle between God and mammon. Britain's Chief Rabbi, Dr Jonathan Sacks, shares that view. In his 1990 Reith Lectures he urged religious minorities to support the established church, it being the only national institution capable of giving a religious dimension to Britain's public culture. The argument is quoted with approval by a Moslem scholar, Tariq Modood, in one of the thoughtful essays published last year under the title Not Easy Being British (Runnymede Trust and Trentham Books, Pounds 7.95). Modood is anxious to head off an attempt by secularists to use the supposed sensitivity of non-Christian minorities to advance the cause of disestablishment - something which, he says, has not been demanded by any minority faith organisation. Moslems found much more understanding for their campaign against Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses among the Christian clergy than they did in the secular intelligentsia. That may seem surprising. In earlier ages Christian writers depicted Islam as a vicious and fanatical heresy, and it was anticlerical liberals who first painted a different picture, of a civilised Islam, which they contrasted with the reactionary obscurantism of the Catholic establishment at home. Now the boot is on the other foot. Islam is again seen as a threat to established western values, but those values have become more liberal than Christian, and some Christians see Islam as a possible ally in an effort to stem the tide of liberal triumphalism. Is there in fact an irreconcilable conflict between Islam and western values? Many on both sides would say yes. Many Moslems see the west as completely godless and amoral, dominated by crime and pornography at home, brutal and arrogant in its behaviour towards the rest of the world, and nursing a special animus against them, the Moslems. From Bombay to Bosnia, passing by Iraq and Palestine, Moslems see themselves as victims, with 'the west' always directly or indirectly the aggressor. In his powerful TV series, Living Islam, starting tonight on BBC2, and in the accompanying book (BBC Books, Pounds 15.99), the Pakistani anthropologist Akbar Ahmed even called the war in Bosnia the 'last crusade'. Similarly, many in the west see Islam as irredeemably violent and repressive. Neither side has any difficulty in finding evidence to support its view, and of course each is reinforced by the other. But both 'Islam' and the 'west' can be regarded either as ideals or as civilisations. If we think of them as ideals, we may have difficulty in defining them precisely because so many different people identify with them in each case and there is such a variety of interpretations on offer. Clearly they are not identical: the west puts more emphasis on the value of each individual human being, while Islam insists on the centrality of God. But there is a considerable overlap in the core values that both proclaim: peace, justice, compassion, tolerance; even equality and the use of reason to acquire knowledge. If we think of them as civilisations we are confronted with even greater diversity on both sides. They are composed of millions of human beings, nearly all of whom fall short in practice of the ideals they claim to believe in; and here too there is an increasing overlap. Not only do some 10m Moslems live in the west; equally significant is the presence of so many aspects of western civilisation within Moslem countries. More than anything it is the impossibility of making a complete break with the west that drives some Moslems to desperation. They may succeed in defining an 'Islam' that is completely antithetical to the west, but their chances of imposing it durably on any part of the Moslem world are virtually zero. Revolutionary Iran and conservative Saudi Arabia alike are driven all the time to make compromises, though in very different ways. The Moslems' extremist myth of a monolithic and malign west is as futile and misleading as the view, current in some western circles, that a monolithic, malign Islam has replaced communism as our most dangerous enemy. This indeed is the main point of Prof Ahmed's series; as an articulate Moslem living in the west, he hopes to persuade both sides to see good as well as bad in each other.</p>

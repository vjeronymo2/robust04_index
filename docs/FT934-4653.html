			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke out of favour As the market surged ahead, Ladbroke provided one of the few splashes of red on dealing screens as a variety of bearish stories struck the leisure stock. First came news that Mr Michael Hirst, a main board director, had unloaded 125,000 shares - virtually half his stake - in the market four days ago at 161p a share. The timing of the announcement, which came just minutes before the market closed on Tuesday, meant the stock felt the full brunt of investor concern as the market opened yesterday. It drifted lower throughout the morning session, amid reports that one of the stock's most bullish brokers had turned negative. There was also talk of a boardroom rift over the share sale. However, it was not until late afternoon that the shares went into full retreat as rumours swept the market - later confirmed in an after-hours' statement from the company - of the group's decision to take advantage of foreign income dividend rules, a move which will hit pension fund shareholders. There were grumblings from some brokers that the news of the announcement had been leaked into the market selectively. The stock finished 20 1/2 weaker at 151p after very large turnover of 23m shares.</p>

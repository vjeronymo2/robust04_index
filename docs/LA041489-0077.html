			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SOCIAL SECURITY FILES BARRED IN CREDIT CHECKS  </P> <P> Commissioner Dorcas R. Hardy moved Thursday to bar credit bureaus and banks  from using Social Security's massive data files to verify Social Security  numbers for commercial purposes.  </P> <P> "I have decided after consulting with the policy council and office of general  counsel to halt providing negative verifications of Social Security numbers to  financial and credit institutions," Hardy said.  </P> <P> She said her order would bar the Social Security Administration from processing  magnetic tapes containing 140 million names and Social Security numbers  submitted by TRW Credit Data, whose operations include gathering information  for credit purposes, to determine which names have incorrect Social Security  numbers.  </P> <P> Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), who raised the issue with Hardy on Monday at a  hearing of the Senate Committee on Aging, said: "I am glad that Commissioner  Hardy has taken this path and has seen fit to preserve the confidentiality of  the Social Security files.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, this action comes too late to protect some 150,000 people whose  files were violated during a test run conducted for TRW (in 1987) and for more  than 3 million people on whom verifications were conducted for Citibank and  other firms in past years." Pryor said he had been "appalled that officials had  been so cavalier about the privacy of American citizens."  </P> <P> In a letter to Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of health and human services, Pryor  asked for an investigation by the agency inspector general. Pryor called the  TRW and Citicorp verifications "the largest breach of privacy in the history of  the program." He called the verifications violations of the Privacy Act of  1974.  </P> <P> After Hardy learned about the practice, she said, she decided in December to  delay approving the TRW request for verification of 140 million names and  Social Security numbers. She said she asked the policy council to review the  issue.  </P> <P> Hardy said it was clear that verifying Social Security numbers for credit  bureaus and financial institutions is impermissible. However, she said the  agency will continue to verify numbers for employers who need the information  to be sure that Social Security deductions for their employees are properly  recorded and to be certain that a job applicant is using a valid Social  Security card.  </P></p>

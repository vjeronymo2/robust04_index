			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- House of Representatives  Speaker Takako Doi on Monday [20 June] rejected a plea from  former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to nullify a  parliamentary decision to summon him as a sworn witness over his  alleged financial irregularities, officials said.    In a meeting with Masuo Matsuoka, secretary general of  Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP), Doi reportedly said that the  lower house "cannot and will not annul (the decision to summon  him) as it has already issued a summons."    After the meeting, Matsuoka told reporters that it is not  yet  decided whether Hosokawa will appear before Tuesday's budget  committee session.    Hosokawa, in a letter to the speaker, had asked the lower  house to review the parliamentary procedures that led to his  summoning.    At a session of the budget committee on Thursday, its  chairman, Tsuruo Yamaguchi, declared that his panel unanimously  approved a proposal to summon the former prime minister.    Some parties in the ruling coalition of Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata lodged a protest against the procedure, saying the  committee's decision contravened a longtime parliamentary  practice of authorizing such summons only when all parties  approved of such a proposal.    Budget committee members from the JNP and two other  coalition  parties, Komeito [Clean Government Party] and Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], declared at Thursday's session their opposition  to the proposal to summon Hosokawa.</p>

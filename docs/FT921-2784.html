			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Arts: Into a world of 'voter meters' and 'media monitoring'  -Television / Election overkill is enough to drive us all to satellite dishes Predicting the outcome of the election campaign is a doddle: 1. Broadcasters will spend more money, time, resources, and manpower than on any previous election. 2. When Parliamentary candidates ask people on their doorsteps 'Do you have any complaints?' the commonest response will be 'Yes, too much election on television'. (This is not a joke; ask people who do a lot of doorstepping and they will tell you.) 3. The outcome of the poll (no doubt there will be a post election survey this time as there was in 1987) will be that be tween 70 and 80 per cent of voters will say there has been far too much coverage. 4. Whatever politicians and broadcasters may claim, points 1, 2 and 3 will apply again at the next election. It seems absurd that while everyone recognises that television nowadays delivers far too much on elections, nobody does a thing about it. However, the reasons are surely pretty clear. First, politicians and news journalists (actually news and current affairs journalists) have much in common: they are fascinated by politics, revel in the campaign, and love the sound of their own voices. The overkill is a sort of conspiracy between them and against the public. Secondly, the campaign gives broadcasters a wonderful opportunity to test all their latest technology, from 'bi-media work stations' (the BBC's new Westminster news room is fully 'bi-media', meaning that each journalist can work for both television and radio) to mobile satellite links. The only other event which allows a test as wide and as rigorous is a proper shooting war, and those do not occur often enough. Thirdly, once any major news event is under way, many broadcasters spend nine-tenths of their time thinking about the opposition and only one tenth thinking about the viewer: 'Who's covering the breakfast conference for ITN?' and 'How is the BBC organising its exit poll?' become far more important than 'Won't Auntie Ethel already be bored to tears?' Moreover, so much attention is devoted to the pressing problems of the nearby trees - resisting pressure from the party machines, and ensuring fair representation of the parties - that the wood disappears from view. Speak to individual broadcasters and they will concede all this, yet, unsurprisingly, not one of them will go on to say 'So I'm volunteering for my programme to stay out of the election scramble'. One other prediction is less of a certainty but should still be made: 'media monitoring' (analysing the coverage rather than the politics) is already a major growth area. So much so that before long somebody will surely begin to do a regular survey of media monitoring, whereupon the wheels within the wheels will become so complicated that our heads will start to spin. Outside the walls of university sociology departments, media monitoring first began to appear in the late 1960s, used by journalists as a sort of defence mechanism against the image builders employed by political parties and leaders. The seminal work was Joe McGinniss's The Selling Of The President which, in 1969, described the way in which television was used to 'sell' Richard Nixon to the Americans. Today's political salesmen are called 'spin doctors' and an increasing amount of air time is devoted to examining their efforts. Previously this was included in more laid-back series such as Newsnight and Channel 4's late lamented After Dark, but now we are beginning to get programmes which do nothing else. The Vote Race on BBC1 on Sunday nights for the next three weeks promises to investigate 'the hidden strategies of the campaign managers'. In this week's opening programme we saw a panel using 'voter meters' to indicate, phrase by phrase, viewers' responses to a politician's speech. You might have thought that, for the sake of the public, it would be better if the broadcasters told the parties and all their sorcerers that henceforth they would behave like independent journalists, serving the best interests of the public, choosing the news for themselves, not operating even vaguely hand-in-glove with the politicians to achieve stopwatch parity between the parties, and that any attempt at 'spin' would be routinely revealed if it merited revelation, wherever it might be found. That said, the most interesting item so far is a programme that did not appear: the edition of Panorama in which Peter Jay was due to consider the origins of the recession. Predictably enough, Samir Shah, head of current affairs at BBC television, was accused on Biteback, BBC1's inadequate monthly 'feedback' programme, of running scared and surrendering to Government pressure. Yet those who have read the transcripts of the programme published in several of the Sunday papers (edited transcripts, and not identical, but several thousand words long, enough to convey a fair idea) may have reached other conclusions. Of course a printed transcript is not the same as a television programme which would incorporate talking heads, graphics, and 'wallpaper' scenery. But even allowing for that, this appeared to be a classic result of belief in the Birt-Jay thesis, an argument developed in the late 1970s by John Birt and Peter Jay when they worked on ITV's Weekend World. Broadly they said there was a bias against understanding in television journalism because news and current affairs programmes concentrated on the 'what' at the expense of the 'why'. They wanted more analysis. Today John Birt is the BBC's Director-General in waiting and Peter Jay is the corporation's Economics Editor, so it is hardly surprising to find the attitude of that thesis applied to Panorama when Jay is exploring the reasons for the recession: it is an archetypal Birt-Jay thesis subject. But if I were in charge of BBC current affairs and read that script prior to transmission I would be struck first by the seemingly historical nature of the piece, which was commissioned for the BBC's flagship current (not ancient) affairs programme; and then I would have a vivid vision of viewers in their hundreds of thousands zapping away to find something more congenial. Television should certainly do such analytical pieces, but Panorama may not be the best place for them. There is one more prediction that seems a sure bet: one effect of the election overkill will be to increase even further the amount of time devoted to watching World Cup cricket on Sky Sports. Since most of this is transmitted in the early hours of the morning, the drill, assuming you have a video recorder, is to load a four-hour cassette on long-play and tape the entire match. Then, when the terrestrial broadcasters offer you politicians, politicians, politicians or politicians of an evening, you settle back to watch the cricket. Furthermore with this system you can zap out the pestiferous commercials which they insert at the end of virtually every over. Aside from the cricket, there is still a vast amount of dross coming off the Astra satellite. Flicking through the channels on several evenings last week I came across long promotional sequences for anti-wrinkle cream and a sponge rubber painting system which I have seen so many times before that I can practically recite the lines with the presenters. There was speedway on ice and American all-in wrestling, too, and every night two entire channels are devoted exclusively to rock videos. But some viewers will regard that as a big attraction. It is precisely the fact that you can always watch the news, or sport, or rock videos whenever you want to that is the system's greatest advantage. In a period when you are going to be able to watch politicians on all terrestrial channels at all times, whether or not you want to, a dish suddenly seems a far more attractive proposition.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Lima, 24 Jun (EFE) -- A law establishing prison  sentences of eight to 15 years for people who grow  heroin-producing poppies went into effect in Peru today.    The law was approved by Congress on 22 June. It confirms the  sentences included in the original bill.    The Peruvian penal code now includes the "crime of growing,  promoting, assisting, or financing" the planting of poppy  plantations used for making opium or heroin. [passage omitted]</p>

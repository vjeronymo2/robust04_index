			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Malaysia foresees 8.5% growth Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister, yesterday unveiled a moderately expansionist budget for 1995 aimed at sustaining the country's economic growth while also controlling inflation. Mr Anwar forecast that Malaysia's economy would grow by 8.5 per cent this year, the seventh consecutive year of growth exceeding 8 per cent. 'While others are plodding along painfully, we are riding the waves of rapid economic growth,' he said. He proposed a series of tax cuts which would primarily benefit lower income groups - and win support for the government of prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad in advance of elections likely to be held later this year or early next. The maximum rate of individual income tax will be cut from 34 to 32 per cent while income tax will be abolished for a large segment of those on lower incomes. 'Thirty per cent of the total number of taxpayers will no longer have to pay income tax,' said Mr Anwar. Corporate tax will be cut by 2 per cent to 30 per cent in line with other countries in the region. Mr Anwar said the government intended to further streamline investment procedures and announced a number of measures to encourage domestic investment. The government says the inflation rate is 3.7 per cent. As part of the effort to overcome market imperfections and stabilise prices, import duties on more than 2,600 items - many of them foodstuffs - will be either reduced or abolished. Due to a rapid growth in imports so far this year and a sharp rise in the deficit on the services account, Malaysia's current account balance of payments deficit is forecast to balloon to MDollars 11.7bn (Dollars 4.8bn), compared with an earlier official projection of a surplus of MDollars 1.5bn. Measures to tackle the services deficit include increasing efficiency and capacity at ports and promoting the development of the Malaysian shipping industry. Mr Anwar also announced a substantial increase in educational spending in order to meet serious skills shortages. He warned that wages in the first seven months of this year wages had risen by 6.7 per cent, compared with an increase in productivity of 2.2 per cent. 'While we may rightly rejoice in our success, let us not throw caution to the wind,' he said.</p>

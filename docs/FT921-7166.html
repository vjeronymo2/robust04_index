			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Observer: Overdue There may be doubt about Poland's economic reforms, but at least the country should not be without a finance minister for much longer. Andrzej Olechowski, the deputy foreign trade minister, is tipped to take over the hot seat. A tall, silver-haired 45-year-old, Olechowski first came to prominence as a disc jockey on Polish radio in the early 1970s. By 1981, he was working at IKC, the Trade Ministry's research institute, where he set up Solidarity's first cell in the government administrafirst days of martial law, produced a report reminding the communist government that western sanctions would be successful and that martial law had to be lifted soon. After a stint at the World Bank, he returned to Poland's central bank, the NBP, to run its relations with international financial institutions. When Solidarity came to power, he was promoted to vice-chairman of the NBP, before being given the job of handling the sensitive parts of Poland's association agreement with the EC which was signed last December. Well-regarded by the World Bank and the IMF, Olechowski's promotion could help break the log-jam over the renegotiation of Poland's Dollars 10bn commercial bank debt.</p>

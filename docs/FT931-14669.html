			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Losses on warrants I HAVE held 6,000 Eurotunnel warrants since 1988. I did not exercise the warrants because the cost of doing so was greater than the value of the Eurotunnel shares they would have yielded. Last November the warrants lapsed. Can I set the loss of the adjusted cost of the warrants against investment gains for Capital Gains Tax purposes? Yes, by virtue of section 144(4 &amp; 8) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992: '(4) The abandonment of. . . a traded option . . . shall constitute the disposal of an asset (namely of the option) . . . '(8) In subsection 4 above . . . 'traded option' means an option which, at the time of the abandonment . . is quoted on a recognised stock exchange . . . ' If your tax inspector should try to restrict your allowable loss by invoking the notorious wasting-asset rules (which apply to some types of option), refer him or her to section 146 of the Act. This says the wasting-asset rules 'shall not apply . . . to a traded option . . . ', as defined in section 144(8). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

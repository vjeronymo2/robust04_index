			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Travel: Hedonism on Bourbon Street - There is always something going on in New Orleans, says Christina Lamb. It is a 24-hour city given to food, music and cosmopolitanism. Away from the bright lights, Nicholas Woodsworth travels the backroads of southern Louisiana and finds some fun There is something about the air in New Orleans that makes perfectly normal people yearn to throw off their everyday skins and become artists, writes Christina Lamb. Maybe it is the riverport aroma of crawfish and spice; or the Mediterranean ambience of outdoor cafes and stucco houses with lace-patterned wrought-iron balconies; or just the way the sky hangs low over the Mississippi as a lone saxophonist serenades the sunset. It happened in the guest-house in which I was staying. A 50-something couple at the next breakfast table pored over guidebooks and maps, the man planning the day's activities like an army assault. On the third day the meek-looking wife had swapped her tweed suit for a long flowing garment stamped with large yellow and red roses. Under a floppy straw hat adorned with sky-blue feathers, she bore a new and determined expression - and an interesting brown paper package. Instead of following Mr Dragoonmaster, she headed for the hotel's small courtyard with its crumbling fountain and, lighting up a cigarillo, began painting bold indecipherable strokes on a pristine sketch pad. The landlady had obviously witnessed such a metamorphosis before. Passing by with an armful of freshly laundered towels, she nodded encouragingly and said: 'That's coming together'. Flushed with pride, the formerly meek-looking wife returned to work with new vigour, making me feel mean that I had walked past without so much as a glance. After all, what was I doing but making feeble efforts at romantic poetry in the shade of a crooked banana tree. New Orleans was once a mecca for aspiring artists and writers, providing the setting for Tennessee William's play, A Streetcar Named Desire, and inspiration for John Audubon's Birds of America paintings. But these days, most people associate it with two big events - Mardi Gras, the pre-Lent carnival which rivals Rio's as the world's biggest party, and the Jazz Fest. Unless one is a lover of crowds, the best time to savour the city's atmosphere may be outside the two main events. There is always something going on in New Orleans. As the birthplace of jazz it is a magnet for musicians. Parades and festivals celebrate everything from tomatoes to Tennessee Wiliams. The French Quarter, or Vieux Carre, the original part of the city, is busy. On my first afternoon there, admiring the Spanish-style iron-work and cool inviting interior courtyards of Royal Street, I came across Blanchette and Michelini playing baroque music on multi-stringed lute-like instruments. Around the corner, in front of the white Disneyland facade of St Louis Cathedral, on Jackson Square, a melancholy jazz trio was competing for attention with a group of long-haired blues musicians, one of whom was using string tied across a large card as a bass. In the park, a gaggle of giggling black school-children had gathered around a clown. Along the railings, artists made sketches of tourists for Dollars 5 a time. As the shadows lengthened, a squat old woman, swathed in turquoise crepe with a huge beribboned hat, dismounted a spindly old bike and set up shop as the Star Lady, predicting the imminent arrival of tall dark strangers to breathless women in short skirts and scarlet lipstick. Nearby, a group of punks with clashing shades of luminous hair queued at the Lucky Dog, a giant tin hot-dog on wheels. New Orleans owes its cosmopolitanism to its history. Founded in 1718, it is the only US city to have changed flag six times - French, Spanish, French, American, Confederate and Federal Union. But it was the brainchild of a Scotsman. John Law, a crooked financier from Edinburgh who had won his way into the affections of Philippe d'Orleans, regent for the infant Louis XV, to become his de facto finance minister, conceived of a scheme to make France rich through colonising the Louisiane territory. Establishing the settlement of La Nouvelle Orleans, he sold real estate to Europeans. But it was not quite the paradise Law described. Instead of fabulous wealth, colonists found a crude collection of shacks on a swamp, beset by fire, yellow fever, hostile indians and hurricanes. As the swindle was uncovered, Law's company went bust, although some tenacious colonists remained, the city passing into Spanish rule, then back to French, becoming a flourishing port, before being sold to US president Thomas Jefferson by Napoleon in 1803 for Dollars 15m. Today the spirit of John Law lives on in the city's hedonistic character. This is most evident on Bourbon Street - a neon jungle of strip-bars and tacky T-shirt shops, with music oozing from every crevice. There is something very special about hearing jazz in the place it was born, and New Orleans continues to produce great musicians such as the Neville Brothers, Dr John, Wynton Marsalis and Harry Connick. Just Dollars 3 (and a wait) can buy an evening of traditional jazz in Preservation Hall where some aged founding fathers of jazz still play. Further along, at Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop, you can listen to piano in perhaps the oldest bar in the state. Dating from 1772, it presents a striking sight with its original timbers and soft brick, like the creole cottages of the first French settlers. Blues lovers adore the Old Absinthe House. The New Orleans tourist authority does little to boast of its musical heritage, offering only a few glass cases of memorabilia in Louisiana State Museum, among them Louis Armstrong's first cornet and a pair of Bix Beiderbecke's cuff-links. Armstrong Park, named for the city's most famous son, is sadly dilapidated beyond its illuminated arch. Inside, Congo Square, where last century free blacks and slaves would congregate to improvise music and dance, is silent save for the groans of some drunken hobo. Storyville, a legal red-light district which flourished from 1898 to 1917, attracting players such as Buddy Bolden, Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver, who developed what we know as jazz, is not safe to explore  - the city is sadly crime-racked. After music, the highlight for many visitors is food. Of both Creole and Cajun origin, local specialities include catfish, alligator, jambalaya, gumbo and sweet pralines washed down with Dixie beer. New Orleans is a 24-hour city, and reward for staying up all night should be breakfast in Cafe du Monde. From there you can saunter across to the river-side Moonwalk to watch snub-nosed barges and brightly painted paddle steamers emerge in the morning mist. As the sun meets the moon in the sky and the saxophonist plays a final rendition of Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans before leaping on the red river-front streetcar, do not be surprised if you feel inclined to stay to write that long-planned novel, or take up painting.</p>

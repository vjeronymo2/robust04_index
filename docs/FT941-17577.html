			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Increase in taxes 'will not undermine recovery' Tax increases in the spring will not blow the recovery off course, but growth until the middle of the decade will be unspectacular, unemployment will remain high, and inflation will stay well under control, according to a Financial Times survey. The latest survey of 39 independent economic forecasters shows analysts backing the government view that the economy will grow a modest 2.5 per cent this year, and by only a little more in 1995. While the average of growth forecasts is broadly consistent with Treasury thinking, the survey reveals sharp differences over: The expected impact of last year's Budgets on the recovery; The performance of inflation over the next two years; The extent to which base rates will shift from their present level of 5.5 per cent. Not one of the economists surveyed believes base rates will fall below 4 per cent this year or next. Most expect a half-point cut in the spring as tax increases reduce consumer confidence. But eight expect the government to raise interest rates this year to counter a pick-up in inflation. Economists at UBS, the Swiss bank, unconvinced that the UK has shaken off its boom-and-bust tendencies, believe the intensification of wage pressures, capacity shortages and a deteriorating trade deficit will push inflation up to 8.2 per cent by the end of next year, with interest rates rising to 10 per cent. That contrasts sharply with the consensus which puts retail price inflation at 3.7 per cent by the end of 1995, and base rates at just over 5.5 per cent. Few of the analysts go as far as Mr Roger Bootle at Midland Global Markets to declare that inflation is dead, but they nonetheless do not expect inflationary pressures to mount significantly over the next two years. 'Inflation is a thing of the past and of the future, but not of the present,' says Mr Robert Barrie at BZW, the stockbroker. Forecasts for government borrowing this year and next have been revised sharply downwards, but there is scepticism about the ability of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to restrain public spending as successfully as he hopes. 'No public-sector pay policy has held for more than a couple of years without a catch-up wage explosion,' says Mr David Smith at Williams de Broe. 'It is difficult to see pay restraint holding beyond the next fiscal year,' say Mr Richard Freeman and Mr David Thomas at ICI. Economists are collectively gloomy on unemployment. Not many expect the jobless total to drop below 2.7m this year and even in 1995 the consensus puts it only just under 2.6m. The exception is Mr Patrick Minford at Liverpool University, who, trusting to labour market flexibility, sees unemployment dropping to 2.3m this year and to 1.88m next year.

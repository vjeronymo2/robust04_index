			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RIGHT ON, MIKE  </P> <P> I love it!  </P> <P> The Giant Dipper is almost ready to roll and the developer says they "probably  wouldn't have done it if the shopping hadn't been there" because "it was a real  blighted area."  </P> <P> Nobody mentioned good old Mike Gotch, long the subject of nasty remarks,  attacked as if the development was the worst thing since slum housing.  </P> <P> The center may not be the perfect solution, but given the economic situation of  the time, Gotch really believed the development was a good compromise.  </P> <P> Perhaps he stepped on toes and was less politic than he might have been, but  perhaps the end justified the means this time.  </P> <P> The center is beginning to turn a corner; can no one be found to say that  maybe, just maybe, Mike's decision was the best thing for Mission Beach?  </P> <P> OK, I'll say it: Mike, you were right.  </P> <P> CATHERINE A.  </P> <P> STROHLEIN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

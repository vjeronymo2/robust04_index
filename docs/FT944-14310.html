			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Management: Sights set on higher ground / A look at a German lift-truck group which is raising its profile through expansion Over the past six months there has been an upsurge of interest in learning German at Leighton Buzzard, the small Bedfordshire town where Boss Group, formerly Lancer Boss, makes its lift trucks. 'I've been bombarded with requests for German lessons,' says managing director Jim Porter. Hardly surprising, perhaps, given that Boss was taken over in May by Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck producer, after one of the most controversial UK receivership sagas in years. Yet the old Lancer Boss Group had made its first significant European acquisition in Germany as long ago as 1983 when it bought Moosburg-based Steinbock. 'Half of our turnover and staff were German,' says Porter, 'but attitudes were very insular.' Six months after the takeover, there is still a palpable feeling of relief in the air at Leighton Buzzard as production of lift trucks continues and prospects brighten. The visitor feels a bit like an intruder on an extended honeymoon. 'We are delighted by the acquisition, and hope they are by us,' says Porter  -an oblique reference to workers' fears that a rival bidder would have closed the plant down. Amid the sweetness and light, it is clear that Boss is being transformed into a different company from what it was under its old owners and founders, Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw and his brother Trevor. Yet Jungheinrich, the new owner of both Boss Group and Steinbock (which it snapped up within days of the receivership), has also been changing over recent years. For all the heat generated by the receiverships of both the UK and German ends of Sir Neville's empire, scant attention was paid to the strategic ambitions of the ultimate acquirer. While Bob Bischof, chairman of Jungheinrich GB and now of Boss Group, featured regularly in the blanket coverage given to the saga by the UK press, Jungheinrich's management board chairman, Eckart Kottkamp, kept a relatively low profile. Jungheinrich, along with many in the German engineering sector, has traditionally preferred to let its products do the talking. Founded in 1953, it went public in 1990, although all voting shares remain in the hands of the Lange and Wolf families. Now Kottkamp has spoken at length about how Jungheinrich has survived the recession, why it bought Boss and Steinbock, and what it plans to do with them. It has been a difficult recession, he admits. 'Reunification in Germany blew up the industry's capacity beyond its real need, so when the drop in demand came, the effect was worse,' he says. 'There was tremendous pressure on prices, and the only exit was on the cost side.' Costs had to be cut, and all functions were examined to see if they were strictly necessary. There were lay-offs to adapt to capacity needs  - 600 people or 9 per cent of the workforce last year, mainly in manufacturing. Organisation structures, from the factory floor to the domestic sales and service operation, have been drastically reorganised to improve the service for customers. So far, so conventional, perhaps - at least in an Anglo-Saxon industrial context. But, quietly, Jungheinrich has also been doing the kind of things that would have been unthinkable in many German engineering companies before the downturn. Its changing approach to manufacturing is a case in point. Last year Jungheinrich agreed to form a joint venture near Brno in the Czech Republic with Linde, its bigger German lift-truck rival, producing electric motors for both companies worldwide. This was a significant move for the Hamburg company. While Boss was, and is, essentially an assembly operation, Jungheinrich, in common with many German engineering companies, used to lean heavily towards the 'make' side of the 'make or buy' parts dilemma. Now, says Kottkamp, it wants to concentrate on manufacturing only what is significant for Jungheinrich's competence, or what the customer recognises as its competence and is prepared to pay for. Hence the motors joint venture, which has cut Jungheinrich's motor costs by 40 per cent. Overall, Kottkamp aims to lower what he calls 'manufacturing depth' - or the amount of value added that is generated in house - to 35-40 per cent. Some products are at that stage already, but others are still above 50 per cent, he says. As part of this strategy the company set up an office in the Czech Republic in the spring of last year to co-ordinate the purchase of parts from east European suppliers. These are currently simple parts, such as steel fabrications, counterweights and some gear parts. On top of this, refurbishment of lift trucks has this year mainly been switched from Germany to a long-established partner in Slovenia. The recession in western Europe, he says, also forced many suppliers to increase their competitiveness, offering 'interesting opportunities' for Jungheinrich in countries such as the UK and Italy, as an alternative to sourcing in Germany or own manufacture. All this enabled Jungheinrich to take DM74m (Pounds 31m) out of its operating costs last year, when its sales dipped from DM1.6bn to DM1.4bn, ending a long period of continuous growth. To give itself more protection from the ups and downs of the lift-truck market, Kottkamp has also been spearheading a diversification drive. 'The lift-truck industry is an oligopoly, and all the other producers are part of big groups which are active in other fields. In the long term it is better to have some balancing activity,' he says. In January, it made the first step towards building up a second leg, when it bought Bellenberg-based Wap Reinigungssysteme, one of Europe's biggest producers of high-pressure cleaning equipment used in industry. For three years the company was looking for a business which it could judge and understand, says Kottkamp. The target it was looking for was expected to have growth prospects at least equal to or higher than lift trucks. The chosen deal appears to fit the bill given the environmental and quality issues surrounding the cleaning equipment industry. But the decision to get yet deeper into lift trucks only four months later seems perverse. Kottkamp, however, strongly defends the purchases of both Steinbock and Boss. First, he sees the possibility of broader market coverage, combining Jungheinrich's strength in the distribution sector and large production companies with that of Boss - and especially Steinbock - in small and medium-sized production companies. Second, Jungheinrich recognised the need to develop a full line of lift-truck products, offering customers a one-stop approach to all their materials handling needs - a philosophy that Linde has already used to good effect. So the Boss products - counterbalanced engined-trucks, sideloaders and vast container handlers - matched Jungheinrich's battery-powered warehouse equipment. Third, says Kottkamp: 'We thought we could realise very fast synergies.' Jungheinrich's French company MIC could take on production formerly located at the Boss Barcelona plant, which was not included in the purchase. Some production of counterbalanced electric trucks will move from Nordstedt, near Hamburg, to the Steinbock plant at Moosburg, near Munich. From next year, production of a range of small IC-engined trucks will shift from Moosburg to Leighton Buzzard. The aim is to achieve economies of scale, but Kottkamp points out that Jungheinrich is also reducing Europe's lift truck plants by two - Barcelona and Boss' ill-fated Hyco plant in Italy - thus easing the industry's overcapacity problems. Both Kottkamp and Bischof are delighted by the strength of the Boss product range. Delighted, because the container-handlers in particular have established a world-leading position, and a very strong presence in Asia, which Jungheinrich can build on. They seem surprised, too, because it is hard to see how such products could emerge from a fragmented, untidy manufacturing operation at Leighton Buzzard, with no Cadcam system, high management turnover and chronic cash problems that infuriated suppliers. Bischof, a tidiness fanatic, says more than 500 tons of scrap have been removed from Leighton Buzzard since the takeover. A strong proponent of the takeover from the outset, he admits to having been anxious that executives from Hamburg might have pulled out after he had shown them round. Kottkamp agrees there is 'clearly room for improvement' at Leighton Buzzard, but believes 'the failure of Lancer Boss was due to other areas and not to the manufacturing facilities'. He is also encouraged by the competence of Boss managers. If Bischof's ambitious plans for Leighton Buzzard are approved by Hamburg, the plant will be transformed over the next few years into a world-class volume manufacturer of lift trucks. The Boss chairman also wants to achieve a mixture between the 'chaotic creativity and speed' he has found there and the stricter, more organised structure of Jungheinrich. This partly explains why Boss is being kept as a separate company, a decision that may puzzle advocates of complete integration after takeovers. There will be central financing of the whole group, says Kottkamp - thus correcting a big weakness of the old Lancer Boss - and some common purchasing of parts. Steinbock, for example, would get its electric motors from the Brno joint venture. There will also be 'a continuous flow of personnel' between the UK and Germany, he says, enabling Jungheinrich to improve its understanding of the new UK subsidiary. But Jungheinrich has recognised that the products made at Leighton Buzzard are different from its own, and it makes sense to retain Boss' product development skills and identity, rather than disperse them throughout the organisation. The decision to retain Steinbock as a separate unit within Jungheinrich is perhaps more debatable. Steinbock makes electric trucks for Boss, but its own range competes with that of Jungheinrich in a number of product areas. It is an approach that can be wasteful, because incomplete integration can reduce the benefits of 'synergy'. Kottkamp points out, though, that different truck-types are being concentrated at certain plants, creating centres of manufacturing excellence. The two brands, Jungheinrich and Steinbock, need to be maintained because of their strengths in different market sectors. This means there will be some overlapping, he says, but competition between brands would be limited. With its expanded product range and geographical spread, Jungheinrich now has the opportunity to become a truly global competitor, rather than a big player in European alone. So it will not mind spending a bit on German lessons at Leighton Buzzard.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / The Property Market: Values improve Commercial property values have risen for the first time in more than three and a half years, according to the June figures compiled by the Investment Property Databank, a research group. A rise in values across all the sectors pushed the capital growth index up by 0.5 per cent for the month. The improvement stemmed from a further shortening of yields, which dropped from 9.9 per cent to 9.8 per cent. However, rental values continued to decline, leaving the all property rental growth index at its lowest level since December 1989. The all property total return stood at 2.5 per cent for the second quarter of 1993, against 0.8 per cent for the first. Capital growth showed a marked improvement over the previous quarter, averaging 0.2 per cent, but rental values fell by 3 per cent compared with their 2.5 per cent decline in the quarter to March. The recovery of the first six months of the year will, if it persists at roughly the same rate, be sufficient to produce an end-of-year return to the IPD monthly index of between 5 and 7 per cent. Retails were the best performing sector in June at 1.5 per cent, compared with 0.6 per cent in May.</p>

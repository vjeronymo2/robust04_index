			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Granada steps up pace in ITV game of musical chairs: A determined LWT does not cast itself as helpless target The tempo increased yesterday in the game of musical chairs for the future ownership of ITV as Granada made its expected play for London Weekend Television. Carlton Communication's agreed bid for Central last week removed one large chair. When Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, tried to sit down on the chair of his choice yesterday, Sir Christopher Bland, the LWT chairman made it clear he had no intention of vacating it. For Granada, the leisure, television rental and computer services company responsible for programmes such as Coronation Street, Prime Suspect and World In Action, the attractions are obvious. It was clear when Granada spent about Pounds 84m in June and July to buy a 17.5 per cent stake in LWT, that the London company was the target as soon as the government relaxed ownership rules, now in prospect subject to parliamentary approval. The prospective deal would create the second 'super' ITV company, broadcasting to 16m people and accounting for about 22 per cent of total ITV advertising revenue, second only to Carlton/Central in the pecking order. The offer of 6 new Granada shares for every 5 LWT shares was worth 582p an LWT share at yesterday's close and values the company at Pounds 600m. There is a full cash alternative of 528p. The bid was carefully pitched at a small discount to the LWT price of 585p before the deal was announced. Mr Gerry Robinson argues that the offer already represents a generous takover premium: 54.8 per cent on the share bid before Granada made its summer bid for an LWT stake; and 15.4 per cent to the share price before the government announced its intention to change the rules. Granada brought forward its results announcement to show a larger than expected pre-tax 53 per cent increase to Pounds 176m. Turnover rose 221 per cent to Pounds 1.6bn, earnings per share at 24.8p was up by 56 per cent. The dividend per share rose to 8.75p, up 14 per cent. All the Granada divisions showed increases in operating profit. The operating profits of Granada Television rose 30 per cent from Pounds 33m to Pounds 43m. To complete the attack, Granada said LWT was too small on its own to take advantage of the new opportunities in international television markets. That is not how Sir Christopher Bland sees it. Sir Christopher and his chief executive Mr Greg Dyke spent less than half an hour at a private meeting on Saturday morning with Mr Alex Bernstein, the Granada chairman, and Mr Robinson, to politely but firmly say 'no'. Granada, said the LWT management which collectively owns about 10 per cent of the company worth Pounds 60m, was a conglomerate with only 20 per cent of its operating profit coming from television and therefore had little to offer LWT shareholders. It is likely now that Sir Christopher will sit tight and play the game long. A robust LWT defence document will reply to the Granada offer document and that may take until Christmas. The LWT view is that a fundamental revaluing of the ITV system is under way in the wake of liberalising of the ownership rules and that Granada does not adequately reflect that. LWT is also a potential predator as well as prey and is looking seriously at bidding in its own right for a second ITV licence. There are three potential targets. A bid for Scottish Television would be possible but could become a sensitive political issue. The two most likely prospects are Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, a company in which LWT has a 14 per cent stake and Anglia Television. At Yorkshire, the problems include the need to dispose of the separate Tyne Tees licence because LWT could not hold three licences, and the pre-tax losses of about Pounds 8.5m that Yorkshire-Tyne Tees will announce later this month. Anglia, now capitalised at about Pounds 200m would be an expensive bite, twice as big as Yorkshire-Tyne Tees. Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at stockbrokers Goldman Sachs, believes the Granada bid is 'finely balanced', although it may have to be followed up with a better cash alternative and that LWT could yet come up with 'some angle'. The music may be about to increase in tempo yet again. From January 1, before any Granada deal could be completed, the rules make it easier for European Union companies to take over ITV licences. There have been no reliable sightings so far of continental European players wishing to join. But if there were, the most obvious and attractive target would be LWT, which produces London Burning, Blind Date and The South Bank Show for the ITV network. Lex, Page 18; London SE, Page 38</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stefano Marroni: "Democratic Alliance `Divorces' </F> From Progressives"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- The "merry war machine" is continuing to  lose its components. Less than three weeks after the elections,  and following the separation announced by Communist Renewal and  the PSI [Italian Socialist Party], now also AD [Democratic  Alliance] is bidding farewell, hopping down from the progressive  train, in such tones as to call into question the very  possibility of a federative agreement.    A hectic day of contact-making and meetings seems to have  paved the way in the Chamber of Deputies for the birth of a  foursome, including the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left],  Rete, the Greens, and the social Christians, as well as for the  probable convergence of AD's 12 deputies into the mixed group,  together with the South Tyrol People's Party and Valdostan Union  members -- assuming, of course, that the storm through which  [Pact for Italy leader] Segni's former allies are going (since  yesterday they have also had to cope with spokesperson  Ferdinando Adornato's resignation, offered in a long letter  addressed to AD's leaders) is not the prelude to a major  disbandment.    This is the outcome of a tug of war which has occupied the  progressive front leaders for the past four days. A political  tug of war which, against the background of a yet unanswered  "What next?" and of a compelling grassroots thrust toward unity,  was also fueled by other factors: personal ambitions, unavowed  "logistical" concerns, and, above all, the tensions to which the  electoral defeat has given rise among the left-wing political  forces. It is first and foremost, the war of nerves currently  raging at Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters] between [PDS  Secretary] Occhetto and [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema in view  of a congress scheduled for the fall and which -- as grudgingly  acknowledged at PDS headquarters, where the leadership will be  meeting today -- will certainly not be a "ritual" one.    All this explains the succession of moves and countermoves,  interspersed with crossed vetoes, feints, and double-crossing,  which has ended by leaving in AD's hands the hot potato of an  embarrassing split. After D'Alema "forcefully" shipwrecked the  federative option last week, it has become difficult for  Adornato to counter the thrust of AD's republican component,  which is absolutely determined to break away from the PDS's  "hegemony" and secure independent connections with Segni and  [former Italian Popular Party Secretary] Martinazzoli. In the  Senate, Bruno Visentini immediately started working on the  possibility of setting up an autonomous group of Democrats for  Europe. This would be open to senators for life such as De  Martino, Bobbio, and Valiani. In the Chamber of Deputies, the  same concern first led to a "no" to D'Alema and then gave  [former lower house speaker] Napolitano the cold shoulder and  suggested, at the same time, Giorgio Bogi as the possible  progressive group floor leader.    Last Saturday morning [16 April], playing on the novelty of  a  (strictly speaking) nonparty personality, D'Alema wheeled out  Luigi Berlinguer onto the track. It was the Greens, however,  who got AD out of an embarrassing situation by counterpoising  Anna Finocchiaro to Siena university's former rector. This was  a way of breaking off and saving face, given the split at the  top of the environmentalist federation, with those against  forming a single group prevailing by seven votes against four,  and the quasi-certainty that -- thanks partly to less stringent  rules -- the environmentalists will organize on their own at  Palazzo Madama [Senate].

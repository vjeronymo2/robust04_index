			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Further rates rise warning by Bank Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, yesterday indicated that further interest rate rises might be necessary to control inflation, although he said he hoped rates would plateau 'fairly soon'. The governor said it was too early to say whether Wednesday's half percentage point increase in bank base rates to 6.25 per cent was enough to curb inflation and whether the interest rate plateau would be established at that level or higher. But because the authorities had acted early, the interest rate peak would be lower than before. Mr George said in evidence to the Commons Treasury and civil service committee that he had initiated Wednesday's base rate rise. He recommended a rise to the chancellor because of above-trend growth in the economy and growing inflationary pressures. He said: 'From my point of view, politics were irrelevant.' He conceded that the government's Tuesday night defeat over value added tax on domestic fuel might have influenced the readiness of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to agree to the rate increase. Mr George said that he asked the chancellor's office, before Tuesday's vote, for Wednesday's meeting to be brought forward to 8.45am from the 9.30 time originally scheduled. This was a 'contingency' measure. The governor knew he would advise a rate rise and, in the event of the chancellor agreeing, he wanted time to inform the financial markets before that day's gilts auction. The chancellor's office returned his call after the vote and agreed the new time for the meeting. Mr George pushed aside suggestions that the rate increase was politically motivated. He said the bank had come close to recommending a rate increase a month earlier at the November meeting between governor and chancellor. Mr Clarke did not refer to the vote against the government in the meeting on Wednesday, he added. The governor firmly rejected any suggestion that the minutes of his monthly meetings with the chancellor were doctored. Mr George added his voice to a warning given earlier this week by Mr Alan Budd, the government's chief economic adviser, about the risks of future tax cuts. These, he said, could be justified only if the productive growth of the economy increased. Inappropriate tax cuts that encouraged inflation would lead to higher interest rates, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Udo Bergdoll: "Kohl's Luck With Kinkel"] </F>   [Text] The election of Roman Herzog as federal president  marks the end of the dream that a transition of power will come  about automatically in Germany. Helmut Kohl is the great winner  of 23 May. He convinced the FDP [Free Democratic Party of  Germany] not to tip the scales in the SPD [Social Democratic  Party of Germany] candidate's favor. That the liberals were in  agony over that decision makes his success all the more  impressive.    The chancellor, who predicted a kind of final twilight of  the  gods just a few months ago, is on his way to power again with  his coalition. When it was said that he is no longer strong  enough to keep the eastern German members within the CDU  [Christian Democratic Union], to convince the FDP that they  should trust in him as a life insurance, it was only rumor.  Once again, Helmut Kohl has relied entirely on his instinct for  power. And once again he has had a lot of luck.    Kohl is fortunate to have Klaus Kinkel. One of the reasons  why Kohl got his way after the bad start he had with Steffen  Heitmann, was that he judged the FDP correctly. The liberal  party was torn. One-third of them wanted to see Johannes Rau as  president; he seemed more suitable than Roman Herzog. They also  wanted to signal that the FDP is maintaining a minimum of  independence, that it does not let Kohl dictate their ballot  slips in the Federal Assembly. But the majority were convinced  that they will stand a better chance of surviving this autumn's  elections if they commit themselves to a chancellor who just has  to find out where he stands once again.    In the middle of this test, Kinkel established himself as  party chairman. In his view, the FDP must not waver until the  elections. He was planning the decision in Herzog's favor as a  confirmation of the earlier coalition statement in favor of the  CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union]. Kinkel's signal consists of  three words: predictability, straightforwardness, reliability.  The liberals did not vote for Herzog or Rau, but for their  chairman's demand that they should behave in such a way that  Kohl's coalition feels on its way up again and Scharping's  upward trend seems to have stopped.    In spite of his relative strength, Kinkel has not come out  as  a winner on 23 May. The decision for Herzog was born out of a  weakness. The FDP no longer feels strong enough to want  anything itself, to enforce its own ideas about the candidate's  personality and about the distribution of power in the republic.  The liberals had two options before Herzog was elected. With  the coalition statement, they kept the future with the CDU/CSU  open. At the same time, this statement enabled them to feel  free to indicate a different line for the presidential election.  Kinkel decided in favor of the clear majority in the Bundestag  group that feels closer to the coalition with the CDU/CSU than  the party as a whole does. He turned the Bundestag group's will  into political action cleverly and successfully.    But it has also become clear that Kinkel does not dare do  something on which one of his predecessors was an expert:  juggling with two or more balls. With Genscher as chairman,  the FDP could have voted for Rau. In that case it would have  been wooed by the CDU/CSU and the SPD. The FDP under Kinkel did  not dare do such a thing. It was scared of a "sudden  deterioration of the climate." It prefers being scolded by the  SPD to being chided by the CDU/CSU even if it does not yet see  itself as a liberal working group within the CDU.    At first glance, Kinkel's straightforwardness seems to be  liberating. The hangover comes later. The new president's  first speech has already irritated several of the FDP delegates  who had voted for him. The fact that Herzog wants to represent  Germany "in a relaxed way," that he welcomed citizens from the  East like guests to the West and forgot the foreigners did not  only make Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher and Hans-Dietrich Genscher  wince. Herzog's impromptu speech, formed by the emotions of the  moment, rhetorically plain, made the liberals feel that they are  partly responsible. This will, all the more, make them have to  support this president who might still need to grow into his  office and will certainly not be the image of his predecessor,  Richard von Weizsaecker.    With the decision in favor of Herzog, the dream of a  transition of power fades, the image of Helmut Kohl's upswing  moves to the foreground. In this republic, the chancellor is  the one who makes decisions. In the coalition, the dog once  again wags the tail, not the other way around -- as sometimes  happened before. The FDP does not consider it in its interest  to prevent the chancellor from coloring everything his way. But  this could annoy some of the voters.    Will Kohl's success turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory in the  end? This depends on whether Kinkel's hope of his loyalty to the  chancellor being appreciated is fulfilled. On the evening of 16  October in Bonn, the CDU/CSU and the FDP will have to get enough  weight on the scales to be able to harvest the fruit they sowed  in Berlin in May. For the chancellor, a cancellation of the  twilight of the gods will not be sufficient. More than ever  before, the FDP will determine Helmut Kohl's fate.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ivaylo Kutov: "Congress of Camouflage"] </F>   [Text] The latest congress of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist  Party] confirmed that the Socialists are still afraid of the  political responsibilities of the time. The declaration of their  intention to go for elections in the fall is nothing more than a  scrap of paper, at the very least, because it does not envisage  any procedure or compelling force to make them overthrow the  Berov government in the autumn so as to provoke the elections.    The BSP top leadership also pretends it is disturbed by the  status quo and that it has set course for elections. These are  mere empty phrases, nothing more. At present, it is very  convenient for the Communists to rule without bearing any direct  responsibility. Someone may say that, following the events in  Poland and Hungary, they may have hopes of winning  independently. Even if something of the kind occurs, which I do  not believe for one moment, they will not know what to do with  the power when they get it. The new geopolitical situation  forces them to operate in the conditions of a pluralist  democracy. Even in Brezhnev's time, the Polish and Hungarian  Communists were more accustomed to working in an environment  containing elements of dialogue, with the organic necessity of  stating the reasons for their decisions and actions to their own  people and the civilized democracies. For this reason, the  successors of the Polish and Hungarian Communists have some  experience of working in conditions of dialogue and competition.    Our BCP [Bulgarian Communist Party] was a foreign branch of  the CPSU [Communist Party of the Soviet Union]. It never made  an independent decision, either mechanically carrying out  Moscow's directives or imitating, in an inimitable way, the  decisions of the CPSU.    This is why the present BSP top leadership is well aware  that  as the party in power, the only thing that will happen is that  it will finally expose itself for what it is. In any case, they  will lose the next elections. Even if they should by chance win  something, they will not know what to do with it.</p>

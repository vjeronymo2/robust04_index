			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bogdana Paun report: "Three of the Ethnic Hungarians </F> Pardoned by Iliescu Have Not Been Released From Jail"]    [Text] Three of the eight ethnic Hungarian convicts who  were pardoned by Ion Iliescu, namely Istvan Illyes, Ferenc  Boldizsar (both inhabitants of the village of Zetea), and Mihaly  Balint (of Cristuru Secuiesc), have not been released from jail,  although their names were also mentioned in the presidential  pardon.    In the case of the three named persons, the presidential  initiative was overruled by the Alba Iulia City Court. The  reason given was the unfavorable report of the Aiud penitentiary  direction. The report cites an attempted breakout (Illyes), the  slapping of the face of a cellmate (Balint), and the gravity of  the crime for which he was convicted (Boldizsar).    All three have appealed the Alba Iulia Court decision.    "The UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania]  lawyers  and parliamentarians will take all possible legal steps to have  them released and to have the presidential decree applied in  their case as well," says a UDMR communique.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Cookery: Teaching men to fend for themselves BEFORE WE got married, my husband used to woo me occasionally with his cooking. He was a dab hand at such menus as asparagus hollandaise, baked sea trout with cucumber and new potatoes, and a salad of peaches in orange and lemon juice. Blinded by love, I failed to notice what he has pointed out since - his repertoire ran to three or four menus only. This is as much as a chap needs to sail through social life, of course. But if the aim is to gain enough knowledge and confidence to create variations on culinary themes, and thus become a fully-fledged cook, then a proper understanding of ingredients and cooking methods (rather than the mere learning of recipes by rote) is necessary. The belief that every man should be able to fend for himself in the kitchen  -and fend occasionally for others, too - explains why colleagues Lyn Hall, Lorna Wing and Roz Denny have decided to rescue non-cooking males in distress. Next month, they will launch Bachelor Cooks, a course to be held in Fulham, west London, on six consecutive Monday evenings. (How sensible for them to choose such a time - Mondays are always low tide on the social calendar). Classes will be limited to 12 and each lesson will take the form of a menu. First, it will be discussed and demonstrated by the three colleagues, then cooked by the bachelors working in pairs. By 9pm, everyone should be sitting down to eat the fruits and meats of their labours. At this point, the party will be joined by a guest expert who will talk about, say, buying cheese or wine. Sample menus will include Provencal filo fingers, honey-glazed roast chicken, basmati pilaf with green herbs, and brochettes of exotic fruits with crushed kiwifruit and gin sauce; and char-grilled vegetables with olive oil bruschetta, steak with red wine sauce and mustard butter, green salad with hazelnut dressing, and whisky syllabub with red fruits. Each menu is, I gather, designed for two people. I imagine there will be instructions on multiplying them for a dinner party as, seductive tete-a-tetes apart, they are not normally the the sort of meals I would consider cooking for two (rather unsuitable, I would have thought, if a friend rather than a lover were coming to supper or for a single parent with a hulking teenager to feed). The trio promise a very practical approach. Plenty of attention will be paid to shopping such as where to buy, how to recognise quality, and how to use bought-in foods in spectacular ways without feeling guilty. Some short-cuts will be encouraged, but only those that do not compromise fine results. There will be help with those most vexed problems for the novice cook: unravelling the finer points of what can and cannot be prepared ahead without deterioration, and learning to organise timetables so that the various components of a meal come together precisely when you want them. Each of the trio specialises in different fields. Hall is an ace tutor of classic French cuisine, on her own account and for Michel Roux at the Waterside Inn. Wing is a queen bee in catering circles, creator of deliciously witty and imaginative party pieces. Denny is a writer and television cook with a solid reputation for good, plain dishes expounded in a modern and cosmopolitan way. TOAST-RACK TOMATOES (serves 2) For those who have not yet learned to boil the proverbial egg, here is a pretty and fairly substantial appetiser that involves no cooking at all. For each person, you will need one largish (5-6 oz) tomato with good flavour. This is a tall order, I agree, but I hope Bachelor Cooks will tell you where good tomatoes can be bought. There is a good Pick-Your-Own market garden called The Green Landscape, in Hurst Lane, Egham, Surrey. Remove the stalks and sit the tomatoes, calyx end down, on plates. Slice each tomato almost, but not quite, through to the base, rather as though preparing a stick of French bread in readiness to receive garlic butter. Fan open gently and sprinkle sea salt, black pepper and torn basil leaves between the slices. Take about 7 oz of mozzarella di bufala cheese. Cut slices to size and insert them into the tomatoes, like white pieces of 'toast' standing in scarlet racks. Drizzle extra virgin olive oil between the slices as you insert them. Spoon a little more oil over the top and scatter with more basil before serving. Lightly-toasted ciabatta bread from Marks &amp; Spencer will do well for mopping up the delicious juices.

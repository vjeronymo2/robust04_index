			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "hen": "Bonn Will Withdraw From Many Companies </F> in the Future"]    [Text] Bonn -- On Thursday [24 February] the Federal  Cabinet approved the intention of Finance Minister Theo Waigel,  Christian Social Union [CSU], to privatize a number of federal  companies either completely or in part in the near future. The  biggest of the candidates for privatization is the Deutsche  Lufthansa AG in Cologne, where, in Waigel's view, the framework  conditions for a withdrawal of the Federal Government are  extremely favorable at the moment. In a few days he expects an  expert clarification on the problem of Lufthansa's pension  obligations.    Upon Waigel's proposal, the Federal Cabinet came out in  favor  of further reducing the number of the Federal Government's  company participations and real estate holdings. The latest  participation report by the Federal Government shows a total  number of 410 direct and indirect participations at the end of  1992. The cabinet stressed that the privatization policy, as  the most important part of Bonn's action program for more growth  and employment, has high economic priority. In the future, it  must be an absolute exception to have tasks done by the state or  to keep tasks within the state's sphere of responsibility if  these tasks could be done just as well by private persons. The  privatization policy, which has been pursued by Kohl's  government since 1982, has yielded total revenues of about 11.6  billion German marks [DM] so far.    The financial scope of future privatizations at the federal  level (without real estate holdings) will, however, rather run  into the "one-digit billions." Only by including the Federal  Government's special assets -- Telekom, above all -- can a  double-digit billion sum be expected in the medium term. Waigel  appealed to the laender and communities to follow the example of  the Federal Government on their own responsibility and to also  privatize their comprehensive participations. The Federal  Government will support this process by amending the budget  principle law.    Among the short-term privatization measures the Cabinet  approved are, in addition to Lufthansa, the reduction of federal  participations in the Rhein-Main-Donau AG, the Neckar AG, the  Bundesanzeiger Verlagsgesellschaft mbH [publishing company], as  well as the Gesellschaft fuer Nebenbetriebe der Bundesautobahnen  mbH [company for subsidiary enterprises of the federal  highways]. The list of short-term privatization measures or  sales of participations also includes: Deutsche  Aussenhandelsbank AG [German Foreign Trade Bank], Staatsbank  Berlin [Berlin State Bank], Genossenschafts-Holding Berlin-DG  Bank [Berlin-DG Bank Cooperative Holding], DFA Fertigungs- und  Anlagenbau GmbH [DFA Assembly and Installation Construction  Company], Gesellschaft fuer Lagereibetriebe mbH [Warehouse  company], Heimbetriebsgesellschaft mbH [Homeworkers' company],  Bayerische Lloyd AG, Osthavellaendische Eisenbahnen AG [eastern  Havelland railroads], a recreation home in Davos owned by the  Federal Government, as well as various participations in housing  construction.    The Federal Government is striving for medium-term  privatization solutions for the future three share-holding  companies Telekom, Postdienst, and Postbank. At the moment it  cannot yet be decided which part of the privatization revenues  from Telekom will go to the company itself because there is  still a lack of "solid bases for economic assessment," Waigel  said. In contrast, Federal Post Minister Wolfgang Boetsch (CSU)  recently gave the impression that he had already come to an  agreement with Waigel on this controversial issue of the second  part of the postal reform.    According to the federal finance minister, the sale of the  Federal Government's east German real estate holdings has made  good progress. So far, real estate property at a value of more  than DM1.3 billion has been sold and property worth DM2.3  billion has been restituted to the original owners for free. In  order to further accelerate the sale, a division of labor  between the Federal Property Administration and the Trust  Agency's Property Company (TLG) has been instituted since the  end of 1993. While the Federal Property Administration  clarifies the legal and real matters involving real estate  property, the TLG takes over sales management.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> USAir, All Nippon Airways Plan Link: USAir Group agreed to initiate service  between Orlando, Fla., and Washington as part of a cooperative agreement with  All Nippon Airways.  </P> <P> The agreement allows ANA to offer customers round-trip flights between Tokyo  and Orlando -- a popular tourist destination -- with a stop in Washington. Both  airlines said they have asked the U.S. government to allow shared flight codes  and blocked space arrangements, under which ANA would guarantee USAir a certain  amount of revenue for the Washington-Orlando flights. The airlines said they  would explore other cooperative arrangements, perhaps on flights between  California and Japan.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BECKMAN TO ISSUE $100 MILLION IN NOTES TO PAY OFF U.S. BANK DEBT  </P> <P> Putting its newly acquired, high-grade commercial debt ratings to work, Beckman  Instruments said Thursday that it plans to retire its long-term U.S. bank debt  and replace it with cheaper money raised by selling corporate IOUs.  </P> <P> Dennis Wilson, Beckman vice president and treasurer, said company officials  have authorized the sale of up to $100 million in commercial paper, an amount  that should allow the company to pay off most of its domestic bank debt.  </P> <P> He said the interest rate that the company will pay to purchasers of its  commercial paper -- basically short-term, unsecured promissory notes -- is  between one-quarter and one-third of a percentage point lower than the best  interest rates Beckman can get from its banks.  </P> <P> While those numbers seem small, the difference between paying 8% a year and  7.75% a year on $90 million in debt is $225,000.  </P> <P> The first corporate paper, to raise between $50 million and $60 million, will  be issued today, Wilson said. Goldman Sachs is underwriting the issue. Wilson  said Beckman is able to issue paper at lower interest rates than banks charge  because of its high-quality credit ratings.  </P> <P> Standard &amp; Poor's assigned Beckman an A-1 commercial paper rating last week  -- the highest it awards. And Moody's Investment Service gave the company a  mid-level Prime-2 rating earlier this week.  </P> <P> The ratings qualify the commercial paper as investment grade and show that both  credit rating services believe Beckman is in good financial shape and unlikely  to have problems repaying its debt.  </P> <P> Beckman, which merged with SmithKline Corp. in 1982, became an independent  public company again in July.  </P> <P> The company is an international manufacturer and marketer of scientific  instruments, analytical systems and related products for the fields of  life-sciences research and clinical diagnostics.  </P></p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Chelsfield plans to go public CHELSFIELD, the private property group headed by Mr Elliott Bernerd, is planning to go public within four to six months either through a flotation or a reverse takeover of a quoted company. The plans to seek a listing on the stock market emerged as speculation spread in the City about the financial well-being of the group. The speculation centred on the demerger of Pall Mall, the joint venture vehicle for the assets of Laing Properties, which Chelsfield acquired with P&amp;O for Pounds 492m in April 1990. This will require an injection from Chelsfield of about Pounds 250m into the joint venture from which it will acquire half the UK assets and a 50 per cent stake in the US assets, Mr Bernerd said. The Canadian properties will be acquired by P&amp;O. Mr Bernerd confirmed that Chelsfield has already made arrangements to satisfy the cash injection through senior lending with banks of between Pounds 100m to Pounds 120m, a further Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m of loan stock with equity rights and the remainder coming from an equity placing. Mr Bernerd also confirmed that the demerger of Pall Mall would be conditional on the repayment of a Pounds 340m non-recourse loan made to the joint venture. Following the placing, Chelsfield will have Pounds 360m of gross assets, Pounds 120m of senior debt and Pounds 60m of subordinated loan stock. Gearing would be at about 33 per cent, excluding the loan stock. Mr Bernerd, who will retain about 50 per cent of the enlarged share capital, said that the preferred route for the company in going public was through a reverse takeover. There were 'a good half a dozen situations' among listed property companies that have lost their way in terms of stock market recognition, are unloved and provide a good opportunity for Chelsfield to reverse into. Mountleigh, which Chelsfield has been rumoured to be interested in for some time, was a very good example of such a company, Mr Bernerd said.</p>

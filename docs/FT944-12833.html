			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Historic ship cruises through city centre One of the world's most historic and revolutionary ships, the 100-year-old Turbinia, made its final voyage yesterday - by road - through the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne to the Discovery Museum, Chris Tighe writes. Once the fastest ship on the oceans, Turbinia was the world's first turbine-propelled vessel. Its construction in 1894 changed the face of maritime engineering. The ship was designed by Sir Charles Parsons, inventor of the steam turbine and one of a highly influential set of engineers who made Victorian Tyneside an internationally renowned centre of innovation. Turbinia astonished spectators at Queen Victoria's Spithead review in 1897, setting a record speed afloat of 34 knots, about 40mph. The ship was laid up in 1908 and for the past nine years the fragile 100ft long vessel has been in storage in Newcastle, away from public view. Yesterday, in a painstaking two-hour removal operation, it was transported by road at 5mph on a specially constructed cradle. Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, which includes turbine-generator manufacturer Parsons, the company founded by Sir Charles, paid the Pounds 62,000 cost of moving Turbinia and making the structural steel supports on which it will rest at the museum.</p>

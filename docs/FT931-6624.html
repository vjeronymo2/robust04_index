			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Bosnia aid plan 'a risk worth taking': Three cargo aircraft leave Frankfurt on presumed start of air-drops MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday played down the risks to US air crews as the air-drop of relief supplies for Bosnia was reported to have got under way. He said the operations were 'a risk well worth taking' and probably involved less danger than existing relief flights into Sarajevo airport. German television reported last night that cargo aircraft had left Frankfurt airbase to make the first air-drops of crates of food and medicines to villagers stranded by fighting in remote parts of Bosnia. The ZDF television channel said three C-130 transport aircraft had left on the mission and it showed one of the aircraft taking off from the military base at Frankfurt airport. But the US military, which has put a news blackout on the flights, declined to confirm or deny that any aircraft had left the base. Mr Christopher claimed the fact that ground convoys were currently getting through in Bosnia with less trouble might well reflect the imminence of the US airdrops. 'It is a statement of greater US involvement,' he said. Speaking in a TV interview, Mr Christopher said the weekend dropping of leaflets telling people of the impending operation had been 'successful and routine'. He also sought to play down domestic criticism that the US was being drawn into a Balkan quagmire. Citing the number of missed opportunities in the last 18 months to control the conflict, he argued that now 'the great risk is that we do nothing'. He noted the dangers of a wider Balkan conflict and added: 'We have a stake in preventing the world from going up in flames.' Mr Christopher also firmly rejected the notion that the countries of Europe were not doing enough to help. 'There is a division of labour and responsibility,' he said, noting the presence of British, French, Spanish and Canadian troops in Bosnia and the use of Nato surveillance aircraft. In advance of the air-drops, two Hercules C-130 cargo aircraft on Saturday scattered boxes containing 1m leaflets over eastern Bosnia - written in Serbo-Croat in both Cyrillic and Latin script, and emblazoned with the US flag - urging people not to open fire on the aircraft and to stay clear of the falling crates. But first reports by ham radio from Gorazde, a besieged town in eastern Bosnia, said the leaflets had missed their mark. Mr Hadzo Effendic, the mayor, said no leaflets had dropped in Gorazde, Radio Zagreb reported. The radio quoted Mr Effendic as saying some leaflets had fallen in no-man's land between the frontlines. He said Srebrenica and Zepa, two of a handful of Bosnian government strongolds in eastern Bosnia, had not found any leaflets. United Nations officials and representatives of Bosnia's three main ethnic groups have already inspected the first 96 crates being delivered in the first air-drop. Serb leaders have expressed suspicions that weapons will be included in the air-drops. Weighing 704kg each, the parcels include ready-to-eat meals. Smaller crates have medical supplies, including non-prescription medicines for people suffering shortages of anaesthetics and antibiotics. Meanwhile, a fresh row flared between Moslem-led Bosnian government troops and Bosnian Croats, nominal allies in the civil war, when Bosnian Croat forces announced that they were closing all supply routes between Croatia and Moslem-held territory. The Croatian Defence Council (HVO) accused the Bosnian government forces of deploying 25,000 troops in central Bosnia and abandoning the fighting against Serb forces. But Croatian television reported later that the HVO had agreed to let through Bosnian army convoys at border points if they were destined for regions where HVO and Moslem forces were jointly fighting the Serbs.</p>

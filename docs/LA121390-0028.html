			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO ADMIRATION FOR THE GRAND LIFESTYLE  </P> <P> How nice for Norman and Claire Weiss to have options the rest of us can only  dream about ("Turning Away From Grand Lifestyle," Dec. 2).  </P> <P> Without begrudging these people anything, I resent The Times' presentation of  their decision to live a simpler life in Utah on $500,000 a year as indicative  of some sort of national trend.  </P> <P> This is simply another of those articles, so ubiquitous over the past decade,  that enjoin the common folk to admire and envy the wealthy as we toil to meet  basic needs.  </P> <P> When will your editors realize that we down here at the bottom of the  trickle-down are weary of being asked to fawn over the amassment of wealth by  the few on top?  </P> <P> CONNIE COOK  </P> <P> Brea  </P></p>

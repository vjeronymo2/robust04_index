			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Expanding Bowthorpe seeks Pounds 64m Bowthorpe, the international electronic and electrical components group, yesterday announced a Pounds 64.4m rights issue to fund the expansion of its instruments and sensors business. The company hoped the 1-for-8 placement, involving the issue of 20.6m new shares at 320p, would enable it to pursue acquisitions and strengthen a balance sheet depleted recently by the Dollars 21m (Pounds 14m) purchase of Lear Siegler, the US measurement controls company. The issue would also offset the Dollars 17.2m cash purchase of Kaye Instruments, another US instrument manufacturer. Although borrowings had increased sharply, the company was expecting pre-tax profits to grow 18 per cent to Pounds 50.5m (Pounds 42.7m) in the 12 months to December 31. Of that increase, Pounds 4.8m would be due to beneficial currency translations compared with Pounds 900,000 last time. A final dividend of 5.03p (4.57p) would raise the total to 6.91p (6.36p). Mr Colin McCarthy, financial director, said increased demand in the UK and US had persuaded the company to expand in those markets. 'We'd like to find suitable acquisitions in the UK, but there are more opportunities overseas. The rights issue will help us exploit those,' he said. COMMENT Bowthorpe, which last made a cash call shortly before the 1987 stock market crash, has a reputation for shrewdly exploiting its buoyant share price to raise capital. So although the issue price of 320p looks attractive against yesterday's close of 373p, analysts suspect the market price might be overvalued. Indeed, a 9p fall on the day suggests some investors felt it was time to take profits. Bowthorpe, however, has not let down investors in the past by making poor acquisitions. Forecast pre-tax profits for next year have been increased to Pounds 59.5m, putting the shares on a forward multiple of 20.7 and reflecting market confidence about the group's strategy.</p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Savoy head dismisses speculation of Forte bid MR GILES SHEPARD, managing director of The Savoy Hotel, yesterday dismissed speculation of a renewed bid from the Forte group following news that his board could not rely on the support of a key investor in any takeover battle. 'What has been said does not alter anything one iota,' he said yesterday. Mr Shepard was responding to reports that a trustee of the Swiss-based Fondation Pour la Formation Hoteliere, which controls 5.7 per cent of Savoy's voting shares, had insisted decisions made by the trust could not be 'based on loyalties and personal friendships'. 'A trustee has to say he will do what is in the best interests of the trust,' Mr Shepard said. In 1989 Forte - which holds 42.5 per cent of the Savoy votes - agreed not to buy Savoy shares for five years and promised to give a year's notice of any bid, in return for a seat on the board. However, recent events may encourage Forte, which failed in its attempt to take over the hotel in 1981, to rethink its contract. The death of Savoy's anti-Forte chairman, Sir Hugh Wontner, in November was followed by the collapse of St Anselm, the property company, which owned 4.29 per cent of Savoy voting shares. The shares are now in the hands of receivers Cork Gully, and could be up for sale. Mr Shepard said the agreement with Forte still held. It was legally binding, he said, and 'I think honourable people would always stand by it'.</p>

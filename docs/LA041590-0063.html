			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALIBU DIAPER SERVICE NEEDS RETHINKING  </P> <P> Lerner Gray need no longer feel guilty about disposable diapers in the Southern  California landfill, but she has made a trade-off:  </P> <P> 1.  </P> <P> Diesel-spewing diaper delivery trucks rolling up Pacific Coast Highway to her  home in Malibu.  </P> <P> 2. Additional use of energy (whether gas, electric or both) to run washing  machines and dryers, and heat wash water to the extremely high temperatures  required to sterilize soiled diapers.  </P> <P> 3. Finally, the gallons of water used to launder 90 cloth diapers each week.  Taken over a one-year period, this is a tremendous amount of water usage.  </P> <P> In consideration of our serious drought in California, one could recommend that  born-again environmentalists switch to disposable diapers.  </P> <P> SANDY HACK  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

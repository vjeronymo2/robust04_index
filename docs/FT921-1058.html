			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Boeing's share price struggles to take off: Anxieties about the US aircraft group outweigh opportunities What is keeping Boeing grounded? Shares in America's leading airlines have taken off since the beginning of the year on hopes that their recessionary problems are almost behind them. But shares in Boeing, the world's leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft, have not risen in the slipstream. Not even an upbeat presentation to Wall Street analysts earlier this month by Mr Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman, has had much impact on the shares. They have been trading at around Dollars 45, giving a prospective price-to-earnings ratio of about 9, compared to roughly 15 for the Standard &amp; Poors 500 index of leading stocks. But Boeing has a strong balance sheet, a Dollars 92bn (Pounds 53bn) backlog of firm orders - equivalent to roughly three years' sales - and is one of the few large US industrial companies which can still claim to be undisputed world leader of its sector. Moreover, its recent annual survey of the industry's outlook struck a bullish note, predicting world air travel would grow about 5.2 per cent a year for the next 18 years, and that airlines would buy around Dollars 857bn worth of aircraft during that time. Given that sales rose 7.2 per cent a year between 1970 and 1990, Boeing's forecast - virtually unchanged from those of the two previous years - is perfectly feasible. But Wall Street remains edgy about near-term prospects, particularly over the order book. During the past few months two of the three largest US airlines - United and American - have announced cuts in aircraft purchases for the next three years. United said it would take delivery of only 156 aircraft, compared with 278 it had on order or options. The cuts include 44 Boeing 737s and 60 Boeing 757s. Boeing says its contracted Dollars 92bn backlog has so far been unaffected. But it has deferred delivery of many of these aircraft and will have to cut 737 production from 21 to 14 a month next October. This, with cuts in its defence business, will mean 8,000 job losses by the end of the year. Mr Shrontz said the company still expected to deliver a record 440 commercial aircraft this year, up from 435 in 1991, while the group's revenues (including defence operations) were expected to total around Dollars 29.5bn, against last year's Dollars 29.3bn. Some analysts argue that deliveries by the three major manufacturers - Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Europe's Airbus Industrie - could suffer over the next few years if other airlines follow American and United, and economic growth outside North America slows further. Mr Kenneth Holden, chief strategist for GPA Group, the large Irish airline leasing company, predicted recently that while the jumbo jet market would be stable over the next few years, deliveries of narrow-bodied jets by all makers would decline by 42 per cent between 1991 and 1995. At the very least, the market is likely to remain soft over the next few years, which will intensify pricing competition Boeing faces from Airbus which clinched a deal this month to sell nine A310s to Delta for Dollars 600m. McDonnell Douglas could also become a more weighty competitor to Boeing if it sells a large stake in its civilian aircraft business to Asian investors. Boeing's earnings over the next few years will depend on the extent these market weaknesses are offset by positive factors, including progress in developing its 777 jet, and declining research and development spending; a productivity drive to improve operating margins; and a return to health by its defence business. The 777, a wide-bodied twin jet which fits between the 767 and the 747-400 jumbo, is due to enter service in 1995, competing against McDonell Douglas's MD-11 and Airbus's A-330/340. Boeing said the 777 project would involve research and development spending totalling Dollars 1.8bn for 1992, and then between Dollars 1.4bn and Dollars 1.6bn for several years. It is also spending between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 2bn on new facilities over the next few years, including a plant north of Seattle to produce the 777. As a result, the company's cash flow will remain negative, but its balance sheet is strong, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 16 per cent in spite of about Dollars 1bn in debt last year. However, Wall Street remains worried the company might plunge straight from the 777 into building an aircraft, dubbed the 787, which could seat 600 passengers or more. Boeing set up a group last year to investigate this market, but Mr Shrontz insisted 'the studies are very preliminary.' Airbus is also studying development of an ultra-large aircraft. The company's earnings should also be lifted by the sale of its loss-making de Havilland commuter aircraft business to Canada's Bombardier and a return to profit by its defence business, after three years and nearly Dollars 1bn of losses. With the Pentagon cutting its procurement budget by 25 per cent over five years, all US defence contractors face shrinking markets. But Boeing is involved in two of the biggest contracts in the 1990s - the Advanced Tactical Fighter and the Commanche Helicopter - and expects the division to remain in profit this year on sales of around Dollars 5bn, down from Dollars 5.8bn last year. Wall Street expects earnings per share of around Dollars 5 this year, against Dollars 4.56 in 1991, rising to between Dollars 5.25 to Dollars 5.50 in 1993. Some analysts said this backdrop, and growing perceptions of airline health, could trigger a sharp rise in the stock, but for now the anxieties outweigh the opportunities.  ----------------------------------------------------           YEAR-END ANNOUNCED ORDER BACKLOG  ----------------------------------------------------                            Total         Boeing                        1990*   1991   1990*   1991 Units                 3,563   3,158  1,843   1,665 1992 dollars, bn      201.9   190.7  109.7   104.5  ---------------------------------------------------- *Adjusted for 1992 cancellations Source: Boeing  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

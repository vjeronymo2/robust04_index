			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> METS TURN ON POWER TO DOWN PHILLIES, 5-2  </P> <P> For the first time this season the New York Mets looked like the Mets of 1988  -- a club capable of winning with power.  </P> <P> The Mets got consecutive third-inning home runs from Darryl Strawberry, Kevin  McReynolds and Keith Hernandez Monday night, ending an offensive slump to beat  the Philadelphia Phillies, 5-2.  </P> <P> Hernandez left the game after five innings with a slight sprain of the right  groin and is on a day-to-day basis.  </P> <P> "We're not a last-place ballclub and there's no reason for us to play like  one," Strawberry said. "It was just a matter of time."  </P> <P> The Mets began the game with the worst record in the National League at 3-7 and  had scored only 35 runs, fewest in the league. They had a team batting average  of .223, and had only four home runs.  </P> <P> Manager Davey Johnson criticized the team for its lackluster effort and banned  the players from playing cards or golf on the road.  </P> <P> Strawberry hit a pitch by Don Carman over the left-center field fence with one  out in the third. It was his fourth home run of the season. McReynolds hit  Carman's next pitch for his first home run and two pitches later Hernandez hit  his first homer.  </P> <P> Sid Fernandez won his first start of the season, allowing two runs on five hits  in 5 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> Don Aase relieved with the bases loaded and two out in the sixth. He struck out  pinch-hitter Curt Ford with three fastballs and Randy Myers took over in the  ninth for his second save.  </P> <P> The Mets' Kevin Elster played his 71st consecutive game without an error at  shortstop, one short of the major league record set by Eddie Brinkman of the  Detroit Tigers in 1972.  </P> <P> Montreal 2, Chicago 1 -- Andres Galarraga hit a two-run homer in the sixth  inning at Montreal as the Expos ended the Cubs' seven-game winning streak.  </P> <P> Kevin Gross pitched 6 2/3 innings and allowed nine hits for the victory. Tim  Burke got the last three outs for his second save.  </P> <P> San Francisco 9, San Diego 0 -- Converted reliever Scott Garrelts pitched a  six-hitter, and Will Clark and Candy Maldonado each drove in three runs as the  Giants beat the Padres in Candlestick Park.  </P> <P> The Padres, who have lost five of their last six games, were shut out, 5-0,  Sunday by Rick Mahler and the Cincinnati Reds.  </P> <P> St. Louis 4, Pittsburgh 2 -- Ozzie Smith's run-scoring double sparked a  three-run eighth inning at St. Louis, leading the Cardinals past the Pirates.  </P> <P> The Cardinals managed four doubles off reliever Brian Fisher to break a 1-1 tie  in the eighth.  </P></p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Film industry campaigns for levy on distributors British film makers yesterday launched a campaign to persuade the government to impose a voluntary levy on film distributors backed by a series of tax breaks in order to rejuvenate the industry. Supported by actors such as Michael Caine and producers David Puttnam and Jeremy Thomas the 'Impact' campaign argues that money from cinema, video and pay-television distributors should be transferred to British film-making in return for tax breaks. Mr Tom Gutteridge, chairman of Pact, the main film and television producers' organisation, said that modest changes could lead to Pounds 220m a year in extra finance for the industry and would cost the government nothing after two years. 'We are not looking for additional government subsidy,' he said. 'Our plans are going to make money for Britain.' The main suggestion is that all those who distribute films in the UK would be assessed and then encouraged to spend a small percentage of qualifying revenues  - probably around 1 per cent  - on British film-making. In return they would be able to get a 100 per cent write-off on the investment in the first year. At the moment film investment is written off over three years. Impact believes this measure could generate Pounds 60m a year of new production finance for the industry. A further Pounds 160m could be raised if the first-year tax deduction available to all British films was increased to 65 per cent. The National Heritage Department helped to fund a study by Hydra/Olsberg, strategy consultants for Pact which provided most of the Impact proposals. To make the scheme more flexible for the distributors, this study suggested the creation of Film Depository Receipts which they would receive after promising to help finance British films. The FDRs could be combined from different sources to finance a single film and would be a flexible means of attracting the special tax concessions for the distributors. 'If the system we propose were introduced then the effect would be to revitalise the UK production base without denting the profitability of the investors involved,' Mr Gutteridge said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On Friday the State Duma voted to set up its own TV  and radio service as a department in the apparatus of the lower  chamber of parliament. It will be in charge of preparing daily  radio and TV programs on activities of representative power  bodies in Russia. 265 deputies voted in favor of this  resolution, only 62 were against.    Deputies were not stopped by a statement of the presidential  press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov made the day before, in  which he described the creation of such a TV and radio service  as reanimation of "infringement of the former parliament on  prerogatives of free mass media" and as an attempt by the State  Duma "to create information privileges" for itself.    Kostikov's statement said: "The president is concerned that  the resumption of information dictate may lead to the fall of  the Duma's prestige, and this in turn will damage the process of  strengthening the civic accord."    The press secretary also drew attention to the fact that  neither the president, nor the government, nor the Council of  Federation have their own broadcasting service. "The president  urges deputies of the State Duma to show wisdom, political tact,  and to take into account lessons of living history," Kostikov  resumed.    Most observers doubt that such a step by the State Duma may  lead to a serious complication of its relations with the  president. Some experts, however, believe that the latest  actions by the lower chamber of the parliament confirm the  recent apprehension expressed by Boris Yeltsin in a conversation  with the faction Union December 12 about insufficiently  constructive and fruitful work of the Duma.    On Friday most deputies attending the Duma session (189)  spoke in favor of putting on the agenda the issue "On  anti-constitutional decrees by the president" proposed by a  representative of the communist faction. He had in view a  package of six reformist "economic" decrees by Boris Yeltsin  made public earlier this week. However, the positive decision on  putting this issue on agenda ran short of 36 votes.    On the same day the State Duma postponed the discussion in  the second reading of a draft law on the federal budget for 1994  until June 8. IF Note: According to the treaty on civic accord  signed by the chairman of the State Duma and a majority of its  factions, the lower chamber pledged to pass a law on the federal  budget for this year already in the first half of the year.</p>

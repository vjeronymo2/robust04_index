			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Indian industrial output rises: Jump of 8.75 per cent will boost public support for reforms Indian industry, which saw production stagnate after the launch of the country's economic reforms in 1991, is recovering sharply this year, according to government estimates published yesterday. The data will boost public support for the reforms among businessmen who earlier complained at the extent of the slow-down in demand caused by widespread economic restructuring. Executives will also take heart from recent inflation figures which show a slowing in the rate of price increases. Industrial output rose 8.7 per cent in May, compared with the same month last year, the largest monthly increase since before Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, launched the reforms. The jump in May followed a 7 per cent increase in April. The recovery is being led by a sharp rebound in the production of capital goods, which suffered particularly badly in the early post-reform period because the government, an important buyer of industrial equipment, cut orders in an effort to trim public spending. This year, private companies, intending to modernise and expand their factories, are fuelling demand for capital goods. Capital goods output in May was 19.6 per cent higher than in May 1993. While the data is provisional and subject to adjustment, government officials and business executives alike believe that the recovery is broadly-based and expect it to continue for some time. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, earlier this month forecast that industrial output for the year to the end of March 1995 would rise 7 per cent over 1993-94. Some industrialists foresee an increase of up to 10 per cent. Meanwhile, government figures published at the weekend show the rate of increase in wholesale prices, the most widely followed indicator of inflation, fell in the week ending September 3 to 8.3 per cent, compared with the same week in 1993 - the lowest rate recorded this year. Inflation has slowed from a peak of more than 11 per cent in the spring, when prices were affected by sharp increases in the cost of government-controlled goods and services such as fuel and transport.</p>

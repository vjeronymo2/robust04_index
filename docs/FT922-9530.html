			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (5): A tale of triumphs and disasters  -Banks have scored bigger profits and record loan provisions THE SWISS banking industry has lived through a bewildering combination of triumphs and disasters in the past year. Many banks scored handsome increases in profits. The big three universal banks all recorded new records on the bottom line and showed that in spite of the unpopularity of the notion of global banking these days they could made significant progress in international markets. Yet most banks had to make record provisions for bad loans, some in connection with the embarrassingly well publicised collapses of companies controlled by Mr Werner Rey and the late Robert Maxwell. The Swiss banking community was also embarrassed by the spectacle of the forced closure of a sizeable regional bank, Spar und Leihkasse Thun, last October, something no-one ever expected to see in Switzerland. And early this year, the removal by Moody's of its triple A rating from the long-term debt of Credit Suisse, and its threat to do the same to Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) caused further discomfort. Moody's cited the increased risk to banks caused by the liberalisation of Swiss banking and security markets in the past two years, but the indications are that over the period both the big universal banks and the top private banks have strengthened their positions in securities dealing and fund management. Probably the most important of these developments is the growing success of the big three banks in world markets. Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), the largest, and Credit Suisse have had considerable troubles in the past with their foreign subsidiaries and SBC was slow in establishing an international strategy. But in the past year, aided by their strong balance sheets and no doubt also by the retreat of troubled Japanese and US banks from the key international markets, the big three have found profitable pickings in international lending, foreign exchange dealings and fund management. Credit Suisse said 30 per cent of its net income came from foreign operations, but Bank Julius Baer, in a recent study, argues that the figure would be more like 66 per cent if income from the group's Luxembourg-based mutual funds, which are managed from Zurich, were included. UBS said the foreign contribution to its earnings last year tripled to 25 per cent. SBC said that its association with the derivative specialists, the O'Conner Partnerships in Chicago, in which it invested about SFr90m a little over a year ago, yielded net income of SFr107m last year, but overall foreign earnings were depressed by large provisions on bad debts. In spite of the Thun failure, the country's regional banks also did well. The Union of Swiss Regional Banks (VSRB) said its 173 members increased their combined net profits by 12 per cent to SFr264m and enlarged their balance sheets by 5.1 per cent to SFr86.1bn. However, even their combined profits are tiny in comparison with UBS's SFr1.2bn last year, indicating the need for further consolidation. Mr Robert Studer, chief executive of UBS, startled a Zurich audience in March by predicting that 100 of the country's banks could disappear in the next 10 years. That seems a large number for a small country, but it makes more sense when you consider that Switzerland's total bank count is still a whopping 630. Indeed, some might think Mr Studer's proposed reduction too modest. Leaders of the country's financial services industry have known for a long time that rationalisation was inevitable, and that the need for action had intensified since various cartel-like conventions, providing protection for various types of banks, were abolished. But they preferred not to think about it much until the failure of Spar und Leihkasse Thun shocked them into action. It was the first time in memory that the Federal Banking Commission had closed a well-known bank without warning, and the sight of queues of depositors outside the bank's doors was not one anyone had ever expected in Switzerland. In the wake of the closure, the various bank associations in February agreed to set up a two-layer safety net designed to prevent any more forced closures. First, the VSRB, which represents many of the smaller local banks that are in the greatest difficulties, has formed an examining board to discover problem cases and try to solve them. Union officials say that about a dozen of their 185 member banks are now being examined. Ideally, another bank will be found to take on the problem bank or its assets. If a problem bank refuses to co-operate, the Federal Banking Commission will apply pressure. If no bank is willing to take over the troubled bank, a working group within the Swiss Bankers Association will move in to make sure that, whatever happens, creditors are protected. Meanwhile, rationalisation is also the order of the day among big banks. In his March speech, Mr Studer also shocked his audience by suggesting that one of the big three might decide to give up retail banking in the foreseeable future because profits were so thin in this area. Analysts immediately pointed the finger at Credit Suisse, the third largest of the big three, and a relatively recent player in the retail area. However, Credit Suisse officials denied that they had any intention of abandoning its retail network. Nevertheless, all three big banks are now looking carefully at their retail businesses for ways to raise revenues and trim costs. Thus, UBS announced in January that it would concentrate certain specialised services in a limited number of branches rather than have every branch offer every service. Credit Suisse said it had already made considerable progress on this front. Mr Franz Galliker, chairman of Swiss Bank Corporation, said last month that SBC too was thinking of 'streamlining' its branch network. In March, SBC announced that it was restructuring Banca della Svizzera Italiana, in which it acquired a majority stake last year, to become part of a private banking group, leaving it with retail activities only in its canton Ticino base. The big three banks have also participated in the trend among leading Swiss companies to greater transparency and investor friendliness in recent months. They have much stronger equity bases than most of their leading international competitors, but their return on equity, ranging from 7 per cent to 10 per cent, still leaves considerable room for improvement.</p>

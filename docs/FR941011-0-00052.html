			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Public Information and Consumer Protection <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State's original submission addressed all the elements of this section (40 CFR 51.368), except for a provision to automatically supply test repair facility performance data and diagnostic information to motorists that fail the emissions test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the supplemental submittal details the information that will be provided to motorists that fail the emissions test, including test repair facility performance data and diagnostic information. Therefore, taken together, the original and supplemental submittals sufficiently address all the elements of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Improving Repair Effectiveness <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The original submittal sufficiently addressed all the elements of the section (40 CFR 51.369), except for the issue of repair facility performance monitoring. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State's supplemental submittal, however, provides the necessary materials to establish an acceptable system of repair facility performance monitoring. The supplemental submittal establishes a program to provide motorists whose vehicles fail the I/M test with performance monitoring statistics of certified repair facilities. Therefore, the supplemental submittal together with the original submittal sufficiently addresses all the elements of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Compliance with Recall Notices <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State's original submittal did not sufficiently address the elements required by this section, 40 CFR 51.370. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However the State's supplemental submission along with the original submittal provides a sufficient basis for approval of this section. The original and supplemental submittals ensure that vehicles included in either a voluntary emission recall or a remedial plan determination pursuant to the CAA, have had the appropriate repair made prior to the inspection. The managing contractor will identify vehicles which have not been identified as having completed recall repairs. Motorists with unresolved recall notices will be required to show proof of compliance or will be denied the opportunity for inspection. The SIP also commits to comply with the policies of the National Recall Committee and additional the EPA rulemaking when available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Concluding Statement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA has reviewed the Western Michigan I/M SIP revision submitted to the EPA, using the criteria stated above. The State's original submittal along with the supplemental submittal represent an acceptable approach to the I/M requirements and meet all the criteria required for approvability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A more detailed analysis of the State's supplemental submittal and how it meets Federal requirements is contained in the EPA's Technical Support Document (TSD), dated August 30, 1994 which is available from the Region 5 Office, listed above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Response to Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36123), the EPA published an NPRM for the State of Michigan. The NPRM proposed approval in part, and conditional approval or disapproval depending upon the materials submitted by the State 2 weeks prior to close of the comment period. No public comments were received on the NPRM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By this action, the EPA is fully approving this submittal. The EPA has reviewed the State submittal against the statutory requirements and for consistency with the EPA regulations and finds it to be acceptable. The rationale for the EPA's action is explained in the NPRM and will not be restated here. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered in light of specific technical, economical, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

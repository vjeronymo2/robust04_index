			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICK DU BROW: CAN'T-MISSES, SURE-FIRES AND MONEY IN THE BANK  </P> <P> TV or not TV ...  </P> <P> SUMMER DAZE: It was a year ago, and everyone knew what TV's new fall hits would  be.  </P> <P> Remember?  </P> <P> "Chicken Soup," with Jackie Mason, couldn't miss following "Roseanne."  </P> <P> But it was soon axed.  </P> <P> "The Famous Teddy Z" had Hollywood drooling with its gags about a talent  agency.  </P> <P> America shrugged. And Teddy was gone.  </P> <P> "PrimeTime Live" was sure-fire with Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer -- the Jack  Nicholson and Meryl Streep of TV news.  </P> <P> But Sam and Diane mixed like oil and water.  </P> <P> A year ago, we hadn't even heard of "The Simpsons," "Twin Peaks" and "America's  Funniest Home Videos" -- all late network starters.  </P> <P> But Madison Avenue whizzes figure they still know where the smart money goes.  Media buyer Paul Schulman offers a few bets on this season:  </P> <P> Like almost everyone, he's sold on "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," with rapper Will  Smith.  </P> <P> "Money in the bank," says Schulman.  </P> <P> "America's Funniest People" will also score, he adds -- because it follows  "America's Funniest Home Videos."  </P> <P> And "Gabriel's Fire," with James Earl Jones as an investigator, could do  respectably against "Cheers," he says.  </P> <P> Flops? Schulman has little hope for "The Flash" (based on the comic strip),  "Life-stories" (dramas about medical patients) and "Sons and Daughters" (about  a Northwest family).  </P> <P> Possible sleeper, says Schulman: "WIOU," about a local TV news operation.  </P> <P> HIT AND MISS: Easy to understand why "Knots Landing" is back for its 12th year  -- best soaper on TV. But an eighth season for "Night Court"? Go figure.  </P> <P> AT EASE: Can't tell you how much we missed Todd Donoho's KABC Channel 7 sports  trivia questions during our vacation. We almost rushed back. But a few weeks  away from Arsenio Hall is rejuvenating.  </P> <P> CLOTHES HORSE: Best reason for watching the 11 p.m. newscasts in Los Angeles is  Fred Roggin's first-class wardrobe. If the KNBC Channel 4 sports guy picks out  the stuff himself, he's definitely worth the $800,000 or so he reportedly gets  per year. Right? Of course.  </P> <P> AFTER HOURS: Let's be generous and not even discuss Rick Dees' late-night ABC  series.  </P> <P> EXECUTIVE SEARCH: The endless turnover of CBS News presidents -- with David  Burke the latest to go -- is disgraceful and demeaning to an organization that  once was the jewel of network journalism. The place is beginning to come across  like a palace of medieval intrigue.  </P> <P> STIRRINGS: With Deborah Norville's negative publicity beginning to subside, or  at least become old news, NBC's "Today" show has quietly picked up a trifle in  the ratings over the last few weeks.  </P> <P> TOURISTS: Forget "The Simpsons" and "The Cosby Show" Thursday -- competitor "48  Hours" sounds like it's got some ideal summer viewing: an hour visit to the  Grand Canyon.  </P> <P> PEER PRESSURE: Fox TV has broken another barrier in its fight for parity with  ABC, CBS and NBC. For the first time, Fox will be represented when executives  of the major networks address the Hollywood Radio and Television Society's  annual kickoff luncheon for the new season Sept. 11.  </P> <P> ON THE MOVE: Linda Alvarez and John Beard were the anchors on KNBC's late news  the other night, but reporter Patrick Healy registered more authority.  </P> <P> BLUEPRINT: Since news shows usually draw older viewers, reruns of "The Golden  Girls" should be an ideal 7:30 p.m. lead-in to KCAL Channel 9's three-hour  prime-time newscasts when the station launches its fall season Sept. 17.  </P> <P> CANDIDATES: Two clergymen who sought the presidency and failed are staying in  the public eye with TV series this fall. "The Jesse Jackson Show," a new,  issue-oriented, syndicated program with the Democrat, will debut on KCAL Sept.  24 as a 5 p.m. Sunday entry. And Republican Pat Robertson is, of course, seen  on "The 700 Club" on the Family Channel.  </P> <P> ONE OF A KIND: Roseanne Barr once dropped in on his cable show because she  likes him. A lot of performers do. And on Sept. 9, waiter-comedian Mr. Pete, a  loony, sardonic performer, moves up in class to KTLA Channel 5 with an 11:30  p.m. Sunday debut. It's called "The Late Mr. Pete Show." And the comedian  describes it as "the 'Tonight Show' gone bad."  </P> <P> HOME STRETCH: Voting on Emmy Awards nominations was held Saturday and Sunday at  the Beverly Hilton, and here's how it works: More than 1,500 panelists judge  their peers in 76 separate panels -- that is, performers judge performers,  writers judge writers, and so forth. Fox airs the Emmy Awards show Sept. 16.  </P> <P> POTENTIAL: With some really good writing, stars Jean Stapleton and Whoopi  Goldberg could turn CBS' "Bagdad Cafe" into one of the best shows on TV.  There's something very nice about the way they work together, but without great  words to sustain the fragile premise of friendship in a remote diner, forget  it.  </P> <P> SHOWCASE: If you never really looked at "Beauty and the Beast," which won a  host of Emmy nominations but was canceled by CBS, you have another chance when  the Family Channel reruns the series starting Sept. 7.  </P> <P> BEING THERE: "The first requisite of culture is good manners." Who said it?  Charles Laughton in his impressive role as a teacher in the World War II film  "This Land Is Mine," shown on the American Movie Classics channel.  </P> <P> Say good night, Gracie ...  </P></p>

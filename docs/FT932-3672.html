			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Sport: Somerset's rustic joys - Cricket DOWN IN Somerset, it is a delight to see how much they like cricket. While there are only three first-class grounds - at Taunton, Bath and Weston-super-Mare - they attract good crowds. Pubs and hotels decorate their walls with framed photographs of cricketing heroes. 'You're never far from cricket down here,' said the proprietress of our hotel. The church just down the road from the county ground in Taunton goes further than that, proclaiming itself on its notice board as 'St James next to the cricket.' You even smell the game in Somerset because you are never far from cider - and cider sponsors cricket. The Taunton ground is small, basic and welcoming, selling better cider than beer. It has a little museum with a wide range of exhibits, including one of Joel Garner's size-15 cricket shoes. Such fondness for the game is all the more remarkable since Somerset have never won the county championship. Their nature is to play at full tilt, erratically. One-day cricket kept things cheerful, starting with victory in the Gillette cup and John Player league in 1979, the Benson and Hedges cup in 1981 and '82, and the NatWest trophy in 1983. In those five years Somerset became the rustic champions of big-hitting cricket, basking in the feats of their great west country heroes: Ian Botham, Viv Richards and Joel Garner, natives of Cheshire, Antigua and Barbados respectively. Somerset always have had a strong sense of local identity, without letting Somerset ancestry or provenance cramp their style. The other day, I watched their cosmopolitan team play a team from Glamorgan which had five Welsh players and several with Welsh accents. By contrast, only one of the Somerset players, batsman Richard Harden, came from Somerset. The rest were imports, not just from elsewhere in England but, in the positively universal mode of numbers eight, nine and 10 in the Somerset line-up, from Pakistan (Mushtaq Ahmed), New Zealand (Andrew Caddick) and the Netherlands (Adrianus van Troost). So far, Mushtaq looks like a successful signing. Those who saw him removing England's spin-blind batsman last summer will remember how effective his leg-spin, peppered with googlies and wrong 'uns, can be on English pitches. He is the right kind of high-voltage cricketer to revive Somerset. In turn, they are taking care to keep him happy because they are liable to intermittent spots of bother with their overseas players. Last year, the South African all-rounder Richard Snell, was released after a feeble season; Australian Ken Macleay went home to take up farming; and Dutchman Roland Lefebvre was allowed to end his contract a year early. I watched Lefebvre playing for his new county, Glamorgan, along with another ex-Somerset man, Richards. Somerset got rid of Richards and Garner after the 1986 season whereupon Richards' furious friend, Botham, also left. It was a bitter set of dismissals and departures and Peter Roebuck, appointed captain in 1986, fought to keep his team together. In 1987, he was helped by the new overseas signing, New Zealander Martin Crowe, who was just what the county wanted: a devoted club man as well as a star batsman. When New Zealand's quickly-arranged tour of Sri Lanka at the end of the 1987 season was cancelled just as quickly, Crowe flew straight back, like a true son of Taunton, to play for his county. Nevertheless, Somerset have lacked both inspiration and brute force since their one-day flourish a decade ago. Last year, they finished ninth in the county table, the first time since 1984 they have managed to get as high as half-way. They got there in true Somerset style, with dramatic victories at the beginning and end of the season, a dead patch in the middle, and a rattling game against Pakistan - which they lost all ends up. Caddick's six for 73 on Somerset's behalf shared the headlines with Mushtaq's five for 46 for Pakistan, Mushtaq impressing his victims' talent scouts in the process. Somerset recovered some of their sparkle last year under the dynamic guidance of their new director of cricket, Bob Cottam. It is to the credit of both that Cottam and captain Chris Tavare that two such different characters can work together, particularly as Tavare has been struggling to recover his form. His grafting 148 not out off Glamorgan's uninspired bowling was slow going, but invaluable to Somerset's eventual win. The lady next to me in the crowd gave a combined nod and shake of her head when Tavare reached his century with an elegant cut for four. 'I like him to play his shots,' she sighed. Tavare likes it, too. He is a natural stroke player, as he showed for Oxford university and Kent in the 1970s. He explained, with a wistful smile: 'I just fell into the dour mode because it was the best way to stay in the Test team. I know it's boring. Even I get bored sometimes.' Tavare is a quiet, modest man, nicknamed 'Rowdy' by his team-mates and inclined nowadays to play quiet, modest cricket, except sometimes in one-day games when he plays fiercely. He says he likes Somerset, to which he moved in 1989, cheered all the way by his Somerset-born wife. In 1990, he took over the captaincy from his old Oxford friend, Vic Marks, and found his first year in office pretty tough. 'I had to re-appraise the captaincy. But things are better at Somerset now and we have some young talent coming through.' That young talent includes Harvey Trump, an enthusiastic off-spinner born in Taunton, and Mark Lathwell, a fearsome opening batsman. When Lathwell opens with Nick Folland they make an opening pair with panache. Both, like Mushtaq, were recruited bravely by Cottam. Somerset are one of the few, precious counties (Derbyshire are another) for whom enthusiasm and style matter more than results. Good luck to them.</p>

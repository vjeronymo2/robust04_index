			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Nuclear Electric gets go-ahead for Sizewell B Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generator, has cleared the last significant regulatory hurdle in the run-up to commissioning Sizewell B, Britain's first pressurised water reactor power station. The Pollution Inspectorate has granted an authorisation for the Suffolk plant, built within its Pounds 2.03bn budget, to routinely discharge radioactivity into the environment. The decision follows a second round of public consultation made necessary earlier this year by a High Court case involving the Sellafield reprocessing works of British Nuclear Fuels. It means that Nuclear Electric can proceed with its plans for the Sizewell reactor to start up in the middle of next month. Final commissioning procedures will have to meet standards set by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the UK safety watchdog. Sizewell B is expected to achieve full power by the end of February - in line with a commitment given to the government at the public inquiry in 1983 which considered plans to build the plant. As a result of the Sellafield case the Pollution Inspectorate was required to be satisfied that there would be a net public benefit from the operation of Sizewell B, taking into consideration routine discharges of radioactivity. It received hundreds of representations from groups and individuals calling for the authorisation to be refused. The inspectorate has concluded that there is a balance of advantage in favour of Sizewell B. It has also concluded that the discharge limits set will protect human health, the safety of the food chain and the environment generally. Nuclear Electric last night welcomed the decision which, it said, vindicated the company's case that nuclear power had a role to play in UK energy policy. Ms Bridget Woodman, national nuclear campaigner for the Greenpeace environment group, said there was no justification for the decision because the radioactive waste which would be produced by Sizewell B was not needed. She said the risks of an accident were not acceptable. Nuclear Electric said: 'We are delighted that this authorisation means we can achieve the target we have always set ourselves.' Nuclear Electric wants to build another plant at the site. The twin-reactor Sizewell C would have a capacity of 2,500MW and would cost about Pounds 3.5bn to build.</p>

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Sonic, stamps and Sex: FT writers pick their top products of 1992 A year of recession took its toll. From the US to Japan consumers were watching their purses and manufacturers were wary. Innovative products were thin on the ground. Amid a disheartening lack of exciting consumer electronics products, the one bright spot was the launch of Philips's Digital Compact Cassette (DCC). But optimism was short-lived, as consumers realised they could face another battle over industry standards comparable to the VHS and Betamax video wars of the 1980s. Like Philips's DCC, Sony's MiniDisc attempts to replace the ageing cassette tape with a digital product that will deliver the crisp sound of CDs. But with incompatible formats, Philips and Sony are now vying for the allegiance of leading record companies to ensure sufficient recorded music. Elsewhere it was a question of improving on the tried and tested. This was the year VCR manufacturers finally realised that 80 per cent of owners are clueless about how to record programmes. The answer was VCR Plus - an idiot-proof system aimed at techno-illiterate adults. Instead of fumbling with endless codes, users set their machines by punching in one set of numbers. Each programme has an assigned code, found in TV listings, which switches the VCR on, sets the channel, starts recording and stops automatically. The year underscored the selling power of rock stars, dead or alive, with Madonna selling Sex and Elvis selling stamps. A million Americans took part in a summer poll to decide which image of Elvis should be used on a commemorative stamp. The new stamp, available next month, is expected to be the hottest-selling stamp in US history. The initial printing of 300m stamps is twice the normal run for a commemorative issue, and it is still not expected to meet demand. Madonna moved on to the bestseller list in October with her book, Sex, featuring nude photographs of the Material Girl in poses more publicity-minded than pornographic. The book was censored in Japan and almost banned in Canada, although critics dubbed it a bore. But it was neither Madonna nor Elvis who stole children's hearts. Un-doubtedly the cult figure of the year was the improbable Sonic, a hyperactive, steel-blue hedgehog. Sonic is not your typical hero. But the spiky mammal enabled its maker, Sega, the Japanese games company, to perform the unthinkable feat of challenging Nintendo's dominance in the video games market. Elsewhere in Japan, Seibu, the stylish Tokyo department stores, opened a recycled kimono corner, a move reflecting consumers' new, frugal approach to shopping. While a new kimono costs more than Y500,000 (Pounds 2,645), used ones cost about Y40,000. About 200 second-hand ones are sold every month, though there has been a rush of customers this month to Seibu eager to buy a traditional kimono before the new-year festivities. While Japanese women look to the past, an invention by a Japanese textile scientist is helping the fashion world claw its way forward in the teeth of recession. Today, no self-respecting fashion retailer would be without clothes made of microfibres - microscopically thin filaments of polyester or nylon. Microfibres make quality hosiery and can be mixed with wool or linen to create silk-like blends. In the pharmaceuticals industry, nicotine patches, which look like large sticking plasters and curb cigarette cravings by steadily delivering nicotine into the bloodstream, hit the US market early in the year. Demand soon outpaced supply in spite of FDA criticism of patch advertising, and patch sales for the year are estimated at Dollars 800m (Pounds 526m). With a six-month success rate of about 25 per cent, the patches do not qualify as a miracle cure. Sometimes, however, a drug can just be too successful. Imigran, Glaxo's breakthrough migraine treatment, known in the US as Imitrex, relieves migraine symptoms in 77 per cent of patients within four hours. But the drug has certainly proved a headache for health ministries, worried it could blow a hole in their budgets. The British Medical Journal calculated that, if it achieved 100 per cent market penetration at Pounds 20 per treated attack, it could cost Britain's National Health Service Pounds 1.344bn a year. The annual NHS drugs bill is Pounds 3.2bn. Over the summer months minds were temporarily diverted from money matters by the Olympic Games. The hit product of Barcelona was undoubtedly Olympic champion Chris Boardman's racing bike. Its black finish and enigmatic, faintly menacing shape suggested more Spanish Inquisition than Spanish Olympics. Developed by Lotus Engineering, part of the sports cars subsidiary of General Motors, the ultra-lightweight LotusSport pursuit cycle combined advanced composite materials and unique aerodynamics. Cheap it was not. Replicas of Boardman's bike would cost about Pounds 5,000. Come the autumn and British minds again returned to finances. The 3 percentage point fall in base rates which followed Britain's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism left mortgage rates at their lowest level for 15 years. Homeowners took advantage of the lower rates by subscribing to fixed-rate offers. Many were so popular they were snapped up immediately. But in a year of doom and depression, Chanel, the Paris fashion house, could be relied on to come up with something really frivolous - Y-fronts for women, dry clean only, at Pounds 100 a pair. Chanel is coy about how many pairs it has sold. It probably does not care. In the 1990s, the amount of publicity a new design produces is the often the key to the turnover it generates.

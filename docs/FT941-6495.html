			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Volatility, interest-rate uncertainty deter borrowers A handful of borrowers announced plans yesterday to tap the international bond markets. However, on the whole, new issue activity remained rather subdued in the wake of the recent turbulence in Europe's financial markets and uncertainty over US interest rates. Ontario Hydro, the largest electricity utility in Canada, plans to launch a CDollars 1bn global floating-rate note (FRN) with a five-year maturity. Merrill Lynch, the joint bookrunner, said the deal would provide investors with the first substantial FRN offering in Canadian dollars. Ontario Hydro, which has an Aa2/AA- credit rating, has an expected borrowing requirement of between CDollars 2bn and CDollars 3.8bn per annum over the next three years. Given that the US Federal Reserve has already raised short-term interest rates, and the somewhat uncertain interest rate background, Merrill said it expected to see demand for the FRN from investors who want exposure to Canadian dollars, and who are expecting a similar rise in Canadian short-term interest rates. Waiting in the wings for more suitable market conditions is a Dollars 500m, 10-year fixed-rate Eurobond issue from the African Development Bank. The bank is a relatively rare borrower in the international bond market: the proceeds will be used for general treasury purposes. Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, known as KfW, announced yesterday it would delay the launch of its much-publicised dragon bond issue until market conditions had stabilised. KfW, with a triple-A rating, has been planning to bring a Dollars 300m, five-year fixed-rate dragon bond to Asian investors, but decided to delay the issue because of the current weakness in the US Treasury bond market. Meanwhile, undeterred by the market conditions, International Telecommunications and Satellite Organisation (Intelsat), launched a Dollars 200m, 10-year dragon bond issue priced to yield 37 basis points over the US Treasury bond. Nationwide Building Society is redeeming a Pounds 300m issue of floating-rate notes early, and is offering investors the chance to switch into a new issue on slightly more attractive terms, which effectively gets rid of the 5 per cent floor. The issue was launched in 1986 and is due to mature in October 1996. It had a coupon of one-month Libor plus 8 basis points, and had a floor of 5 per cent. The new issue, which will be for up to Pounds 300m, is paying a coupon of Libor plus 10 basis points and will also mature in October 1996. Baring Brothers, the lead manager, said there was a shortage of paper maturing in 1996.</p>

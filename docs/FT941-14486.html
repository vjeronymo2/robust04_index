			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / People: Serif Eric Holroyd, 67, has stepped down as chief executive of Serif, less than a month after the refinancing of the loss-making printing and packaging group. John Sandiford, the company's finance director, said that Holroyd was a company doctor and now that the refinancing had been completed there was less need for his services. Holroyd will remain on the board as a non-executive director and a new chief executive is being sought.</p>

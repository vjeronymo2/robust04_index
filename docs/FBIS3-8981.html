			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle at today's news  conference spoke about the results of a recent visit to Chile  and New York. He also replied to some of the questions  concerning relations with Croatia. Nadja Pengov has more  details about the news conference:    [Begin recording] [Pengov] The visit to Chile was of  political and economic nature and was successful in both  aspects, as Foreign Minister Peterle says. The partners  displayed interest in the new markets in Europe and Slovenia can  play an important role as a sort of service in this function.  Great interest in the economic cooperation with Slovenia was  also expressed by the Chilean economics minister. The talks  that the economic part of the Slovene delegation held with the  representatives of the association of industrialists were also  successful.    The foreign minister will again visit Latin America in May.  On that occasion he will go to Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay  where he will sign several economic agreements.    The purpose of the visit and the talks at the UN  Headquarters  in New York was, according to the minister, to accelerate the  lifting of the arms embargo for our country. The partner in  talks was French Ambassador Merimee who is presiding over the UN  Security Council this month.    [Peterle] Mr. Merimee was pleased with this meeting and said  that new circumstances and new reasons have emerged for Slovenia  to be exempt from the embargo. However, he saw no possibility  of this happening immediately, that is to say, very soon. He  believes that the action should be pursued further on this  basis. Judging by these talks I believe that we are actually  considerably closer to this solution than we used to be.    [Pengov] The opinion of the Brazilian ambassador to the UN,  who is the head of the UN Sanctions Committee, was similar. He  promised that his commission will act in a way so as not to hurt  Slovenia. Now to other issues:    Bearing in mind that the second meeting of the  Slovene-Croatian border commission was scheduled to take place  today and that the meeting did not materialize, the foreign  minister, when asked about the reasons, replied that the  postponement had been proposed by the Slovene side. The reason?    [Peterle] There is no new basis for the work of the  commission because the Croatian part of the expert group, that  is to say, the geodesists, do not show any willingness to  continue searching for a common solution for those sections of  the state border for which consensus has not been reached yet.    Let me say that the fact that the Croatian Post and  Telecommunications public enterprise without any prior warning,  let alone consent, redirected the telephone lines of some  subscribers on the territory which is within the land registry  district of Secovlje does not have a positive effect, also in  connection with the work of this commission.    [Pengov] What about the refugees moving out of the Slovene  holiday homes in Istria? The owners of the holiday homes  rejected the request to extend the deadline for their stay and  the deadline will thus have to be observed as it was agreed.  [end recording]</p>

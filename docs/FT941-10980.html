			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK stores There has been plenty of ink spilt recently on the subject of tax rises and their blood-curdling impact on consumers. Yet recent work by James Capel suggests the fears are overdone. While taxes will rise by some Pounds 10.4bn this year, consumer spending may rise by Pounds 19bn as a result of increases in income and a rundown of savings. The question is how this extra money will affect prospects for the retailing sector. Retail sales tend to be more volatile than overall consumer spending, since they contain a greater discretionary element. Equally, non-food retailing tends to benefit from an upturn more because food purchases are pretty stable. So while Capel's estimate of Pounds 19bn equates to an increase of 4.7 per cent in consumer spending, the broker thinks that non-food retailing could grow by 6.5 per cent. Large stores may do even better. After inflation, quoted stores volumes may rise by almost 4 per cent, only slightly less than the healthy 1993 figure. Against that, there is much talk of further pressure on margins. Retailers such as Sir Geoff Mulcahy of Kingfisher have made much of low prices as the way to lift sales. Sir Malcolm Field of W H Smith has said that this competition may be more apparent than real. Capel's statistics seem to support this view. Margins have only fallen slightly in the past three years, and are expected to remain stable in 1994 and 1995. The squeeze on prices has been offset by a mixture of fewer discounted sales, better stock control and improved sourcing. It is companies such as Burton and ironically, Kingfisher, which still have much of this work to do, that will find it hardest to offset the pricing pressures.</p>

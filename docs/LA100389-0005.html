			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATASTROPHIC CARE CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Your extensive article on the catastrophic care bill was complete, thorough and  objective (Part I, Sept. 24). We all believe in the purposes of this  legislation, but what is now frustrating seniors is the failure of our Congress  to address valid criticisms.  </P> <P> I recently attended a meeting of the Aging Commissions of the county. Contrary  to Sen. David Pryor's (D-Ark.) comments that "they don't understand the  benefits they are going to have," each of the more than 200 present knew every  benefit in minute detail. Unlike Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) and Rep. Pete  Stark (D-Oakland) who allege the outcries come from a few wealthy, greedy  people, these were normal, good people who have saved a few dollars and know  fairness when they see it.  </P> <P> And they recognize that when Congress recites the support of the American Assn.  of Retired Persons, this is a biased group, self-interested, whose support is  not representative of the majority of its members.  </P> <P> As with the recent pay raise issue, the public is again speaking, loud and  clear. It is democracy at work. The need for such grass-roots involvement  reflects poorly, however, on the present state of our representative form of  government.  </P> <P> TED BRUINSMA  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

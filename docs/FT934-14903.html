			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Observer: Sinking feeling It was more a case of sinking than floating at Allders yesterday. The department store and duty free retailer planning a stock market listing in November was due to present its pathfinder prospectus to stockbrokers in the City, but was nearly rained off by the local monsoon. Finance director Tony Collyer was stuck on a train from Bath which was stopped by rain water lapping the sleepers. And copies of the document itself were in a van from the printers which was held up by floods. Luckily chief executive Harvey Lipsith's train had made it to town and he conducted the presentation single-handed.</p>

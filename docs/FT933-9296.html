			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Payment disappoints Interim profits from General Accident, the composite insurer, were at the very top end of market expectations but failed to induce any substantial buying interest in a market where optimists had been looking for an increase in the interim dividend. The latter was held at 9.7p, with some analysts pointing out that GenAx has been criticised in the past for paying out too much in dividends. Dealers said the 9 fall in the share price to 683p represented no more than small-scale selling by disappointed speculators. Turnover was an unremarkable 2.4m shares. Mr Youssef Ziai, insurance analyst at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, described GenAX's figures as 'very encouraging', and said a rights issue is less likely with solvency margins at 49 per cent. The broker shifted its stance from 'sell' to 'hold'. Enterprise Oil was a big casualty in an otherwise sedate oil and gas sector as the market reacted badly to news that Mr John Walmsley, the group's highly-rated finance director, is to leave the group at the end of the year. Enterprise fell 12 to 439p on the news with turnover expanding rapidly to a higher than normal 1.1m shares. 'The market has taken this news very badly and is scenting that perhaps something could be going wrong at Enterprise,' said one analyst, who added that Mr Walmsley has been at Enterprise since the group was floated on the market in the early 1980's. International news and information organisation Reuters fell 24 to 1524p on news that the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) had suspended discussions on joining the company's Globex system, the after-hours electronic trading system owned with the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Turnover was 1.1m shares. Mr Brian Newman of Henderson Crosthwaite said it was no more than a technical reaction to a small piece of bad news. Another analyst said the announcement had triggered profit-taking after the recent strong run in the shares. Bank shares, among the market's best performers since the UK withdrew from the ERM last September, suffered from a bout of profit-taking, largely triggered by 'take profits' advice from one of the leading London broking houses. Standard Chartered, reporting interims tomorrow and whose shares have been hitting new peaks in recent sessions, tumbled 14 to 882p as talk of a hefty cash call along with the figures began to filter into the market. Any rights issue, however, is expected to be well taken and nearer to Pounds 250m than Pounds 500m. Lloyds Bank was the biggest casualty in the high street banks, the shares dipping 12 to 534p on 4.8m traded, with dealers noting plenty of switching out of Lloyds and into Barclays and NatWest. The latter settled 6 off at 497p and the former 4 off at 498p. Merchant banks, on the other hand, continued to make good progress, with Kleinwort Benson 6 up at 498p and SG Warburg 4 better at 797p. Commercial Union retreated 11 to 649p, affected by General Accident. Royals were active and eased 4 to 343p. News International moved 11 ahead to 255p on the back of its recent successful bid for a controlling stake in StarTV, the Hong Kong-based satellite system. Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, appreciated 5 to 479p and Reed International, the international publishing group, climbed 10 to 663p. Both companies had underperformed the market over the past period. In the media sector, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi shed 4 to 168p, although its interim results were in line with market expectations. SG Warburg downgraded the group's final pre-tax profits forecast from Pounds 27m to Pounds 24m on high redundancy costs in Europe. The announcement that Owners Abroad was appointing Mr Michael Julien as chairman saw the shares rally, closing 10 ahead at 77p. Turnover was a healthy 6.7m. Dealers said the appointment reassured some investors who considered the stock as undervalued, but remained nervous after the recent profits warning. Anglo-Dutch food group Unilever weakened on further press comment on the brands issue and nervousness ahead of its results on Friday. The shares dropped 11 to 951p. The prospect of further domestic interest rate reductions drove the housebuilders sharply higher. Wilson Bowden was the market's favourite, closing 12 up at 431p, closely followed by Persimmon, 6 higher at 275p and Berkeley, 4 firmer at 419p. Turnover in British Land rose to 3m as a block of 1m was placed at 356p. The shares were unchanged at 358p. In a strong property sector, Slough Estates gained 5 to 230p.</p>

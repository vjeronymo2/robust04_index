After the meeting, the U.S. ambassador expressed his belief  that there will be an opportunity for a truce in Lebanon. He  said: What is certain is that the only road to peace in the  region is through negotiations. He added that the United  States, as well as the Lebanese Government and all other  governments, wants to see a peaceful solution in Lebanon.    Ambassador Hambley said the U.S. military delegation and the  prime minister discussed a cooperation program between Lebanon  and the United States that began a year and a half ago and that  the discussion dealt with some future moves. This visit, he  remarked, is the first in a series of visits scheduled for the  delegation.    Asked about the likely role of the delegation in the south,  Hambley said: We have no details on this matter. No doubt the  Lebanese Armed Forces will play a very important role in south  Lebanon. We want to help the Lebanese Armed Forces so that they  are fully equipped in the future. He referred to a technical  training program in addition to some equipment the United States  will provide for the Army.</p>

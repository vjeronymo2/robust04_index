			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / People: Sali's Strong man Little more than a year after William Strong arrived in London to head Salomon Brothers' European investment banking business, his empire has doubled in size. The 40-year-old Strong, a former co-head of the firm's New York mergers and acquisitions department, has been put in charge of all investment banking business outside the US. It is a newly created job. In the past different regions have reported to different people and Strong says that the new structure reflects the growing demand of Salomon's global clients for a single point of contact. Salomon is still best known for its trading and market-making skills but Strong's appointment is another sign that the firm is intent on significantly expanding its international investment banking business which takes in capital raising, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and advisory work. Strong, who will continue to be London-based and have a team of around 200 professionals reporting to him, has taken over responsibility for all the firm's international investment banking functions and offices in Asia, Australia, and Canada as well as his old business in Europe. New York-based groups covering Latin America, sovereign governments and development banks will also report to Strong. He in turn will report to Richard Barrett and Leo Higdon in New York who run investment banking worldwide. Strong took charge of Salomon's European investment banking business after Ron Freeman left to head the merchant banking operation of the newly-created European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Since he arrived in London, Strong has set up a worldwide privatisation practice, headed by Francis Maude, the former Treasury minister who lost his seat in the last election, and established a specialist group which advises on infrastructure projects.</p>

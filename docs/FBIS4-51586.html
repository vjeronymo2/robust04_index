			<p>CSO     [Text] Georgetown, 27 Mar--Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri  Anwar Ibrahim urged the private sector to give full support to  the development effort and the advancement of the people in this  country. He said the private sector's support is necessary  because it bears some social responsibility. In fact, the nation  cannot boast of cultural and educational development if it is  not matched by economic growth.    "Approaches to development do not mean economic methods  alone  but include culture and intellectual traditions, such as a  climate of reading, which needs to be supported by the private  sector," he said. He said this tonight in a speech at the start  of a dinner held by the Pulau Public Library Board. Also present  were Pulau Pinang Chief Minister Dr. Koh Tsu Koon and Deputy  Chief Minister Datuk Dr. Ibrahim Said.    Anwar, who is also minister of finance, said full advantage  needs to be taken of economic growth to prove that the  development concept we are following has a unique and distinct  corporate philosophy.    "Conceptual approaches to development in this country are  different, and we need not borrow all the experience of the  private sector in the West in order to create a national  economic system," he said. In that connection, he said, the  people want to see a Malaysia that is successful in keeping the  growth rate at around 8 percent and inflation below 4 percent.  He urged the public and private sectors to compete and  cooperate and to reject an attitude of happiness with the growth  we have already enjoyed, because such an attitude could hinder  development efforts.</p>

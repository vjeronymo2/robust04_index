			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> IRAQI DISASTER REPORTED  </P> <P> Up to 700 people were killed in an explosion last month at a secret defense  establishment near Baghdad, where Iraq is believed to be developing new  missiles, Britain's Independent newspaper reported. Quoting U.S. diplomats and  Middle Eastern sources, the newspaper said the blast occurred Aug. 17, causing  a blaze that firefighting planes took nearly a week to extinguish. The  explosion at the complex near Hillah, 40 miles south of Baghdad, was apparently  loud enough to be heard in the Iraqi capital, the newspaper said. It quoted  U.S. diplomats as saying they had heard from Iraqi sources of a major incident  in which casualties were "in the low hundreds."  </P></p>

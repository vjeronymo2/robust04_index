Is Iran still the same power trying to  export its revolution or has the regime there now shifted to the  phase of defending its own existence, and is that now its sole  preoccupation?    It is clear that the Iran we knew at the time of the war  with  Iraq in the eighties is not the same as the Iran of today, whose  revolution is now entering its 16th year trying to find a new  and more pragmatic path. The daily facts of life, especially  oil prices, dictate above all that there should be a search for  new policies that would negate past policies without announcing  it. For how is one to interpret the fact that in Lebanon,  through its tools there, Iran appears to be most extremist about  Israel but in the Gulf it establishes the best relations with  Qatar, the country which has gone further than other Arab states  in the region in responding to the peace process and whose prime  minister met with the Israeli foreign minister twice, and the  country which had expressed willingness to host one session of  the multilateral negotiations, which would mean the arrival of  an official Israeli delegation in Doha?    Qatar, of course, is free to follow any policy it likes,  particularly as it is a sovereign state that knows its own  interests. It is worth noting that Iran's upstaging stops at  certain limits. Where the upstaging game benefits Tehran in  defending the regime's past slogans and where such slogans are  still alive, Tehran pursues that same policy as in Lebanon, but  where appeasement appears to be desirable, such slogans  disappear, as in the case of Qatar for instance.    It is true that the internal political polarizations  sometimes make it necessary for Iranian politicians to continue  to play that game even though it has proved to be very harmful  to a country such as Lebanon, but it is also true that the  changes taking place in Iran are now apparent to everyone. The  evidence can be seen in the fact that Syria is engaging in the  peace process without any consideration for the Iranian  position. Even some of the Lebanese forces which had more than  good links with Tehran are beginning to try to emphasize that  there is some distance between them and Iranian policies and  that their policies are Lebanese before being Iranian.    What is taking place in Iran is seen as part of the changes  occurring in the region, radical changes that made the sight of  Shim'on Peres and Yasir 'Arafat holding hands look quite  ordinary as if they have been friends for decades. It remains  to say that knowledge of what is going on calls for a minimum  degree of thinking about the new picture emerging in the region  and the willingness to acclimatize with reality and stop  condemning every new element that appears in the picture. Even  Iran is changing.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: PWA challenges Gemini ruling PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, is appealing against last week's Ontario court decision refusing to declare the Gemini computerised reservations system insolvent. PWA had sought the insolvency ruling as part of its survival strategy. American Airlines plans to make a CDollars 246m (USDollars 195m) equity infusion into Canadian, but insists that Canadian switch from Gemini to its own Sabre reservation system. Canadian and rival Air Canada, together with another small US airline, own Gemini. The court found that PWA was trying to get out of the partnership in order to complete its deal with American. PWA denied that the insolvency suit was related to the American link-up, but would not reveal the basis for its appeal. Mr Hollis Harris, chairman of Air Canada, said a merger with Canadian was still the best solution to the problems of the Canadian airline industry. It would create one large Canadian international airline capable of competing globally, he said. If the Canadian-American airlines link were approved by Ottawa, he added, Air Canada would become 'as weak as Canadian is today'. SHL Systemhouse, a fast-growing international computer systems integrator formerly linked with BCE of Canada, will manage Canada Post's data processing and telecommunications operations in a contract worth more than CDollars 500m. Last year, Systemhouse signed a Dollars 550m out-sourcing contract with Mexico's finance ministry. It will expand the Canada Post data processing centre in Ottawa, instal new networks and take over mail tracking and administrative functions.</p>

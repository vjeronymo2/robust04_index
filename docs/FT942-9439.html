			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Observer: Snub or oversight? China has put a further stamp on its impending takeover of the colony, by starting to issue its own bank notes with pretty pictures of Hong Kong. However, the new notes have a glaring defect. The Bank of China's view of Hong Kong does not include a single property belonging to Jardine Matheson. It's a bit like publishing a picture of Blackpool without its tower, given that Jardine properties dominate the Hong Kong skyline. Li Ka-shing, a friend of China, gets a plug through his HIT Terminal building, and Swire, which works with China's CITIC, has fared well. But despite the fact that the Bank of China HQ is next to a raft of Jardine buildings, the pictures ignore them. Jardine is not one of China's favourites. It is shifting its domicile to Bermuda, before the Chinese arrive, and is a big fan of Governor Chris Patten. Do the new bank notes carry a first hint of revenge?</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Cookery: Extracting the right recipe Dental trouble has plagued my household recently. Indeed, my husband has lost three teeth in as many months. The fight to save them was long and valiant. He has endured many waiting rooms in the company of old Country Life magazines, not to mention throbbing, anaesthetised jaws and the constant, chilling sound of drills. My instinct was to nurse him through the crisis with invalid or baby foods. I banned from my menus any potentially perilous nuts, grains and spicy seeds, or crunchy apples and other fresh fruits that might add to the problems. Instead, we re-entered the bland gastronomic world of the nursery. Those who went to public schools are said to retain a fondness for nursery food all their lives. In practice, though, there is a limit to how long adults with educated palates can endure a daily diet of porridge, baked eggs, fish and shepherds' pies, custard, rice pudding, apple snow and bread and butter pudding. The breakthrough came when I realised that easy-to-eat foods need not be so nannyish or insular. More sophisticated and international options deserved consideration. Little tooth fairy treats began to appear at meal-times and the patient perked up. Oeufs soubise replaced scrambled eggs. Instead of steamed cod, there were mousselines or quenelles of salmon, pike or scallops. There was guacamole; steamed meatballs with coriander raita and dahl; and oeufs a la neige with mango instead of baked apple. Particularly pleasing were the de luxe offerings that punctuated the pain-ridden weeks: caviare, foie gras and oysters. Admittedly, though, this was luxury indulgence. So here are a few more modest suggestions. AUBERGINE CAVIARE Teasingly named, this consists of small aubergines pricked and cooked under the grill until the flesh feels very soft under the blackened and blistered skins. Strip off the skins and squeeze some of the juices from the flesh (Dutch-grown aubergines can be wringing wet). Tear the flesh to shreds with forks, or puree it in a food processor or blender, adding a sliver of crushed garlic for every pound of aubergine. Season lightly, beat in a few spoonfuls of olive oil and a good splash of lemon juice, and scatter with chopped flat-leafed parsley or coriander. MUSHROOM CAVIARE This is as dark and rich as aubergine caviare is delicate and light. Soften a small, very finely-chopped onion in plenty of butter until it is meltingly tender. Chop roughly about  3/4 lb flat mushrooms, discarding the stalks, and saute briskly until most of their moisture is driven off. Mix the vegetables, splash them with marsala (or madeira or port) and season well with salt, pepper, toasted and powdered cumin and coriander seed. Add a shake of cayenne. When cool but not cold, process briefly to a grey-flecked mixture that a blind man might mistake for caviare, adding extra butter gradually (at room temperature and diced). When the texture is creamy - I allow one part butter to two or three parts mushroom - check seasoning and pot. POTTED SALMON WITH DILL &amp; LIME Season and wrap a piece of salmon in buttered foil with a sprig of dill and a slice of lime. Bake or steam the fish until just cooked. Unwrap it when cool but not cold. Skin and bone it. Weigh the flesh, then shred it with a pair of forks, working in gradually the juices contained in the wrappings and plenty of cool, melted butter (using a ratio of three parts butter to four parts fish). Season with salt, pepper, very finely-grated zest of lime and chopped fresh dill. Pack into pots and seal with a thin film of clarified butter.</p>

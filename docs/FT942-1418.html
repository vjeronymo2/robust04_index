			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Study urges state funding of all 'off the job' training All 'off the job' vocational training leading to qualifications should be paid for from public funds, a study from the London School of Economics says. Mr Ken Mahew, one of the editors of the study, said yesterday it was difficult to cost the proposal but it could add Pounds 1bn to Pounds 2bn a year to what the government spends on vocational training. The UK is good at graduate training level, the report says, but increasingly bad at lower levels of skill. 'In order to combat unemployment and low pay, the top priority is to lift the skills of the less able workers.' The report says this would not happen adequately through more people staying on in full-time education. It required a system which guaranteed part-time vocational education to everyone who did not stay on full-time. The study also proposes: Anyone employed aged under 19 should be employed as a trainee - with clear obligations on the employer, and appropriate levels of pay. Any company employing workers under 19 should by law ensure they receive at least one day a week off-the-job vocational education. A review of National Vocational Qualifications.

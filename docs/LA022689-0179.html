			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL ABORTIONS AND OTHER CHOICES  </P> <P> I sympathize with the woman (S.L. Davis, Letters, Feb. 19) who shared  information about her ordeal while having an illegal abortion. I agree  wholeheartedly that no woman should be subjected to such pain and suffering.  However, it seems that she had other choices. It appears that she yielded to  the pressures of her husband instead of seeking competent medical advice and,  possibly, having her child adopted, which might have been safer at that point.  </P> <P> My firsthand experience concerns an RH-negative mother who was advised by her  obstetrician not to become pregnant. The woman and her doctor later learned  that she was pregnant. She subsequently had a legal abortion at an advanced  state of pregnancy. Her baby weighed over 2 pounds.  </P> <P> It was a healthy, beautifully formed male child who actually cried and alerted  the hospital laboratory staff. The infant was then placed in an intensive care  unit of the hospital. My colleagues and I were shocked. We cared for this  little infant. Unfortunately, because of the traumatic birth, heroic efforts  failed to keep him alive for more than a month.  </P> <P> As I write this, I am still incensed that this particular abortion took place.  I fear that all too often, abortion privileges have been abused. It is in  observing and touching little victims that one is moved to address concerns  over legalized abortion.  </P> <P> M.

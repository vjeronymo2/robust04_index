			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum , June 15 ( XINHUA ) -- Sudanese President  Umar Hasan al-Bashir today described a U.S. approach toward  Sudan as positive reflecting its growing interest in Sudan.    The president opined that the fact that the U.S. President  Bill Clinton's envoy to Sudan Melissa F. Wells did not raise  issues such as terrorism and human rights during talks with  Sudanese officials here was a step towards better relations  between the two governments.    Bashir, in an address to a regular get-together with  Sudanese  media leaders here, described the U.S. envoys visit as the first  direct dealing between the Sudanese and U.S. Governments.    He welcomed the approach, saying that the U.S. envoy came to  discuss concrete issues of peace (in south Sudan) and relief  measures.    The U.S. presidential envoy, who arrived here on June 11,  concluded a four-day visit to the country.</p>

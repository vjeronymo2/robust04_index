			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Management: Steps to overseas experience Most multinational companies want to give more of their managers international experience. But they are finding it harder, more expensive - and too slow - to do so by the conventional route: sending people to work for several years as expatriates in distant subsidiaries. Companies can resolve the problem by becoming more catholic in the way they 'internationalise' their executives, according to two business academics, Brooklyn Derr and Gary Oddou. One method they suggest is to increase the attractions of service abroad by moving more foreigners for limited periods to the prime seat of corporate power. Another method, which also speeds up the process, is to give middle or senior managers experience of a region by sending them on three- to six-month trips to several locations within it, especially any which have been designated as business unit or divisional head offices. A third more obvious approach, which is evidently growing, is to make membership of international task forces a part of managerial training and development. Philips, the electronics group, has done this for 20 years, say the academics in an article in the latest issue of European Management Journal*. In spite of their awareness of the 'internationalisation' problem, many multinationals - more than half according to one survey - have no strategy for internationalising their managers. Derr and Oddou in their own study of 105 European multinationals found that almost three-quarters believed importing more foreign nationals to corporate HQ was the key to their future internationalisation, while a quarter said the 'import rate' would remain constant. * EMJ Dec 1993.

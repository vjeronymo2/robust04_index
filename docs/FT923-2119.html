			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Grown-up zarzuela - David Murray on Opera North's production of 'The Duenna' ROBERTO Gerhard's comic opera The Duenna was staged for the first time at the beginning of this year, 22 years after his death. The audiences in Madrid and Barcelona were delighted (as was Max Loppert, who wrote about it here); now Opera North has mounted a second production of it, which should enjoy a similar success. Substantial support has come from the European Arts Festival, quite rightly. Gerhard was Catalan-born of Alsatian and Swiss parents, studied composition under both the great Spanish nationalist Pedrell and Arnold Schoenberg, exiled himself to England at the start of the Franco regime, and in 1947 completed his only opera - to a 1775 English text by the playwright Sheridan, author of The Rivals. The Duenna had originally been produced at Covent Garden as an 'opera', ie a prose play with songs in verse. What Gerhard made of it amounted to a 'Zarzuela Grande': a larger, through-composed version of the popular Spanish zarzuela, something between folk-operetta and musical comedy. Gerhard set the original verses as engaging ditties, expanded a number of speeches into serious arias and ensembles, left some minor dialogue to be spoken, and dressed the whole in richly sensuous music, seemingly 'eclectic' - folk-Spanish, candid touches of Falla, Meistersinger-ish meditations, Schoenbergian chromatics, a Ravellian glitter. Precisely because of that compendious eclecticism, the score found no favour when the BBC broadcast it in 1949, nor at a 1951 performance in Germany. But we are wiser now: with post-modernist ears, we can hear a composer's veering between different idioms as no more opportunist or insincere than following an Allegro in G with an Adagio in E-flat. Furthermore, as we know now, in the late works that were to establish Gerhard's international reputation - the Concerto for orchestra, and the dazzling ensemble-pieces Libra and Leo - all those strands would be woven into a unique, utterly personal vocabulary. In The Duenna, they were just a bit more separated. The Schoenbergian passages lend emotional depth to Sheridan's comedy of elopements and disguises; the open-hearted show-numbers vie with the best Bernstein; the dancing Spanishry is instantly infectious. Antoni Ros-Marba, who conducted the Spanish premiere, draws the best from the Opera North band here. An eager, mostly young cast put their music across to excellent effect, though only a couple of them can speak Sheridan's sophisticated words in convincing style. As a fully rounded character, Andrew Shore's Don Jerome, the heavy father, is head and shoulders above the rest (as is his wont); but the baritone Adrian Clarke makes Don Ferdinand a colourable Regency blade, and the two flighty heroines are fervently sung by Pamela Helen Stephen and Susan Chilcott. As lovelorn Don Antonio the tenor Gordon Wilson looked a dull stick (even in the first scene, a straight lift from Barbier de Seville) but warmed steadily to his musical role. Gillian Knight lent her seasoned wiles to the scheming Duenna, like Eric Roberts as the risible Portuguese Jew. A hint of Political Incorrectness there] - the production tried to pretend that being Portuguese was worse than being Jewish, but some discomfort remained. With spectacular help from Sue Blane's unbridledly fanciful designs, and the more equivocal asset of a troupe of dancing mimes, the show wears a bright face. One could still wish that the director Helena Kaut-Howson had found more gestural detail for her principals: in the orchestral interstices of their numbers they often looked stranded and blank, reminding us too plainly that period-comedy needs professional actors. Still, those numb moments were only flecks on the action; Gerhard's effervescent score was more than enough to carry the evening.

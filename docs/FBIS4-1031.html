			<p>BFN     [Text] The national media spokesman for the Afrikaner  Volksfront [National Front -- AVF), Mr. Koos Kemp, has denied  allegations that soldiers from the AVF are undergoing training  in northern Swaziland. Earlier a tribal chief said he had  handed information about the alleged training to the Swazi  defense force. Mr. Kemp also denied having any knowledge of a  huge meeting allegedly held by the AVF in the Lubodlwana region  of Swaziland last week.    The leader of the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement], Mr.  Eugene Terreblanche, has also denied knowledge of right-wing  troops being trained in Swaziland. He was not prepared to  comment on whether the AWB was involved in the training of any  other groups. However, he did confirm that training of his own  commandos had been stepped up.</p>

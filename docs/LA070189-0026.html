			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAUER'S REMARKS  </P> <P> Steven Bauer, an actor of Cuban origin, is suddenly an expert on  Mexican-American relations. In Bart Mills' June 19 article, " 'Desperados'  Relives the Brutal Murder of a U.S. Drug Agent," Bauer stated that the Mexican  people "don't like us; they really don't." Also that Mexicans want to make our  country "look stupid, which is what Mexicans live for."  </P> <P> Funny, but I get different vibes. On the whole the Mexican people admire and  respect our political system and our immense wealth and power. Many certainly  want to live here! When they compare their corrupt government, ballot box fraud  and other social ills with mainstream America, we come out smelling like a  rose.  </P> <P> JOHN F.

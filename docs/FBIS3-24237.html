			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Petrovich Barkashov, leader of </F> Russian National Unity, by Sergey Turchenko; place and date not  given: "A Meeting With Aleksandr Barkashov--the Bricked Up  Knight's Sword"]    [Text] He was released from "Sailor's Rest" at 1815  on 26 February. Despite a serious bullet wound to the thigh, he  came out of the prison by himself, adroitly supporting himself  on crutches that have already become habitual.    Supporters had been waiting at the gate since 0900. A  Russian National Unity honor guard company in full dress uniform  was in formation. It greeted its leader with the thrice-repeated  yell: "Glory to Russia!" Barkashov embraced each one of them and  departed for home, where he has not been since 20 September 1993.    The building in which Aleksandr Petrovich lives had two  exits as recently as five months ago. One to the courtyard, the  other to Leninskiy Prospekt. When in October of last year the  sleuths of "democratic" detection were hunting for the leader of  Russian National Unity, the second exit was walled up with brick  masonry so they would not have to maintain two posts of  "operatives" here simultaneously. This wall has remained as a  modest monument to victorious "democracy."    We met with Aleksandr Petrovich several days after his  release at his apartment, which was left in a more than frugal  condition. It had neither rugs nor expensive furniture. On the  wall, next to Orthodox icons, was an ancient Russian knight's  sword as the symbol of a fighting faith. Wounded, wasted by  prison, Barkashov appeared the inflexible monk of this  courageous religion to which Russia is doomed.    After congratulating Aleksandr Petrovich on his release, I  asked him how he felt about the amnesty.    [Barkashov] I think it is a compromise step on the part of  those forces that did not want the investigative activities with  respect to the "October prisoners" to reach the court, because  this would reveal the true culprits of the mass murders in  October of last year. Other forces were able through the act of  amnesty to resolve their own concerns, for example, to release  the criminals, because those forces do not have another social  base. As for me personally, I interpreted the amnesty in a  positive way, since I know that in our country an investigation  can drag on for years and not come to anything. But sitting in  prison is not for me, I have to be active. In addition, I  understand that this was an act that the authorities were forced  into, and not some kind of sop. The public conscience had  reached a level that the authorities could not risk holding us  under guard anymore. What is more, I do not feel any kind of  guilt for myself. On the contrary, the Procuracy committed such  a string of violations in my arrest that I do not know how it  would extricate itself were it not for the amnesty.    [Turchenko] Our newspaper informed the readers about this in  detail. But we have hardly written about the activities of  Barkashov supporters in September-October of 1993.    [Barkashov] As early as spring, when an attempt was made to  introduce OPUS [special procedure for governing the country], we  announced that if the president decided to dissolve parliament  and usurp power, we were ready with all available resources to  oppose this. After the publication of Edict No. 1400, a subunit  consisting of 300 persons arrived at the House of Soviets in an  organized way. For the first two days, it was on the street.  Afterwards, we settled ourselves in the reception room of the  Supreme Soviet. Soon, information began to arrive that forceful  actions were being planned against the leaders of the Supreme  Soviet, and even that an assault on the building was being  prepared. The need arose to reinforce the security of higher  state officials and the internal premises of the House of  Soviets. We were asked to take part in this, and we were  assigned specific places to guard, in particular, the Ministry  of Defense, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], the MB  [Ministry of Security], and various vital life-support centers  where, through underground communications, it was possible to  get through to the inside of buildings. Our people guarded  Khasbulatov and Rutskoy at their request.    On 2 October we heard growing noise, and even shooting, from  the Smolensk Square side. I sent my scouts to find out what was  happening there. They went and returned through underground  communications. They reported that the OMON [special purpose  militia detachment] had provoked a clash and that people had  been killed and wounded. That was the first time that weapons  were employed against unarmed people. We have documentary  pictures from which it can be seen how individual OMON members  were firing from pistols at a short distance into the crowd. For  some reason I did not see a word about this in the press. In  addition, we also discovered that some foreign inspectors who  were working under the Red Cross service for some reason were  directing the activities of the OMON members, special purpose  elements, and the militia. People were sitting in vehicles with  foreign infantry weapons, and they were speaking in English. It  became clear that a tragedy was developing under foreign  leadership.    [Turchenko] Do you have documentary evidence of this?    [Barkashov] Yes, sir. When the time comes, I will publish  it.    [Turchenko] But, in your opinion, did the other events of 3  October not appear to be a tragic play acted out by foreign  intelligence services in order to eliminate the most active  patriotically inclined citizens?    [Barkashov] I am convinced that 3 October was a real  people's  uprising. Almost half a million insurgents. The age group:  youths from 16 to 25 and older men from 35 to 55, mainly workers  and the technical intelligentsia. Plus a lot of women. Despite  the clubs and tear gas, they breached several OMON barricades  and in an absolutely sincere outburst broke through toward the  House of Soviets.    [Turchenko] I absolutely agree, as a people's uprising the  October display was spontaneous, if, of course, the fact that  for a whole week prior to this people were provoked to uprising  by unjustified harsh beatings is ignored. But does it not seem  strange to you that it was exactly on 3 October that the militia  and the OMON left the House of Soviets?    [Barkashov] You know, they did not leave. They scattered.  The  Dzerzhinskiy division, after receiving information about such a  mass of people, quickly pulled out and departed in panic to its  permanent station. Special purpose and OMON subunits also  scattered in panic. Commanders abandoned their subordinates. We  brought to the House of Soviets two companies of soldiers of the  Internal Troops whose commanders had abandoned them. Later, two  companies from Sofrino simply announced the desire to switch to  the side of the insurgents. Only those who established  themselves in the mayor's office fired on citizens. For some  reason, nothing is being written about this, but I personally  saw how people were wounded and killed by this fire. When in an  outburst of indignation the crowd desperately hurled itself at  the mayor's office, the firing became more intense. In order not  to permit unnecessary bloodshed, seven of my companions, plus  four fellows from the Union of Officers, rushed over there. All  it took was several warning bursts for the mayor's office to  quiet down. Then we led the half-drunk defenders of "democracy"  away.    [Turchenko] But why was it necessary go after Ostankino?    [Barkashov] The leadership of the Supreme Soviet in those  days undoubtedly displayed high courage. But in addition to  courage, an ability to organize the popular masses was also  needed.    [Turchenko] In your opinion, to organize what?    [Barkashov] This does not at all mean to shoot, to assault.  It was enough with organized groups to take control of Moscow's  main facilities. The march on Ostankino was a purely emotional  outbreak: "The empire, they said, lies, a nest of evil..." I  agree. But in such situations it is necessary to be guided not  by emotions, but by sober calculation. If we need the television  airwaves in order to tell people the truth about the events in  Moscow, send a group of workers to Shabolovka, which was  practically unguarded. And go on the air. There were many  organizational miscalculations. As a result, the authorities  gained time and the opportunity to organize the shelling of the  House of Soviets. All that time our subunit was performing the  duties entrusted to it, and was prepared to stand to the end.  But when the leadership made the decision about going out, it  made no sense to remain in the House of Soviets. On the evening  of 4 October we surrendered our weapons in an organized way, and  I ordered the boys to go out. I myself remained with Achalov  when he was arrested, and demanded that I be taken together with  him. However, an officer of the Ministry of Security answered  that he had no instructions concerning me, and he advised that I  leave with the "Alpha." I want to express my great gratitude to  the officers of this subunit. Had it not been for them, there  would have been far more victims. In any case, when "Alpha"  turned the group with which I came out over to the OMON people,  they took us in the direction of the stadium where, as we  already knew, massive executions were being conducted. However,  when officers of "Alpha" noticed this they raised their assault  rifles and said firmly: Release these people. We were  released... Unfortunately, not all of our boys remained alive.  On 4 October, Dmitriy Marchenko, the editor of the letters  department of our newspaper RUSSKIY PORYADOK, was wounded in the  leg. He was taken to Sklifosovskiy. But relatives were soon  informed that he was dead. When they came for him, they saw  traces of brutal torture on his body. His nose and ears were  torn off, the tendons in his legs were cut, and the back of his  head was shot through. The body of Guards Major Anatoliy Surskiy  was also found with traces of ritual torture.    [Turchenko] What did you do after you left the House of  Soviets?    [Barkashov] We received information from our own people in  the MVD that there was a directive to arrest a group of  activists from Russian National Unity and, in addition, the  chiefs would have no objection if anyone was shot while  resisting arrest. It became necessary to shift to an illegal  situation.    [Turchenko] How did the October events affect Russian  National Unity, did they not disorganize the movement?    [Barkashov] On the contrary, the fighting men became  stronger  in spirit. We saw a large influx of new people into the  organization. Many youths. Workers of many of the Moscow plants  sympathize with our views, and the first Russian National Unity  cells have been established there.    [Turchenko] Would you be able to name at least the  approximate numerical strength of your organization?    [Barkashov] The fact is that our membership is three-staged.  The first stage is the most numerous--these are sympathizers.  Those who are most active and who have shown their worth move to  the second stage--fellow-fighters. They go through special  training in our, so to say, training institutions, they perform  one-time or permanent assignments. Achieving a certain level, a  fellow-fighter can become a companion-in-arms. This is a direct  member of our organization with pertinent rights and  disciplinary duties. I will not name the figure for all of  Russia. But in Moscow we have about 1,500 companions-in-arms and  more than 10,000 fellow-fighters, and there are several times  more sympathizers.    [Turchenko] What is the system of training in Russian  National Unity?    [Barkashov] We place the main emphasis on political and  ideological training, to put it more exactly, on world outlook.  Our main weapon is propaganda and agitation. Further, there is  tactics, firing training, and hand-to-hand combat.    [Turchenko] What does ideological training mean? Could you  briefly formulate its basis?    [Barkashov] It is very difficult to do so briefly. Its  essence is awakening the national self-consciousness of the  Russian people. Because as our statehood was built around the  Russian people, so it will be revived around a Russian nucleus.  The main thing is that it is necessary to show the whole truth  to the people to the end. So that they may see not in words but  with their own eyes that they are on the brink of extinction,  and so that the instinct of self-preservation be turned on. It  is necessary to point out their main enemy. And one exists, for  a struggle between good and evil is going on in the world.    [Turchenko] What capabilities do you have to report this  truth?    [Barkashov] First, a press organ--the newspaper RUSSKIY  PORYADOK. The circulation is quite high--400,000. But it is also  necessary to consider that its dissemination is targeted--only  to the social environment that is of interest to us. In the  present period, this is most of all workers and servicemen.    [Turchenko] What is the base in the military environment?    [Barkashov] There are companions-in-arms even in the senior  generals milieu. There are fellow-fighters. The main mass is  sympathizers. It is technically very difficult to establish  primary Russian National Unity cells in the army, for the eyes  and ears of the special department are everywhere.    [Turchenko] How do you work in the units?    [Barkashov] We arrive at the main gate checkpoint in the  evening and disseminate newspapers in which there is always a  contact telephone. Then you begin to get calls from the military  unit, and later people walk in. And it is here that individual  work with them starts. People receive individual instructions,  they join our studies system, etc.    [Turchenko] But are people not repelled by the fact that the  symbolism of your movement has an emblem that is reminiscent of  the swastika, which gives some journalists a reason to accuse  Russian National Unity of fascism?    [Barkashov] This is a democratic label. Our sign is the  eight-pointed Star of Our Lady, who from days of old was  respected in Rus. You will also find it on ancient icons and in  the ornamental embroidery of Russian national costumes. We have  explained all of this, with documents, more than once in our  newspaper. When people read it, all questions are removed.    [Turchenko] But why is this sign not seen in today's  Orthodox  Church?    [Barkashov] Today's Orthodox Church promised to anathematize  those who were the first to spill blood in October 1993. Instead  of this, I see on television how priests kiss the organizers of  murder. But God is their judge. As for the Star of Our Lady, its  description is in all canonical literature and in icon  paintings. All of this was gradually etched out of our memories,  probably because previously the common people called this  ancient sign a zhidobor [amulet to protect against Jews].    [Turchenko] Fine, let us drop this subject. Tell us, how did  you arrive at your present views?    [Barkashov] I am from a working family. My father worked all  of his life in a TETs [thermal electric power center]. Mama was  a nurse. I also worked at the same TETs for a long time as an  electrician. As far as I can recall, I was always interested in  books on Russian history. After 1985 I joined the Pamyat  movement. I sensed in 1990 that it had become outdated. There  was a need for a stronger and more united organization. Together  with like-minded people, I left Pamyat and established Russian  National Unity. My world outlook is from Russian historical  science and knowledge of the attitudes of the working  individual. But it was the development of the situation in the  country itself that mobilized me to political activity.    [Turchenko] Of the parties that exist now, which do you  cooperate with and which do you like most?    [Barkashov] We have a very strict ideology. It is difficult  for us to find common language with those who paper over the  cracks first and then join political games. We call things by  their real names. Therefore, it is difficult to accept something  like compromising alliances. But we are always ready to support  tactically any political force that comes out for national  interests. So the Supreme Soviet made a clear-cut statement  about betrayal of national interests, and it said that it will  defend them, and we immediately came to its assistance.    [Turchenko] What is your prediction for the near-term  development of the situation in the country?    [Barkashov) Fundamental changes will occur this year. And if  they are sufficiently fundamental (that is, if an uncompromising  national policy is implemented), then within three years the  people will be able to eliminate the consequences of the mess  the reformers have created.    [Turchenko] But do you see such forces?    [Barkashov) I see the psychological condition of society,  because I am not separated from it like Yeltsin, or as  Khasbulatov was separated from it. Authority must resonate with  the condition of society. If this does not exist, authority  declines. Therefore, that is why changes have occurred: There is  talk of accord, and the Russian question and changes in foreign  policy are being stirred up. This, of course, is not out of  goodwill. The present leadership simply understands that in its  previous capacity it is becoming absolutely unacceptable to an  overwhelming majority of the people. It will be forced to bring  ever newer figures onto its staff until there is conformity  between the will of the people and policy.    [Turchenko] The forecast is more than optimistic. Many  thanks.</p>

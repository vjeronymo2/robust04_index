			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Law Lords seek help on maternity leave case - Legal Briefs THE LAW Lords have asked the European Court of Justice for help in resolving the difficult question of whether an employer is guilty of sex discrimination in dismissing a female employee who becomes pregnant shortly after being hired to cover for another employee taking maternity leave. The Law Lords said last week there was no doubt that in general it was unlawful direct discrimination to dismiss a woman because she was pregnant. But in the present case the critical factor was that the employee would not be available for work at the time when the job for which she was specifically recruited was to be performed. A final decision in the case of Webb v EMO Air Cargo (UK) was suspended pending a ruling by the European Court as to whether the issue had been affected by recent European Court rulings on the interpretation of the 1976 EC sex discrimination directive.</p>

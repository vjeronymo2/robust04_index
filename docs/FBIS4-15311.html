			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS-KAZTAG] </F>   [Text] Tokyo 7 April, TASS -- The Japanese Government will  soon beging insuring businesses conducting foreign economic  transactions with Kazakhstan, Japanese Minister of Foreign Trade  and Industry Hiroshi Kumagai said.    The announcement was made during Kumagai's meeting with  visiting Kazakh Vice-Prime Minister Syzdyk Abishev who is  accompanying Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev on his  official visit to Japan.    The Japanese-Kazakh project to modernise the metallurgic  plant in Karaganda will be the first to be insured by Japan.  There are also plans to extend state insurance to a new oil  pipeline to be built in Kazakhstan. However, this will become  possible only if the Kazakh government provides firm guarantees  of credit payments to Japanese companies.    Abishev called on Japan to double investments in the Kazakh  economy, adding that the Republic has only three joint ventures  with the participation of Japanese capital. Kumagai expressed  the hope that Japanese companies will boost investments in  Kazakhstan if it creates favourable conditions for foreign  investors.</p>

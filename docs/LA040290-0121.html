			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MARGAUX BARES ALL TO GET HOLLYWOOD'S ATTENTION  </P> <P> Life in the fast lane destroyed Margaux Hemingway's film career just as it was  getting under way a decade ago, but now, at 35, the granddaughter of the late,  great author says she is ready to come back.  </P> <P> And the best way to get Hollywood's attention, she figured, was to pose nude.  </P> <P> The model-actress is featured in Playboy's current edition. If nothing else,  she proved she is in great shape.  </P> <P> She insists that everything else is in order too, claiming victory in her  battle against alcohol and cocaine dependencies.  </P> <P> Hemingway was a giddy 19-year-old when she burst on the national scene as an  ingenue in "Lipstick." The movie was terrible, but she captured the country's  imagination.  </P> <P> A fresh-faced, outdoor girl from Ketchum, Ida., Hemingway was a delightfully  candid, naive newcomer whose love of life catapulted her into celebrity. She  adorned the cover of Time magazine.  </P> <P> After all, this was Ernest Hemingway's granddaughter.  </P> <P> She signed a $1-million contract to promote a perfume and toured the world. She  made movies -- "Killer Fish," "A Fistful of Chopsticks" and "Over the Brooklyn  Bridge" -- none of which was very good.  </P> <P> She was married and divorced twice, moving her home from New York to Venezuela  to Paris and leading a fast-paced life that was going nowhere.  </P> <P> Her second marriage -- to Venezuelan documentary film producer Bernard Foucher  -- finally hit the rocks, and Hemingway all but disappeared.  </P> <P> About 2 1/2 years ago she spent a month in the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho  Mirage, Calif., and has been sober since. She also lost 75 pounds.  </P> <P> Last year she completed a movie in Paris, "Love in C Minor," and hopes it will  lead to a revived acting career in Hollywood, where she lives.  </P> <P> "I'm single and in charge of my own life for the first time," she said. "It's a  marvelous feeling."  </P></p>

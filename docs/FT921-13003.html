			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Greenalls enfranchises shares amid rights issue speculation GREENALLS, the UK pubs and hotels group, is to abolish the two-tier share structure that has enabled the Greenall family to maintain control of the company. Enfranchisement of the group's shares will complete its transformation from a 230-year-old family-owned regional brewer into a national retailer. The move roused speculation yesterday that it was the prelude to a rights issue to fund a large acquisition, either of pubs or hotels, and sparked a stock exchange scrutiny of share dealings prior to the announcement. Under the enfranchisement proposals, 'A' shareholders, who have had superior voting rights, will get one ordinary share for every two 'A' shares. The price of the 'A' shares, which had been unchanged at 153p since December 3, rose sharply on Tuesday to 171p, a gain of 18 per cent. They rose again yesterday to 207p before closing at 199p, a gain of 28p. Mr Andrew Thomas, managing director, denied there were any plans for a rights issue or any immediate acquisition. But he added: 'It is important that the company has maximum flexibility in terms of access to financial markets in order to respond rapidly to opportunities for investing in existing business areas as they arise.' Changing the share structure would help provide that flexibility by increasing the number of institutional investors and improving the marketability of the shares. Mr Thomas, 49, who is to become chairman and chief executive in September, conceded the changes could make the group more vulnerable to a bid, but they would help expansion. The group would like to add at least another 100 pubs to its estate of 1,400; and to increase its 105 catering inns and budget hotels by about 50 per cent. It has ambitions to add to its De Vere hotel chain, particularly in London; and it aims to establish a substantial presence in the off-licence business. The changes in the share structure will reduce the voting rights of the Greenall family interests from 53 per cent to 17 per cent. The family, which comprises Lord Daresbury, his four children and 11 grandchildren, will get Pounds 24.7m from the placing by Cazenove of 6.5m shares with institutions at 380p a share, leaving them with a holding of 24m shares. The ordinary shares rose 1p yesterday to close at at 398p. Observer, Page 18; Lex, Page 20</p>

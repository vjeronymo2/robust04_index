			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Palestinian negotiators released ISRAELI police yesterday detained, questioned and then released 17 members of the Palestinian Middle East talks negotiating team who broke Israeli law by holding a public meeting in Jordan with Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, reports Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem. The Palestinian negotiators from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, led by Mr Faisal Husseini, met Mr Arafat a few days before the Israeli election in an attempt to embarrass Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the outgoing prime minister, and his Likud party. The episode has highlighted the tenuous nature of Israel's claim to have kept the PLO out of the negotiations and is awkward for Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Labour party leader and prime minister-elect. Labour policy is to repeal the controversial laws which forbid contact with the PLO, but Mr Rabin wants to avoid a de facto endorsement of negotiations with it, especially during delicate negotiations on a Labour-led coalition.</p>

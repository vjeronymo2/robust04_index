			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / FO offers diplomatic plodders a path to the top DIPLOMATIC plodders may finally get the grand embassies and knighthoods which have tended to be the exclusive preserve of public school and Oxbridge-educated high flyers. The Foreign Office - the most traditional of Whitehall departments - is planning an assault on the Victorian class divisions that permeate the entire civil service. The institution that inspired countless Carlton-Brownes has decided 'in principle' to abolish its fast stream, which is enshrined in the elitism of the Diplomatic Service. This could be one of the most egalitarian reforms since 1854, when patronage was replaced by competitive exams 'for the supply of the public service with a thoroughly efficient class of men'. In the mid-nineteenth century, Lord Clarendon only selected candidates known to him personally. The Foreign Office's decision will eventually end the segregation between 'officers' and 'other ranks' and could help its drive to broaden its intake beyond Oxbridge and the public schools. In the fast-stream system, high flyers expected to sail effortlessly to the levels of senior ambassador or deputy under-secretary are handpicked by the Civil Service Commission and enter the service at Grade 8 or 7d. Fewer than 1 per cent of those who apply to be fast streamers by ticking a box on the application forms are chosen, having survived country-house weekends during which table manners and choice of newspaper are noted as keenly as grasp of foreign affairs. Progress up the ladder to a prestigious embassy posting then becomes almost automatic. Fast-stream officers can expect a posting abroad soon after entering the service, and a succession of interesting economic, commercial, and political jobs both at home and in the field. Sir John Weston, tipped become the next head of the Diplomatic Service, is a good example. Head boy at Sherborne, a First at Oxford, top of his year in the civil service entrance exams, he has risen to become the UK permanent representative to Nato in Brussels after postings in Paris and Washington. A diplomatic plodder would have entered the executive class at Grade 9 before gaining a consular job. Slow-streamers do not expect to progress beyond Grade 5, the first secretary level that high flyers reach in their early thirties. Though fast and slow stream officers are already within the same administrative group, only a couple of officers a year manage to 'bridge' into the fast stream by passing through the final selection board. Clerical staff enter at Grade 10 and rarely leave registry - the secretarial office of a department. The Foreign Office would not confirm its decision. But one ex-civil servant said he did not think the change would herald a more egalitarian era. 'The Foreign Office is like a concertina,' he said. 'It may go in and out but it will always make the same noise.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that the  antiterrorism fight launched by the government is moving toward  its conclusion step-by-step, with the support of the people.    Addressing True Path Party deputies, Ciller pointed out that  significant success was achieved in this respect during the past  few weeks. She said: Compare the nine years from 1984 to 1994  with the period of the 50th government and you will see that the  total number of terrorists caught or killed during the two  periods is equal. Our government is continuing to wage a  decisive and determined struggle to get this issue to the bottom  of our agenda. We will fulfill our claim. We will not be  embarrassed. We started off on this matter saying we will end  it, and we are determined to bring it to a conclusion.    The prime minister stressed that the security forces, which  carried out their duties with loyalty, self-sacrifice, and in a  patriotic manner, played a major role in this success. She  extended her gratitude to the security forces.    In her speech, Prime Minister Ciller pointed out that the  talks held with the United Nations in connection with the  Turkish unit that will serve in Bosnia-Herzegovina have ended.  The Turkish unit will arrive there in the second half of June,  she said, adding that this is the first time in the history of  the republic that such a thing is happening. Ciller said: It  is the first time that a Turkish unit is being sent to Europe.  I cannot think of anything more natural, because the struggle  in our country against terrorism and against illegal aggression  is being waged everywhere without religious or racial  discrimination. There were Turkish troops in Korea and in  Somalia. Turkish politics opposed aggression during the last  crisis in Iraq. Moreover, our country has always opposed  aggression in Azerbaijan and everywhere else, without  discrimination. As a result, nothing could be more natural than  for a Turkish unit to take part in such a struggle in Europe.    Ciller said that most of the equipment needed for  reinforcement of the Turkish unit and not found in the inventory  of the Turkish Armed Forces is being acquired from public  organizations, institutions, and through supplementary funds.    The prime minister stressed that by moving their heavy  weapons to the outskirts of the city of Brcko and by effecting a  military buildup to widen the (Kosovino) corridor, the Serbs are  creating a new crisis in the region. She stated that the United  Nations and NATO must urgently pass resolutions granting this  region the status of a region purged of heavy weapons. This is  essential, she said, to demonstrate once again the international  community's determination against aggression and to deter the  Serbs.</p>

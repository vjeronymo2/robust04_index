			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Arts: Tennstedt's Debussy Klaus Tennstedt, a conductor of naked artistic integrity and emotional intensity, is that rare beast, the genuinely inspired interpreter of the great Austro-German symphonic masterpieces. His Royal Festival Hall ventures into other repertories and musical languages have been scarcer, and less imbued with the fiery authority that marks, say, his Beethoven, Bruckner or Mahler with the London Philharmonic. I recall, for instance, a heartfelt LPO Verdi Requiem that sounded - felt - entirely unidiomatic; and on Sunday at the Festival Hall, the same could be said of his encounters with Debussy. The LPO gave us the Three Nocturnes in the first half and L'Apres-midi d'un faune in the second (followed by a Stravinsky Firebird Suite brash but full of life). The lack of Debussyan detachment and distance was comprehensive. The phrases of 'Nuages' were lustrous but deprived of internal ventilation; 'Fetes', with an unhappy slowing of its central procession, was noisy, lurchingly imprecise; and 'Sirenes', with an uncomfortably spotlit and often ill-tuned contingent of LPO Choir sopranos, meandered. Tennstedt seemed unable to gain imaginative entrance into the Debussy sound-world; in L'Apres-midi, linear distinctness was continually sacrificed to an alien languorous warmth. Because these were rawly honest performances, 'personal' and unvarnished, searchingly undertaken and unstintingly delivered, their very wrong-headedness proved fascinating. It was altogether a peculiar concert. As the latest in the orchestra's current series of loose tributes to Diaghilev, it began with Shura Cherkassky playing Schumann's Carnaval: after a rocky start, he made the piano speak and sing with so much echt-Cherkasskian feline wit, idiosyncratic delicacy and impish brilliance that it felt a cruel deprivation not to be spending the rest of the evening in his company.                       *      *      * In the same hall the following evening, the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Andrew Davis gave excellent support to a Schumann pianist of a very different kind. This was Imogen Cooper, whose account of the Piano Concerto was wonderfully full of gentle, inward-turned imaginative perceptions. Miss Cooper caught the 'domestic' side of the invention with unfailing aptness, penetrated its poetic nooks and crannies with quiet eloquence. I have not heard this pianist for a few years; in that time she appears to have blossomed as an artist. Earlier, Davis and his orchestra had poured their plentiful supplies of energy and enthusiasm into the first performance of Philip Grange's Focus and Fade. This 20-minute orchestral fantasy in three linked movements displays an easy command of large forces, evident care in the linking and cross-referencing of ideas, and a disheartening shortage of identifying, clinching personality. Grange, who came to prominence at the start of the 1980s with a number of striking compositions for small forces, seemed here the retailer of just another anonymous 'modern orchestral showpiece'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- The ruling coalition is  poised to decide next Monday [17 January] to call a January 19  vote on the government's political reform bills in the House of  Councillors' special committee on political reform, coalition  sources said.    Ruling and opposition parties of the upper house committee  failed Friday to agree on a timetable for voting on the  government's political reform package, which cleared the House  of Representatives last November.    Senior members of the upper house committee from both ruling  coalition and opposition parties will meet again Monday to  discuss the schedule after a public hearing on the political  reform process is held that day in Tokyo, officials said.    Ruling parties threatened Friday to table a motion calling  for a committee vote on the political reform bills on January  19, as the January 29 scheduled close of the current  extraordinary Diet session is drawing near.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who failed to legislate  political reform bills by the end of last year as he pledged  last August, has vowed to enact them during the parliamentary  extension, staking his position on the renewed pledge.    The ruling coalition postponed the closure of the 90-day  Diet  session for 45 days beyond December 15 in order to achieve  Hosokawa's target.    In Friday's steering committee wrangling, the coalition for  the time being retracted the threat of forcing a vote when  agreement was reached to hold public hearings in five cities  outside Tokyo on Tuesday, in addition to Monday's hearing in the  capital.    Public hearings are a prerequisite to putting the bills to a  floor vote in an upper house plenary session. In the hearings,  knowledgeable persons recommended by the ruling and opposition  parties, respectively, express their views on the bills.    After Monday's public hearing in Tokyo, the coalition will  urge the opposition camp to agree to conclude deliberations on  the bills on Wednesday.    If the opposition refuses to accept the proposal, committee  chief Yubun Ueno will decide on the schedule, exercising his  prerogative as chairman, coalition sources said.    In such a case, the opposition is expected to table a  noconfidence motion against Ueno.    The government's political reform bills are designed to  replace the current multi-seat constituencies for the more  powerful lower house with a combination of single-seat districts  and proportional representation, as well as to tighten curbs on  political fund-raising activities in a bid to stem repeated  corruption.    The existing electoral system is believed to be a major  cause  of lavish campaign spending because of competition among  candidates of the same party in single districts, while the  current Political Funds Control Law is seen as having loopholes  that make it possible for politicians to escape punishment for  wrongdoing.    In the 252-seat upper house, the ruling coalition has 131  seats, while the Liberal Democratic Party holds 99, the Japanese  Communist Party (JCP) 11, the Niin Club five, and independents  five.    Several upper house members of the Social Democratic Party  [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest bloc in the alliance, have  expressed opposition to the bills and could vote against them or  abstain, greatly weakening the coalition's chances of passing  the bills in the upper house.</p>

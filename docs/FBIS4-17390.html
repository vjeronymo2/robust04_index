			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Knyazkov: "Who Enjoys Serving in Kyrgyz </F> Army? Russian Officers Turn to Askar Akayev for Help"]    [Text] In the wake of the "privatization" of former Soviet  Army units, some 8,000 Russians ended up in the Army of Kirgizia  [Kyrgyzstan] (around 90 percent of its officer corps). The  sovereign Republic was interested in having the Russians help  put together a national army.    Protocols defining service regulations for the Russian  personnel in the army of Kirgizia were initialed in Bishkek on 4  March. Under the first protocol, effective until 31 December  1999, Russian nationals -- officers, warrant officers,  servicemen -- in the Kirgiz Army are entitled to all benefits  due servicemen of the Russian Army. Kirgizia's Defense Ministry  undertook to buy for a retiring Russian officer or warrant  officer housing in any town (with the exception of Moscow and  St. Petersburg, and not to ask Russians to take another oath of  loyalty.    Under the second protocol, officers and warrant officers of  the Russian Army are permitted, before 31 December 1994, to  serve in the Army of Kirgizia upon signing the corresponding  contract while their citizenship and benefits remain the same.    But, as they say, everything was fine only on paper. A  little more than one month after the signing of the protocols in  Bishkek, the public learned of instances where Russians were  being ousted from the Kirgiz Army.    Russian officers in the Osh garrison in southern Kirgizia's  have sent an open letter to Republic President Askar Akayev. In  it they write that "behind the back and despite the will of  Republic Defense Minister Myrzakan Subanov, organs of the  military prosecutor's office have begun lately to oust  Russian-speaking commanders from the Army."    "The military justice organs that have occupied themselves  with tracking down pilferers of military and state property  among the officers," continues the letter -- published,  incidentally, in the newspaper SLOVO KYRGYZSTANA [Kyrgyzstan's  Word], "think, in our view, that since we have not yet left for  our own country, this signifies that we have some side motives  that are holding us back. But this is utter nonsense. We are  still here only because we are true to the oath of loyalty we  took some time in the past."    The letter of the Osh garrison officers is signed by 100  persons. This attests to disturbing symptoms. What will the  reply to it from the military prosecutor, Kurbat Kozhonaliyev,  to whom the Russian officers' main charges are addressed?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "An Agreement That Bestows  Legitimacy on Occupation," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: Yasir  'Arafat signed a new agreement with Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday as  an extension of the Oslo agreement that was secretly negotiated  outside the Washington peace talks and without the participation  of most Palestinian leaders in and outside of the PLO. We do  not know how many subsequent agreements will be signed and  presented to the people.    AL-BA'TH adds: Anyone who saw the huge notebooks signed by  'Arafat and compared their size to their miserable contents will  say: What revolution until victory has 'Arafat led toward a  besieged Gaza Strip and a small detention camp, which is at  Israel's disposal and which is called Jericho? Anyone who  contemplates the role played by 'Arafat when he refrained from  signing, and then signed with head held low and without the  usual signal of victory, will be overwhelmed with regret and  sorrow.    The paper says that in view of these negative indicators,  any  agreement not supported by the people will lose its value, its  seriousness, and its strength, and ultimately face a known fate.  What has happened between the PLO and the Israeli Government is  not in the interest of the Palestinian people. Practical  experience shows this agreement will not push the peace process  toward its objectives, represented by establishing peace,  regaining rights, and safeguarding the interests of all parties.    AL-BA'TH stresses that Syria seeks a just and comprehensive  peace. Syria has never accepted, and will not accept, separate  and incomplete solutions. The paper points out that we, in  Syria, have cooperated, and will continue to cooperate, for the  sake of such peace. It emphasizes that a just and comprehensive  solution will achieve a durable peace, saying that any agreement  that is not accepted by peoples, that does not secure peoples'  national interests, and that is not in line with the resolutions  of international legitimacy cannot bear the seeds of its own  life. This is because the will of peoples will triumph at the  end.    Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: The Palestinian people, who are  known for their struggle and sacrifices, will continue to  express themselves and achieve their objectives regardless of  dark days and hard circumstances.    Under the headline "The General Mourning," the newspaper  TISHRIN says: It is very clear that the Gaza-Jericho agreement  and its signature are not a step on the path of peace. This  agreement places new obstacles before the peace process, and  removes from Israel a heavy burden as a result of the escalating  and continuing intifadah. This was explained by the fact that  many Israeli officials acknowledged that this agreement secured  a partner for Israel and its security, and that a security  alliance was established between the PLO and Israel to confront  and end the intifadah.    TISHRIN explains: By showing firm, broad, and angry  rejection of the self-rule agreement, the Palestinian people are  reiterating their insistence on toppling this agreement and are  showing that they will never relinquish their objectives for  which the tumultuous intifadah was unleashed in order to totally  remove the occupation from the occupied Palestinian territories.    The paper emphasizes that the Palestinian people are aware  that any partial solutions, phased settlements, and separated  deals can only be in favor of both Israel and its occupation and  will not be in favor of Palestinian national rights.  Concluding, TISHRIN says: All facts point out that the anger  that prevailed in the occupied Arab territories when 'Arafat  signed the liquidation of the Palestine question was the  strongest proof that Israel has dragged the Palestinian side  into a situation with grave consequences and into further  concessions. These concessions began in Oslo, then continued,  and recently ended in a fragile agreement not in the interest of  the peace process. This agreement gives Israel many gains, and  turns the Palestinian police into tools to guard both the  occupation and the settlements.</p>

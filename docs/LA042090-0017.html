			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LIMITS OF PROTECTION;  </P> <P>  SURE, SUPPRESS KID PORN, BUT BE CAREFUL HOW YOU DO IT  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing states to outlaw or stiffen penalties  for the private possession of pornographic photographs of children is a  necessary step, though the lawmakers, who now will move to implement it, would  do well to heed the reservations of the three justices who dissented from  Wednesday's ruling.  </P> <P> At root, the court held, the issue created by such pornography is one of child  protection and only peripherally one of expression. In fact, writing for the  six jurists who voted in Osborne vs. Ohio to uphold Ohio's statute banning  possession of child porn, Justice Byron R. White took care to say that the  court did not intend to diminish the constitutional protection it extended to  the private possession of obscene material in the 1969 case of Stanley vs.  Georgia. In that instance, White noted, the state incorrectly "sought to  proscribe the private possession of obscenity because it was concerned that  obscenity would poison the minds of its viewers." That "paternalistic"  approach, he said, infringed on First Amendment freedoms.  </P> <P> The Ohio law, on the other hand, sought to "protect the victims of child  pornography" by "destroy(ing) a market for the exploitative use of children."  To that end, it was "reasonable for the state to conclude that it will decrease  the production of child pornography if it penalizes those who possess and view  the product, thereby decreasing demand."  </P> <P> In his minority opinion, however, Justice William J. Brennan reminded his  colleagues that laws governing even so offensive an expression as child  pornography inevitably involve some balance between "the First Amendment and  the state's interests" -- in this case protection of children's health and  welfare. As originally drafted, Brennan pointed out, Ohio's statute was  dangerously broad. Had its scope not been narrowed by Ohio's own Supreme Court,  the law, Brennan wrote, would have permitted prosecution of individuals who  have pictures of "teen-agers in revealing dresses" or "even of toddlers romping  unclothed."  </P> <P> That sort of sloppy and potentially dangerous ambiguity is precisely what the  California Legislature ought to avoid as it moves to make possession of child  pornography a felony rather than a misdemeanor, as it is now. It also ought to  avoid any flirtation with the so-called "strict liability" provisions that have  opened some federal laws to challenge because they allow prosecution of people  who unknowingly possess such material.  </P> <P> The state's interest here is in rooting out a despicable vice, not in the  proscription of speech, however noxious.  </P></p>

Petr Filippov  Proposes an Interparty Purge"]    [Text] According to INTERFAX, the Analytical Center on  Socioeconomic Policy under the Russian Federation presidential  administration has recommended that Boris Yeltsin to come out  with a legislative initiative to introduce changes in the  current legislation on political parties and elections to the  State Duma and the election of the head of state. The aim of  the proposed adjustment is to "do away with the hypertrophied  multiparty practice."    According to Petr Filippov, head of the analytical center  and  member of the Presidential Council, the implementation of this  project will inhibit the further existence of "dwarf" parties  and will also affect the interests of "leaders with  disproportionate ambitions who have now become State Duma  deputies."    Mr. Filippov believes that in Russia there are no  full-fledged political parties at present. "What we are used to  calling a party is nothing but small groups of politically  engaged citizens, united around one or several personalities.  The president's main task, according to Petr Filippov, is to  pass through the Federal Assembly draft laws which "would close  one-man shows and drive political forces to concentrate within  three or four large political parties."    The authors of an analytical memorandum sent to the  president  deem it expedient to reregister parties before elections to the  State Duma. It is proposed to make registration of a political  party contingent on its concrete action program in the event  that it comes to power. A party may be admitted to elections  only if its plans have evoked a certain public response. To  this end a party will need to publish its program in the central  press as a paid commercial announcement, as well as no less than  10 articles discussing and commenting on it.    The document gives special attention to the problem of party  financing, which, in the authors' opinion, cannot be done by  legal entities. Analytical center experts propose to extend the  right to contribute to party funds exclusively to private  individuals. The latter, should the sum exceed a certain  amount, will have to present their income return.    Parties that have complied with all the above requirements  and entered the political arena will be entitled to state  support.    At the same time the Legislative Initiatives Commission  under  the Russian Federation president has advised SEGODNYA's  correspondent that the draft law on political parties does not  exist yet and that all discussions about the supposed rights and  obligations of political associations are being centered around  its concept. At the end of January the commission held public  hearings attended by representatives of 23 political parties.  Various opinions were expressed while matters of registration  and financing evoked particular interest. Work on the draft  law, commission officials promised, will be continued, taking  into account the wishes of participants in the hearings.</p>

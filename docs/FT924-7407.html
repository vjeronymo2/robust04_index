			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Building societies and banks become whipping boys again: John Gapper examines the background to accusations that lenders are failing to pass on interest rate cuts to customers YESTERDAY was a typical enough day for the heads of banks and building societies under Mr John Major's government. They were given a public scolding about their alleged failure to pass on cuts in base rates to mortgages and small business loans. As the recession has lingered, such tickings-off have become frequent. The admonition was not as severe as in the past. The chancellor's statement after his chat with building societies and the Housing Corporation, the quango which finances housing association homes, yesterday focused mainly on his plan to inject Pounds 750m into the housing market. But he warned them that he wanted to see cheaper loans. The banks and building societies offer similar defences to the charge of profiteering. Two high-street banks say they have widened margins to reflect the higher risk of bad loans in a recession. Building societies say wider margins are needed to pay for higher mortgage default. The banks are most sensitive to charges about their loan policies towards small businesses. There are two accusations against them: that their minimum lending rates keep loan interest payments artificially high; and that they are covertly keeping back part of base rate cuts. Barclays and National Westminster set minimum lending rates to ensure profitability at low levels of base rates. Until Wednesday, National Westminster's minimum rate on small business loans was 11 per cent. The average such loan cost 11.5 per cent, or 3.5 percentage points above the base rate. There was a danger that a base rate cut to 7 per cent - which happened on Thursday - would have resulted in the bank responding with only 1/2 percentage point cut in the small business rate. Having been bitten several times before, both banks cut their minimum rate to prevent this. The second issue for banks is the overall movement in what they charge small businesses for loans. Margins vary according to each individual risk - for example, Lloyds does not follow base rates precisely, but adjusts what it calls 'managed business rates'. It has three bands - equivalent to spreads of 3, 4 and 5 percentage points above the base rate - which it adjusts roughly as base rates change. Mr Phil Nunnerley, assistant general manager for retail banking, argues that the bank has 'fully mirrored' cuts in base rates since last year. Midland also says its small business loans have fallen in line with base rates. It says the average gap has been 3.5 per cent for the past two years. The recession has led to more customers being classified as high-risk, but this has been balanced by more risky loans being written off. However, both Barclays and National Westminster admit that their spreads on business loans have risen - from around 3.1 points 18 months ago to some 3.5 per cent today. Ms Jane Bradford, National Westminster's head of small business services, says that reflects higher risk. Building society mortgage rates have gradually diverged from base rates in the past two years. The difference between them is historically high, after being squeezed in the late 1980s when societies competed to offer mortgages. Societies are trying to regain profitability by widening the margin. The mortgage rate in 1980 was 1.4 percentage points below the base rate on average, according to the securities firm UBS Philip &amp; Drew. For most of the 1980s, mortgage rates were above base rates while societies rebuilt profitability. However, in 1989, mortgage rates were again lower. There has since been a return to mortgage rates exceeding base rates, the difference last year being 1.2 points on average. The societies stand accused of two sins: widening their margins, and delaying cuts in rates for borrowers so that new ones are at an advantage. Mr John Wriglesworth, an analyst at UBS Phillips and Drew, argues that criticisms are unfair because the industry needs to raise profit-ability. Mr Wriglesworth says lower rates hurt societies' balance sheets because they are earning less interest on their own reserves. They also need to raise their margins because they are hurt by rising repossessions. Bad debts have risen from Pounds 20m five years ago to an estimated Pounds 2bn this year. He says that if societies had not delayed cuts in mortgage rates for existing borrowers, they would have been unable to cut mortgage rates as much as they have done. Mr Terry Payton, head of group finance at Alliance and Leicester, argues that building societies both need to take account of the increased risk in the housing market and to try to attract more savings. 'We are trying to balance both sides of the equation, and help the saver as well,' he says. The upshot is that banks and building societies are risking the public opprobrium of widening margins because commercial pressures are proving too heavy to resist.

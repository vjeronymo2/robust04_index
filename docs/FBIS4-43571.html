			<p>BFN     [Text] The Belgian newspaper LE SOIR wrote this morning  that President Habyarimana's aircraft might have been shot down  on 6 April by two French soldiers wearing Belgian uniforms and  acting on behalf of Hutu extremists. Belgian officials  immediately said that this possibility had been rejected by  their investigation committee. French Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe, currently visiting Abidjan, brushed aside these  accusations:    [Begin Juppe recording] From what I gather, the author used  the conditional tense in his article. He reports allegations  according to which the French were wearing Belgian uniforms, and  so forth. I shall not expand further. According to my  information this seems to be pure fabrication. I have no more  comments to make. An investigation under the aegis of the UN  secretary-general is currently underway to establish the truth.  All these rumors are obviously baseless. I regret that such  accusations are being made using the conditional tense. Either  one is certain of the facts, and has evidence or one keeps  quiet. [end recording]</p>

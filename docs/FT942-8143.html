			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Silversmiths' time capsule - Clive Fewins meets three craftsmen in a workshop that has changed little since 1902 Ancient cracked plaster peels away from the walls on the bare oak staircase up to the first floor workshop. Inside, bills dating from the early 1940s hang from the low, beamed ceiling; antiquated tools and price lists from long-defunct bullion dealers line the walls, and the only automation in sight is an archaic hand-worked silver rolling machine. The scene is Harts Silversmiths, in a quiet side street in the Cotswold town of Chipping Campden. It reminds the visitor of the wedding dress scene from Dickens' Great Expectations; it is a time capsule. Harts is an Arts and Crafts Movement workshop. It is the only survivor from The Guild of Handicraft, moved from the East End of London to Chipping Campden in 1902 by utopian and early Arts and Crafts pioneer C R Ashbee. The brick-built former silk mill was once buzzing with the sound of iron forging, leather working, book binding, and woodcarving, but in the first floor workshop at least, things have changed little. 'Everything is hand-beaten out of sheet silver, rather than being spun on a lathe or pressed out by large machines,' said David Hart, who heads the team of three silversmiths. Reticent, slightly gruff, a craftsman to the core after learning the business at his father's leather apron, Hart is 55. His son William, 25, works alongside. The workshop was founded by David's grandfather, George, who came with Ashbee and bequeathed to the workshop a vast array of drawings. David and his father Henry stopped counting when they reached 4,000. William gained a BSc in computing at Manchester University but joined the family firm after graduating. There is no computer among the hand tools in the creaky-floored, wood-lined workshop. The third member of the trio is Derek Elliott. He wandered into the workshop (anyone is welcome to walk in and browse) 14 year ago while studying A-level Art at Chipping Campden School. A year later he was beginning a five-year apprenticeship with David, Henry, and David's uncle, George, who played Jethro Larkin in The Archers for 20 years. Harts Silversmiths is not a company but a group of three small businesses. Each of the three craftsmen undertakes his own jobs and keeps his own accounts. Overheads - rent, business rates and allied expenses - come to about Pounds 5,000 a year. The three share this, and the cost of their materials. The silver arrives once a month, the annual bill being between Pounds 12,000 and Pounds 20,000. 'If we were good businessmen we'd be turning over Pounds 60,000 apiece. But we are not. We're appalling businessmen. We have no retail outlet. We let the public come to us and we do virtually no marketing,' said Derek Elliott. That is the way things have always been - and are likely to stay. David and his team love Campden, their workshop, and their craft. They enjoy meeting the stream of visitors, from the steady flow of retired people in the town who drop in for a chat, to the visitors from across the Atlantic, Asia and Australasia, who find their way to the upper room. The three each turn over about Pounds 22,000 worth of work in a good year, charging at the rate of Pounds 12 an hour, plus Pounds 10 an ounce for silver - their pricing has not changed in four years. They rarely argue over who takes on which job, and never know how much each turns over or pays himself. They say they are happy to net Pounds 12,000-Pounds 15,000 a year each. 'It's all underpriced, but the market won't stand any more,' said David Hart. 'However, we are anticipating some interesting new business from a Belgian who wandered in recently. He looks like ordering a pair of wall sconces to support light fitments, and also a set of silver dinner mats. 'The commission should be worth several thousand pounds. But the interesting thing is that this man controls a large specialist glass factory and is looking for a source for prototype silver adornments for a new range of high quality glass decanters. We could do the job, and he seemed keen.' Spring optimism is in the air at the Hart workshop. The order book is looking healthy. As well as a myriad of designs of silver place settings, napkin rings, serving spoons, tankards and teapots, all to be made to commission, there are one or two large church orders in hand, and also a big job making a commemoration cup and rosewater dish for a Cambridge college anniversary. The commission is worth about Pounds 8,000 and will have to be split between two, or possibly all three, of the craftsmen. There is a steady stream of church work, plus refurbishment and restoration jobs. This year looks like being a prosperous one for the workshop. But last year was very different. 'In early 1993 we were really hit by the effects of the recession,' David Hart said. 'The order book was the lowest it had been in my 38 years here. Commissions were just not coming in.' Things did pick up, but the Harts had learned a lesson. They are about to advertise in a society magazine - their first advertising apart from a regular slot in the quarterly Church Building journal. In the meantime, work continues to flow from the workshop: a Pounds 2,500 tea set being made to a client's design by Derek Elliott; a pair of delicately curved modern silver candlesticks by William Hart, each with six parts that are invisible to the untrained eye; an intricate repair to a stylish Georgian teapot by his father. 'I enjoy the challenge of restoring lovely things, but it is uneconomic. It always takes longer than you think. So often you could make a new one more cheaply,' said David Hart. 'Although it doesn't make much money you can't turn this sort of work down. It is part of our tradition, and it often comes via long-established customers. 'However it is far better than being like most other silversmiths nowadays. So often they are just assemblers of wafer-thin spun or pressed components. Here we are - different.'

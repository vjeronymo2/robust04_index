			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dragan Momcilovic, charge d'affaires at the </F> Embassy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FRY, by Edouard  Van Velthem; place and date not given: "The Yugoslav Point of  View on the Conflict in Bosnia Herzegovina"]    [Text] [Van Velthem] Three days before NATO's ultimatum  expires, how do the Yugoslav authorities see the situation  around Sarajevo?    [Momcilovic] I am relatively optimistic. According to  General Rose himself, the situation is developing favorably on  the ground and calm continues to reign around Sarajevo. In any  case, as General Briquemont has already said, it is not possible  to resolve the Bosnian crisis by military means. Mr. Karadzic  has moreover made it known that he is ready to withdraw his  heavy weapons on condition that the Bosnian Muslim Army does the  same. That is what is required by the NATO decision in points  six and seven.    The UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] admits that the Muslims  are trying to profit from the situation and their army's chief  of staff refused to take part in the three-sided meeting with  his Serbian counterpart and General Cot.    [Van Velthem] Is the FRY putting pressure on the Bosnian  Serbs?    [Momcilovic] Mr. Karadzic, who regularly visits Belgrade, of  course remains in contact with the federal authorities. We are  doing what we can to favor a peaceful outcome to the crisis.    [Van Velthem] What if the air strikes go ahead?    [Momcilovic] It is difficult to make predictions on the  subject. Of course, in the FRY, there is a normal and  legitimate interest in the fate of the Bosnian and Croatian  Serbs. If Benazir Bhutto can come 10,000 kilometers to discuss  the fate of the Bosnian Muslims, why can't the Serbs, their  immediate neighbors, also take an interest in their own brothers.    [Van Velthem] The FRY supports the European peace plan for  Bosnia. Does that include the respect of administrative borders  that are internationally recognized?    [Momcilovic] NATO's recent decision refers explicitly to the  European plan. It is therefore a solid basis for the United  States as well as for the Twelve. But what do we see in  reality? The Serbs accepted this plan two whole months ago,  respecting the territorial concessions requested in favor of the  Muslims --one third of the country. Only the authorities in  Sarajevo have refused this document. Will Washington's  intervention in the peace process persuade the Muslims to accept  this plan? That is the main question being asked today. It is  true that there are a few points that have yet to be answered,  such as Muslim access to the Adriatic coast and to the Save.  The important thing, however, is to put an end to the war, and  then we can negotiate in detail the issues that remain  unresolved.    [Van Velthem] But Mr. Karadzic has said that his aim is  annexation to Serbia.    [Momcilovic] It is too early to envisage such a hypothesis  before a lasting peace is imposed on Bosnia. Firstly, we should  settle all the questions raised by the hasty recognition of the  former Yugoslav republics. The international community -- and  President Mitterrand has admitted this -- committed a serious  mistake when it based its decision on the internal borders born  out of communism, without taking into account the status of  minority groups and the distribution of rights between the three  communities.    [Van Velthem] If NATO's requirements are satisfied, will the  FRY try to take advantage of this to obtain the lifting of the  embargo?    [Momcilovic] The peace negotiations do not concern just  Sarajevo but are related to the whole process, including the UN  sanctions. It is clear that if the first step is accomplished  with a peaceful solution being found for Sarajevo, then  naturally the issue of lifting the sanctions will have to be  considered. All the more so, since after 24 months of sanctions  the shortage of goods is becoming very trying for the civilian  population of the FRY. In addition, they have to support half a  million refugees.    [Van Velthem] Precisely, is Yugoslav public opinion still  caught up in the events in Bosnia, or has economic survival now  become the priority?    [Momcilovic] The Serbs are always interested in everything  that affects them directly. In total, in both world wars, we  lost more than four million of our people standing up to fascism.    We want just one thing: To be able to live together, in  peace, without being considered minorities. You should not  forget the demography of the Balkans: More than 10 million  Serbs as opposed to five million Croats, and two million  Muslims. Why should we accept being split up into three states?  We are a single people vital to stability in this region.    [Van Velthem] Zagreb and Belgrade have reopened their  dialogue with mutual diplomatic representation. However,  nothing has been settled in Krajina.    [Momcilovic] It is up to the authorities in Zagreb and  Krajina to define among themselves what their future relations  will be. For us, in the current situation, the first steps are  all-important. The normalizing of relations between the FRY and  Croatia is a step in this direction: Restoring communications,  rebuilding the economic fabric, and reestablishing bilateral  trade are major initiatives since they illustrate how we used to  complement each other before the war.    This is the path we must take in the future. All of our  destinies, the fate of the former Yugoslav peoples, lies with  cooperation and coexistence, not in permanent confrontation.</p>

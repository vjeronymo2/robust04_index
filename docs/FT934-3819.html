			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Norfolk firm tests Taiwan engines Taiwan has moved closer to production of its own car engines to supplant components imported from Japan, writes John Griffiths in London. The first test engines have been run at the Norfolk, eastern England, headquarters of Lotus Engineering, under a contract which aims to bring the engines into commercial production by 1997. The contract provides for development work and technology transfer by Lotus to the Taiwan government-backed Industrial Technology Research Institute. It is said by Lotus, which was sold by General Motors to Bugatti of Italy earlier this year, to be worth several million pounds over its two-year life.</p>

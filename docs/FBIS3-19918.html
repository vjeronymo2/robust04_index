			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Copenhagen, March 23 (AFP) -- Croatian Foreign  Minister Mate Granic said here Wednesday [23 March] his country  "is not planning any military operation" against break-away  Serbs in the Krajina region.    On the contrary, he told journalists, Croatia was looking  forward to reducing troop levels "as long as the Serbs do not  continue their aggression."    The minister said Croatia was ready to grant local autonomy  to the region but would never accept Krajina's integration into  Greater Serbia nor a formal link between Krajina Serbs and rebel  Serbs in Bosnia.    Granic partially admitted accusations made by humanitarian  organisations that Serbs in Krajina had been persecuted and  their homes destroyed. "We're at war," he said, "and it's  difficult to control everything that happens near the front  line."    Granic said his country was in favour of international  supervision to ensure human and minority rights were respected  in Krajina and said negotiations between Croat and Serb  representatives from the region would recommence in the Russian  embassy in Zagreb in six days' time.    He also indicated that Croatia was ready to normalize  relations with Serbia if it ceased to support secessionists in  Krajina and said it was "necessary to apply even more pressure  on Belgrade which holds one of the keys to the end of the war in  ex-Yugoslavia."    Granic said he was in favour of a new "active and realistic"  mandate for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Krajina. He  said the present mandate had not led to a disarming of the Serbs  in the region and had not prevented the continued bombardment of  Croat towns like Zadar.    After meeting a number of officials in Copenhagen Wednesday,  Granic left for Helsinki in the last stage of a Nordic tour that  also included stops in Oslo and Stockholm.</p>

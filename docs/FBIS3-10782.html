			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega; from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, PRD [Democratic  Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate, urged other  political parties to avoid provocations and refrain from  engaging in electoral violence.    Perez Balladares met with members of the Colon Free Zone  Users Association today. He explained to the businessmen the  need to reform the law creating the Free Zone, so as to make it  more functional and to bring it in line with the demands of the  world's economic market.    According to the PRD leader, if he wins the elections he  will  appoint the Free Zone manager from a list of nominees proposed  by those businessmen. Perez Balladares emphasized the need for  a Panama City-Colon highway, which will become a reality during  his administration.    [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] There are between  12,000  and 14,000 daily vehicle transits on this road. With  appropriate tolls, this would translate into high revenues that  could very well pay for the highway, should it be done by  private enterprise. This is what we want to do.    [Unidentified reporter] What do you think of electoral  violence and how it affects the PRD, given there has been some  questioning and the Justice and Peace Commission is conducting  an investigation?    [Perez Balladares] I think certain media, not you, have  blown  foolish incidents out of proportion. This must not be  interpreted as a justification, because I do not justify these  incidents. We are conducting an investigation so we can punish  those responsible, if anyone is found, but let me tell you  something: People usually let their emotions go during the  political season; consequently, we ask our supporters to avoid  confrontation. Let's not hold our political rallies at the same  time our political adversaries do. Although they are not our  enemies, they are still our adversaries.    On the other hand, I call on the media to discourage  violence  with ill-intended and false reports. I also urge other parties  to avoid situations we may regret in the future. [end recording]    Perez Balladares said he will observe the Justice and Peace  Commission's decision on a possible sanction over an alleged  attack by PRD supporters against members of the PDC [Christian  Democratic Party] and Arnulfist Party.</p>

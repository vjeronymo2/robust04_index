			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 24 Apr--The merger of the Democratic Union  and the Liberal Democratic Congress was the only logical  solution for our parties, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, chairman of the  Freedom Union [UW], said on Sunday at the first news conference  held by the new party.    Commenting on the fact that Jacek Kuron refused to be a  candidate for the leadership of the new party, Mazowiecki  expressed his regret. "I know that the comments on this matter  will be unfavorable. I tried to persuade him to put his  candidacy forward, but he did not want to do it. However, this  fact does not change our respect for Jacek Kuron," he emphasized.    When asked whom the Freedom Union would support in the  presidential elections, he said that the UW would definitely not  support a candidate of the Democratic Left Alliance or the  Polish Peasant Party, and that the attitude of the UW towards  the present president was critical. He stressed that, for the  time being, his party would not comment on the matter "in order  not to attract any blows. However, the time will come when we  shall make a statement."    It is not yet known what the logo of the new party will be.  It has only been established that it will be blue.</p>

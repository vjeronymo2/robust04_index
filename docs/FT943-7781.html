			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Outdoors: Simply Itchen to seize - Fishing Self-doubt is an insidious infection, and two blank evenings on the Itchen in high summer had left me seriously ravaged by it. As the second drew to its maddening end - with the only trout I had managed to hook making its escape into the weeds with my fly in its mouth - I wondered whether it might all be beyond me. What made it worse was that I was alone in my failure. A glance at the book in the fishing hut told me that everyone else had enjoyed some measure of success. Were they all, I asked myself gloomily, simply better fishermen than me? Probably, was the answer that hung heavily in the darkness over the Hampshire water meadows. My mistake had been to persuade myself there was only one place I wanted to go. The fishery consists of a fairly short stretch of the Itchen itself, with a criss-cross of interconnecting little streams. The other anglers had prowled these streams, picking up a simple-minded trout here and there. But I had skulked in one spot, waiting for something that never happened. The Main, as it is known, is hardly classic Itchen. It was, so the old-timers relate, subjected to barbarous dredging in the 1950s. As a result, it tends to flow sluggishly over thick silt, unweedy and unpromising. At the top of our stretch, though, the current is quicker, the gravel is pale and exposed and the weed healthy. And there are trout there, good ones - or, at least, there had been last year. Supposedly wiser after my two fruitless evenings, I arrived for the third determined to give the Upper Main a miss. So, at quarter to nine, in blissful warmth with the sun sinking in a molten sky, I found myself on the Upper Main. It was not intentional. I had headed for one of the little streams, only to find another fellow in occupation. I then tramped across to the Lower Main, still fixed in my resolve. But there I met a deterrent. Now, I have nothing against birds in moderation. A couple of coots, a duck here and there, even the occasional family of swans - these I can view with equanimity. With an effort, I can even forgive them their atrocious habit of flapping around over proven trout lies, scaring every decent fish out of its wits. But the Canada goose is another matter. I counted 30 of these large, stupid and ridiculous birds. As I approached one of the few promising runs from downstream, they sailed into it from above. Round and round they went, while their chums hastened to join them from all points near and far. Briefly, I savoured a fantasy in which the rural idyll was shattered by automatic gunfire and the honking of wounded geese. Then, I marched upstream towards the forbidden zone. And there I came upon fish, feeding fish, and I was much amazed. For, on those previous occasions, the trout had been engaged in some fishy ritual of self-denial, abstaining almost totally from the tasty morsels which the approach of darkness prompted to pass over their noses. Now, though, this Ramadan had evidently expired. They were hard at it, tails and backs out of the water as they slurped and guzzled. Initially, I was not sure what they were taking, so I put on a little sedge tied with cul-de-canard (feather from the duck's neck). This was grabbed at once. I landed the fish, knocked it on the head and cast again. I was taken again, and broken. I put on another sedge, of deer hair, hooked a fish and lost it, rose another and missed it. At this point, the community of fishes reached a consensus that it had seen enough of me. It sank out of sight and I moved on, convinced I had blown it. But around the next corner were even more fish, troughing away. There was about half-an-hour of fishing light left - not a moment to be wasted. They were not on the sedge, I knew; it must be the Blue Winged Olive. So I knotted on an Orange Quill - which imitates the BWO on summer evenings - and set about disrupting the gourmandisers' gala. Innate modesty, and the horror of being thought tedious, compel me to skip the details of the resulting display of dynamism and efficiency. I was the embodiment of cool calculation. Back at the hut, I bumped into the angler who had deflected me originally from one of the streams. Nice fish, he murmured, as I tipped out my two brace. Very nice fish. And they were, the two best reaching 2 3/4 lb. As I skipped off down the path to my car, I heard a little warning voice. Something, I think, about self-doubt being bad - but excess pride being worse.</p>

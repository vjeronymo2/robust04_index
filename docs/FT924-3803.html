			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Renault will close Dunstable plant RENAULT, the French car and commercial vehicle maker, is to close its truck assembly plant at Dunstable, Bedfordshire, ending truck making in the town. Dunstable was once one of the leading truck centres in Europe, producing vehicles under the Bedford, Commer, Karrier and Dodge names. The workforce was cut to 522 from 1,070 at the end of 1989. The closure, with the loss of 280 jobs, comes about six months after AWD, the privately owned truck maker that took over the loss-making Bedford truck operations in Dunstable from General Motors in 1987, went into receivership with the loss of 650 jobs. The plant was once part of the Rootes group. Its ownership changed to Chrysler of the US in the 1960s, to the Peugeot group of France in 1978 and to Renault in 1981. Renault truck operations in the UK have lost money consistently for the past decade. The company said yesterday that UK production of its 50 Series and Midliner trucks would end in the spring. It will maintain its commercial and parts operations at Dunstable, employing 244 people, and form a small vehicle-engineering centre at the site to provide UK vehicle specifications. It is understood that Renault Truck Industries has lost Pounds 11m-Pounds 12m this year compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 18.6m in 1991. Closure provisions are expected to push the total loss above last year's level. RTI said it would change its name this month to Renault VI United Kingdom.</p>

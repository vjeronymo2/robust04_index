			<p>BFN     [Text] Jamaica will not be expected to bear any cost as a  result of the processing of Haitians on U.S. ships in Jamaican  waters. This is established in a memorandum of understanding  about the establishment of [words indistinct]. The minister of  foreign affairs, Dr. Paul Robertson, says he is making it clear  that in no way will existing Jamaican resources be diverted as a  result of the arrangement. He said the processing of Haitian  refugees for entry to the United States will take place aboard a  U.S. vessel which will be moored about a mile off Lime Cay,  above Kingston Harbor. The ship on which no processing will  take place will operate closer to the harbor. Dr. Robertson  said Jamaica is putting itself on the line because people are  dying, people are being killed every day in Haiti [word  indistinct], and we in the Caribbean have to do more than just  [word indistinct] talk. He says the operation is expected to  begin within 10 to 14 days, during which time Jamaica will be  making preparations (?with the) U.S. assembling its personnel  after which [words indistinct] are expected to remain for six  months.    The opposition Jamaica Labor Party is opposed to the move,  but the Republican Party is supporting it. The Republicans  think, however, that the United Nations and the United States  (?should) do more to resolve the situation in Haiti. And the  Caribbean human rights network, Caribbean Rights, has welcomed  the decision by Jamaica to allow the processing of Haitian  refugees in territorial waters.</p>

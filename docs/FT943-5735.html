			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Technology: Towards a cure for blindness Work on a protein that stimulates blood vessel formation may lead to a drug to prevent blindness. The protein, vascular endothelial growth factor controls the laying down of blood vessels during normal development. VEGF may also cause abnormal blood vessel proliferation in diabetic retinopathy, the commonest cause of blindness in the UK workforce. The abnormal blood vessels prevent light reaching the sensitive part of the eye and are fragile, often causing further damage by bleeding. The British Diabetic Association estimates this type of blindness affects between 7,000 and 14,000 people in the UK annually. With early detection, laser treatment is possible in 70 per cent of cases. The hope of a drug treatment rests on three sets of results from researchers in Israel, Australia and the US. The Israeli team first identified VEGF and developed sensitive tests for it while working on ways of preventing the blood vessel formation (and hence growth) in human tumours. They then showed, in collaboration with Jonathan Stone of Sydney University, that VEGF is the protein that regulates the formation of blood vessels in the developing rat retina. The third piece of the jigsaw is that high levels of VEGF are found in the eyes of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The next step is to develop a drug that inhibits the production of VEGF, and to test if it prevents the unwanted proliferation of blood vessels in the retina. According to Stone: 'Much is known about the gene and the protein and the possibility of specific inhibitors is real.'</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ferruzzi tightens its control at Fondiaria after fall in profits FONDIARIA, the Italian insurance group, seems set for more management upheavals after a shift of responsibilities for Mr Alfonso Scarpa, its managing director. Mr Scarpa, who oversaw the group's recent growth, has run foul of the Ferruzzi group, which controls the company with Mr Camillo De Benedetti, the Italian financier, through a joint holding company. Mr Scarpa's responsibilities were apparently diluted earlier this year when Mr Carlo Sama, a senior Ferruzzi executive, was appointed as his joint managing director. The process has now gone further. Mr Scarpa runs everyday operations at the group's three main insurance subsidiaries, and Mr Sama has overall strategic responsibility. The dispute with Ferruzzi arose over declining profitability at Fondiaria, which has just reported a 20 per cent fall in gross group profits to L78bn (Dollars 62.60m) in the first half of this year from L97bn in the same period in 1991. Group premiums rose by 17.6 per cent to L2,777bn. Domestic non-life premiums climbed 12 per cent to L2,000bn, while life premiums increased 13 per cent to L297bn. Fondiaria's expansion, notably building up a 20 per cent stake in Germany's Aachener und Munuchener Beteiligungs (AMB), has been viewed increasingly critically by Ferruzzi, which has decided to take a more active role. Among alternatives being considered to improve profitability and lower debts are the sale of some stakes, perhaps including that in AMB.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia has  called on the United States to engage in a paradigm shift --  moving away from physical presence and concentrating on the role  of provider -- when playing its security role in the  Asia-Pacific region.    Defence Minister Mohamed Najib Abdul Razak said that as a  provider, the U.S. could offer countries like Malaysia  technology transfer, information, and access to state-of-the-art  training to assist in Malaysia's effort to modernise its defence  capabilities.    I hope our modernisation process will continue because a  stronger Malaysia, in military terms, makes for a stronger ASEAN  ... I see it as a deterrent value, he told members of the  Carnegie Endowment for International Peace at a luncheon address  on Malaysia's concept of strategic security: Towards a Stable  and Peaceful Environment Wednesday.    Najib, who is in the U.S. for a nine-day visit, quashes the  idea of an arms race in the region, emphasising that Malaysia's  modernisation programme was not to keep up with the neighbouring  countries, but merely to replace its antiquated asset, some  purchased when my father was defence minister, he told an amused  audience.    There is no immediate threat, but if things do go wrong (I'm  not saying things will go wrong) we will be more prepared ...  ASEAN will be more prepared. Who knows what will happen in the  21st century, he said.    On why Malaysia recently purchased only eight F-18 from the  U.S. but 18 MiG-29 from the Russians, he explained that the  costs of the two packages were equivalent.    He added that although the Russian MiGs were older, they  were  equipped with new engines and air frames that met Malaysia's  specifications and current needs.    As for the eight F-18s, he quipped, there's scope for more  ... We only have half a squadron ... No pilot likes to fly with  half a squadron.    Najib later told journalists that Malaysia had no immediate  plans to purchase additional F-18s and that his visit to the  McDonnell Douglas plant in St. Louis, Missouri next week was to  identify areas of cooperation and technology transfer.</p>

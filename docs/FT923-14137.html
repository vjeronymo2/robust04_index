			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Sterling's slide hits prospect of interest rate cut THE British government's ability to cut interest rates was further weakened yesterday as sterling dipped to its lowest point against the D-Mark since April 9, the day of the general election. Sterling's slide was assisted by strong buying pressure directed at the D-Mark, which on a turbulent day on world currency markets gained at the expense of a weaker dollar. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, attempted to buttress the pound by once again ruling out a devaluation. Speaking in Munich, on the final day of the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, he said there was 'no question of an alteration of sterling's exchange rate value vis a vis European currencies'. He said the UK would keep interest rates at whatever level was necessary to maintain the pound's value and reaffirmed his commitment to take sterling, when appropriate, into the narrow bands of the ERM at the DM2.95 central rate. Although the pound rallied slightly after Mr Lamont's comments, it finished last night in London down 1 1/4 pfennigs against the D-Mark at DM2.8725. In late trading in New York it was little changed at DM2.8735. Meanwhile, with the summit's final communique failing to mention any international bid to prop up the dollar, the US currency continued its recent slide. However, after touching a 17-month low against the D-Mark, it revived in late European trading to close in London slightly down at DM1.496. In New York it closed at DM1.4897. The pound's weakness is likely to rule out any immediate cut in UK base rates, held at 10 per cent for the past two months. Many industrialists and politicians would like Mr Lamont to engineer a cut in borrowing costs. At the Munich summit, Germany came under pressure, from Mr Lamont and other finance ministers, to relax its own high interest rates, a move which would stimulate global growth. However, senior Bank of England officials have privately conceded there is little chance of a rate cut by the Bundesbank before late autumn at the earliest, reducing the prospects of an early move by Britain on borrowing costs. Pessimism about the immediate outlook for the UK economy added to selling pressure on the pound. Some investors were persuaded to switch out of sterling into other currencies because of continuing rumours that technical moves by the Bank last Friday on the money markets were a precursor to an effort to cut rates this week. Such a cut would be judged by many foreign exchange investors as extremely risky, considering the pound's weakness in the ERM, and the rumours helped stoke the general nervousness about sterling.

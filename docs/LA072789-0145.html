			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN DAY CAMP TURNS YOUNG INTO STUDENTS OF FITNESS  </P> <P> Eric Wade is less than 5 feet tall, yet he's preparing for a place as point  guard on an NBA basketball team. That may not be impossible. Eric is 10 years  old.  </P> <P> Each of the last four summers, he has spent a month of mornings at Cal State  Northridge's Summer Youth Fitness and Sports Camp, a 25-year-old nonprofit,  coeducational program for 7- to 12-year-olds.  </P> <P> The camp isn't designed to turn youngsters into superstars but to provide a  non-competitive learning environment, said William J. Vincent, director of the  camp and a CSUN faculty member. Every day, the children rotate through four  classes on the campus: swimming, which ranges from basic instruction for  non-swimmers to diving and water safety; gymnastics; games such as  shuffleboard, jump rope, handball and kick ball; and sports, including  </P> <P> volleyball, basketball and soccer. Badminton, tennis and golf are taught the  older children.  </P> <P> Staffed by CSUN's Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education faculty and  community teachers, the camp is committed to teaching those with perceptual  motor problems or medical disabilities as well as those who already excel in  sports, Vincent said. Students are recruited through flyers and brochures sent  to local schools.  </P> <P> The staff focuses on the "total person concept: helping the students learn  cooperation and social skills and building self-esteem and self-image," Vincent  said. As soon as children start doing well on the playground -- having the  motor coordination, strength and skill to play typical games and sports -- they  feel more self-confident and make friends more easily, he said.  </P> <P> Brian Cratty, program director of the Center for the Improvement of Physical  Coordination in West Los Angeles and professor of kinesiology at UCLA, said  there are three types of self-esteem in children: social, intellectual and  physical ability.  </P> <P> He said studies show that by increasing a child's physical ability, his  intellectual self-esteem can rise too. Gifted children and those with learning  disabilities are often what he terms awkward, and the tack to take is to do  what you can to help them improve their coordination and skill on the  playground, he said.  </P> <P> The CSUN program provides basic assessment as well as coordination and skill  training, Vincent said. It offers posture analysis with a written evaluation to  parents, a screening system for such divergences as scoliosis (lateral  curvature of the spine), knock knee (when the child stands with the knees  together and the ankles do not meet) and bowlegs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> National Fitness Test  </P> <P> The camp also administers a national fitness test that checks for  cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, overall endurance and body fat  percentage. The results are computer-generated and recorded, and returning  students can compare their past records each year. Both tests are valuable  because they are not usually offered in public or private schools, Vincent  said.  </P> <P> Most students who attend the camp are from nearby because there is no  transportation available through the program. At least 50% of the 200 students  have been in previous years, Vincent said.  </P> <P> According to Denise Austin, a consultant to the President's Council on Physical  Education and Sports, a council survey showed that "90% of all children ages 6  to 12 fail the presidential sports tests. And 90% can't do one chin-up. Only  one-sixth of all boys who take the test can do 40 sit-ups in one minute, and a  study in 'The Physician and Sports Medicine Journal' estimated that 15% to 25%  of U.S. schoolchildren are obese."  </P> <P> Austin said the decrease in physical ability has taken place just since 1974,  when more rigorous physical education routines were still budgeted in most of  the nation's schools.  </P> <P> Dr. James G. Garrick, an orthopedic surgeon and director of the Center for  Sports Medicine at St. Francis Memorial Hospital, San Francisco, said, "The  fitness levels of children and adolescents have been declining for over two  decades."  </P> <P> The decreased availability of education dollars makes changing physical  education programs in the schools an unrealistic goal, Garrick said. He favors  "an enhancement of extra-scholastic youth sports programs and increased  education and pressure from parents and the medical profession."  </P> <P> As for participants in the CSUN program, Merrill Hardy, professor of physical  education at CSUN and the swimming teacher at the Youth Fitness and Sports  Camp, said they are a fairly homogeneous group, but "a lot of parents have  their kids in the program because they are less fit, less coordinated than  others."  </P> <P> Hardy does not think that the decrease in children's fitness levels would come  as a surprise to anyone. Television, videotapes and games have turned them into  couch potatoes, and physical education has become increasingly a part-time  elective at most junior and senior high schools, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Develop Basic Skills  </P> <P> The key in extracurricular programs such as CSUN's is to develop basic movement  skills in children so they can succeed and truly enjoy athletics and sports,  beginning at as early an age as possible, Hardy said. "Kids who don't move  successfully don't tend to exercise," he said. The CSUN camp started, in fact,  as a demonstration school for elementary school education, an attempt to show  CSUN students and the community an ideal approach to teaching fitness.  </P> <P> Hardy suggests that "parents look for programs that offer these kinds of  opportunities for kids, such as the Department of Parks and Recreation programs  -- at local parks -- and the YMCA."  </P> <P> Vincent warns against signing children up for such sports as T-Ball and soccer  too quickly. Not only may parents be limiting the range of choices a child may  make regarding his favorite activities, but the competitive, organized sports  tend to attract the cream of the crop. Youngsters with motor weakness or the  need for skill training may be left on the bench, he said.  </P> <P> Hardy recommends that parents limit television to a specific hour of the day,  and that they suggest or require 30 minutes a day of physical activity.  "Parents are short-changing their kids if they don't help them find one to two  things they will really enjoy doing athletically, to have the opportunity to  succeed," he said.  </P> <P> "Seeing their parents enjoying an activity does more than anything to get kids  interested in fitness," he said.  </P> <P> The camp costs $260 for a one-month session of half-day classes held five  mornings a week. There is one teacher for every 12 children at the session,  which is in July. For information about next year's enrollment, call (818)  885-2661.  </P></p>

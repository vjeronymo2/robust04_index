			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Search is on for a better way to evaluate exposure - Risk and Reward The current debate over the dangers inherent in the derivatives market has led to a more detailed analysis of the different types of risk involved, and greater attention to the best way to quantify risk. Traditionally, the growth of the over-the-counter derivatives market has been tracked according to the notional principal amount of swaps outstanding  -that is, the notional amount on which payments under each swap agreement are calculated. The notional amount, in most swap agreements, is not actually exchanged. However, many derivatives dealers have argued, not surprisingly, that while this measure of derivatives volume may reflect the size of the market, it does not reflect the amount of risk involved. Instead, they argue, it makes more sense to measure the replacement values of swaps transactions, which reflects the current credit exposures of outstanding derivatives transactions. Such a measure has much in its favour. First, because dealers manage risk by marking the value of transactions 'to market' - up or down in line with market fluctuations, a measure of current replacement value is more in keeping with market practice. Second, the measure reflects credit risk, one of the main types of risk identified by bankers and regulators as a source of concern in the derivatives market. It can then be more reasonably compared with credit risk in other markets. 'Modern risk management allows us to disaggregate and isolate different elements of risk, against which one can set appropriate amounts of capital internally,' said Ms Gay Evans, chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA). To prove the point, ISDA, the OTC derivatives trade association, last week announced the results of a pilot survey on derivatives replacement values. The survey of 14 leading dealers around the world found that the gross replacement value of swaps outstanding at the end of 1993 was Dollars 178.4bn, or 2.15 per cent of their notional amount of Dollars 7,600bn. However, the net replacement value - once all agreements between individual counterparties have been netted off - is even lower at Dollars 101.3bn or 1.22 per cent of their notional amount. The smaller figure assumes netting is legally enforceable, which remains unclear in some jurisdictions. However, the Basle Committee of central bankers is believed to be close to making a fresh statement on the issue. In future, ISDA will conduct a survey of net replacement value alongside its regular survey of notional principal amounts. Its most recent survey of the notional principal amounts, for the end of 1992, produced an estimate of Dollars 4,500bn. The latest survey of just 14 participants, showing their notional amount at Dollars 7.6bn at the end of 1993, suggests the market's expansion has accelerated still further. The survey also showed that the credit exposure of participating firms in derivatives was significantly less than in other activities. For example, the 10 banks and two of the four broker-dealer affiliates surveyed held net loans and letters of credit totalling Dollars 1,686bn, and the 14 firms had a total of Dollars 442bn of securities in investment or trading accounts - compared with net replacement value, or credit risk, of just over Dollars 100bn. The move away from notional amounts was recognised in the recent report by the US General Accounting Office. In its own survey of 14 US participants, the notional amount at the end of 1992 was Dollars 6,500bn, with gross credit risk of only Dollars 114bn and net credit risk of Dollars 68bn - much smaller than for loans.</p>

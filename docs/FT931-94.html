			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Cost reductions help Ciba advance 19% to SFr1.5bn CIBA, the Swiss chemicals and pharmaceuticals group formerly known as Ciba-Geigy, yesterday reported post-tax profits for 1992 up 19 per cent to SFr1.52bn (Dollars 1bn) from SFr1.28bn. The results, in marked contrast with the poor results at the German chemicals companies, were achieved on sales up 5 per cent to SFr22.2bn from SFr21bn. Mr Alex Krauer, chairman, said he expected turnover and profits to increase this year in spite of the poor environment, due mostly to cost reduction and a switch to international accounting standards. He warned that sales during the first quarter would fall compared with the same period last year when Habitrol, a successful smoking cessation product, had been launched. The group's rate of sales and profits growth during 1993 would be less than last year, he added. Most of last year's profit increase was due to restructuring, said Mr Krauer. The company was half-way through a three-year programme, launched in 1991, aimed at reducing costs in relation to sales by 3 percentage points. Turnover at the industrial division increased 3 per cent on a currency adjusted basis to SFr8.72bn from SFr8.45bn. Operating profits rose 51 per cent to SFr527m from SFr349m, due to restruct-uring and low raw material prices. Customer focus and productivity improvements had generated most of the profits growth in the industrial division, said Mr Heini Lippuner, chief operating officer. Pigments sales increased 11 per cent to SFr1bn, with printing inks and automotive products generating substantial growth. Healthcare sales rose 12 per cent on a currency adjusted basis to SFr8.66bn from SFr7.8bn. Operating profits improved 3 per cent to SFr1.285bn from SFr1.253bn. Mr Pierre Douaze, head of pharmaceuticals, said the high costs of production for Habitrol and pricing pressure had led to only a modest profits increase. Mr Lippuner said the company was looking to expand its over-the-counter non-prescription drugs business in the US. Sales at the agricultural division, the world's largest agrochemicals business, rose 1 per cent on a currency adjusted basis to SFr4.817bn from SFr4.798bn. Turnover in the US increased 10 per cent. Unfavourable weather and the effects of the reform of the EC's common agricultural policy hit trading profits, which fell 3 per cent to SFr493m from SFr507m.</p>

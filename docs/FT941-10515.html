			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Minnows swim in fresh waters: Patrick Harverson examines the inroads made by Japanese securities houses on Wall Street In the battle between economic superpowers, investment banking is a business where the US has dominated Japan. Even in Japan's home market, the Tokyo subsidiaries of some of the biggest US securities houses - Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs - have established good profit records that some Japanese firms, struggling with the effects of recession, might envy. While a few big US firms have thrived in Tokyo, their Japanese counterparts have found it difficult to shine on Wall Street, where US houses have always dominated. The balance may now be changing. Competition from Japan's 'big four' securities houses - Nomura, Daiwa, Yamaichi and Nikko - is intensifying. The lucrative mainstream of broking, trading and underwriting of stocks and bonds remains overwhelmingly in US hands, where large distribution networks and established corporate relationships give American firms an edge. But in some niche businesses, Japan's big four have built market share relatively quickly, by applying large amounts of capital and trading skills acquired locally. The Japanese have also piqued their Wall Street rivals by poaching many top traders and bankers with the lure of hefty pay packages. Daiwa America, for example, has established itself as one of the most profitable players in specialised mortgage-backed securities trading; Nomura Securities International, in little more than three years, has become one of the main participants in the still small business of 'program' trading, in which firms execute, usually with computers, large-volume stock trades for US institutions; Nikko Securities International has become heavily involved in the trading of financial futures (contracts for buying or selling securities at a later date); Yamaichi International is developing a presence in specialist equity products such as derivatives and arbitrage (trading in different markets to take advantage of price differences). In part, diversification has been forced on the big four. Since the early 1990s, the dollar's slide against the yen, the faltering Japanese economy and the volatility of Tokyo share prices have gradually squeezed the business that American subsidiaries of Japanese securities firms traditionally relied upon: selling US securities to Japanese customers and Japanese securities to US institutions. Mr Stanley Ginsberg, a senior vice-president at Daiwa America, says when demand for dollar assets from Japanese clients began to dry up, 'it was clear that the business (in New York) would have to localise . . . and that Daiwa America could no longer be a single-service shop'. Other Japanese firms reached a similar conclusion: the answer has been to 'Americanise' their US subsidiaries. At Daiwa America, one of the first moves was to bring in Mr Andrew Stone, a former Salomon Brothers mortgage-backed securities trader, who hired a team of top professionals in the field from the best Wall Street firms such as First Boston and Merrill Lynch. Daiwa has pioneered new products which package non-traditional mortgage assets, such as loans secured on mobile homes, into securities. Daiwa has subsequently added futures trading and equities arbitrage to its mortgage backed securities business. Nikko Securities International has followed many US firms and diversified into the fast-growing Latin American investment banking market, where it is underwriting yen-denominated bonds issued by local companies. 'This is a US firm, so we should act like a US firm,' says Mr Ryosuke Suzuki, chairman of Nikko's New York operation. Nomura has gone furthest in reshaping its US subsidiary. The change started in 1989, when Mr Max Chapman, former president of US investment bank Kidder Peabody, was appointed co-chairman of Nomura Securities International, the Japanese firm's US affiliate. He was the first American to fill such a senior post at a big four firm. When Mr Chapman arrived, 'this company was essentially a branch office, a sales office, for Nomura Tokyo', says Mr Joe Schmuckler, the head of equity derivatives at NSI, who joined the new chairman from Kidder. As well as overhauling the firm's management, Mr Chapman encouraged the development of swaps and other derivatives trading, asset management, mortgage-backed securities, and international equity and bond underwriting. The common thread through all the changes at the big four has been a shift in business away from buying and selling securities on behalf of customers towards trading the firm's own money. Tokyo head offices have therefore had to allow the US operations greater freedom. There are still limits, however, on the autonomy the parent companies are willing to grant. When Nomura's Mr Chapman wanted to buy a Dollars 10m stake in a small Latin American bank, a region he believes crucial to NSI's future, Tokyo refused his request. Any nervousness on the part of Japanese parent companies could be explained by the experience of the mid-1980s, when the big four tried to challenge Wall Street firms in the lucrative business of underwriting US company securities. The Japanese failed then to make a big impact because they lacked a network of salesmen and brokers, established corporate relationships and investment banking skills. They were also used to handling straightforward but high-volume transactions. The big four eventually realised, says Mr John Keefe, securities industry observer with the Keefe Worldwide consultancy in New York, 'the techniques that work in the Tokyo markets - mass offerings of low-price services - are out of date for the US, where there is more of a premium placed on offerings tailored to the individual issuer and investor'. The Japanese securities firms in New York rule out attempting to go down that route again. Mr Schmuckler of Nomura says: 'We've recognised that it's going to be a tall order . . . for us to be looked at as a value-added distributor of US equity products to Americans.' Mr David Sexton, a director and senior executive vice-president at Yamaichi International, agrees that winning underwriting business from US companies has 'historically been a tough nut for all Japanese firms to crack'. For the big four, however, the strategy of concentrating on niche businesses is already paying dividends. NSI, after losing money in the late 1980s and early 1990s, will make more than Dollars 125m in the 1993-94 fiscal year, up from Dollars 25m the year before. Others have been reluctant to give figures, but Daiwa says its mortgage-backed securities operation has turned its US affiliate into a profit centre, Yamaichi claims to have been in the black for two years, while Nikko says earnings are gradually improving. The response to the Japanese revival on Wall Street has been muted. The chief executive of a top US securities house says: 'I don't think they've made much progress. They don't do much underwriting for US corporations, in stocks or bonds. Have they developed a credible government (securities) trading operation?' The intention of the Japanese firms, however, has not been to dominate US underwriting or bond trading. They may be the big four at home, but in New York they would rather blend into US markets, profiting from smaller, less high profile, businesses.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNDING FOR LIBRARIES  </P> <P> As a former librarian in Northern California, your two articles on public  libraries (Part A, March 12) brought back some unhappy memories.  </P> <P> For eight years I managed a branch library serving a population of 30,000 in  Butte County.  </P> <P> When I started in 1978, I turned in 13 time cards including regular staff, CETA  workers, and part-time help. When I left in 1986, one step ahead of being laid  off, my branch was down to 3 staff and 25 volunteers. Now, apparently, all  libraries in Butte County are mothballed. Your article does not delve into the  causes of the great disparity between library services in the rural counties  and the urban areas of this state. I see two basic problems:  </P> <P> 1. Most libraries in rural areas are county libraries and county governments  have been affected most by Proposition 13. Municipalities are relatively  well-off because they rely on the sales tax and not the property tax.  </P> <P> 2. The post-Proposition 13 bailout by the state favored the spendthrift urban  counties to the detriment of the historically parsimonious rural counties.  Butte County, for example, since 1978 has almost always received less per  capita from the state than any other county.  </P> <P> Until our state government provides adequate funding for all county  governments, rural or urban, there will continue to be "have" and "have-not"  public libraries in California.  </P> <P> ALLAN OCHS  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

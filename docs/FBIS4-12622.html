			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says getting out of  the Gaza Strip will bring only good things to Israel.  Addressing a dinner of the Israel Bonds in Tel Aviv last night,  the prime minister added that the Gaza settlement of Netzarim,  despite the fact that only 27 families live there, will remain  in place, as will all other settlements in the territories.  This government, declared the prime minister, will continue the  peace process even if it only has a majority of one.    [Begin Rabin recording] We achieved in the agreement with  the PLO what we could not achieve with anyone: that the unity  of Jerusalem will not be under question for the interim period;  that all the settlements will remain in place. Believe me, in  Greater Gaza, in the Gaza Strip, there are three-quarters of a  million Palestinians and less than 5,000 Israelis. Netzarim --  27 families in the outskirts of Greater Gaza of a quarter of a  million people.    We'll continue. The present Government of Israel, regardless  to domestic opposition, we are a democracy, and as long as we  have got a majority in our elected legislative body, we will  continue. Even if I have got a majority of one, I am determined  to go on. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prishtina, June 4 (ATA) -- The recent campaign of  barbarian attacks of the Serbian authorities and violence  against the Kosova institutions and against all the Albanian  organizations, accompanied by detention, imprisonments and  sentences have caused indignation and protest all over Kosova.    The common message of all those protests and reactions is to  continue the work and the activity of institutions in the  republic of Kosova against the persecutions, violence, grave  conditions under the occupation and to continue persistently the  development in other new fields of the institutional  organization of the life.    The protests emphasise that the Serbian tendency for  discriminating the activity of those institutions by calling  them illegal and parallel only because they are legal and  opposite to the violence organs, is unacceptable and fleeting.  The organizing of the political, state, and institutional life  in Kosova finds a complete support in the legal and natural  right which is the political will of the Kosova people expressed  in a democratic way by the referendum for independence, first  pluralist, parliamentary, and presidential elections, as it is  said in the reactions.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Indochina's 'golden gate' reaches the outside world: New bridge is a powerful symbol of the region's reintegration into south-east Asia To call the new bridge across the Mekong River 'the golden gate to Indochina', as does General Chatichai Choonhavan, Thailand's former prime minister, is a pardonable exaggeration. The 'Friendship Bridge' across 600m of muddy water between Thailand and Laos is an unremarkable concrete structure, but the ceremonial opening of the bridge today is a powerful symbol of Indochina's reintegration into south-east Asia. Built with Australian aid at a cost of Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.2m), the bridge is the first to span the 2,400km-long stretch of river between the Chinese border and the Mekong Delta of southern Vietnam. It is unlikely to be the last. A region once notorious for wars, opium-growing and poverty is now eagerly developing trade, industry and tourism as it races to catch up with the other fast-growing economies of Asia. The bridge linking Vientiane, the capital of landlocked Laos, to the northern Thai town of Nong Khai is only the most visible aspect of this process. Roads, ports, airports and railways are being improved, and it becomes easier by the month to travel in the three countries of Indochina - Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos - and move between them and their Asian neighbours. 'It's a regional bridge,' said Mr Michael Mann, Australian ambassador to Laos, during a recent visit to the new bridge. 'It links Singapore to Beijing. . .I believe that in ten years' time you'll think nothing of sending a package by trucking company from Kunming (capital of the south-western Chinese province of Yunnan) to Kuala Lumpur.' A bridge across the Mekong near Vientiane was mooted in the 1950s, and the Japanese made the first detailed plans in the 1960s, but the wars between Indochina's commun-ists and the US and its allies made such projects impossible, particularly since the US was using Thailand as a base during the fighting. Communist victories in 1975 did not bring lasting peace to Indochina. In Cambodia, the extremist Khmer Rouge murdered and starved to death an estimated 1m people, provoking the Vietnamese to invade the country in 1978 to install a new government. Cambodia's Vietnamese-backed government then had to prosecute a war against Khmer Rouge and royalist guerrillas along the Thai border. Laos, meanwhile, was isolated and forgotten, although rebels based in Thailand continued to harass the communist regime. As recently as 1988, Thailand and Laos fought each other in a border dispute in which hundreds of soldiers were reported killed. It was only from 1986 onwards that the communist governments of Vietnam and Laos began to reform their economies along free-market lines. In 1989 Gen Chatichai, who was then prime minister, adopted his policy of transforming Indochina 'from a battle field into a market place'. Construction of the bridge began in 1991, a month after the signing of the Paris accords that outlined a peace settlement for Cambodia. Since then, Vietnam and its much smaller neighbour Laos have attracted billions of dollars in foreign investment applications and seen their economies grow at about 8 per cent a year. The US has allowed the International Monetary Fund and other multi-lateral organisations to assist Vietnam, and in February Washington finally lifted the US trade embargo against Hanoi that dated back to the Vietnam war. Cambodia remains the odd man out in Indochina. The United Nations successfully organised an election last year and a coalition government took power, but the Khmer Rouge leaders reneged on their agreement to participate and are still fighting the authorities from their jungle strongholds along the Thai frontier. Foreign investors remain understandably cautious. Yet even the much-feared Khmer Rouge guerrillas seem unable to resist the wave of economic development sweeping across south-east Asia. Ignoring their own leftist propaganda, they have enthusiastically embraced the free market. They are stripping Cambodia of its assets and selling rubies and logs to Thai traders; they have even sold the forests where they used to hide from government troops. Last month, government forces captured the Khmer Rouge headquarters at Pailin, some eight miles from Thailand. Faint voices can be heard in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia warning of the dangers of the kind of obsessive and uncontrolled pursuit of wealth which has devastated Asia's natural environment, destroyed local cultures, encouraged prostitution and corruption, and widened the gap between rich and poor. There are fears, for example, that property developers will ruin the boulevards of Hanoi, now lined with elegant French colonial villas, and that increased vehicle traffic generated by the bridge will disrupt the peaceful atmosphere of Vientiane, where water buffalo graze in the town centre. But neither Laos nor Vietnam nor Cambodia have much chance, or desire, to avoid the juggernaut of Asian economic growth. The bridge is a symptom, not a cause, of the increasing integration of Indochina with its neighbours. As Radio Vientiane announced in a recent broadcast: 'Laos will finally have a way to connect with the outside world.'</p>

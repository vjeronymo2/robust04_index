			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ARTS  </P> <P> NEA Update: The National Endowment for the Arts confirmed a $12.9-million cut  in arts funding with the official release of its $174-million 1991 budget on  Thursday. The cuts, required under a new congressional mandate to allocate more  federal funds to state arts agencies, will be made in virtually all arts  categories. According to a spokeswoman for the arts agency, the size of each  grant -- not the number of grantees -- will be targeted for reduction as a  result of the cutbacks. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

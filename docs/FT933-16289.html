			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / End in sight to dialling conundrum BUSINESS CARDS listing what sometimes looks like whole a directory of telephone and fax numbers could soon be a thing of the past. A new telecommunications company is planning a nationwide launch next year of a 'personal numbering' service. Subscribers will be given a single number. A special exchange programmed with their daily movements, alterable by a single phone call, will then automatically route their calls as directed - whether to their office, home, a secretary, a voice box or wherever. Numbering Viewed Worldwide, the private company intending to market the service, gained a government telecommunications licence last year and says it plans to invest about Pounds 30m in the operation over the next five years, at least Pounds 4m of it before next summer's launch. Mr Stanford White, its director and a former executive in the US Bell system, said: 'This is a serious venture. Although geared mainly at business at the outset, we are planning a national awareness campaign right from the start.' The 'intelligent network' technology required for personal numbering is not new. In the US AT&amp;T, the largest operator, already operates an 'easy reach' scheme using 0700 numbers. But the cost of upgrading Britain's 7,500 exchanges had previously been thought to make a UK personal numbering service unlikely for some time. However, Mr White believes he can make make personal numbering commercially viable by routing calls through a small number of 'intelligent island sites', fitted with the necessary equipment, rather than by upgrading existing exchanges. He plans to have one open by the launch, with up to eight built over five years. Subscribers will be charged about Pounds 10 to join, and about Pounds 5 a month thereafter. Calls to personal numbers will be charged at premium rates  -higher than standard tariffs but 'well below' those of cellular operators. 'We anticipate a potential subscriber market for personal numbering and related 'intelligent network' services of more than 2m by year five,' said Mr White. Personal numbering has strong support from Oftel, the industry regulator. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel's director, called it 'an important new development in the telephone market'. In its proposals for allocating the 9bn new numbers set to become available with the national code change in April 1995, Oftel plans to dedicate a block for personal numbering operators. 'This will enable such numbers to be identified by callers and easily processed by the operators,' the regulator said. Mr White's marketing pitch is alluring. 'The plethora of numbers - office, mobile, pager, fax, etc - printed on the back of business cards is an invitation to an expensive and time-consuming gamble. One number to ring - or to leave a message if the person is really unavailable - is a huge advantage.' BT says it has 'no plans' to launch a personal numbering service of its own.</p>

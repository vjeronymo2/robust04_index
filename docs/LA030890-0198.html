			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND WARMS HEARTS THAT THE EAST HAD LEFT COLD  </P> <P> In these times of congestion and smog, random violence and runaway real estate  prices, Wednesday served as one of those days that can reassure Southern  Californians who have begun to fear that forsaking the Corn Belt was all a big  mistake.  </P> <P> Consider this: In Denver, you would have awakened Wednesday to a foot of fresh  snow. In Providence, R.I., they were hoping for a high of 27. In Chicago it had  warmed up to 34 degrees.  </P> <P> And in Santa Ana, skies were sunny and blue, with the high 72.  </P> <P> Gene Klinger of Whittier didn't need a thermometer to measure the day. Perched  on scaffolding on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood along with three other  construction workers, he was basking in the sunshine, watching the foot traffic  below.  </P> <P> Klinger, 42, was telling -- with relish -- the story of how he came to leave  Chicago.  </P> <P> "I'll never forget the date," he said. "It was Jan. 1, 1985, and we had an  80-below wind-chill factor. Broke the windshield out of my car. I made up my  mind then I was going to California. I won't go back. Ever."  </P> <P> Robert Kelly, 32, who was seated beside Klinger, nodded his head in agreement.  He commutes two hours a day into Los Angeles but said, "It's days like this  that make up for it. And it's days like this when everyone back East, where  it's snowing, wants to move here. I ain't leaving."  </P> <P> At a small park in Beverly Hills, Jim Reed of West Hollywood and Susan Brooks  of Sherman Oaks were seated on a blanket, sharing a fortuitously planned picnic  in the 70-plus-degree sunshine.  </P> <P> "As soon as we got in the Jeep (for lunch) I turned to Susan and said, 'You  picked a perfect day,' " said Reed, 28, who works for a film production  company. "Even gray skies can get you down when you live out here. The cold  weather is hard to take. It makes people irritable out here."  </P> <P> Reed left Springfield, Ill., seven years ago and doubts that he could ever  return.  </P> <P> "It's one thing to get stuck in the snow one day, but to scrape ice off your  windshield every day . . . well, it's awful," he said. "I don't think I've ever  scraped ice off my windshield here."  </P> <P> At Mann's Chinese Theater, 19-year-old Sonja Huff was getting her first glimpse  of Los Angeles. Back home in Roanoke, Va., it was rainy and cold.  </P> <P> "Actually we're on our way to UCLA to pick up some admission papers," she said.  "It's so nice to come into the sunshine. I never imagined California being this  wonderful!"  </P> <P> And the population grew by one.  </P> <P> Yet not everything was so cheery in the sun. Tourist Hiroyuki Seki, 24, talked  about the differences between Tokyo and Los Angeles, which he was visiting for  the first time.  </P> <P> "I like L.A.," said Seki, obviously unfamiliar with the nuances of Randy  Newman's civic anthem. "Little bit cold in Tokyo. I like L.A. But the other  night I saw some people making a fight with a knife in a Jack in the Box. At  night Tokyo is very quiet. Not so many sounds of policemen at night."  </P></p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Japan's GDP edges up 0.5% Japan's economy defied expec-tations by growing 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, lifting gross domestic product by an annualised 2 per cent, the Economic Planning Agency said yesterday. The figure, bolstered by a recovery in housing-related spending, contrasts sharply with the mood among Japanese companies reflected in the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey published yesterday. The survey's index of sentiment among manufacturers - a comparison of those with positive and negative outlooks - slipped almost 10 per cent from -51 to a gloomy -56, and among non-manufacturers from -41 to a record low of -47. For the July-September quarter, GDP rose 0.5 per cent from the previous quarter, while GNP gained 0.4 per cent and an annualised 1.5 per cent. During the quarter, the EPA started using GNP instead of GDP as the official measure of economic performance. The Bank of Japan and the EPA agreed that no signs of a durable recovery have emerged, but the agency suggested that the third-quarter growth was an indication of the economy's underlying strength. In the previous quarter, GDP contracted by 0.5 per cent. Most economists had expected a further contraction. Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, economist at Morgan Stanley, said the positive figure for the latest quarter was partly a 'yo-yo effect' from the weak position in the previous quarter, and the economy was likely to turn down again in the fourth quarter. Japan's government is expected to start preparing another stimulatory package next week. Jobs hold the key, Page 3</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 1 Mar (XINHUA) -- At a symposium on Deng  Xiaoping Thought on Education [deng xiao ping jiao yu si xiang  6772 1420 1627 2403 5148 1835 1927] today, Li Lanqing, member of  the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and  Vice-Premier, pointed out: To study, publicize, and put into  practice Deng Xiaoping thought on education are important tasks  for China's educational and theoretical communities; they are  also the basic requirements for party and government leaders at  all levels in upgrading their leadership ability over the  modernization drive.    The symposium, which was sponsored by the Research Center of  Educational Development [RCED] of the State Education  Commission, is aimed at studying and understanding Comrade Deng  Xiaoping thought on education [deng xiao ping tong zhi de jiao  yu si xiang 6772 1420 1627 0681 1807 4104 2403 5148 1835 1927],  and discussing how to implement the "Outlines of Educational  Reform and Development in China".    In his speech Li Lanqing said: Education makes up a very  important part of the treasure-house and overall strategy of  Deng Xiaoping's theory [deng xiao ping li lun bao ku 6772 1420  1627 3810 6158 1405 1655]. In probing ways -- and finding an  answer on how to -- solidify, develop, and build socialism,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always treated education as one of the  strategic issues which is of vital importance to the overall  situation of China's socialist construction and the historical  fate of socialism. He personally took charge of educational  work, published a series of brilliant writings and statements,  and formed well-developed educational theories with Chinese  characteristics and the features of the times, which developed  into a scientific theoretical basis and powerful ideological  weapon for guiding China's educational reform and development.    Li Lanqing said: To lay a solid foundation for the  modernization drive, we must make the study of Deng Xiaoping  thought on education [deng xiao ping jiao yu si xiang] the  component part of the study and implementation of the theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Leadership at  all levels should take the lead and inspire popular enthusiasm  for such a study so that education will truly be carried out as  a strategic priority of socialist modernization; will serve  socialist construction better; and education and socialist  construction will -- as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said -- complement  one another and advance in harmony.    Li Lanqing pointed out: In studying Deng Xiaoping thought on  education [deng xiao ping jiao yu si xiang], we should, first of  all, study his far-sighted strategic perspective encompassing  the overall situation and his approach of stressing, reforming,  and developing education from the high plane of socialist  construction. On these fundamental issues in particular -- on  which the destiny of the state and nations hinges -- Comrade  Deng Xiaoping established education as a strategic priority in  socialist modernization. He held that we should exercise  patience on other aspects, or even sacrifice some speed, in  order to make a success of educational work. His theses  represent not only a major breakthrough in educational theory  but also in the theory of socialist construction.    Li Lanqing pointed out: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's approach to  China's educational problems is one that tackles, from the high  plane of ideology, theory, and strategy, the issues in terms of  direction, course, and general policy; and, at the same time,  lays special emphasis on increasing input into education,  improving the material benefits and political treatment of  intellectuals, and helping solve practical problems like housing  shortages faced by teachers. He also proposed that he himself  be assigned the job of providing logistics support for the  development of education, science and technology, a fact that  testifies to his determination as a party leader to solve the  numerous practical problems facing education. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping has set a glorious example for us. He has taught us by  his own actions how to exercise leadership over education and  how to make China's education a success. Li Lanqing stressed:  We are running the world's largest education enterprise in a  poor, economically undeveloped country. We are faced with  numerous practical problems. Only by solving these problems one  by one in a down-to-earth manner and with perseverance will we  be able to ensure quick, sound development of our educational  undertakings.    Lei Jieqiong and Wang Guangying, vice chairmen of the  Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and  leaders of relevant departments including Zhu Kaixuan, Pang  Xianzhi, Liu Ji, Li Qi, and Hu Zhaoguang attended the symposium  held in the Great Hall of the People. Officials from the  Central Party Literature Research Center, the RCED, the Academy  of Social Sciences, and Central Party School; scholars and  experts from the educational community; and officials from  Dalian's Huada Corporation conducted academic exchanges at the  symposium.</p>

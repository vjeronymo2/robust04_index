			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, March 27 (XINHUA) -- North China's  Hebei Province has been hit by the worst drought since the  1980s, an official from the provincial water conservancy  department said here today.    Li Zhiqiang, director of the department, said the severe  drought since last December has threatened 1.53 million ha of  wheat fields and made spring seeding difficult for 2.53 million  ha of farmland.    And the situation is worsening, Li said.    The director said there have been only two poor drizzles  over  the past three months, dropping a scant three to four mm of rain.    In 1993, the province received 474 mm in precipitation,  which  is 12 percent less than in normal years, the director said.    According to Li, the province's big reservoirs now contain  1.2 million cubic m of water, of which only half is actually  available, while small reservoirs in the western area had dried  up even before winter came.    Even Baiyangdian, the biggest lake in North China, is now  only 45 cm away from totally drying up, as it was before 1988,  the director said.    The director noted that the sustained drought has had a  critical impact on the supply of underground water.    He said the water table in northern and central Hebei has  dropped one m from that of the same period last year. In a few  places, it has dropped more than three m [meters].    Li said water shortage has always been a great adverse  factor  in economic development of the province. Some industrial  projects have been made impossible, rich resources can not be  developed, and the biological environment is worsening.    Li said seven million people in the province are drinking  high-fluorine water and two million people are suffering from  fluorine poisoning. 600,000 people in the mountainous western  area face water shortages.    Li said the central and provincial governments are taking  emergency measures to fight against the drought, which has  caused more outcries for the diversion of Chang Jiang River  water to North China.</p>

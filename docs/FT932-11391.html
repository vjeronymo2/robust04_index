			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Changes to new fines system announced GROWING concern over the effects of a new system of income-related fines yesterday forced the government to announce changes to the Criminal Justice Act only seven months after it came into force. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, admitted after a meeting with magistrates that the act had led to some 'absurd decisions' and needed to be amended. The system of linking fines to income has resulted in some people with above average earnings facing penalties of thousands of pounds for motoring offences. In another celebrated case, an 83-year-old woman was fined Pounds 800 for not having a television licence, while the same court fined a younger woman with a lower income Pounds 32. Mr Clarke intends to retain the principle of unit fines linked to income, but will reduce the banding on which the system operates. The disposable income scales on which courts calculate fines range from Pounds 4 per week to Pounds 100. 'I know of no tax or means-tested benefit where the spread is 1-25 so I would like to readdress that,' said Mr Clarke. The Home Office believes some of the problems have arisen from courts failing to appreciate the flexibility available under the new system. As an immediate step, the government will emphasise to magistrates that they should use the discretion open to them, pending legislation to change the scale of fines. Mr Clarke also intends to change another aspect of the wide-ranging act that has been criticised by judges - limitations on courts being able to take an offender's previous convictions into consideration when passing sentence. A persistent reoffender was not the same as a first offender, said Mr Clarke, and the courts should be able to take this into account. The new arrangements have led to some magistrates resigning since they came into effect in October. Ms Joyce Ross, who chairs the Magistrates' Association, said after yesterday's meeting with Mr Clarke that the morale of magistrates would be lifted by his proposals. 'Some of the changes cannot happen overnight but at least we know there will be changes and they will be in accord, we hope, with what we are proposing.' The unit fine system was tested in four parts of the country without apparent difficulty. But under the act maximum fines in magistrates' courts rose from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 5,000, and this has aggravated the problem.

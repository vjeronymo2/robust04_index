			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Guardian Royal It is a measure of the cyclical nature of insurance that a decade ago Guardian Royal Exchange was vying with Royal to be the sector's most highly valued company. Decisions to expand in Italy and build up the UK motor business at the wrong moment put paid to such ambitions. Its market capitalisation is now little more than half Commercial Union's, which was itself the sector laggard in the mid-1980s. If the lesson is that insurance companies benefit from a period of retrenchment, one might wonder whether the tables will be turned again in 10 years time. Yet the stock market remains suspicious that Guardian is trying to make up lost ground too quickly. Premium income in the first half was 15 per cent higher than in the same period last year - a faster growth rate than its peers. Once accounting and reinsurance changes are stripped out, though, premium growth is a less frightening 11 per cent. And the modest acquisitions which account for 4 percentage points of the increase look sensible. Buying US expertise in non-standard automotive risks, for example, could bear fruit in other countries. There is also the potential for cost savings. Besides, Guardian made an operating profit in all the countries in which it operates in the first half. That hardly smacks of slack management. With a solvency ratio of around 50 per cent, the balance sheet is strong enough to support growth and still deliver a decent return on shareholders' funds. On that measure, Guardian is outperforming most of its peers.</p>

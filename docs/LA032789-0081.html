			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS HOPE TO RAISE SCORES  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Board of Education today will consider a 10-year, $431-million  plan aimed at reversing academic failure, particularly among poor, minority  students. The plan incorporates many ideas that school districts are  increasingly adopting to fight chronically poor test scores and high dropout  rates. Programs emphasize smaller classes and strong early education, as well  as ways to restructure school management, shifting authority to individual  schools and to teachers. With the board deliberating over $90 million in budget  cuts that district officials say are needed to pay higher teacher salaries, the  steep price of the plan is likely to prompt concern.  </P></p>

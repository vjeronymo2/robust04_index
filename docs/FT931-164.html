			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Observer: Body guard However much the long shadow once cast by Mao Zedong has shortened since his death, his mortal remains are as big as ever. Or so Chinese authorities have ruled in response to persistent rumours that the ex-leader's embalmed body is shrinking in its glass-topped coffin in a mausoleum off Tiananmen Square. Any impression of shrinkage is merely an illusion caused by peculiar spatial and lighting effects in the hall, says the mausoleum's director Xu Jing. And she should know. She has been looking after Mao's corpse since arriving at his deathbed four hours after he expired on September 9 1976.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Telecom giants to share network SIX OF the world's largest international telecommunications carriers yesterday announced an agreement to pool parts of their submarine cable capacity to create a shared global network. The carriers said the new network, which will be ready by the end of next year, would provide them with a more flexible and cost-effective way of routing telecommunications traffic around the world than the current system of bilateral arrangements. It would, for example, allow them to respond more quickly to disasters such as earthquakes, and provide customers with services at shorter notice. The six carriers are American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, British Telecommunications (BT), France Telecom, Germany's Deutsche Telekom, Japan's Kokusai Denshin Denwa, and Australia's OTC. BT stressed yesterday that the agreement had 'no regulatory implications' and was therefore not being registered with authorities such as the European Commission. It was a co-operation agreement, not a joint venture, it said. Each carrier would continue to own the capacity it put into the global network and the financial arrangements under which each carrier gained access to another operator's infrastructure would be exactly the same as at the moment, BT said. Another 14 or 15 carriers could later join the project called the Global Network Project, which could end up 'spanning the whole world', BT said.</p>

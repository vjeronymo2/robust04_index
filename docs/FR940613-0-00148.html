			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the heading for &sect;292.24 was edited for clarity to read: ``Determination of compliance and noncompliance.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Having carefully considered the comments received on the proposed rule, and explained the basis for adopting or not adopting changes proposed by reviewers, the Department hereby adopts a final rule to ensure that the use and development of private lands within the Hells Canyon Recreation Area are compatible with the purposes for which Congress established the Area and its management direction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standards established by the final rule are those essential to protection of the Area. The approach adopted is not one of direct federal regulation of private land but rather one of relying, to the greatest extent possible, on local zoning authority. The rule gives private landowners notice of those uses that are compatible with the purposes of the HCNRA, provides a mechanism whereby the landowner and the agency may determine compliance or noncompliance with the standards of the rule and gives constructive notice to private landowners that incompatible uses of private land may trigger the use of the Secretary's condemnation authority. Nevertheless this rule is predicated on the premise that the use of the Secretary's condemnation authority is to be a last resort and that the agency shall make every effort to work harmoniously and cooperatively with private landowners to ensure protection of the HCNRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures and Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review. It has been determined that this is not a significant rule. This rule will not have an annual effect of $100 million or more on the economy nor adversely affect productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, nor state or local governments. This rule will not interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency nor raise new legal or policy issues. Finally, this action will not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients of such programs. Accordingly, this final rule is not subject to OMB review under Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, this final rule has been considered in light of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and it has been determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined by that Act. To the extent that the rule imposes additional requirements on any small entity, these requirements are the minimum necessary to protect the public interest, are not administratively burdensome or costly to meet, and are well within the capability of small entities to perform. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Takings Implication <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since this rule is premised on the formal exercise of the Secretary's eminent domain authority, it is not an ``action'' as that term is defined in Section 2(c)(1) of Executive Order 12630. Nonetheless, the Office of General Counsel has reviewed this rule for takings implications and determined that there is no risk of a taking related to this rule or its implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Accordingly, (1) all state and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule or which impede its full implementation are preempted; (2) no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) it will not require administrative proceedings before parties could file suit in court challenging its provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rulemaking was discussed as a proposed rule in the final Environmental Impact Statement and Comprehensive Management Plan for the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area, pages 155&hyph;158. The analysis completed for the Comprehensive Management Plan was revalidated in April 1990 with the signing of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest Land and Resource Management (pages 1&hyph;2).

As such, this rule contains information requirements as defined in 5 CFR Part 1320. These information requirements are assigned control number 0596&hyph;0135 and are approved for use through March 1997. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 292 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recreation and recreation uses, and National forest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, part 292 of title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, is amended by adding a new subpart E to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 292_NATIONAL RECREATION AREAS [AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=72 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart E_Hells Canyon National Recreation Area_Private Lands <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Sec. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 292.20&blank;Purpose and scope. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 292.21&blank;Definitions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 292.22&blank;Land category assignments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 292.23&blank;Standards of compatible land use and development. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 292.24&blank;Determination of compliance and noncompliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 292.25&blank;Information requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  89 Stat. 1117; 16 U.S.C. 460gg&hyph;460gg&hyph;13. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

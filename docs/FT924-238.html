			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Personal View: Call to arms controls Two years on from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the realisation that Iraq, a small and semi-industrialised state, had by 1990 succeeded in accumulating an arsenal of weaponry greater than that of any state other than the superpowers, seems to have been forgotten. 'Never again' was on everyone's lips as the five permanent members (P5) of the UN Security Council met in October 1991 to draw up criteria for restraint of destabilising arms transfers to conflict areas and the UN general assembly resolved to establish an open register of arms exports and imports. And yet a recent report* by Saferworld, the foreign affairs think-tank, informs us that, whereas Dollars 6.8bn worth of arms were ordered by Middle East countries in 1990, orders worth Dollars 35bn-Dollars 45bn have been placed since. The P5 agreed to inform each other of big sales to the Middle East. I wonder if the Russians did so in regard to more than 100 aircraft, 200 T-72 tanks and three submarines sold to Iran, or the Americans in regard to 236 tanks to Kuwait, 700 tanks to Egypt, 72 F-15s to Saudi Arabia and so on. These are only a few of the deals we have learnt about, and the Chinese have now withdrawn from the P5 discussions because of the US and French sales of combat aircraft to Taiwan. China too is alleged to be making hay with orders to Iran and to have exported the M-11 ground-to-ground missile to Pakistan. None of this creates confidence in the effectiveness of the P5 initiative. The Saferworld report proposes a common EC policy for regulation and control of arms and dual-purpose exports. The authors point out that six of the 15 leading exporters in the world are EC members and that, in 1991, the EC accounted for some 20 per cent of all defence sales. They argue that a co-ordinated EC approach to other big exporters would have a greater effect than initiatives by individual member states, and that the EC needs to harmonise members' regulations, and to achieve a higher standard of implementation of controls. The advent of the single market on January 1, resulting in the freer movement of goods and services, will add further urgency to this task. The report develops the guidelines governing arms and dual-use exports and proposes lists of countries to which goods would be controlled. Essentially these would be based on compliance with international agreements such as UN sanctions, nuclear non-proliferation, plus the categorisation of importing states in relation to, for example, human rights records, domestic tensions, regional peace and security, end-user reliability and other considerations. Such an approach has its difficulties. Drawing up lists of countries to which arms exports/dual technology would be totally or partially banned would be particularly problematic. There is a broad spectrum between states which are under mandatory UN arms embargoes (South Africa, Iraq, Somalia, Serbia) and countries where there is no problem (Australia, New Zealand). For example, to decide when a government's human-rights record would render it offside could lead to endless wrangling. Moreover, definitions of the legitimate self-defence needs of importing states and of strategic considerations would vary between members. In a broader context, between 1987 and 1991, the US, Russia and China exported Dollars 31bn of arms. Without some prior indication that the example of those exporting some 20 per cent would be followed by those exporting 80 per cent, it seems likely that the latter would simply gobble up a further proportion of the former. The competition between the US and UK over tanks for Kuwait and aircraft for Saudi Arabia is discouraging. I come, therefore, to two tentative conclusions which are interlinked and which amount to modification and expansion of the notions in the report. First, the most effective instrument of restraint is prior consultation and agreement between leading exporters (ideally the P5 and the EC) on any large and/or destabilising order from a government in an area of tension or conflict. This was the principle underlying the Tripartite Declaration of 1950 between Britain, France and the US in regard to the Middle East and it worked, more or less, for five years until overleapt by the Egyptian/Soviet deal of September 1955. Second, such a system should, as a long-term aim, be extended to incorporate all significant arms manufacturers/exporters. I realise that these goals are distant, especially as the low quality of eastern European ploughshares will make it particularly difficult - in a time of agonising economic transition  -for Russia and others to move away from the profitable export of swords. However, the recommendations in the report would constitute a beginning and, if considered by EC governments, it is essential that they should be combined with simultaneous approaches to the remainder of the P5 and to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. *Arms and Dual-Use Exports from the EC: a Common Policy for Regulation and Control, Saferworld, 82 Colston Street, Bristol BS1 5BB.

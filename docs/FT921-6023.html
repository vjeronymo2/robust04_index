			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Buying other people's life policies - How to .. invest in a second-hand endowment IF YOU want to invest in an endowment policy, why not buy someone else's? When buying second-hand endowments, you are unlikely to be sold a 'pup.' And such policies are offering attractive returns - around 14 per cent before tax. It sounds baffling, but the market is surprisingly simple. You buy an existing endowment for a cash sum and pay the premiums until the contract matures. Then, you receive the maturity payment. The market has expanded rapidly in recent years. Policies can be bought in two ways: From a market-maker. This is the easier way. Lists issued each month by market-makers set out the available endowments, which are listed by maturity date and price. You simply look through the list for a policy with a suitable maturity date and decide if the price is acceptable. Monthly lists from Beale Dobie, a leading market-maker, show maturity dates ranging from a few months to more than 10 years ahead. Market-makers also give information to help you decide if the price is right and to judge the merits of the investment. This includes the name of the life company; the original term; sum assured plus attaching bonuses and premium; the approximate surrender value; the assumed maturity value on the life company's present bonus rates; the terminal bonus ratio; and the internal rate of return (IRR) - the before-tax return which the investor would get, including future premium payments, if this maturity value is achieved. One point needs emphasising. You will need to be flexible about the amount of capital you can invest. This depends on the costs of the contracts available that meet your requirements. You must order quickly after receiving the list to beat other investors. At auction. This is a much more specialist operation. The London-based firm of Foster &amp; Cranfield has been holding monthly auctions of endowments and reversions for more than a century. Here, you have to decide how much you can pay and compete against other interested investors, although the company will give guidance on a realistic price range. But you have to judge the likely maturity values and the price worth paying. Most investors assume that the life company will maintain its present bonus rates, both reversionary and terminal. But under Lautro's marketing regulations, life offices are no longer allowed to quote projected maturity values on their present bonus rates for periods greater than five years, so you will probably have to do your own calculations. This is a straightforward exercise if you know the life company's present bonus rates. You can then build up the amount of bonuses on the contract year by year until maturity - an exercise that needs only a pocket calculator. To work out how much you are prepared to pay, you need to decide on the minimum acceptable investment return after tax and then, using the estimated maturity value, perform a complicated discounted cash flow calculation. Unfortunately, though, bonus rates are not stable at present. There is a big question mark hanging over the traditional life assurance industry's ability to continue bonuses at their present level. Some offices have cut them already and others may not be able to put off the day of reckoning for much longer, according to analysts. And when the cuts are made, they could be drastic. This is of concern to potential investors in second-hand endowments who could well receive less than they expected on maturity. The question is, how much less? This depends on the period before the endowment matures. A change in the reversionary bonus rate will significantly affect only endowments maturing in the longer term. But a cut in terminal bonuses will hit all policies. Take Scottish Life, which reduced its reversionary bonus rates in 1991. The estimated maturity value of a Scottish Life contract on Beale Dobie's list - calculated on previous reversionary bonus rates of 13.90 per cent of the sum assured and 17.20 per cent of attaching bonuses and the same terminal bonus  -would be Pounds 32,718. This is a difference of around 1 per cent from the new projected maturity pay-out of Pounds 32,413. Investors would be far more concerned with a change in the terminal bonus rate. A cut here could have a bigger impact on the ultimate maturity value and the consequent investment return. In the above example, if the terminal bonus rate was cut by about a quarter to 40 per cent, the maturity value would be reduced by 8.5 per cent to Pounds 29,659 and the rate of return to around 12 per cent. Beale Dobie has produced a useful table for clients showing the sensitivity of the rate of return to reductions in terminal bonus. But remember that the eventual maturity payout could be less than the anticipated or calculated figure. Finally, tax can be payable on maturity. There are two cases to consider: If it is a qualifying policy, you would be subject to capital gains tax. If it is bought in joint names of husband and wife, the combined exemption can be used. If not, then you are subject to higher-rate tax on the profit, calculated on the top slicing principle. So, an investor paying basic-rate tax only might not be liable for tax on lower-sized contracts. In either case, an investor would be better-off buying a series of smaller endowments maturing in successive years, than one large endowment. In theory, the buyer of an endowment should keep in touch with the original owner of the contract because if that person dies before maturity, the benefits would be payable to the investor earlier than anticipated. In practice, the investor can wait until maturity - the death benefits are lower than the final pay-out.</p>

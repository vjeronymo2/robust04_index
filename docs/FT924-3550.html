			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / UK Company News: LBC owner hits new hitch over French sale CROWN Communications, the financially-troubled owner of LBC, the London-based radio station, has hit another hitch in its bid to sell some of its stake in RFM, its French commercial station. The CSA, the French broadcasting authority, said it had still not received sufficient clarity on the bid by Mr Alain Ayache, owner of Le Meilleur magazine, and of Mr Jean-Paul Baudecroux of the NRJ group for Crown's controlling stake. It said it wanted further information on the proposed capital and nature of the bid before making a ruling. NRJ, after having an earlier bid turned down by the broadcasting authority, has since been joined in its endeavour by Mr Ayache. But this has apparently not relieved the CSA's concern about undue concentration. Crown has been seeking to raise money from the sale of its RFM stake, but recently entered negotiations with Dame Shirley Porter, the controversial Conservative politician, who is said to be interested in taking a stake in LBC.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Tate &amp; Lyle The ADollars 121m (Pounds 58m) cash offers made by Bundaberg Sugar, the Australian sugar company owned by Tate &amp; Lyle, to acquire two north Queensland crushing mills, have been allowed to lapse. This follows a vote earlier this month by shareholders in the South Johnstone Mill who voted against the lifting of the restriction which limits the number of shares which any single investor can hold. Bundaberg holds a 2.7 per cent stake in South Johnstone - the smaller of the two - but lacks even a small holding in the other, Tully Sugar.</p>

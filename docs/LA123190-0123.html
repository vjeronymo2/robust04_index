			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COLUM-BUST;  </P> <P> U.S. PLAN TO HONOR DISCOVERY OF AMERICA HITS STORMY WATERS  </P> <P> A presidential commission planning the 500th anniversary celebration of  Columbus' voyage to America has been plagued by problems: a tiny budget, few  corporate donations and, until this month, almost no publicity.  </P> <P> Now add a conflict-of-interest controversy to its list of woes.  </P> <P> The panel's chairman, Miami real estate developer John Goudie, resigned amid  disclosures that a close friend has ties to a company doing business with the  commission.  </P> <P> The event's biggest corporate sponsor, Texaco Inc., suspended its donations in  September after raising questions about the commission's management. Another  potential sponsor, Chrysler Corp., may stay away from the event.  </P> <P> And a congressional subcommittee is looking into Goudie's involvement with the  Christopher Columbus Licensing Group Inc., or CCLG, of Miami and New York.  </P> <P> "To have this project blow up in our faces now is making it difficult to deal  with future sponsors," said Frederick Guardabassi, a Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.,  businessman who has served on the commission since 1985. "So much damage has  been done to the commission. It's a tragedy."  </P> <P> The centerpieces of the celebration are replicas of Columbus' three ships being  built in Spain and originally financed with money from Texaco. The commission  is $600,000 in arrears in payments for the ships, which are to follow Columbus'  route and visit 50 U.S. ports.  </P> <P> Chrysler says it wants to clear up unspecified contractual questions before  making a donation of more than $1 million.  </P> <P> Congress has appropriated $210,000 a year for the commission, which pays for  staff salaries and office space.  </P> <P> Strapped for cash, the commission turned to CCLG in 1989 because the company  was willing to pay $300,000 immediately for the licensing rights to Columbus  souvenirs.  </P> <P> The rights potentially are worth millions.  </P> <P> Goudie is a popular fund-raiser for Republican candidates in Florida. His  Hispanic background made him a natural for the commission chairmanship, say GOP  figures in Miami.  </P> <P> This year, CCLG paid at least $35,000 to Manuel Gonzalez, who describes Goudie  as a close friend. The two Miami businessmen have known each other since their  days in junior college, Gonzalez said during the course of several interviews.  </P> <P> Other commissioners said they didn't know about Gonzalez' role.  </P> <P> "I was stunned," said Commissioner Charles Ginoli, who served on the finance  committee that reviewed the CCLG contract.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Santa Cruz de la Sierra EL MUNDO in  Spanish on 3 Jun, page 13, carries a 650-word report by Roberto  Mendez on the dismantling of a huge cocaine laboratory, capable  of producing 600 kg of cocaine per month, near Puerto Pacheco by  members of the Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN]. The  laboratory was found on 1 June in an inaccessible area between  two branches of the Grande river. It had separate areas to  produce and pack cocaine. In one area the drug enforcement  force found 12 barrels each containing 200 liters of ether and  another 10 barrels of acetone. FELCN commander Colonel Hector  Frias said nobody was arrested because the traffickers fled  after being alerted by a lookout with a communications system.</p>

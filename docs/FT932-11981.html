			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht battle resumes THE BATTLE at Westminster over the next stage of the Maastricht bill intensified yesterday as the coalition of opposition parties and Tory rebels stepped up the pressure for an effective vote on the social chapter. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, may announce later today her provisional selection of amendments - more of which were tabled last night - for further detailed debate on the bill ratifying the Maastricht treaty, next Tuesday and Wednesday. But last night both the government and supporters of a vote on the chapter were voicing confidence that the decision would go in their favour. Almost 300 MPs of the 650 in the Commons have put their names to the amendment excluding the social protocol, which contains both the social chapter and the UK's opt-out from it, from the bill. This was debated in the earlier committee stage, but a fierce row erupted over the decision by Mr Michael Morris MP, the deputy speaker who chaired the committee, not to allow MPs a separate vote on the issue. Although Labour and the Liberal Democrats want the UK to adopt the social chapter, and the Tory rebels want to stymie the treaty altogether, their united support for the amendment puts the government's majority of 20 severely at risk. The government has said passage of the amendment would have no effect on its ability to ratify the treaty. But a decision to allow a vote would be seen as a severe setback because of the contortions ministers have been through to avoid one. Government lawyers have also warned ministers that if the Tory Euro-sceptics were successful in applying for judicial review of the government's decision, then the UK's ratification of the treaty could be delayed by up to six months. It also emerged yesterday that a telephone poll on Maastricht, the results of which are to be unveiled next week, has resulted in an overwhelming thumbs down for the treaty. There were indications last night that the proportion against Maastricht in the poll, launched in February with the support of Lady Thatcher, could be as high as 90 per cent.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / A General Accident waiting to happen: An ill-fated diversification General Accident's decision to break up or close down the banking operations of its New Zealand subsidiary, NZI Corporation, could be said to close a sorry chapter of acquisitions by the UK's leading insurers. Within the last six months two other companies - Prudential Corporation and Guardian Royal Exchange - have both disposed of expensive acquisitions made since 1986 and incurred heavy losses as a result. Prudential accepted last month that its losses from selling off its estate agency chain would amount to Pounds 334m. GRE announced late last year that the costs of writing off its investment in an ill-judged venture in the Italian insurance market would amount to about Pounds 70m. Now it is Perth's turn to bite the bullet. GA spent about Pounds 460m acquiring NZI Corporation in 1988 and 1989, then sustained costs of over Pounds 100m in operating losses and interest charges. It is now left with an insurance company that has net assets worth anything between Pounds 250m and Pounds 400m. Losses on the deal look likely therefore to be be at least Pounds 200m, roughly 14 per cent of the company's shareholders' funds at the end of 1990. GA's problems down under can be traced to the climate of the mid-1980s, when its assets were growing strongly because of rising share prices and property. GA felt the need to expand. 'They were under pressure to do something,' says Mr Chris Pountain, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, 'there was a feeling they'd run out of ideas.' Mr Ian Menzies, a corporate financier who joined GA from Schroders merchant bank in 1985, helped introduce sophisticated financial engineering skills to a company long dominated by a conservative actuarial approach. In 1986, GA bought the Ontario motor insurer, Pilot. Two years later, acting quickly and in the face of a lot of competition, GA paid Pounds 353.2m for a 51 per cent stake in NZI, including a 38 per cent stake bought from Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur. GA paid for that partially by backing some of its existing Australasian assets into NZI. In 1989 GA purchased the remaining minority interests in NZI for Pounds 110m. NZI, formed in 1981 when the New Zealand Insurance Company merged with the South British Group, had long been regarded as one of the most competent and profitable insurers in Australasia. It was - and remains  - the biggest insurer in New Zealand with a market share of over 22 per cent, and had built up impressive shares of Pacific Rim markets like Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines. GA felt NZI was well placed to benefit from the steady growth in the region's insurance business. According to Mr Tom Bennett, an analyst with Banque Paribas Capital Markets, the potential for growth in the Pacific Basin made GA believe that it was 'backing certain winners'. Enthusiasm for the area led GA to underestimate problems linked to the size and character of the group's banking business, which had been built up in the mid-1980s. Mr Barry Holder, GA's current general manager, who has been leading the group's efforts to unravel the bank's problems, says: 'Within five minutes of acquiring the bank we wanted to sell it.' Provisions against bad loans increased by four times from March 1988 to March 1989. Defaults on some big commercial property loans in Australia, coupled with the collapse of large number of corporate customers in New Zealand, were largely responsible, said Mr Holder. Mr Holder says that GA 'was locked into the bank by buying a good insurance business' but accepts that the purchase of the bank was 'a mistake'. The group has successfully turned round the bank - it earned a small profit last year. Efforts to find a buyer have been bedevilled, however, by New Zealand's economic problems and widespread scepticism among international bankers about prospects for Australasian markets in general. So the bank will now be wound down. Mr Menzies, the corporate financier, left GA at the end of last autumn. The group now intends to concentrate on its insurance business, emphasising its traditional strengths of sound underwriting. Mr Holder, its general manager, said yesterday: 'Credit risk assessment is bankers' business . . . still fraught with difficulties in that part of the world.' The group intends to move back towards a more conorientation which has been followed since the conclusion of a strategic review last year. GA undertook the review following the overhaul of senior management which took place in the wake of the retirement of its former chief general manager, Mr Buchan Marshall, at the end of 1989. 'We decided to refocus on our traditional strengths,' said Mr Marshall's successor, Mr Nelson Robertson, last year. The group has already embarked upon an extensive rationalisation of its UK business. Announcing pre-tax losses of Pounds 121m in March, Mr Robertson said he aimed to reduce staff costs by as much as 20 per cent in the company's branch network. On the surface, GA is now well placed to consolidate. The resurgence in the stock market since January has helped to produce a recovery in GA's asset base and strengthened the group's solvency ratio (net worth as a percentage of premiums). But some - smaller - banana skins still lie ahead. The possible nationalisation by the Ontario provincial government of the local motor insurance industry would wrest control of the successful Pilot subsidiary from GA, leading to possible losses of Pounds 12m. GA's chain of estate agents has been losing money. And, although the company is confident that no further provisions will be needed for NZI Bank, some analysts are sceptical. Even if there is no further price to pay, however, the memory of the 1980s burst of expansion is likely to trouble GA's cautious, conservative managers for years to come.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Letter: BBC should give customers what they want with Radio 4 Sir, I have heard that the BBC intends to stop broadcasting Radio 4 on long wave. There must be thousands of British expatriates like myself for whom Radio 4 is the main cultural link with Britain. To me Radio 4 is simply one of the pleasures of life, and the idea of it being replaced by a continuous news programme seems quite absurd. We have quite enough of these already, including the BBC's own '648', Radio Europe, and I cannot see anyone wanting to listen to the same items of news being repeated endlessly (except in times of emergency like the Gulf war, but then schedules can be rearranged anyway). The BBC is supposed to be a public service which should give its customers what they want. I, and by all accounts more than 90 per cent of listeners, want Radio 4. I should be grateful if you would use your influence to see that the BBC abandons its plans for an unwanted new service and keeps Radio 4 on long wave. P H Ball, Jan van Scorelpark 58, 1871 EZ Schoorl, The Netherlands</p>

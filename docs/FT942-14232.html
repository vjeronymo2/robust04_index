			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Green revolution in business - The effect legislation to protect the environment has had on managements The Queen's awards for the environment, created two years ago, have emerged at a turning point in the environmental debate. Businesses are beginning to pay considerable attention to 'greening' their activities. After a decade of intense legislative effort by the UK, the European Union and other international organisations, industries find themselves the subject of a barrage of measures to control pollution. You do not, however, have to assume that managements have adopted green convictions to see why it might be in their interests to spend any money on the environment. Taxes on many kinds of fuel have been steadily rising, while one of the European Union's main environmental proposals is the introduction of a tax on energy and its carbon content, to help reduce the threat of global warming. The UK's much-delayed new rules on the management of landfills - licensed rubbish dumps - which come into force on May 1, are also likely to push up the cost of disposing of solid waste. Meanwhile, the National Rivers Authority and the water companies have been steadily ratcheting up the cost of permits to discharge effluent into rivers and estuaries. Controls on air emissions are also one of the main targets of the pollution inspectorate as it seeks to apply the provisions of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act. A second reason for companies' increased concern about their environmental impact is the growing difficulty of getting planning permission for new processes and sites. Many local councils have become tougher about granting such permission, mindful of the public protests that now regularly follow threats of environmental damage. Oil and chemical companies, in particular, say privately that without a green image they will find it hard to win planning battles. While all these factors have had some effect in greening companies, the spread of regulation to control pollution is the greatest driving force behind the growth of environmental technology markets. According to a UK government report last month, the world market for pollution control equipment and services is worth about Dollars 210bn and will grow to about Dollars 320bn by 2000 and Dollars 570bn by 2010. The report said that British environmental technology companies generate an annual trade surplus of Pounds 234m - water treatment technology is a particularly strong sector. However, in many sectors, UK companies lag behind German, US and Japanese companies, whose growth has been helped by the long history of tight environmental regulation in those countries. Mr Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, says that the development of UK environmental technology will be handicapped by the UK government's comparative slowness in drawing up regulation. But he remains sceptical that the Queen's Award scheme marks any deep-rooted greening of British business: 'The Queen's Award will not deliver (a thriving British environmental technology sector) unless the government uses regulation to drive the market.' Environmentalists and industrialists unite in pointing out that technological innovation alone is not enough to generate these markets. Techniques for recycling many products have been available for years, they say, but the demand for recycled material remains low. The near failure of the German attempts to bring in tough quotas for recycling waste packaging shows how difficult it can be to create such markets. In an endeavour to avoid these mistakes, the UK government has challenged the UK packaging industry to draw up a workable scheme. Industrialists in many sectors are also sceptical that the emergence of environmental technology markets can compensate for the extra costs which the rules place on businesses. They suggest, too, that much environmental technology is relatively unsophisticated and will be rapidly 'poached' by companies in developing countries as those markets develop. Controversy about whether higher environmental standards in developed countries hindered businesses when competing internationally surfaced last week in Marrakesh in debates on the environmental implications of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Chemical companies have repeatedly voiced their concern that western Europe will lose sectors such as bulk chemical manufacture to other less regulated parts of the world, particularly to eastern Europe, because of the high costs of compliance with environmental regulation. Such talk is anathema to many policymakers as well as environmentalists. However, firm figures on revenues and markets are difficult to establish in this early stage of the environmental markets' development. While schemes such as the Queen's Awards give prominence to new green technology, the debate about whether greener really means richer has a long way to run.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Name                         Location               Product or process  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Alida Recycling              Heanor, Derbyshire     Polythene waste                                                      recycling Bridgewater Paper Company    Ellesmere Port, South  Newsprint from                               Wirral, Cheshire       recycled fibre Combined Power Systems       Eccles, Greater                               Manchester            Computer controlled                                                      combined heat and Dorman Diesels               Stafford, Staffs       Low emission gas                                                      engines Multicore Solders            Hemel Hempstead,       'No Clean' soldering                               Herts                   materials Seabait                      Ashington,             Cultured ragworms                               Northumberland         for fishing bait Shaw, Son &amp; Greenhalgh       Huddersfield, W Yorks  Isolation valves for                                                      hazardous                                                      chemicals Vickers Electronics          Altrincham, Cheshire   Synchronous                                                      burner controls  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

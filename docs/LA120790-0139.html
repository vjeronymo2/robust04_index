			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE TO GET OUT OF GEOTHERMAL BUSINESS  </P> <P> The state Department of Water Resources said Thursday that it will get out of  the geothermal energy business.  </P> <P> The state will shut down its power plants at Bottle Rock and South Geysers,  near Calistoga, in Northern California.  </P> <P> Steam wells had powered the Bottle Rock facility since 1985; South Geysers was  never considered productive.  </P> <P> The Bottle Rock facility, before power production ended there in September, was  feeding a relatively small 7 megawatts of electrical power into the  distribution system of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.  </P> <P> Private geothermal producers contacted Thursday saw this as no big setback to  development of geothermal power. Both Unocal Corp. and the Northern California  Power Agency, a 14-city consortium, have successful operations in the same  geothermal field.  </P> <P> "The fact of the matter is that the state doesn't know how to run an energy  company," said Bob Taggart, senior vice president for external affairs for San  Francisco-based California Energy Co., the leading U.S. independent geothermal  producer.  </P> <P> California Energy Co. operates several power plants, including one at China  Lake in the Southern California desert.  </P> <P> "We have a facility there that is cranking out 240 megawatts," Taggart said.  "That supplies all electrical needs for 250,000 households."  </P> <P> One technician familiar with the state's wells said Thursday that they had  always been "marginal" steam producers, on the edge of the well field.  </P> <P> They had also been plagued by caustic hydrogen sulfide gas, which corrodes  metal pipe casings.  </P> <P> "They were just in a bad part of the field," he said.  </P> <P> About 7% of all electricity used in California is currently produced by  geothermal wells.  </P></p>

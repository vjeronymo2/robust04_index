			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / International Company News: L'Air Liquide in gas deal with Kemira KEMIRA, the Finnish state-owned chemicals group, is linking with L'Air Liquide of France to produce and market industrial gases in Finland. The two companies are setting up a joint venture, Polargas, which will be 70 per cent owned by the French group. The venture will take over Kemira's industrial gas production and distribution facilities in Oulu and Raahe on the west coast of Finland. The operations mainly produce oxygen, nitrogen and argon and have a FM100m (Dollars 17.1m) annual turnover. L'Air Liquide will contribute know-how and make a payment of unspecified size for its holding in the new company. Kemira said it was optimistic about growth possibilities for industrial gases, but did not want to expand its operations in this area on its own.</p>

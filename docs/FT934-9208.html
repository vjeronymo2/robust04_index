			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: CNN owner tumbles in quarter TURNER Broadcasting System, which owns the CNN television news service, yesterday reported net income of Dollars 1m in the third quarter, down from Dollars 12.5m in the same period of last year. The fall was due to the costs of overseas expansion and a Dollars 6m extraordinary charge for early termination of debt. Mr Ted Turner, the chairman, said the company's core business performed relatively well, with advertising revenue up 11 per cent. 'The decrease in profitability is primarily related to investment in new businesses, particularly overseas. 'The impact of this sort of investment is consistent with our past philosophy of sustaining operating losses in the near-term in order to create a valued asset in the long-term.' The company's operating profit dipped from Dollars 64.1m to Dollars 59.9m on revenues of Dollars 501m, up from Dollars 456.4m, while earnings per share worked through at zero, compared with 5 cents. Turner's interest burden rose from Dollars 46.9m to Dollars 48.2m. Operating profit at the entertainment segment rose 6 per cent to Dollars 46m, while the news business was up 22 per cent at Dollars 8m, and syndication lost Dollars 10m, Dollars 6m more than last year. For the nine months the group reported a Dollars 254m net loss after a Dollars 306m charge for accounting changes, compared with a profit of Dollars 48m.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Western groups to buy more from the east WESTERN Germany's largest companies plan to double their purchases from eastern German enterprises by 1995 despite high labour costs and low levels of productivity in the five new Lander, the Federation of German Industry announced yesterday. The project to 'buy east German', launched last February, is aimed at reviving the region's economy. It is supported by a range of west Germany's biggest companies, including motor manufacturers and retail and mail-order chains. Although it is progressing slowly, several purchasing managers from west Germany said yesterday they would help improve the quality, marketing and efficiency of goods bought in the east. When the project was launched purchases of east German goods and services by western German companies since early 1991 totalled DM14bn (Pounds 5.6bn), against eastern purchases from western Germany amounting to DM174bn. Ms Birgit Breuel, president of the Treuhand privatisation agency, said this would reach an annual figure of DM25bn by early 1995. 'There are goods to be bought. This offensive is aimed at integrating the two economies,' she said yesterday. The long-term effects of the scheme, she added, would entail transferring crucial 'know-how' and management skills to the east. Some companies - Audi, for example - have set up a special east German section in its purchasing department. Mr Erich Schmitt, a member of Audi's management board, said the company had already spent DM600m a year on buying spare parts from eastern Germany. 'The enterprises in the new states have to know what we want. Despite the high labour costs, there are some advantages. Since productivity is so low, we can improve the efficiency fairly quickly. 'There is greater scope for more flexibility. 'We have to get it into our heads that eastern Germany is a place which we must automatically include in our contracts. That demands a change in the mentality of western German businesses,' he added.</p>

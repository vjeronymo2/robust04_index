			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Fresh challenge to Yeltsin as ally faces corruption inquiry THE RUSSIAN parliament stepped up its challenge to President Boris Yeltsin yesterday by voting to investigate one of his closest allies for alleged corruption amid charges and countercharges of an impending putsch by supporters of both sides. The parliament voted to permit the procurator general to investigate Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister and Mr Yeltsin's most senior cabinet supporter, on charges that he misappropriated Dollars 14.5m (Pounds 9.6m) of hard currency meant to buy baby food from a Swiss company. Mr Shumeiko, in a television interview, dismissed the charges, saying they were a purely 'political game'. His press secretary likened the move to Stalin's liquidation of his opponents in the late 1930s. The investigation follows another corruption probe into the affairs of Mr Mikhail Poltaranin, a close aide to Mr Yeltsin and a man whose abrasive insults to deputies made him unpopular. During yesterday's session Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, also produced one of his most vitriolic speeches against the presidency. At a press conference later, Mr Lev Ponomareyev, a leader of the Democratic Russia group, urged Mr Yeltsin to cut short his two-week holiday because of the 'pre-putsch situation' in the capital. The fragile recovery in the Russian economy was also in jeopardy after parliament passed a budget on Thursday night with a deficit of some Rbs22trln (Pounds 14.6bn) or 25 per cent of Gross National Product, compared to a government draft budget with a deficit of Rbs12trln. Approval of the budget triggered a struggle which could threaten the delivery of Western financial assistance for further reforms. Mr Khasbulatov said Russia was on the verge of economic collapse. He commanded the parliament's praesidium to remain in permanent session to be ready for a 'sudden turnabout in the development of the political situation'. Mr Sergei Dubinin, the first deputy finance minister, said the budget would mean inflation surging up again to 25-30 per cent a month, from its present level of around 17 per cent. He said he would ask Mr Yeltsin to use his powers of veto on the parliamentary version. The government's deficit would still be near the 5 per cent of GNP target agreed with the Group of Seven industrialised countries - since assistance provided by the G7, largely via the International Monetary Fund, would bring down the deficit which had to be financed from domestic sources. However, a team from the IMF returns to Washington this weekend sceptical of the durability of the cuts suggested by the government - especially cuts to wages and pensions, agricultural subsidies and payments at the military industrial complex. The first Dollars 1.5bn tranche of the G7's Dollars 3bn 'systemic transformation facility' was disbursed last month - but a decision on the second tranche will not be taken before mid September at the earliest.</p>

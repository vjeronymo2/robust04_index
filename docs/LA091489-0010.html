			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PILOT'S LICENSE  </P> <P> As a private pilot, with an instrument rating, I take flying seriously. I was  outraged upon reading about the new regulations (The Nation, Sept. 1) making it  easier to obtain a pilot's license! If anything, I have always felt that the  regulations should be more stringent. There are enough incompetent pilots in  their air right now.  </P> <P> Flying is serious business; it is not a game. Planes are not toys on a string.  Every pilot has a responsibility for his/her own safety as well as the safety  of everyone else in the air and on the ground.  </P> <P> I hope that the National Transportation Safety Board and other private pilots  will put enough pressure on the FAA to reverse that decision and not let  inexperienced thrill-seekers endanger our skies.  </P> <P> PATRICIA M. OLSON  </P> <P> West Los Angeles  </P></p>

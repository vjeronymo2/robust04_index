			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih by </F> Sumayyah Ahmad in Cairo "during the meetings of the Arab Foreign  Ministers Council at the Arab League headquarters"]    [Text] [Ahmad] What are the developments in the south?    [Abu-Salih] Let us return to May of last year, when a  ranking  Sudanese delegation travelled to Abuja to hold talks with  Garang, who did not attend the meetings. He sent his deputy  Musa al-Bashir instead. Despite this move indicating his  derision and unwillingness to establish peace, we continued  discussing the basic issues for three weeks. We found a  solution to around 80 percent of these issues.    At the same time, there was another Sudanese delegation  negotiating in Nairobi with a delegation from the United  Faction. We made some positive progress. But developments in  Nigeria then made it difficult to continue negotiations.    In September of last year, the (EANGAD) [abbreviation,  parenthesis as published] group in East Africa proposed  mediation to form a committee from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda,  and Kenya. It held many meetings on the presidential or foreign  ministerial level in the different places. But there was no  clear objective behind these meetings. We were made to  understand that negotiations are the objective so that EANGAD  does not negotiate on their or our behalf.    I went to Nairobi last month to confirm our adherence to and  welcoming of mediation on condition that a negotiating schedule  be set out, that negotiations be direct, and that there be a  specific working agenda. The Nairobi meeting was held on 8  March. President al-Bashir traveled on 17 March and met  President Moi. We believe this was a good beginning. Agreement  was reached on a second round of talks on 15 May in accordance  with the old schedule. We believe we need to build on what has  been achieved in the past, when agreement was reached on many  issues. We also believe that future meetings should take place  to discuss the other problems.    [Ahmad] Recently, some proposals were made on the right of  the south to self-determination. Was this issue discussed in  the negotiations?    [Abu-Salih] Not at all. They proposed some ideas on the  working agenda, the most important of which was to add a new  item, the right to self-determination. We rejected this  totally. They are nothing but a group of rebels forming a  minority. The reason we do not talk to them is not because they  carry arms, but because we believe that the solution always lies  in dialogue. We have no intention of deciding the issue  militarily, although this is our duty and mission. There is no  power that can prevent us from being flexible. These people are  not talking in the name of the south.    [Ahmad] You have often pointed out the existence of foreign  circles supporting the separatists. Who are these circles?    [Abu-Salih] There are American and British circles. The two  governments are not too distant from each other. There are many  seminars being held in the two countries. The most recent one  was held in an American research center in October. It called  for the unity of the factions. Congressmen attended. Another  seminar was held in the British House of Lords, although none of  the lords attended. The topic of the seminar was the right to  self-determination in the south.    The archbishop of Canterbury and many other figures and  officials visited the south without the permission of the  Sudanese Government.    [Ahmad] The Arab foreign ministers issued a resolution at  the  end of their recent meeting rejecting every attempt to divide  Sudan. Is this stance considered enough for Sudan?    [Abu-Salih] Undoubtedly, it was a supportive stance, beyond  our expectations, when the Arab brothers competed to highlight  and confirm their country's position on the unity of Sudan,  especially Egypt's stance. We do not wish to polarize the Arab  nation or seek military or material support. But we wanted to  warn the foreign sides that there is Arab moral support for the  unity of Sudan's territory.    [Ahmad] This leads us to Sudanese-Egyptian relations.    [Abu-Salih] The differences between the two governments are  not beyond resolving if there is confidence between us. We are  still waiting for Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa [to come to  Khartoum]. I do not believe we will need many meetings between  us. I must point out that Egypt's stance on the south is  honorable and responsible, without anyone asking it to be so.    [Ahmad] How do you explain Sudan's stance opposing Egypt's  joining the preferential trade agreement for the countries of  East and South Africa?    [Abu-Salih] That is not true. Countries other than Sudan  objected. I did not attend this meeting.    [Ahmad] But Sudan did object?    [Abu-Salih] Yes. But two other countries are very close to  Egypt. I do not wish to discuss this topic.    [Ahmad] In what way does expelling Sudan from the IMF affect  the economy in Sudan?    [Abu-Salih] Primarily, the IMF stance on Sudan is a  political  stance, not a scientific one.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Procurator General Anzor Baluashvili, </F> head of the group investigating Abkhazian war crimes, by  unidentified SAKINFORM correspondent; place and date not given:  "The Abkhazian Tragedy Is a Crime Against Humanity"]    [Text]Atrocious crimes have been committed by  Abkhazian separatists against the Georgian population in  Abkhazia. As is known to the general public, criminal  proceedings have been instituted in the Republic of Georgia  Procurator's Office concerning the genocide and ethnic cleansing  of the Georgian population that has been living on this ancient  Georgian land. Regarding these facts, the investigation has  already acquired numerous pieces of evidence that very clearly  show the Abkhazian separatists' cruelty toward the peaceful  population. Taking into account the very great interest of the  public toward the investigation, our editor's office is  continuing its series of publications on this subject. Anzor  Baluashvili, head of the investigation group and the republic's  deputy procurator general, spoke to a SAKINFORM correspondent  about the incidence of genocide and ethnic cleansing of the  Georgian population on the territory of Abkhazia by Abkhazian  separatists.    [Baluashvili] Absolutely horrific facts are being  established on the basis of research: The organized genocide of  the native Georgian population on the territory of Abkhazia by  Abkhazian separatists and their reactionary henchmen. The  conspiracy to between the organizers, perpetrators, and  accomplices in this most serious crime is clearly evident. With  the aim of violating the territorial integrity of the Georgian  state, Abkhazian separatists slaughtered, in an organized way  and on a massive scale, thousands of completely innocent people  who were sacrificed only because they were of Georgian  nationality. With the same aim, hundreds of thousands of  indigenous Georgians were expelled from their homes, which  action was accompanied by indescribable terror, physical and  psychological violence, violation of the honor and dignity of  citizens, devastation of homes and destruction of family  belongings, the stealing of livestock and hijacking of vehicles.  The Georgian people were subject to conditions that would have  resulted in their certain annihilation had they remained on this  territory.    Certain people are vainly trying to deny that the genocide  of  the Georgian population took place in Abkhazia and explain the  events as the cruelty that takes place during time of war. We  state openly that this is an attempt to mislead the  international public. The investigation will make available to  any interested person the materials in its possession, to prove  that systematic ethnic cleansing did indeed take place on the  territory of Abkhazia.    Moreover, several issues of the newspaper would probably not  suffice to simply list the biographical details of those persons  who were killed by the Abkhazian separatists and their  hirelings. Those who were slaughtered did not participate in  military operations. You cannot find an Abkhazian town, rayon,  and village where reprisals were not perpetrated against the  Georgian population. In practice, military actions in Abkhazia  ended following the fall of Sukhumi on 27 September 1993.  However, the investigation has gathered numerous pieces of  evidence testifying to the slaughter of the Georgian population  on a massive scale after military actions had ended. The  investigators know with what inhuman cynicism and brutality the  band of separatist criminals raped women and then cut off their  breasts while they were still alive and even raped young girls  who had not attained puberty and cut off their nipples and kept  them in matchboxes. I state publicly that this testimony can be  corroborated not only by Georgians but also by Greeks,  Armenians, Russians, and representatives of other nationalities.  In order for the world to assess the tragedy perpetrated by the  fascists in Abkhazia in an objective and comprehensive manner, I  believe it is essential that international organizations become  immediately involved in the investigation. I believe that  riffraff have surfaced at the end of the 20th century, the  spread of whose lifestyle causes wounds that will not heal among  millions of inhabitants of different countries. According to  the testimony of some people, it has also become known that,  after killing innocent people, the vandals attached the  following types of inscriptions to the bodies of the victims:  "Georgians, don't eat a lot, don't get fat. It's unpleasant  for us to drag your corpses." One cannot read without feeling  revulsion the testimony of eyewitnesses that describes how, in  the immediate aftermath of the fall of Sukhumi, the following  people were slaughtered on Tsereteli Street: A. Gadelia, O.  Gegechkori, U. Kvaratskhelia, J. Dgebuadze, T. Kakuberi-  Gvakhariasi, and S. Kakuberi, and also the Sukhumians J.  Dartsmelia, the Zakradze brothers, Sh. Kacharava, Eter and Zaira  Abramia, Z. Kalandia, B. Pipia, V. Jimsheleishvili, Ts. Sharia,  V. Kvachakhia, A. Kintsurashvili, D. Kopaliani, and M.  Kvirchkhaia. Thousands of Georgian families residing in  Abkhazia shared the same fate as Nugzar Varlamis dze [son of  Varlam] Jimsheleishvili, former Abkhazian Cabinet of Ministers  engineer. His father, Varlam Noes [son of Noe] Jimsheleishvili  was taken prisoner, his home was ransacked, and his mother  Babutsa Pipia and mother-in-law Mzia Kalandia were tortured to  death. For specific reasons, I am unable to disclose the  identity of 80-year old L.B. He was tortured to death and his  foster child I.T., who was of Russian nationality, was shot at  his grave for the sole reason that he had dared to bury a  Georgian. 60-year-old M. Shonia, who was being sheltered in a  neighbor's apartment, was killed with similar cruelty, as were  68- year old N. Mirtskhulava, and the couple V. and A.  Kvaratskhelidze and V. Arghvliani.    According to information acquired in the course of the  investigation, people of Georgian nationality were shot  individually and in groups. I repeat that it is possible to  present a multitude of analogous facts. A description of the  tragedy played out in Gali rayon and the facts about the  slaughter there could become the subject of a separate long  discussion.    The investigation into the circumstances surrounding the  brutal murder of Jiuli Shartava, chairman of the Abkhazian  Council of Ministers, and his associates is continuing.  According to additional materials received by the  investigation, it is patently clear that, following the capture  of Giuli Shartava and his associates in Sukhumi, Abkhazian  separatists tortured them to death with particular cruelty.  Before being killed, they were violently tortured, which has  been clearly corroborated by forensic examination; additional  testimony was provided by witnesses and other evidence. It is  confirmed beyond a doubt that the murder of J. Shartava,  employees of the Abkhazian Cabinet of Ministers, and other  persons was sanctioned by those who provoked the armed conflict  against the Georgian state and its people, which subsequently  took the form of large-scale military operations.    [SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA editorial note] During the course of  the investigation, a clear picture is emerging of the identity  of those persons who, on the instructions of the Abkhazian  separatists, carried out the genocide of the peaceful  population. The materials that have been gathered show that the  tragedy played out in Abkhazia is a crime against humanity and,  therefore, as Anzor Baluashvili, the republic's deputy  procurator general, stated, those who participated in this crime  should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.</p>

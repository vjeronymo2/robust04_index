			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Tories blame the victims Sir, Many thanks to Joe Rogaly ('The patter of tiny ideas', October 12). In these difficult times, we should ensure we fulfil our obligations to the least fortunate in our society. In fact, the opposite is happening. Scapegoats are required and the least fortunate, who are unable to defend themselves, are being blamed. It is sickening to see the Conservative party exploit these prejudices to boost its popularity, and to do so in the name of the 'moral majority'. Let us focus on the real issues: if the British economy were successful, there would be fewer needy people and it would be easy to meet the cost of providing for them. Alice Jolly 16 rue des Minimes, Brussels 1000, Belgium</p>

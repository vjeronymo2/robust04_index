			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / China opens up jobs to competition CHINA has begun throwing open its top bureaucratic jobs to competition as part of an overall reform of what the Chinese call their 'cadre employment system'. The State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, an important government 'think tank', is seeking applications for the position of director of one of its affiliated research institutes. This is the first time a central government agency has sought to fill the director's position by open examination, according to the China Business Times newspaper. More and more senior cadres will be selected through public examination and competition, instead of appointment from higher authorities, the paper reported. Applicants for the research institute job will be required to take a written exam and undergo an oral test before qualifying for a one-year probation. Appointments to senior jobs in a sprawling and opaque bureaucracy have generally relied on a system of patronage and 'back door' deals rather than merit. China recently announced that it would reduce its 10m-strong bureaucracy by about 25 per cent. It has also begun streamlining its bureaucratic superstructure, getting rid of a number of specialised departments and 'ad hoc' organisations under the State Council, or cabinet. At the recent National Political Congress, or parliament, ministries, commissions and other organisations under the State Council were cut from 86 to 59 in an effort to deal with problems of duplication.</p>

			<p>USE ONLY  <F P=103> 94S0106A </F> <F P=104>  Paris AIR AND COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE  INTERNATIONAL </F>   Language: <F P=105>French, </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Francois Bigay, Eurocopter president </F> and general manager, by Jean-Pierre Casamayou and Christel  Tardif; place and date not given: "We Are Conducting  Negotiations on the Equivalent of 100 Cougars."]    [Text]    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Does the rapid-fire signing of two  contracts  dealing with 20 Cougar Mk I for Turkey and 17 Cougar Mk II for  the Netherlands mean that the military market is beginning to  pick up again?    [Bigay] With the help of these two contracts, we will  probably regain our share of the market during the years prior  to the Gulf War in 1993. But we cannot draw any conclusions from  that as to the total volume of the military market.    What we can see is that there was first of all a partial  reorientation of the market toward very heavy attack  helicopters, like the Apache. This happened rather  paradoxically, at that, since the frontal threat in the center  of Europe has disappeared and because this is currently  reflected by the switch from highly specialized helicopters  toward more multirole helicopters. That is the way the  development trend is going in Germany between the PAH-2 and the  UHU, which is the German version of the Tigre. A certain number  of countries have procured very heavy and highly sophisticated  helicopters for themselves and they will probably have trouble  getting their money's worth out of them. Our response to that  market obviously is the Tigre. Unfortunately, the latter is  currently not available on the market and we have not been able  to participate in the competitions.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Are you afraid of American competition on  these markets?    [Bigay] It is obvious that the cut in the United States  defense budget persuaded American builders to increase their  export share in an effort to hold on to those sectors in which  they were strong; the export business has not been one of their  priorities so far. The first expression of this American  aggressiveness was the involvement of authorities at a very high  level, much more so than was ever done in the past.    France, more so than other countries in Europe, took some  time to react to that. Today, the various persons in charge in  our respective countries realize that being technically and  financially good was no longer enough to walk away with the big  contracts. From here on in, you have to be able to come up with  financing plans equivalent to those of our competitors and,  above all, you have to show that France has a strong political  interest in getting the contract signed.    French officials are now fully aware that if we stand  together and if we dedicate ourselves to our industry in a  sector where it is competitive and strong, then the chances of  an even fight and victory in the end is within reach.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] You were talking about the French  Government.  But what is the position of the German Government?    [Bigay] The two contracts we just got involve Cougars which  are exported under French law. We have had the unfailing support  of our chief shareholder, that is, Aerospatiale, and it is  entirely normal that we should have the support of the French  authorities. Of course, we have been having a certain amount of  trouble from the German authorities regarding everything that  has to do with armament export policy. But we have so far not  suffered too much as a result of that, of course, to the extent  that we do not have any deal in the final stage that would  involve equipment exported under a German license.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] You are involved in other negotiations  in a  certain number of other countries. What kind of volume do they  represent?    [Bigay] As for realistic business deals, we are currently  conducting negotiations on the equivalent of the 100 Cougars.  And then, of course, there is the British competition over the  supply of 91 attack helicopters, a challenge we took up with a  particular version of the Tigre.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] On that score, you received the British  Defense Minister at Marignane. Did you submit your proposal to  him?    [Bigay] Eurocopter responded to the British bidding  invitation with a model of the Tigre that is very close to the  French antitank version and the German UHU version. As we told  Minister Malcom Rifkind, the broad outlines of our proposal also  point to involvement of British industry (through British  Aerospace) covering the entire service life of the complete  Tigre program. By the way, British industry is already  associated with the Tigre program in a very significant fashion  since it is participating in the design of the MTR 390 motor and  the Trigat missile. In addition to responsibility for specific  equipment to be used in the British version, we entrusted it  with the straightforward production of the aft portion of the  fuselage and the armament fins.    The end of this century is a unique opportunity for putting  in place common and interoperable military resources in Europe.  The current competition is an opportunity for Great Britain to  get back in since it withdrew from the NH-90 when Sikorsky took  out a partnership in Westland. Besides, if it were possible to  arrive at interoperability between the German, French, and  British armies, the costs of the program, especially in the  matter of logistics (basic and advanced training, maintenance,  etc.) would be greatly reduced.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What are the strong points of Tigre as  compared to its competitors?    [Bigay] Generally speaking, looking at our real competitors,  Tigre features a technology that is between 20 and 25 years  younger. All you have to do is to go back 25 years to realize  that the technical evolution is quite considerable here. We are  getting equivalent and even higher performances from a lighter  helicopter as far as antitank weapons systems are concerned.    As for the industry aspect, we went for a long-term policy  with real partnerships, not a short-term solution that, for  example, would be based on licensing. We should view the  European alliances in the form of a partnership and not in the  subcontracting format. We tried to get the best combined effort  and we think that this association with British Aerospace is one  of the best we could put together to the extent that we  supplement each other. We have competence in helicopters,  British Aerospace is competent in handling big orders, in  managing systems, and in the processing of important business  deals in logistic terms with the Ministry of Defense.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] The British specifications mention  industrial  production in 1998, whereas the Tigre program looks to 1999...    [Bigay] Mr. Francois Leotard answered that question and  assured us that the Tigre program would be continued without  delay and that France was prepared to go for industrial  production by the date necessary to meet the British demand.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What about the Netherlands' project to  procure  attack helicopters?    [Bigay] The competition has not been started as yet. When it  does start, Eurocopter will pick up the challenge. In the more  or less well-informed press, I read that they were about to buy  75 Apaches on sale. All I can say on that score right now is  that we were not consulted. I think nevertheless that the  purchase of 75 helicopters will require real and proper  consultation.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Do you think that the NH-90 program  which was  recently attacked in a parliamentary report is threatened?    [Bigay] The '94 budget provides the sums of money necessary  to develop the NH-90 program as planned. I do not think that it  is threatened, nor could it be threatened by the new planning  law. One must not forget that this program involves seven  different armies and that we are now in a period where no  European country has the means for developing its own product, a  time when cooperative efforts are necessary to share the burden  of financing new products and, thereafter, to share the  ownership costs. I am confident that if the program were to be  examined once again, we would arrive at the same conclusions as  those that led to its launching. Perhaps, we may nevertheless  have to improve certain points in the decision-making procedure.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What results do you estimate for 1993?    [Bigay] The '93 and '94 results were held down by the lack  of  orders in '92 and at the start of this year. The business we  picked up in '93 will add up to a business volume in '95 and  '96. I estimate that our total business volume will once again  drop 10&percnt; when compared to '92; the operating result will  not be  as good as anticipated, but it will be balanced and the final  result will probably be negative. This is because of the trouble  we are going to run into with our civilian operator customers  who are suffering tremendously as a result of this crisis. Out  of our 30 French operators just a couple of years ago, only half  are still operational today. But if we were to implement  stricter payment terms, then we would be left with only a few.  That, unfortunately, also applies to our foreign clients.    Nevertheless, regardless of the result, it will not have any  serious impact on the company in medium-range terms.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Are you going to continue to cut jobs?  Is the  establishment in La Courneuve threatened?    [Bigay] In 1994, we will have to tackle the situation by  temporary measures without touching our organizational  structure. If we should have to cut our personnel force once  again significantly at Eurocopter France, then the existence of  the two establishments would be in doubt. But that is no longer  the case today.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] DASA [Deutsche Aerospace AG] is being  restructured. Are these measures going to affect Eurocopter  Deutschland?    [Bigay] Eurocopter Deutschland is managed independently of  DASA. As for Airbus production, which was assigned to us, we  have a commitment on the part of DASA stipulating that this  production effort will continue to be handled through ECD  [Eurocopter Germany] until Tigre and NH-90 start coming off the  assembly line.    [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What about your cooperation with the  Russians?    [Bigay] The difficulty with our Russian friends does not  spring from any lack of new ideas. They have what it takes to  build all kinds of helicopters. The difficulty resides in  putting together a viable industrial structure, that is to say,  financing their investments on the basis of series-production  and customer service. As of today, we cannot see any significant  development with our partners. Their technological capacity and  their imagination when it comes to getting into a program cannot  be doubted. They will have cleared a decisive hurdle the moment  they are capable of organizing an industrial helicopter company  with a complete economic cycle.    I cannot see any sense in multiplying our alliances with the  Russians today.  <H5>  17 Cougar Helicopters for the Netherlands </H5>   They finally dropped the other shoe. The Dutch Air Force  (RNLAF) or, more precisely, the future Mobile Brigade of the  Netherlands will be equipped with AS 532 U2 Cougar MkII  helicopters as of 1996. The contract is worth about 1.4 billion  francs [Fr] and calls for the delivery of 17 craft; it was  signed this Friday, 29 Oct 93, by Ton Frinking, secretary of  state for defense of the Netherlands, and Jean-Francois Bigay,  president of Eurocopter. The deliveries will be spread out from  January 1996 until the middle of 1997.    This contract includes a big industrial cooperation program  accounting for 120&percnt; of the sales figure. These  compensations  will be spread out over 12 years and will, in particular, relate  to the involvement of Dutch industry in the manufacture of  Cougar, in the development of elements intended for the Tigre,  EC 120, and EC 135 programs, but also a boost in Dutch  participation in the NH-90 program (currently handled to the  extent of 26.9&percnt; by Agusta, 24&percnt; by ECD,  42.4&percnt; by ECF  [Eurocopter France], and 6.7&percnt; by Fokker). Beyond these  helicopter activities, the program also calls for technology  transfers, subcontracting, and miscellaneous aeronautical  purchases, plus related high-tech activities (cars, shipping,  chemistry, etc.).</p>

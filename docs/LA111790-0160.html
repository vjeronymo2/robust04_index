			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARINES RAM, JAM AND RE-UP 850 AT PENDLETON;  </P> <P> GULF CRISIS: RESERVISTS ARE INSPECTED, INJECTED AND ELECTED FOR DESERT SHIELD  DUTY. THEY'LL JOIN CORPS' 5TH EXPEDITIONARY BRIGADE.  </P> <P> The largest mobilization of Marine Corps reservists since the Korean War turned  Camp Pendleton into a fast-paced "ram and jam" processing center Thursday and  Friday, when 850 called-up Marines were inspected, injected and instructed.  </P> <P> It took each Marine from 20 units throughout the United States, including  Orange and San Diego counties, about 45 head-spinning minutes to get ushered  into active duty, beefing up Camp Pendleton's 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade  bound soon for Operation Desert Shield.  </P> <P> They arrived Thursday, and by the end of Friday, all reservists had been  checked in, gotten medical screening -- including a test for the HIV virus that  causes AIDS -- were issued new identification cards and dog tags, and had made  legal and financial arrangements for their deployment.  </P> <P> "Every Marine who shows up here feels the emotion," said Brig. Gen. Michael  Neil, who was a San Diego trial lawyer until he was called back to active duty  to temporarily command Camp Pendleton.  </P> <P> "As a reservist, I share it," said Neil, who, as time allows, has been  personally speaking with the arriving Marines. "Based on my conversations with  young Marines and senior Marines, they are highly motivated and ready to go.  That's not just talk on my part."  </P> <P> It has been an abrupt departure from civilian life, and the reservists who went  through what Lt. Col. Ray Blum dubbed "ram and jam" mobilization processing,  expressed some common sentiments.  </P> <P> There is trepidation about leaving their jobs for an uncertain period, cautious  confidence the United States will prevail against Iraq and the Marines patented  esprit de corps.  </P> <P> "It was a bit of a shock when they called me at 2 in the morning and told me  I've been activated," said 21-year-old Corp. RicSutton, a policeman in  Chesapeake, Vt.  </P> <P> "I'm a little apprehensive about leaving my job back home, but everybody is,"  said Sutton, who, with a week's notice, is preparing to serve on an amphibious  assault vehicle.  </P> <P> Not knowing whether the Middle East confrontation will burst into war, many  reservists are concentrating on their orders and trying not to fret about  combat that might never come.  </P> <P> Sgt. John Haymon, 25, a computer specialist from Norfolk, Va., said, "I left  politics behind" when he was called up, and hopes his emergency military  service "is going to be a plus for my career."  </P> <P> He's not wringing his hands over the crisis, preferring to believe it will be  resolved without any killing, so he dreams about the good times he will have  when it is all over.  </P> <P> "When I get back, I'm going to buy an old Winnebago and travel America," Haymon  said during a brief stop between processing stations.  </P> <P> Other Marines, especially those who have left families behind, revealed some  tensions, but hastened to add that as Marines they have lived with the  knowledge they could be deployed some day.  </P> <P> "My wife, she's not entirely happy, but she's known this could happen," said  Staff Sgt. Eugene Franklin, 30, a factory supervisor from Virginia. "I really  don't worry about (deployment). I'm going to wait and see. I'd prefer not to  have somebody shooting at me, and I hope they can settle it peacefully."  </P> <P> At least, he offered good-naturedly, the Middle East desert bakes in dry heat,  not the damp humidity he simmers through in Virginia.  </P> <P> The reservists were allowed to be briefly interviewed as they shuffled among  the rows of uninviting, World War II Quonset huts with peeling paint and no  charm of antiquity. Reporters were barred from talking to the Marines while  they were inside being processed.  </P> <P> Blum, the executive officer of the mobilization processing center, said the 850  reservists all were males from reserve combat units who will join the  amphibious assault brigade.  </P> <P> They are among the 1,144 Marine reservists summoned to active duty, the largest  reserve call-up since the Korean War 40 years ago, according to Blum. So far,  it's believed that about 90,000 Marines, nearly half of the entire corps, are  stationed in the Middle East or are going there.  </P> <P> Blum said the 5th Brigade will ship out soon, although the Marine Corps has  declined to give a date. "It will be very quickly," Blum said. Navy sources  have said a fleet of 13 ships loaded with Marines will leave after  Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> Camp Pendleton, Neil said, is the "focal point" of processing the bulk of the  reservists, although some will activated at other bases. It was unclear Friday  whether any additional reservists will arrive at Camp Pendleton.  </P> <P> If being part of the most significant mobilization in decades is a distinction,  most of the reservists didn't show it as they coursed through the Quonset huts.  </P> <P> After being checked in, they received dental screening and medical screening,  receiving shots for influenza, typhoid and tetanus. The Marines took their  inoculations without grimacing, though some of the news reporters and cameramen  winced at the sight and walked away.  </P> <P> Asked whether any Marines had fainted, a corpsman said, "not today, but last  night. . . . " He smiled thinly and said no more.  </P> <P> The reservists were issued traditional metal dog tags to hang around their  necks, and got green active duty identification cards.  </P> <P> Disbursing officials helped them get their financial affairs in order,  including arranging direct deposit of paychecks and assuring them that  dependents could draw from checking accounts.  </P> <P> Legal experts made sure the Marines had completed their wills and left behind  no pressing legal complications.  </P></p>

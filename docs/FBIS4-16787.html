			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok, 20 Apr -- The Commander of the Pacific  Fleet Admiral Georgiy Gurinov has issued an order to post armed  guard at the fleet's water mains and power grids in the garrison  in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy and to stop any attempts of local  authorities to disconnect military installations from these  services. The press center of the Pacific Fleet reports that  this decision has been prompted by a recent warning issued to  commanders of military units stating that their water and power  will be cut off due to the arrears in payments which have now  reached 4.5 billion rubles.    At the sanction of the head of the town administration, an  attempt was undertaken to disconnect water and power from the  headquarters and other units of the Kamchatka flotilla. The  military quickly retaliated by posting armed guards. As a  result, the town authorities are in trouble. To add insult to  injury, an attempt of duty managers to disconnect the supply was  stopped by a preventive gunshot of the guard.</p>

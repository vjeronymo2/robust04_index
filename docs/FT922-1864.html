			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Jobless total climbs to its highest level for five years THE NUMBER of people out of work in the UK climbed to more than 2.7m last month, the highest level for nearly five years. The 21,300 rise in the jobless total in May, which was smaller than most economists had forecast, pushed the unemployment rate to 9.6 per cent. It followed a rise of 42,600 in April. With convincing signs of economic recovery still absent at the end of a week in which a string of economic statistics has been released, the government yesterday pointed to a slowdown in the average rate of increase in unemployment and a drop in the rate of growth of average earnings. There were also some mildly encouraging signs in May's money supply figures, which showed a second successive monthly rise in lending by banks and building societies. Lending by these groups to companies and individuals rose by a seasonally adjusted Pounds 3bn last month, after a Pounds 5.1bn increase in April, according to the Bank of England. Commenting on the unemployment figures Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said: 'The average rate of increase in unemployment in the latest three months is the smallest recorded for any three-month period since the three months to September 1990.' In the three months to May unemployment grew by an average of 23,900 a month compared with 29,400 in the three months to April. The number of people out of work has risen by 70 per cent since unemployment levels started to go up 25 months ago. The Department of Employment's estimate of the trend is for it to continue to grow by between 25,000 and 30,000 a month for the rest of the year. Other Department of Employment figures showed that average earnings growth eased to 7 per cent in the year to April. In spite of falling inflation and rising unemployment throughout the recession, this was the lowest rate of earnings growth for 25 years. It is expected to carry on falling as lower pay settlements in the second half of last year feed through to the index. The slowdown in average earnings growth contributed to a sharp drop in unit wage costs and a rise in productivity in April. Mrs Shephard said the containment of wage costs would help to protect and create jobs. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's emp-loyment spokesman, described the rise in the jobless total as dire. 'It is now clear that the government's pre-election promises of a quick economic recovery have evaporated in the post-election light of day,' he said.

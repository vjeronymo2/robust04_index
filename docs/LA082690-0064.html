			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITH ALL MIDEAST ARMED, CRISIS SITS ATOP POWDERKEG;  </P> <P> WEAPONS: ISRAEL HAS NUCLEAR AND CHEMICAL ARMS, IRAQ HAS CHEMICAL AND  BIOLOGICAL, OTHERS ARE ALSO ARMED -- AND THRESHOLDS FOR ACTION ARE UNKNOWNS.  </P> <P> The key players in this month's Middle East crisis all have weapons of mass  destruction: a blanket term for nuclear, chemical and biological arms that kill  huge amounts of people with impersonal, indiscriminate bluntness. And so, a new  study by two strategic analysts at Britain's Bradford University warns that any  war that develops "could have massive and unpredictable consequences."  </P> <P> Particularly dangerous is the fact that the thresholds, or limits to an army's  tolerance, are unknown. Conventional warfare, using bullets and grenades, would  be bad enough; but what would it take to bring on the mass destruction?  </P> <P> What would prompt Iraq's Saddam Hussein to unleash chemical or biological  weapons in the current confrontation? Where is the threshold at which Israel  would feel it must use a nuclear bomb? Could any level of threat or actual  violence justify use of tactical nuclear weapons -- even a high-radiation,  low-blast neutron bomb -- by the U.S. forces now in the gulf?  </P> <P> These questions have been troubling Israeli policy-makers for years. They do  not confirm publicly that they have a nuclear arsenal, but Western intelligence  analysts believe Israel has more than 100 nuclear bombs of various sizes and  types.  </P> <P> Iraq's obvious willingness to use weapons of mass destruction -- seen in the  poison-gas attacks on Iranian soldiers and Iraqi Kurds suspected of disloyalty  during the Iran-Iraq War -- add an extra dimension to Hussein's grab for glory  this month. Israeli strategists fear that Hussein's ultimate goal goes far  beyond the oil wealth of captured Kuwait or Western-backed Saudi Arabia,  extending all the way to the destruction of the Jewish State.  </P> <P> Israelis are concerned that Saddam might order his army to lob a chemical or  biological shell toward Israel, without regard to a missile's accuracy, simply  to shake up the pot and start a wider war that might unite all Arabs.  </P> <P> In war games and joint analysis of options by Israeli and U.S. experts, they  consider an Iraqi attack on Israel to be a worst-case scenario -- but a  possibility.  </P> <P> The Israelis have been tempted to launch a preemptive strike, especially when  their intelligence agencies report Iraq is only five years away from developing  a nuclear bomb. But they appear to accept that they cannot indefinitely enforce  the so-called Begin Doctrine.  </P> <P> It was in June, 1981, that Prime Minister Menachem Begin sent the Israeli air  force on its then-longest bombing raid: to destroy the nuclear reactor that  France had supplied to Iraq. Begin's nightmares of the Nazi Holocaust prompted  him to declare the enemies of Israel and the Jewish people must never be  allowed to obtain weapons of mass destruction.  </P> <P> Now, however, intelligence reports say the Iraqis have spread their secret  military facilities around the country and "hardened" them underground to make  them less vulnerable to air attack. In addition, Israelis say Hussein sounded  serious in April, when he threatened to destroy half of Israel with chemical  weapons if the "Zionists" dared to attack.  </P> <P> It was startling to hear Hussein confirm that he had these weapons, but Iraqi  officials said they were merely trying to match Israel's military superiority.  Western analysts call chemical and biological arms "the poor man's nuclear  weapon."  </P> <P> If Hussein and other Arabs continue to be convinced that Israel could destroy  them, would that deter war? It was Israel, after all, that introduced nuclear  fears into the Middle East. The world knows Israel has the bomb, despite lack  of official confirmation -- certainly since nuclear technician Mordecai Vanunu  in 1986 gave a British newspaper photographs and a detailed account of the  secret weapons factory under the Dimona atomic reactor in the Negev desert.  </P> <P> In the late 1950s, Israel purchased MD-660 ground-to-ground missiles form  France, and -- standard practice in Israel -- manufactured home-grown versions.  The public debut of one carried Israel's first satellite, Ofek, into orbit on  Sept. 19, 1988. The Israelis had a second, experimental Ofek in orbit from  April to July this year.  </P> <P> Less than three weeks ago came a further, thinly veiled warning to Iraq, when  Israel tested its anti-missile missile for the first time. The Arrow  anti-ballistic system is largely funded by the U.S. Strategic Defense  Initiative program.  </P> <P> In this current crisis, the Israeli public has been told that millions of gas  masks are ready for distribution -- but there is no need because Iraq does not  have chemical warheads and any Iraqi warplane flying toward Israel would be  shot down. To keep morale high, the army has said that Israel's chemical  warfare countermeasures are the best in the world.  </P> <P> The Israelis still believe in maintaining a technological edge over their  enemies. They increasingly put their faith in deterrence, hoping that selective  leaks about Israel's "non-conventional" arsenal will be enough to deter the  Iraqis from starting a war.  </P> <P> Reports from the CIA and Israel's Mossad, however, emphasize Hussein is  determined not to surrender to international pressure and still hopes to have  his own nuclear arms with appropriate means of delivery.  </P> <P> Regardless of how the current crisis resolves itself, whether through diplomacy  or battle, Israel feels it is facing a clock ticking against its interests. The  Israeli people do not want Iraq to have nuclear weapons. No referendum has ever  been taken, however, as to when or how Israel should use nuclear bombs in the  name of self-defense.  </P> <P> The only threat the Israelis can make is the vague, but potent, one: "Iraq will  not be the same Iraq" if Israel is attacked. Specifically, Defense Minister  Moshe Arens has threatened massive attacks by the Israeli air force if Iraq  sends troops westward into Jordan as an implicit move toward Israel.  </P> <P> Science Minister Yuval Neeman went so far as to confirm that Israel could  respond to Iraq's chemical-weapons threat by responding "with the same  merchandise." It was a rare mention of Israeli weapons capabilities -- normally  shrouded in official secrecy and military censorship.  </P> <P> For many years, successive Israeli governments tried to prevent local and  foreign journalists from publishing stories about the development of  non-conventional weapons -- and even conventional ones -- by Israeli scientists  and defense contractors.  </P> <P> Discussion has lately become freer, although on the biggest taboo the  government continues to stick to a well-worn slogan: "Israel will not be the  first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East."  </P> <P> Yet, according to Western intelligence officials and civilian analysts in the  United States and Europe, Israel is no more than a few years away from  developing submarine-launched cruise missiles as a second-strike arsenal. These  could retaliate even if Arab forces managed to hit Israel's nuclear reactor,  ground-to-ground missile sites and air force bases.  </P> <P> Israeli strategists still have not worked out exactly when such weapons would  be used, although analysts believe Israel has an extensive range of nuclear  arms including small, "battlefield" shells.  </P> <P> By the same token, it is impossible to say precisely where the U.S. nuclear  threshold stands in this unique desert mission. If Iraq uses even one  mustard-gas or nerve-gas shell against U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, would  America "nuke" Iraq in revenge? Or only to prevent the GI's in the gulf from  being overrun by a million Iraqi soldiers?  </P> <P> The strategy is not to have a stated strategy; to keep the adversary guessing.  Unfortunately, there is guesswork on both sides. U. S. intelligence is armed  with the best satellite photographs and radar-readings from AWACS  reconnaissance planes, but still cannot read the mind of a dictator. Only  Hussein holds the key to how bad the conflict may get.  </P></p>

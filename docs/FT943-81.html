			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei ahead as Taipei rises 1% to four-year high Tokyo Buying by public pension and insurance funds, as well as investment trusts, lifted Tokyo stocks, and the 225-share Nikkei average extended its recovery with a rise of 107.52 to 19,615.12, agencies report. The market ended off earlier highs after dealers adjusted their positions in the late afternoon. Before that the Nikkei 225 had hit an intraday peak of 19,732.25, up from a low for the session of 19,559.01. Volume declined from 287m shares to 263m. Advances outpaced falls by 647 to 322, with 208 issues unchanged. The Nikkei 300 put on 1.50 at 288.69 and the Topix index of all first section stocks gained 6.68 at 1,576.27. The second section index, which lost 12.00 on Wednesday, rallied 11.20 to 2,230.63. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.86 to 1,294.17. Professionals said the Nikkei 225's failure to break through 19,800, and caution ahead of today's deadline for the Japan-US trade talks, triggered the dealers' adjustments. Many investors doubted that the rise could continue for long. 'Share prices rise only when public funds step into the market to buy. This is an unhealthy market,' said a broker at a second-tier securities house. However, other brokers said buying will continue today, as books are closed at the half-year stage. Public funds, they added, will aim to keep the Nikkei and the Topix above their closing levels on March 31, the annual book closing day for many houses. On March 31 this year the Nikkei 225 ended at 19,111.92 and the Topix at 1,563.21. Among the sectors, steels and electricals saw the major gains, while the key declines were in electric power, railway/bus, non-ferrous metal, real estate and warehousing. Steels enjoyed buying by public funds, Nippon Steel adding Y7 at Y392, Kawasaki Y9 at Y447, NKK Y4 at Y292 and Sumitomo Metal Industries Y7 at Y350. There was some speculation that South Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel Co's output could be affected by an accident at its main plant on Tuesday, although a Posco spokesman said operations were now running completely normal. Electricals reflected the yen's overnight drop against the dollar, prompted by growing optimism among some dealers over the outcome of the US-Japan trade talks. Toshiba put on Y5 at Y753, Mitsubishi Electric Y6 at Y706, NEC Y20 at Y1,200 and Fujitsu Y10 at Y1,050. On the second section, the newly listed Japan Telecom rallied to Y4.01m, after a new low of Y3.95m on Wednesday. Roundup Many of the Pacific Rim markets were under pressure. TAIPEI, however, moved ahead 1.0 per cent to close at a four-year high on demand for financials and lower-priced blue chips by institutions. The weighted index rose 72.03 to 7,101.13 in moderate turnover of TDollars 68.88bn. Financials, rebounding from Tuesday's fall, had ICBC surging TDollars 6 or 6.3 per cent to TDollars 102. SYDNEY was initially unsettled by bond weakness and worse than expected current account data before prices bounced back later in the day, leaving the All Ordinaries index a net 16.4 up at 2,030.6. The banks sub-group index gained 1.1 per cent, while the oil and gas sector advanced 3.6 per cent, mainly due to a strong performance by Woodside Petroleum. Shares in the oil explorer jumped 33 cents or 7.3 per cent to ADollars 4.87 amid speculation that the company would announce positive testing results at its 50 per cent-owned exploration well in the Timor Sea offshore Northern Australia. Broken Hill Proprietary, which holds a 25 per cent stake in the oil well, finished 14 cents stronger at ADollars 19.70. SINGAPORE rose on active foreign buying of blue chips as overseas institutions returned to the market. The Straits Times Industrial index gained 18.21 at 2,348.90 in volume of 310m shares. Sembawang added 60 cents at SDollars 12.10 and Keppel rose 30 cents to SDollars 12.20. MANILA rebounded in a technical rally on the strength of a 2.8 per cent rise in Philippine Long Distance Telephone. The composite index moved up 14.27 to 2,897.96 as PLDT appreciated 40 pesos to 1,460 pesos. HONG KONG finished flat after an early, futures related buying spree ran out of steam. The Hang Seng index closed just 6.72 firmer at 9,700.21 after a high of 9,817.51. Volume improved to HKDollars 3.67bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 2.98bn. Index heavyweights dominated trade, with HSBC unchanged at HKDollars 88 after touching HKDollars 89.25 and Hong Kong Telecom flat at HKDollars 15.70, off a high of HKDollars 15.95. Sino Land, which will join the index in February, climbed 30 cents to HKDollars 9.025 on expectations of a good earnings statement later in the day. SEOUL edged lower as a continued consolidation of blue chips outweighed gains by selective issues with good earnings prospects. The composite index ended 2.24 off at 1,037.55 in volume that dropped to 42.9m shares from the previous day's 53.17m. Analysts noted that institutional investors, whose fiscal year ends in March, had sold heavily over the past two days to book profits before the fiscal half-year finishes at the end of this month. BANGKOK saw selling accelerate as the SET index dipped below the 1,480 support level in morning trade, before prices stabilised. The index picked up from the day's low of 1,473.11 to finish a net 11.55 down at 1,482.12 in turnover of Bt6.7bn. Sitca Finance and Securities fell Bt10 to Bt95 on news that it was not granted a full brokerage licence. KUALA LUMPUR extended losses as profit-taking weighed on prices throughout the day and the composite index slipped 7.15 to 1,133.68, tak-ing the week's decline to date to 36.64. Brokers said they expected further technical selling after the recent strong run-up, adding that sentiment was also dented by continuing rumours of an impending increase in local interest rates. SHANGHAI's A share index dropped 77.90 or 8.3 per cent to 865.33 as investors registered disappointment at the lack of market stimulating news from the Communist Party meeting in Beijing. The index of B shares, available to foreign investors, dipped 0.59 to 81.53. The Shenzhen A index weakened 21.94 or 9.4 per cent to 211.38 and the B index was 2.49 or 2.0 per cent down at 119.89. BOMBAY saw a continuation of selling pressure amid concerns about the spread of plague and its impact on foreign investment, and a fall in India's overseas listed shares. The BSE 30-share index closed 50.19 lower at 4,358.30. WELLINGTON was modestly firmer on improved turnover, with attention remaining on leading stocks, while smaller issues faded into the background. The NZSE-40 Capital index edged forward 3.95 to 2,972.55.</p>

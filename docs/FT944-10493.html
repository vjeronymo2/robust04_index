			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Planning for higher prices Few things better illustrate the benefits of competition than the recent price war in British retailing. The consumer has enjoyed value for money to a far greater extent than in the consumption-led recovery of the 1980s. Retailers who have kept prices under control have been rewarded with higher volumes and sales values. The wider benefit has come from the powerful restraining influence on prices generally. What is the risk that this virtuous circle may break down? Producer price inflation is an obvious potential villain of the piece. Yet the fear here may well be exaggerated. The message from Marks and Spencer, which reported interim profits earlier this week, was that its ability to pass on producer price rises is minimal. Other leading retailers have told much the same story. If they are right, producers who face rising prices for raw materials and imported manufactures may simply confront the same choice as the retailers. Either they raise prices and risk an immediate loss of market share; or they join in the competition and hope that increased volume will offset their lower margins. A more plausible ground for concern lies in the peculiarities of the present disinflationary process. The unexpected price sensitivity of consumers is partly a reflection of recession; also of the stretched state of the personal sector balance sheet after the borrowing binge of the 1980s. Time and the precautionary urge to pay down debt from increased earnings could ultimately lead to a more insouciant consumer attitude towards prices. Yet the most powerful longer-run force threatening the current price discipline probably lies in planning policy. Retail property The present retail price war is to a considerable degree a reflection of oversupply in retail property. This stemmed from a relaxation in the approach to planning consents in the 1980s, particularly in relation to out-of-town shopping centres. Confronted with an unexpectedly liberal environment big retailers were tempted simultaneously to expand. The result was overdevelopment. An excessive number of new outlets contributed significantly to the high degree of price restraint that has marked the economic recovery. Under Environment Secretary John Gummer this period of liberalisation is drawing to a close. Last week he declared that the balance must be tilted away from out-of-town shopping centres back to the town centre. Henceforth the emphasis in planning will be on the revitalisation of town centres, the building of communities and reduced dependence on the motor car. Shopping malls on by-passes are out of favour. Local monopoly Few would quarrel with Mr Gummer's aspiration to enhance the quality of life. But whether his policies will achieve the desired goal is a moot point. The first impact of more restrictive planning will be to reinforce the local monopoly of those out of town retailers who have not yet been subjected to additional competition. It will strengthen the hand of smaller retailers in town who have weak buying power, few economies of scale, high fixed costs and thus a poor capacity to offer discount prices. More generally, a restrictive planning policy will tend to favour the inefficient retailer relative to those better able to deal with competition. Meantime the new emphasis on town centre redevelopment raises longstanding questions about congestion and the ability to provide adequate car parking space. While Mr Gummer insists that 'people want a sensible balance in the siting of shopping centres', the experience of retailers seems to be that people like using their cars. Either way, if this shift in policy does prove to be more restrictive overall, those retailers and property developers now suffering from the consequences of overdevelopment will be cheering in the aisles. Just as George Brown made fortunes for countless property developers with his 1964 ban on office building in London, so Mr Gummer will have provided large windfall gains to those whose planning consents came through both in time and in the right place. We are back to the 1960s - or is it the garden-city-minded 1940s? Either way, the consumer will not be a beneficiary.</p>

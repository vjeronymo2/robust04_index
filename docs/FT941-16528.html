			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Holiday price war goes into third week The overseas holiday price war enters its third week today in spite of widespread expectations in the industry that it would end last Saturday. The two largest travel agents' chains say they intend to continue offering discounts of 11 per cent. Mr Richard Bowden-Doyle, marketing director of Lunn Poly, the largest retail chain, said the 11 per cent discounts would apply to all summer 1994 holidays. The chain would also offer reductions of up to Pounds 200 on winter holidays. Going Places, the second-largest chain, said it would match Lunn Poly's discounts. The price war began after Christmas in an attempt by travel agents to get holidaymakers to book early. An 11 per cent discount is close to the average commission earned by large travel agency chains. All the largest chains said at the start of the post-Christmas price-cutting campaign that the discounts would apply for a limited period only. Many in the industry expected travel agents to abandon the price war last Saturday in favour of price cuts on a smaller range of holidays. But Lunn Poly and Going Places said at the weekend that they had not decided when to end the discounting campaign. One travel industry executive said yesterday: 'It would be stupidity to carry on for ever. If Lunn Poly were to do it for another month, I would expect the rest of the trade to follow them. It wouldn't be a disaster if you look at the year as a whole. If it went into a second month it would be a problem. If you continued on 11 per cent indefinitely it would damage margins.' Although some travel agents said the sales in the first few days after Christmas had been no higher than last year, bookings have now picked up. Mr Bowden-Doyle said Lunn Poly had sold 250,000 holidays since Christmas, an increase of 25 per cent over last year.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBLEMS WITH TAXIS  </P> <P> I can't recall when I've been more upset by a story in your section than the  one written by Belcher, who complained about her taxi ride in New York City. If  ever a story begged for the other side to be told, this was it.  </P> <P> Taxi drivers can be rude in any city, so can taxi passengers. One of my  favorite taxi stories happened in New York City. I was making sales calls in  Manhattan and jumping into a cab to reach each appointment. After one call I  asked the driver to take me to the Pan Am building. He drove abut 50 feet,  turned to me and kindly explained that he could drive ahead, turn left, turn  left again and let me out or I could get out right there as we were right in  front of the Pan Am building. Needless to say, I was embarrassed. The driver  refused to take the payment I offered for the minimum amount that already  appeared on the meter.  </P> <P> My worst taxi experience happened in Los Angeles. After returning home from an  international business trip I jumped into a cab at the airport and asked to be  taken to my home in Torrance. It was about 4:30 p.m. and the San Diego Freeway  was jammed. The driver weaved in and out of the heavy traffic, then sped wildly  along the shoulder of the freeway for several miles. I was so frightened that  as soon as we left the freeway I pointed to a house as my destination. I walked  the few remaining blocks to my home.  </P> <P> Perhaps Belcher had a bad attitude before she entered the cab and the driver  simply reacted?  </P> <P> JEANNE McPHAIL  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

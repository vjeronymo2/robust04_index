			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / IOD urges strike legislation in essential services Legislation to prevent strikes in essential services, rather than simply to limit their duration, has been urged on Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, by the Institute of Directors, Lisa Wood writes. Recently the Confederation of British Industry, which is composed generally of larger companies, suggested that the unions should have to hold 'refresher ballots' of members during long disputes. However, Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director of the IoD, effectively rejected the CBI's approach in a letter to Mr Portillo. 'In our view this would be closing the stable door after the horse had bolted,' he said, adding: 'We believe the situation requires more substantial measures.' He recommended no-strike deals and binding arbitration as part of the rail sell-off process.</p>

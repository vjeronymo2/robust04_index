			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladlas Burbulis] </F>   [Text] Vilnius May 12 TASS -- Lithuanian President Algirdas  Brazauskas denounced attempts made by right-wing forces of the  opposition to hold two new referendums in Lithuania, including a  referendum on early elections to the Lithuanian parliament and  the indexation of depreciated deposits in saving banks.    "I see no grounds for holding these referendums and see no  reason why such acts should be made, all the more so that those  suggesting such a step are guided by their narrow party and  ambitious interests and are again craving for power," Brazauskas  said on Wednesday [11 May] night, speaking on national  television.    Brazauskas said that the party, the Union of Lithuanian  Tautinkov (STL) which has several mandates in parliament and  numbers around 200-300 members, has been collecting signatures  for holding a referendum on early elections to parliament. "The  costly referendum will be to no avail, but saw discord among the  people. This is exactly what the right-wing forces are aiming  at," the Lithuanian president said.    He described the idea of holding a second referendum  demanded  by the Union of the Motherland (Lithuanian conservators) led by  Vitautas Landsbergis and Gyadiminas Vagnorius as "utopia."  According to the Lithuanian president, this party demands  suspending privatisation since it is being carried out in  violation of law, and 100-fold indexation of the deposits in  saving banks made by the Lithuanian population over the past  years.    "At present, 1 billion 30 million litas are in monetary  circulation in Lithuania. If the proposals made by these  "theoreticians" of this party are accepted, around eight billion  litas more will appear on the financial market which will  inevitably cause price increases, hyper-inflation and a  multifold drop in the living standards of the population," the  Lithuanian president said. "It is clear that Lithuanian  conservators have set themselves populist, rather than real  goals," he added.</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Car panel plant sold for Pounds 19m Ogihara, the Japanese maker of pressed steel components for the motor industry, is moving into the European market through the purchase of a plant at Telford, Shropshire. The move is a joint venture with Marubeni, the trading corporation. The companies said in Tokyo yesterday they were paying Y3bn (Pounds 19.2m) for the factory and would take it over on January 1. The plant, employing 86 people, would have closed had they not done so. The Telford factory is owned by Venture Pressings, a joint venture of Jaguar Cars and GKN. It opened in 1990 to make body panels for Jaguar. When Jaguar became part of Ford it gained access to other sources of panels, diminishing the need for the Telford site. Ogihara has been considering setting up a presence in Europe for some years. Its first approach to the Telford authorities came in August 1992. A supplier to motor manufacturers in Japan, it has plants in Michigan, Taiwan and Thailand and an office in Beijing. Japanese motor component makers have been moving to Europe in parallel with the assemblers such as Honda, Nissan and Toyota. Latterly currency movements have made European production of components price competitive with goods produced in Japan. Ogihara will own 51 per cent of its joint venture with Marubeni. The venture starts with capital of Pounds 4.5m. It will continue to supply Jaguar with limited quantities of panels. Telford Development Agency, which seeks inward investment for the town, said yesterday it expected Ogihara to expand production soon and to diversify. Jobs at the plant could rise to more than 150.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Malkov, director of the Sibrokko </F> insurance company, by N. Antipina; place and date not given;  under the rubric "Express-Interview": "Creeping `Intervention?'"]    [Text] There have been reports in the mass media that  foreign insurance companies are quietly penetrating the Russian  market, which causes concern among domestic insurers. Are these  reports true, and what does this sort of "intervention" hold for  Russia? I brought these questions to Aleksandr Ivanovich Malkov,  director of the Sibrokko insurance company.    [Malkov] I have personally talked to representatives of  foreign insurance companies which came to Novosibirsk to conduct  a seminar. In particular, with representatives of the Austrian  company Grave. Under the guise of seminars they look for clients  who may easily fall for dollar-wrapped promises. Having  purchased an insurance policy in a foreign company, the client  acquires the right to distribute the insurance policy, bringing  in new clients... Foreign companies, working illegally in our  market, are counting on the president signing a decree  permitting them to do this.    [Antipina] What consequences may the penetration of  insurance  market by foreign companies have for Russia?    [Malkov] You see, in the West, out of 100 large enterprises,  the controlling share of 25-27 is owned by insurance companies,  because insurance capital is measured by an annual inflow of  money of approximately $1.1 trillion. This capital must be put  to work, of course. So it works, including as enterprise stock.  And, as is known, he who pays the orders... what this enterprise  is to produce.    In our country the dollar is worth more than 1,500 rubles  [R]. An insurance company may sell $1,000 in Novosibirsk, for  instance, and immediately have more than R1.5 million, which it  can then use to purchase a controlling share, for instance, in  one of the major banks. Who will manage this bank? This is  penetration of the national financial economy. The same may be  said about penetration of the industrial economy, because  enterprises are now being privatized...    [Antipina] Can this process be blocked somehow?    [Malkov] We have to watch it; make public every fact of  foreign companies' foray into the Russian insurance market; send  information on it to the insurance oversight agency of the  country where this company came from.    [Antipina] What about our Russian Federal Service for  Oversight of Insurance Activities?    [Malkov] Unfortunately, right now it is legally impotent.  Despite the fact that way back in 1786 the tsarist government  issued an edict forbidding other states from operating  unceremoniously in our own fatherland.    [Antipina] While we are at it, tell us what is special about  your company.    [Malkov] We work exclusively with legal entities. With large  risk factors. We have this ability because our specialists are  highly trained professionally--they have been trained in Italian  insurance companies and also by the Russian Federal Service for  Oversight of Insurance Activities.    We are engaged in a line of work nobody else in Novosibirsk  has touched so far. We are so-called average commissioners. We  sort out situations that occur, for instance, in cargo  transportation: emergencies, theft, robbery... For this work we  have specialists who utilize the full range of Western insurance  companies' techniques.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Following the disintegration of the USSR, the  Foreign Ministry of the new, democratic Russia intended to  establish "good partnership relations with the countries that  had confronted Moscow during the cold war. This looked as  though the Russian Foreign Ministry and its head Andrey Kozyrev  pursued a pro-Western line. This was, however, a policy of  establishing partnership relations with the West in the context  of a new balance of forces in the world," Deputy Foreign  Minister Boris Kolokolov told INTERFAX.    He said that "only through direct contacts with our Western  partners could we prove that Russia was a great power. We had  to establish partnership relations with those who could pose a  danger to us."    Kolokolov, just back from a European tour, said that he had  consulted with heads of foreign mnistries in Austria, Slovakia,  Germany and Switzerland on the Balkan, African and Middle East  situations. He had also discussed these issues with heads of  numerous UN agencies in Geneva.    Kolokolov said that whoever he had conferred with had  welcomed the increased Russian activity in the Balkans and the  Middle East. "This is understandable because in the Yugoslavian  crisis we are in equally good relations with all the warring  parties, the Serbs, Croatians and Moslems," Kolokolov said.</p>

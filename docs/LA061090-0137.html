			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN'S DIVISION I DEBUT AT COLORADO  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge has set its 1990-91 men's basketball schedule, one that  includes 10 games against teams from the Big Sky Conference.  </P> <P> Northridge will begin its first season of competition as an NCAA Division I  independent with three road games in four days.  </P> <P> The Matadors, 12-15 against a Division II schedule last season, will open at  Colorado of the Big Eight Conference on Nov. 23. Northridge will finish its  trip against two NCAA tournament teams -- Colorado State on Nov. 24 and New  Mexico State on Nov. 26.  </P> <P> Northridge will make its home debut Dec. 1 against Northern Arizona, which is  among the seven Big Sky teams on the Matador schedule.  </P> <P> Games at Cal State Long Beach (Dec. 12), at USC (Feb. 4) and at Cal (March 6)  are other contests of note.  </P> <P> A tentative schedule for next season that was included in Northridge's 1989-90  basketball media guide included games against the likes of Dayton, Xavier and  Wyoming. Those schools later removed Northridge from their schedules for a  variety of reasons, Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said. MIKE HISERMAN  </P></p>

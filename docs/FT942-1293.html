			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: New Zealand hopes distribution deals will boost kiwifruit sales - Terry Hall explains the reasons behind a significant change in arrangements for handling exports to Britain and Japan New arrangements with major fruit distributors in Britain and Japan mark a significant change for the New Zealand kiwifruit industry, which in the past adopted a largely 'do it yourself' policy in these countries. The Kiwifruit Marketing Board, the co-operative body that controls all exports of the fruit, last month tied up distribution agreements with Geest in the UK and US group Dole in Japan to handle its fruit sales for the new season. Mr Eric Henry, the chief executive says the development follows last year's restructuring of the board when, under pressure from bankers, the emphasis was on cutting costs and the size of the crop to manageable levels and reducing debts. This followed the devastating NZDollars 90m loss suffered in the 1992-93 season. Pessimists were predicting the demise of the New Zealand kiwifruit industry at the start of last season, arguing that it was internationally uncompetitive. However despite another difficult year in Europe and Japan, Mr Henry says the industry has outperformed its New Zealand fresh fruit rivals 'in terms of price, volume and grower returns'.' Total grower returns rose by NZDollars 108.3m to NZDollars 292.5m (Pounds 113m) in the year to December 31. Sales were up sharply, with the board selling 49.2m trays, or 89 per cent of the crop. It would have sold more had climatic conditions been better. For an unknown biological reason New Zealand grown kiwifruit did not keep as well as usual last season forcing the dumping of a substantial quantity in the closing stages of the season. Mr Henry says that this condition could occur again this year, which is why the board is trying to sell as much fruit as possible in the opening months of the season. 'This makes sense,' he explains. 'You get the highest returns then. After that costs start to climb for fruit in storage, competition increases and condition can deteriorate.' The appointment of Geest as the board's exclusive UK agent is an effort to boost sales there sharply. Mr Henry, who is just back from Europe, says UK sales of New Zealand kiwifruit are significantly below what they should be. 'Britain has about the same population as Germany,' he says: 'but we sell six times as much there'. One possible reason for the difference, says Mt Henry, is that Germans are more health conscious. 'They appreciate the healthy properties of kiwifruit'. Only 6 per cent of New Zealand kiwifruit shipped to Europe is sold in Britain. Last year the country bought 2m trays, but Mr Henry hopes to triple this in three years. Most of the kiwifruit sold in Britain now comes from Italy, France and Chile. Under the agreement Geest will provide a nationwide wholesale distribution and logistics service. The board will continue direct pricing and marketing policies, and for the first time will appoint a UK manager who will be based at Geest's headquarters. Under the new structure the board will have direct access to the consumer market, giving it the opportunity to respond quickly to seasonal swings and to deliver tailor made promotions to supermarkets. The deal with Dole in Japan is the first such distribution agreement the US company has signed. It is also the first time it has marketed fruit under a label other than its own. Mr Henry says that this is a recognition of the strong image of New Zealand kiwifruit in the Japanese market. Japan, one of New Zealand's most important markets, last year bought nearly Dollars NZ200m worth of New Zealand kiwifruit, which commands a substantial margin in that market. Dole will undertake the storage and direct merchandising, including preparing pre-pack items for supermarkets. With the first shipments of the new season's fruit headed for export markets, Mr Henry says he is optimistic about prospects in most markets, apart from the US, where the anti-dumping order remains in force. Before the order was introduced New Zealand was selling 4m trays there annually, but this season it will attempt to sell only 700,000 trays. 'That market is basically uneconomic,' Mr Henry says. The board will retain a role in the US market in the hope that the eventually the US will lift its open-ended anti-dumping measure.</p>

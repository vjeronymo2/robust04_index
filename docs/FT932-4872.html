			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: Canada Post buys courier stake CANADA POST, a federal crown corporation, has moved aggressively into the private sector, buying 75 per cent of Purolator Courier for CDollars 55m (USDollars 43.3m) to become Canada's biggest courier operator. Mr Georges Clermont, president, has said CP can now offer a full range of services as standard letter mail demand declines in the electronics age. The move prevents CP from being a carrier of last resort and allows it to compete against US courier companies. Control of Purolator was sold by Onex, a Toronto holding company, and a big Ontario pension fund. In the first quarter it became profitable for the first time in four years. Other courier companies have complained CP will have more than 50 per cent of the market for overnight letter and small parcel delivery, estimated to be worth between CDollars 1.5bn and CDollars 2bn annually, and will be in a position to control pricing. However, the federal government said the alternative was the sale of Purolator to a US company. Onex bought Purolator from its US parent in 1987 for CDollars 234m. It will retain a 20 per cent interest.</p>

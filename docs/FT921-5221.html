			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Putting money on the smaller companies - The sector tipped to lead the economic recovery AFTER THREE lean years, investors in smaller companies are about to have their day again. According to Credit Lyonnais Laing, pre-tax profits of smaller companies with market capitalisations of less than Pounds 250m are likely to grow by more than a third this year, twice as quickly as larger companies. The forecast partly reflects the belief that smaller companies, which were the first to fall victim to recession, will be among the first to benefit from the economic recovery now widely forecast for the second half of the year. Yet Credit Lyonnais Laing's forecast, drawn from its 'Behind the Balance Sheet' report on 54 smaller companies, is only the latest indicator that the sector is back in vogue. In January, Lloyds and Scottish Amicable launched investment trusts to cover smaller companies. Clerical Medical, which since early 1991 has been reducing its weighting of FT-SE 100 stocks in its top performing Pedigree growth fund, followed with a unit trust for those seeking an undiluted vehicle for investment in smaller companies. And a smaller companies show at the Barbican hosted recently by Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank, was enthusiastically attended by more than 90 fund managers. If smaller companies are indeed to enjoy a renaissance, it would restore a pre-1989 relationship between the larger and the smaller sectors; for six years before the recession set in, the FT-A All-Share Index outperformed the FT-SE 100 Index, a pattern that has since been reversed. Mr Nigel Savage, manager of Govett UK smaller companies unit trust, believes the indices are about to revert to their old relationship. Yet the renewed enthusiasm for the smallest companies may be premature, not just because recovery is still only around the corner and not upon us. Investor attention does appear to be shifting away from the FT-SE 100 stocks but it may focus next on the Tootsies, the second hundred largest stocks by market capitalisation companies valued between Pounds 290m and Pounds 1.4bn. 'We think that the next wave of enthusiasm will be the quality second line stocks,' says Mr Savage. 'The real tiddlers, with market capitalisation of less than Pounds 50m, will have to wait until further down the economic cycle.' There may also be qualitative differences between any smaller company upturn this time and the surge of interest in the later stages of the 1980's bull market. 'On the back of the 1980's boom the small company sector got over-hyped and over-bought and dragged in a lot of rubbish,' says Mr Peter Searight, the fund manager building Clerical Medical's new unit trust. 'Those were the days,' says another fund manager, 'All sorts of strange investments were made and they still went up.' In the more austere, debt conscious 1990s, fund managers say they will have a much keener eye on stock selection. 'What people will be looking for is strong balance sheets, strong market share and strong management,' says Mr Savage. This alone may delay a return of buoyancy to the smaller market sector. By definition, many smaller companies may be constrained in one or all of these areas. In another equally important area, smaller companies will also emerge from this recession carrying an additional burden. Commercial banks, burned by their late 1980s lending binge, are widely expected to be reluctant to provide the working capital and longer term debt many companies will need to take advantage of the recovery. Furthermore, the smaller companies' share prices may have been languishing for so long that raising development funds through the capital markets may be either unattractive or impossible. Recovery may, therefore, come only to the stronger companies, making fund managers far more selective and less inclined to buy the sector wholesale. Analysts can call on a raft of tools with which to help fund managers select, such as Credit Lyonnais Laing's analysis of 54 more attractive smaller companies. This attempts to arrive at a better measure of a company's 'financial flexibility' to finance proposed growth by using analysts' forecasts to predict future free cash flow generation and its impact on gearing. The company argues that conventional cash flow calculations - post-tax profit plus gross depreciation less net dividends - only reflect the past and have limited value when trying to understand a company's prospects. But many analysts say that far more important than any technical analysis, is an assessment of the quality of management. For smaller companies this is doubly the case; technical analysis is most valuable in warning a fund manager which managements not to bother to visit.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA FE VIEWPOINT  </P> <P> I wonder if there is room for an opposing view on Jerry Hulse's Santa Fe in the  June 3 Travel Section?  </P> <P> My husband and I finally succumbed to the annual hype on Santa Fe and Taos, and  last month we spent a week there wondering what all the hoopla was about.  </P> <P> Santa Fe is the Tijuana of New Mexico. The shops are a boring succession of the  identical merchandise (jewelry, pottery, and the like), with prices on the same  items varying from 20% to 50%. Buyer beware! The "Santa Fe style" wears on one  very quickly, and everything is just too precious and self-conscious (when it  isn't busy being pretentious).  </P> <P> The galleries (including that fraudulent area known as Canyon Road) are filled  with very little talent demanding prices unheard of anywhere in the West.  </P> <P> But before you think we are entirely peevish about New Mexico, I urge all to go  the extra distance to the jewel of a museum in Roswell, and to the Carlsbad  Caverns. And if you are physically able, take the Blue Tour, during which you  walk down 83 stories (on gently and sometimes steeply slanting ramps). The  sights and wonder of it all will knock your socks off. And don't miss the  twilight "Bat Flight."  </P> <P> BEVERLY HARLOWE  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Jure Radic, head of the President's </F> Office, by Hloverka Novak-Srzic; place and date not given:  "Manolic Cannot Harm Us"]    [Text] Dr. Jure Radic talks about the intraparty conflicts  provoked by the "Manolic case" in a calm and relaxed way, so  different from the impression one gets from the media, which  have recently been following almost every HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Community] member in an attempt to learn more than  the short announcements arriving from the closed party sessions  contain. Asked what is happening in the HDZ, Dr. Radic answered  in a nonchalant way, not letting himself be provoked:    [Radic] Nothing special; we are becoming stronger. The HDZ  is undergoing the process of growing from a movement into a  party, which is in accordance with the decision of the Second  General Congress, and this is the time in which it will be  undergoing minor turmoils; not in a destructive sense, but  rather in the way that will result in the HDZ emerging as a real  party; firm, well- connected, a party that is necessary to  Croatia and the Croatian people.    [Novak-Srzic] However, you cannot claim that it is only an  intraparty conflict. Since the issue is the party in power, the  conflicts in it reflect on the overall political life of  Croatia. How come Mesic has remained president of the Chamber of  Representatives and member of the party Presidency despite the  fact that some of his criticism was harsher than that of Manolic  [president of the Chamber of Counties]?    [Radic] It is normal that all the events in the HDZ reflect  on the events in the overall political life of Croatia, as  Croatian politics are actually the HDZ politics. However, we in  the party view the Manolic problem and the Mesic problem  separately. The Manolic problem was on the agenda, certain  decisions were made -- primarily the decision of the party  president through which Manolic was relieved of his party  duties. On the other hand, after a talk with the President  Mesic agreed to observe the party rules. At a certain point he  reacted in the heat of the moment, perhaps unpleasantly provoked  by certain party members, which is normal, human. I firmly  believe that Mesic will observe the party rules. Moreover, he  has promised the president that he would become an active HDZ  member. It is important to point out that Manolic was offered  the same, on several occasions, including one at the Club of  Representatives, but he refused.    [Novak-Srzic] Do you think Manolic can harm the HDZ?    [Radic] He certainly cannot harm the HDZ as a force, as a  party.    [Novak-Srzic] Many say that when Manolic was being relieved  of his high party duties the party went by the rules of the  procedure, but insisted on the urgency of the process when he  was being relieved of his state functions. Some have called it  a Stalinist method, and they believe that the HDZ members in the  Chamber of Counties have done it in a clumsy, even arrogant way.    [Radic] Those who have attempted to portray Manolic's  replacement that way wished it that way, but that is not how it  happened.    [Novak-Srzic] We watched it on TV.    [Radic] Very few people remarked on that program; the  committee has also shown that Mr. Manolic was not right. The  remarks relate to some collection of signatures before the  session....    [Novak-Srzic] There is talk that after the HDZ Presidency  session, during lunch at the president's, someone started the  action of collecting signatures of those in favor of Manolic's  replacement.    [Radic] That is simply not true. After the Presidency  session, a session of the Club of Representatives of the Chamber  of Counties was held, which I attended, and so did Mr. Manolic.  There was a vote on whether he should be relieved of the  position of president of the Chamber of Counties, as he had  already been under party suspension at that time. It was at  that Club session that the decision was made that Mr. Manolic be  relieved of his post, with three votes against. It was at that  meeting, and not before or after lunch, as some have stated for  the papers. Since 36 representatives voted in favor of Manolic  being relieved, the president of the Club of Representatives  said: "All right, now we have to formalize the decision,  collect the signatures." Namely, the request for his  replacement had to be conducted in compliance with the rules of  procedure. It would be biased to say that signatures were being  collected with some other motives.    [Novak-Srzic] Mr. Manolic has announced the founding of a  new party, and said that a great number of HDZ representatives  would go over to his party. Could the HDZ lose the majority in  the parliament, and could there be a parliamentary crisis --  there has even been mention of early elections?    [Radic] It is human to hope. It would be crazy if someone  were to undertake an action believing it would fail. By the  same token, it is allowed that others also make judgments and  present their positions. My personal judgment is that it would  be unrealistic to expect that Mr. Manolic will attract a great  number of HDZ members and question our majority in both  Chambers. There is no danger of a parliamentary crisis, and  thus no reason for early elections. There is a danger of  violent methods being used, which is when you want to be  something by all means, although the majority are against it.  That is violence. Democracy is the rule of the majority. The  individual opposing the majority is not democracy. The HDZ will  insist on democracy being the position of the majority, and we  will insist on the observance of the procedure and the normative  deeds.    In this case the issue was the conflict in interpreting the  procedure. In any law, the last resort is that the act be  interpreted by whoever passed it. If the rules of procedure are  passed by the Chamber of Counties, then they will be interpreted  by the Chamber of Counties. As far as our style is concerned, I  accept the criticism, I agree that not everything was organized  well and that some individuals were not prepared well. However,  that is one of our organizational weaknesses, but also  strengths, since it is from instances such as these that we  learn not to repeat such mistakes.    [Novak-Srzic] What is your comment on Mr. Mesic's  statements about Bolshevist, Communist, Stalinist,  non-democratic actions in the HDZ?    [Radic] I am sure that Mr. Mesic does not believe that.    [Novak-Srzic] After the tragedy in Sesvete [reference to the  explosion at a military warehouse on the outskirts of Zagreb],  which occurred while the changes within the party were taking  place, there appeared the demand for Defense Minister Susak's  resignation.    [Radic] Naturally, I am sorry, as is any person when a  tragedy occurs. We must all do everything to relieve the  consequences of the tragedy, but we must make even more effort  to prevent the possibility of similar accidents happening, or at  least to reduce it to the lowest possible level. All these  committees, from the president's to the parliament one, will do  everything to learn the truth about the causes of the accident.  We are, in a way, still at war, and thank God there have not  been more such events and tragedies. As far as the demand for  investigating the liability of any member of the government is  concerned, it is a normal procedural possibility of the Croatian  parliament. Not only does the parliament have the right to do  so, but it is obliged to, but it is also obliged, as is any  group, to demand a resignation on the basis of arguments. I  think that the Croatian parliament has done well by deciding  that there be an investigation into the real causes and possible  culprits. You know what the church says: You can sin by  thought, word, deed, and omission.    [Novak-Srzic] However, there are also moral reasons for  insisting on Minister Susak's resignation, are there not?    [Radic] There is a lot of politics and petty politics in  this, especially now. Remember, the reasons behind the demand  for Susak's resignation are different every day. You can  therefore not not put it all together. Minister Susak will  personally make a maximum effort to determine the causes of the  accident. However, there are some who would like Gojko Susak  not to be defense minister. What if it is established that  there is a possibility that those who want Susak to leave are  responsible? I would not prejudice anything. Let the facts  speak.    [Novak-Srzic] Do you consider the process of the  "transformation" of the HDZ completed, and do you not think that  the issue is in fact the postponement of disunion?    [Radic] I do not consider this process finished. I believe  that the process of the HDZ growing from a movement into a party  will last several years. It is impossible to achieve that in  one moment, with one act, or one decree. It is a process. It  is a normal sequence of events in which the HDZ will calmly, as  well as in turmoil, as that is also part of life, carry out its  transformation -- not for its own sake, but for the sake of  Croatia.    [Novak-Srzic] Who will be dropped in the process?    [Radic] Those who do not accept the program and statute of  the HDZ. All the members have been able to participate in the  creation of each act and the overall policy of the HDZ, but when  the majority -- and I would like to stress that it is the  majority -- adopts something by a democratic procedure, the  others must implement it. We remain a broad enough party to  allow for differences within the program, but not in the  important aspects. We must be recognizable precisely in these  important aspects, and those who are not recognizable in this  way will not stay. We are open to former communists, but not to  those who are still communists.    [Novak-Srzic] Ivic Pasalic has recently stated in an  interview that the HDZ was starting the process of  de-communization. What could that mean?    [Radic] There is something there. There are remnants of the  communist system in our society, and the same holds true for the  HDZ. You can see this danger in other countries that are  leaving the socialist world, but in which Communism is  returning. We are a party that will not allow Communism to  return either among our members or in Croatia as a whole,  because we are the essential political force in Croatia. Our  aim is not to have communist remnants among us. I would like to  emphasize that the issue is not whether someone used to be a  communist, but what they support at present. I must point out  that all this does not indicate the HDZ is turning right; we  remain firmly in the center.    [Novak-Srzic] You have mentioned remnants of the communist  society. Is it possible that the apartments that some high  state officials, members of the HDZ, have been given, as was the  case with Mr. Mudrinic [minister of transport and  communications], could also be a remnant of the privileges  following the pattern from the past?    [Radic] Personally, I have and will always be against people  having privileges, especially illegal, only because they are in  politics. The party must work hard on that, and it must clarify  things with those who support it. However, we often tend to  grasp individual cases that we then transfer to the entire  system. I am in favor of changing the system by not allowing  such omissions. I have not been informed of this specific case,  so I cannot tell you anything about it.    [Novak-Srzic] Do you have a state-owned apartment?    [Radic] No, I bought my apartment before I entered politics.</p>

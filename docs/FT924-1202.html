			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Rebel-turned-insider wins Korean poll MR KIM Young-sam of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) last night became the first civilian president to be elected in South Korea in more than three decades. With 93 per cent of votes counted, Mr Kim had 42 per cent of the ballot, against 34 per cent for Mr Kim Dae-jung of the main opposition Democratic Party. Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the Hyundai industrial group, got 16 per cent. Counting of the 24m votes was slow because officials used schoolgirls and bank clerks to tally votes with abacuses, instead of relying on computers, to avoid the charges of electronic fraud that clouded the 1987 presidential election. Voter turnout was 81.8 per cent of South Korea's 29m voters, lower than the 89.2 per cent who voted in the previous presidential poll in 1987 when Mr Roh Tae-woo, a former army general, was selected. Mr Kim Dae-jung announced after the result that he would retire from parliament and political life. Mr Kim Young-sam will be limited to a single five-year term from next February. He stood as an opposition candidate in the 1987 election but joined the ruling party in 1990. He had been the front-runner since candidates were nominated last spring. But his campaign was thrown on the defensive in recent weeks by allegations that the government was interfering on his behalf, although it had earlier promised that it would stay neutral to ensure a fair election. Mr Kim's victory appears due to the Koreans' conservative preference for stability, since he represents continuity in government policy. The threat posed by Mr Chung in attracting conservative middle-class voters from Mr Kim proved less serious than had been predicted. Mr Kim recently criticised Mr Chung, alleging that he was trying to 'buy' the election. Mr Kim's political base in the port city of Pusan, in the south-eastern Kyongsang region, also benefited him. Regionalism is highly influential in Korean politics and Kyongsang has produced all of the nation's leaders for the last three decades. There was little to distinguish between Mr Kim and his main opponents, as all have centrist policies, including proposals to deregulate the economy, which has faltered recently. Mr Kim, who will be 65 tomorrow, has never hidden his ambition to become president ever since he was elected as the nation's youngest ever MP at the age of 25 in 1954. He became known for his opposition to the country's military dictatorship, which ruled from 1961 to 1987. He was expelled from the National Assembly in 1979 and banned from political activity in the early 1980s. He almost died from a hunger strike in 1983. He and Mr Kim Dae-jung formed a pro-democracy organisation, but then became bitter rivals after the downfall of the military dictatorship. The two men could not agree on a single candidate to oppose Mr Roh in the 1987 election and they both ran, splitting the opposition vote and ensuring victory for Mr Roh, who took 36.6 per cent of the vote. Mr Kim Young-sam gained 28 per cent in that election and Mr Kim Dae-jung 27.1 per cent. Mr Kim Young-sam decided to merge his party with the government in 1990 after his Reunification Democratic Party was reduced to third place in parliamentary elections in 1988. The move gave the government a parliamentary majority and Mr Kim was promised the ruling party's presidential nomination in return. Mr Kim was criticised for being a political opportunist in joining the government, but he defended the decision by arguing that it broke a legislative stalemate that was harming the country.</p>

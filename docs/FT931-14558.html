			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Why industry giants are angry LARGE industrial power users are angry that the government is considering a deal that would reduce Imperial Chemical Industries' electricity costs. Companies such as British Steel and Blue Circle Cement say they must also be offered cheaper electricity to allow them to compete effectively against Continental counterparts. The largest consumers are arguing that any special deal for ICI's chlor-alkali plant at Runcorn, Cheshire, should also be offered to them. Smaller users are concerned that the prices they pay would increase if the largest groups were allowed to opt out of the electricity spot market. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, is understood to be negotiating a deal for ICI, which has been campaigning for cheaper electricity for its Runcorn plant since the electricity industry was privatised and its power costs for chlorine production increased by 60 per cent. The group has threatened to stop production there, with the loss 7,000 jobs, unless cheap supplies can be secured. British Steel said it 'could not afford not to be included' if new arrangements were introduced for big industrial users of electricity. The company hopes to find out more this week when the Energy Intensive Users Group meets Mr Eggar. British Steel said: 'There is no doubt that we are very much at a disadvantage compared with our principal European competitors. We are paying 30 per cent more than steelmakers in France and the Benelux countries.' United Engineering Steels, the Rotherham-based specialist steels producer owned jointly by British Steel and GKN, reacted positively. Mr Graham Mackenzie, chief executive, said: 'First, we are delighted to see ICI making the breakthrough. Secondly, we want some of this too, please.' Mr Mackenzie said this was the first indication that the government was willing to look at the problems caused for big electricity users by privatisation of the electricity supply industry. But the continuation of the nuclear levy remained a cause for concern. UES said it was one of the UK's top six energy consumers, buying Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m of electricity a year. Mr Mackenzie said the company would talk to PowerGen, its supplier, and the Department of Trade and Industry to see whether a similar arrangement could be made for UES. One question, however, would be whether such an arrangement could cover the peaks and troughs of energy use in electric arc steelmaking, compared with the more steady energy loads in chlorine manufacture. Mr Ian McKenzie, chief executive of Blue Circle Cement, a subsidiary of Blue Circle Industries, said the company was pleased that the government had recognised that very large UK users of electricity were at a disadvantage to industrial competitors in continental Europe which paid substantially less for their electricity. He added that electricity prices paid by Blue Circle in 1987-88 were broadly comparable with those of its European competitors. The group's UK electricity costs had risen by 50 per cent since then while competitors' costs had stood still and had fallen in some cases. Pilkington, the glass manufacturer and middle-sized electricity user, said it was concerned that if concessions were made to very large users, in effect restoring the pre-privatisation subsidy, then middle to large users might pay more because the final cost structure in the industry would not have changed.</p>

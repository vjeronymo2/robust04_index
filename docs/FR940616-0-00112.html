Grantees are closest to the individuals and are in the best position to advise, assist, and admonish scholars on matters related to their work-or-repay requirements. The Secretary believes that administrative costs for these activities are minimal and are not feasible for line itemization. Instead, the Secretary sees these costs as subsumed under grantee indirect costs. The regulations have been written to state clearly that the responsibility for recordkeeping extends until the repayment period has ended for all students provided scholarships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> June 1, 1992, Effective Date for New Work-or-Repay Provisions (&sect;386.34)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A commenter expressed concern that this requirement is being imposed a full five months before the 1992 Amendments to the Rehabilitation Act were even approved. The commenter asked how, if these proposed regulations are in response to the 1992 Amendments, can this date be required since it predates the amendments?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The June 1992 effective date was set retroactively in the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Payback Requirements for Scholars Who Become University Educators (&sect;386.34) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters observed that the proposed regulations do not permit graduate and doctoral level scholarship recipients to meet the work-or-repay provision by teaching at a university unless the university has a formal agreement with the State agency identifying the university as a ``related agency.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The identification of a ``related agency'' derives from the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. Educators whose college or university employer meets the definition of a related agency (&sect;386.4) by providing services to individuals with disabilities under an agreement with a designated State agency and who are employed in the area of specialty for which Federal support for their training was provided will have no problem meeting the requirement. Examples of acceptable arrangements include educators who have agreements to supervise field placements of students in training at State agencies and related agencies, who serve as advisors or consultants to State agencies and related agencies, and who provide direct services through their universities, including the instruction of individuals with disabilities. The key to meeting the work-or-repay requirement through employment in an educational institution is that the institution have an appropriate agreement with the designated State agency and that the scholar work in his or her specialty area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Six-Year Repayment Period (&sect;386.34)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter expressed concern that, after completing a two-year graduate program, a scholar will have only six years for repayment instead of the current ten-year repayment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The time limits are set in the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Work-or-Repay Provisions for Scholars Receiving Federal Benefits (&sect;386.43) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that the deferral of repayment due to disability be modified to exclude circumstances under which the individual achieves Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) earned income status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary does not believe that there is a need to distinguish the repayment status of scholars by the type of disability benefits a scholar may be receiving.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, the language added in &sect;386.1(b)(30) merely incorporates into the regulations a statutory change made by the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals With Disabilities Act Amendments of 1994 to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and does not implement substantive policy. Therefore, the Secretary has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that public comment on the change in the regulations is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Intergovernmental Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79.

Patronage Is a Good Thing, But It Is More Useful  To `Be Friends' With the Army Every Day"]    [Text] The "military program" of the two-day working tour  of Kaliningrad Oblast by Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the  Federation Council of the Russian Federal Assembly, was packed:  On the morning of 10 March he put to sea for four hours on  board the destroyer Nastoychivyy, and after dinner tactical  exercises at the marines' training center lasted until late in  the evening. At a rally marking the Nastoychivyy's return to  Baltiysk, Vladimir Shumeyko voiced satisfaction with the  seamen's training and announced that the Federation Council is  assuming patronage of the destroyer.    According to the seamen, before Shumeyko, none of the  politicians of his rank who had visited Kaliningrad Oblast had  devoted so much time to the social problems of servicemen.  These problems are quite acute: The oblast accounts for 11  percent of the total number of Russian Army servicemen without  apartments, and approximately 8,000 Baltic Fleet officers and  warrant officers are without housing. The local administration  is repaying its housing debts to servicemen only slowly and  unwillingly: Last year the Kaliningrad authorities "gave up"  only...one apartment. At the same time the oblast's  construction capacities are not great, and all hope is pinned on  the Lithuanian firm of "Selma." Vladas Laurinavicius, its  leader, is well known in Kaliningrad. Under a contract he has  pledged to erect the "Severnyy-2" residential district over the  next two years. This means precisely 4,300 apartments. To all  appearances, the Lithuanians will complete construction ahead of  schedule but will not, alas, remove the acuteness of the problem.    Of course, patronage of a destroyer, cruiser, or regiment is  a good thing, but the way out undoubtedly consists in a  clear-cut, comprehensively considered social program for  servicemen in Kaliningrad Oblast. The need for this can also be  felt, however, in other parts of Russia.</p>

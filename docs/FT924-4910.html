			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Arts: Today's Television As usual on Monday nights these days, the notable material all seems to be factual. World In Action shows the first of a two-part report following seven young people in the first year after they have been released from institutional care (8.30 ITV). In her series of Vintners' Tales Jancis Robinson tells of Arabella Woodrow who is responsible for the wine sold by the Co-op. Working from a building beside the Manchester Ship Canal, Dr Woodrow (PhD in biochemistry) orders anything from packets of 100 cases to entire tankers containing enough to fill 3,000 cases (8.30 BBC2). This year's Richard Dimbleby Lecture (10.10 BBC1) is given by Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, whose subject is proposals for change in the judiciary. If you intend to watch any of the programmes in connection with World Aids Day tomorrow it may be as well to remember, given the desperate determination of broadcasters to keep the true figures from the public, that in Britain 94.9 per cent of Aids deaths occur in men and 5.1 per cent in women. Aids Update 92 (10.40 ITV) is much concerned with women.</p>

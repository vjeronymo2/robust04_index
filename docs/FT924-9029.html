			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Markets: Saving the champagne for another day - Wall Street POOR OLD George Bush. Not only did he lose his job this week, but no sooner was he voted out of office than the economic statistics started going the President's way - what will be President Clinton's way, that is. The Republicans have been hammering away for months with the argument that the economy has not been as bad as people think - that the US was in the middle of an unusually slow recovery, not an unusually deep recession. It was a point that made some economic, if not political, sense. There is a certain irony, then, in the fact that the most recent statistics have painted a predominantly positive picture of economic conditions. This week there was a rise in the National Association of Purchasing Management's index of business activity, small but still welcome increases in car and store sales, higher orders for factory-made goods, lower claims for jobless insurance, a lower national unemployment rate and a rise in the number of people on non-farm payrolls. Many of these figures came with significant qualifications, and some were either too old, or too out of line with longer-term trends, to be meaningful. Taken together, however, the figures suggested that the economy is advancing at a solid, if unspectacular rate, and that the foundations for sustained growth in 1993 and 1994 are being laid. This, however, is of absolutely no comfort to (the soon-to-be-ex) President Bush. For his part, president-elect Clinton must feel that his honeymoon period has got off to an early start, although the possibility of a trade war with Europe could give him a few headaches over the coming weeks. The reaction of the stock markets this week to all this - the economic numbers, the election result, the breakdown of the talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - was remarkably restrained. For one, the hoped-for and much-hyped 'Clinton rally' never materialised. On election day, the talk was of a 'win-win' scenario for stocks. If President Bush staged a remarkable recovery and won, the market would break out the champagne. Alternatively, if governor Clinton rode the polls to a landslide victory, there would still be cause for a celebration. After all, the Democrats had promised to stimulate the economy with heavy spending on capital investment and the infrastructure - which could only be good for stocks over the long-term. In spite of what the headlines said about a Clinton landslide, however, the Arkansas governor earned a less than overwhelming endorsement from the electorate. He may have beaten Bush by 202 electoral college votes, but between them, his two opponents attracted the support of 57 per cent of the electorate. More importantly, Ross Perot won the backing of 19 per cent of the voters - which meant that almost one in five strongly believed that tackling the deficit should be the main priority for the new president. As one analyst said on Wednesday: 'If Clinton really listens to the message of the voters, he's going to go very cautiously on the budget deficit.' This realisation that Clinton will have to tread carefully next year, and that the threat of higher interest rates on Treasury bond markets will keep the Democrats' wilder spending ambitions in check, helps explain why the stock market's reaction to the election result was so subdued. What gains there were this week came primarily from individual corporate stories. The news of a Dollars 3.8bn deal between AT &amp; T, the country's largest telecommunications group, and McCaw Cellular Communications, its largest cellular telephone company, delighted the market. Analysts expect both companies to benefit from the link-up, which involves AT&amp;T buying 33 per cent of McCaw, with an option to take voting control at a later date. The deal pushed McCaw shares up more than Dollars 5, or 18.5 per cent, to Dollars 32, and AT&amp;T up Dollars 2 to Dollars 44 7/8 . Tobacco stocks were also in demand this week following the news that the most high-profile lawsuit filed by a smoker against the cigarette industry had collapsed, apparently because the lawyers who have spent years supporting the case felt the cost of continuing had become unacceptably high. Anticipating that other similar lawsuits would also crumble, and hoping that a dark cloud had been lifted from the industry, buyers rushed into tobacco stocks. The biggest beneficiaries were Philip Morris, which rose Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 78 5/8 , American Brands, which rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 43, and Loews, which climbed Dollars 3 5/8 at Dollars 115 1/2. Monday       3262.21 + 35.93 Tuesday      3252.48 -  9.73 Wednesday    3223.04 - 29.44 Thursday     3243.84 + 20.80 Friday       3240.06 -  3.78</p>

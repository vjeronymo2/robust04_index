			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lamont Pounds 5.9m textile expansion Lamont Holdings has acquired Cunningham Johnson for a maximum Pounds 5.92m cash. The price depends on net assets of Cunningham, at completion, exceeding or falling below Pounds 1.82m as determined by accounts. In addition Lamont has paid Pounds 960,000 to purchase, at face value, a loan note obligation of Cunningham. Established in 1986, Cunningham is primarily engaged in the commission printing of furnishing fabrics and operates from two sites near Rochdale, Lancashire. The business is similar to that carried out by Alexander Drew, which was acquired by Lamont in June 1992.</p>

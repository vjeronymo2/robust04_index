			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: COOKING CORNED BEEF THE RIGHT, MODERN WAY  </P> <P> I'm not sure how corned beef came to be the tradition for St. Patrick's Day,  but indeed it is. More corned beef is sold in this country the week before and  after St. Patrick's Day than the other 50 weeks of the year put together. It's  not, according to the Irish Consulate in San Francisco, such a big deal in  Ireland, but it sure is here in America.  </P> <P> The corned beef that we find in today's supermarket is a different breed of cut  than its ancestors that, incidentally, go way back to the beginning of man's  preservation of meat, long before they even knew about corn. "Corning" is  simply the preservation of beef by the use of salt.  </P> <P> According to P. Thomas Ziegler, writing in his book "The Meat We Eat":  "Lexicographers explain the origin of the word by referring to the 16th Century  when the word corn was synonymous with the word grain. At that time,  manufacturers of gunpowder used the word 'corning' to indicate that their  product had been spread out and allowed to dry in single grains. The term  corned was later applied to the process of curing beef by sprinkling it with  grains of salt." Lots of salt.  </P> <P> One old recipe book I inherited instructs: "Put a layer of salt over the bottom  of the barrel, a good quarter of an inch thick. Pack in a layer of meat as  close as you can get, then put on another layer of salt, following that with  another layer of meat; repeat until the meat and the salt have all been packed  in the barrel, care being used to reserve salt enough for a good layer over the  top." That's a lot of salt -- and the corned beef that came out of the barrel  "28 to 40 days later" was indeed salty.  </P> <P> But that was before my time. Modern methods for making corned beef are not  nearly so salty. Most call for salting or pumping the meat with a brine  solution made with both salt and sugar -- but for nowhere near 40 days.  </P> <P> Modern corned beef, the kind that comes in plastic packages at the supermarket,  is a much more mild-mannered product with as good a flavor and far more  nutritional value than its old ancestor, if you cook it right. The stuff they  used to make in the barrel had to be soaked in cold water for an hour or so  before cooking and the water changed at least once during cooking to keep it  from being too salty.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, far too often, mild modern corned beef is cooked according to  recipes handed down from that much saltier time. The corned beef these days  seldom needs even rinsing, let alone a change of water. Check the label, and  unless the instructions tell you to, don't. Rinsing and changing the water only  serves to wash away a lot of goodness both in terms of flavor and nutrition.  There are a lot of nutrients in the juices that are inside the package so try  not to waste them.  </P> <P> Many brands are packed in a plastic that can go right into the pot to be cooked  in their own juices, so be sure to read the label before you open the package.  </P> <P> In any case, do not throw the juices down the drain. You paid for them, they  are a nutritional part of the product and, to a large extent, that's where the  flavor is, so use them. Add them to the water you cook the meat in -- do not  change the water. Then use the same broth to cook vegetables. That way you get  all the good that you can get out of the juices.  </P> <P> Corned beef is one of the meat items that should be purchased in a large  quantity. Like the Thanksgiving turkey or the Christmas roast, always buy a  bigger one than you need because the best part is the leftovers.  </P> <P> If you want something really hot, try Bubble and Squeak or Red Flannel Hash.  </P> <P> BUBBLE AND SQUEAK  </P> <P> Mix together equal parts of leftover cooked potatoes, cabbage and corned beef  all chopped fine. Mash mixture together and fry in small amount of butter until  brown and crisp on both sides. Then stir with fork until crisp exterior is  incorporated as bits within whole. Fry again on both sides until brown. Repeat,  frying and mashing with fork until Bubble and Squeak is full of crispy brown  bits.  </P> <P> The name, it is said, comes from the noise it makes as it cooks. I must always  be doing something wrong for my Bubble and Squeak is always quiet -- delicious  but quiet.  </P> <P> RED FLANNEL HASH  </P> <P> 1/4 pound salt pork, diced  </P> <P> 1 onion, chopped  </P> <P> 2 cups chopped corned beef  </P> <P> 6 boiled potatoes, peeled and chopped  </P> <P> 1/2 cup whipping cream  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Saute salt pork until fat has rendered. Remove browned pork with slotted spoon  and discard 1/2 fat.  </P> <P> Add onion to pan and saute until tender. Add corned beef, potatoes, cream and  salt pork. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  </P> <P> Cook over moderate heat 30 to 40 minutes until bottom of hash is lightly  browned. Makes 4 to 6 servings.  </P></p>

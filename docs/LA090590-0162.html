			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COURT REJECTS BID TO HALT EXHIBIT OF MAPPLETHORPE PHOTOS IN BOSTON  </P> <P> Opponents of the Robert Mapplethorpe photo exhibit lost a bid in court today to  halt the show that they say violates obscenity laws.  </P> <P> Boston Municipal Clerk Magistrate Rosemary Carr denied three complaints that  would have prompted an investigation of the exhibit by the district attorney.  </P> <P> "Personally I wouldn't pay 5 cents" for the pictures, Carr said, but she moved  quickly to deny the request by the American Family Assn.  </P> <P> The group had sought a ruling that the exhibit -- which includes nude photos of  children -- is exploitative, constitutes dissemination of obscene materials and  disseminates matter harmful to minors.  </P> <P> Lesley Pasquini, who filed the complaints against the Institute of Contemporary  Art, said members of her group will discuss their next step. "We're going to  keep making people aware of what's going on and what's being pushed before the  public," she said.  </P> <P> But museum attorney Cassandra Warshowsky said the exhibit is protected.  </P> <P> "There is an exemption in the obscenity statutes for exhibitions in a bona fide  museum, school or library," Warshowsky said. "In addition to that, this exhibit  is fully protected under the Constitution -- the First Amendment."  </P> <P> The Mapplethorpe photos first went on display at the museum five weeks ago.  </P> <P> In Cincinnati, the Contemporary Arts Center and its director were charged with  a misdemeanor count of pandering obscenity for displaying homoerotic pictures  in the exhibit, which also includes portraits and still lifes of flowers.  </P></p>

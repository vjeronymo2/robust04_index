			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Discussion between Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt and </F> Hermann Rappe, chairman of the IG-Chemie Trade Union, moderated  by Norbert Hoefler and Dieter Huenerkoch; place and date not  given: "A Strike Would Be a Disaster"]    [Text] [STERN] Mr. Rexrodt, Mr. Rappe, during the two  hours that we are going to spend here, 150 people will lose  their jobs from a purely statistical point of view. Can you  tell us something about that?    [Rexrodt] I can tell you a lot about that. The Cabinet has  just presented a program to clearly improve the competitiveness  of German companies, because they are the ones that abolish or  create jobs. With a package of 40 to 50 measures the Federal  Government wants to make sure that, for instance, research and  innovation and their transfer into new products are promoted and  that the labor costs of companies are reduced so that new  companies can conquer new markets.    [Rappe] These are measures that have a medium-term effect  and about which we agree in many areas. However, what are you  doing to overcome the current economic crisis? We need a  program so that the horses drink again [as published].    [Rexrodt] The biggest economic development program that has  ever existed in Germany is currently underway -- with new debts  of 70 billion German marks [DM] incurred by the Federal  Government alone and a gigantic transfer of money to the new  laender.    [Rappe] We should make a clear distinction here. The  reconstruction of the new laender is a structural task. What we  need is an additional economic development program amounting to  DM30 to DM40 billion to stimulate demand, also at the cost of  higher debts. This would be compensated for by additional tax  revenues.    [Rexrodt] I think that your demand for even higher new debts  is irresponsible. This would push up interests and prices and  finally strangle the economic development.    [Rappe] Then I do not see how we are going to overcome mass  unemployment.    [Rexrodt] In 1994, we will have a growth of 1 to 1.5  percent. In 1995, at the latest, the rapid improvement of the  international economic development will also have an effect in  our country; at the same time our measures to improve  competitiveness will begin to have an effect.    [Rappe] You know just as well as all economic researchers  that a growth of 1 to 1.5 percent, which is still doubtful  anyway, will not reduce unemployment at all. On the contrary:  The rationalization and technology effect of 2 to 2.5 percent  will make sure that even more jobs will be abolished. This will  change only when the growth rate lies above the technology rate.  However, you can only dream of that.    [Rexrodt] We simply cannot incur any more debts. There is  no way out, Mr. Rappe, we must all tighten our belts. The  ancillary wage costs must be reduced, and wages must be lower in  real terms for a certain time.    [Rappe] But that means that you damage the economic  development even more if the people have less and less money to  spend and those who have enough money do not spend it either,  because they do not know how bad the future will be. In  addition, in almost all companies the benefits that are above  the collective wage agreement are being abolished. All in all  -- including inflation -- this means a loss in purchasing power  of almost 10 percent for 1993-94.    [Rexrodt] I do see the problem that people have less money  to spend, even though I do not see it as being as drastic as you  do. However, we must get through that. This is the only way in  which we can ease the cost burden on the companies so that they  can sell more on the world market again. Then, in 1995, we will  have at least a stabilization of the labor market and,  afterwards, new jobs again. Otherwise, we will ruin our economy.    [STERN] Are you also referring to the imminent strike in the  metal industry?    [Rexrodt] A strike in the metal industry or elsewhere would  be an economic disaster. This would nip the incipient recovery  process in the bud.    [Rappe] If the employers in the chemical industry were to  demand from us the same concessions that are now demanded from  the working people in the metal industry, I, as trade union  chairman, would never sign that. This is unacceptable and  extremely damaging to the national economy because of the  purchasing power. We agree, Mr. Rexrodt, that the cost burden  on the companies must be eased. But there are many other  possibilities to achieve that apart from a one-sided  renunciation of wages. For instance, a reduction of ancillary  wage costs, by, for instance, making self-employed people and  civil servants contribute to the general expenditures for caring  for the labor market, namely by a labor market contribution.  You can also raise the limits for contributions to the social  insurance so as to include those who earn more to a greater  extent. Why have you been blocking that for years?    [Rexrodt] First, there are constitutional difficulties  regarding the civil servants. And, regarding those who earn  more and the self-employed, in such difficult times one must not  ill-treat those in society who perform most.    [Rappe] You could also divide the Federal Employment Office  into a pure insurance for unemployed that is financed by  contributions, and a labor market policy institution.    [Rexrodt] We agree on that. The cost of labor market policy  must be carried by all tax payers. This would clearly reduce  the contributions and thus the ancillary wage costs. The burden  on the companies would be eased.    [Rappe] Why is your government not initiating this? I get  the impression that you are just saying this year, and in  reality you mean to limit yourself to social cut-backs to reduce  ancillary wage costs, which would mean an even greater loss in  purchasing power.    [Rexrodt] Mr. Rappe, this is not true. You hear that I am  thinking about that. I do not want to abolish the social state.  I want to safeguard it by making sure that it can be financed.  However, I also state clearly: Social benefits must not be  taboo nor the roughly 40 percent of the ancillary wage costs  that are regulated by collective agreements.    [Rappe] I am of a completely different opinion in this  respect. Why are we not talking about other possibilities to  reduce costs, about the cumbersome management in the companies,  which is not even able to use the already existing possibilities  of flexible work time? This would improve production costs and  create new jobs. In the chemical industry, for instance, there  is the possibility of part-time wage agreements with half-day  work. Only about 3 percent of the companies use that. This is  miserable. Most wage agreements also provide more flexible  machine-time.    [Rexrodt] I can even add one thing to that. The middle  management echelons, in particular, have ignored the  possibilities for part-time work and flexibility models in an  incredible way. Certain fields of management have not done their  work.    [STERN] Mr. Rexrodt, you also want to create new jobs  through low-wage areas.    [Rexrodt] We have to think about how we can give jobs to  people who are little qualified and would otherwise turn into  long-term recipients of social welfare. Particularly in the  service sector there are innumerable possibilities for that, for  instance in trade, in the transportation sector, and in  gastronomy, but also in private households. If simple work can  be paid for again, it is also in demand. However, for that we  must also find other possibilities for dismissal. After all,  many companies do not hire people, because they cannot get rid  of them again or, if they can, they have to use an expensive  social plan.    [Rappe] That catches my attention. What kind of working  conditions are these supposed to be?    [Rexrodt] The trade unions have to work that out with the  employers, Mr. Rappe.    [Rappe] Dismissals at the whim of the entrepreneur cannot be  achieved with the trade unions. I do not want American  conditions.    [Rexrodt] Neither do I. But if it turns out that a little  qualified person cannot live up to the requirements, it must be  possible for the company to dismiss him again without any major  complications. Otherwise, this is not going to work.    [Rappe] We will not agree to wages below the collective wage  agreement, which sets down the minimum wages.    [Rexrodt] Then you deprive many people of any opportunity  for employment.    [Rappe] No. The Federal Government could, for instance,  provide subsidies to finance work instead of financing  unemployment. Then one can talk about various things.    [Rexrodt] Granting state subsidies for wages would be  absurd. I think the discussion about a second, financially  supported labor market is dangerous, because the people then  settle down there instead of seizing professional opportunities.    [Rappe] I just want to bridge the next four to five years.  How long do we want to watch rising unemployment? I am just as  afraid as you are of a lasting second labor market.    [STERN] In view of millions of unemployed, will the Germans  have to work more or less in the future?    [Rexrodt] The future requires a labor market, which provides  individual people with the opportunity of working very much less  and thus, naturally, also earning less; 10, 20, or 30 hours per  week. However, 40, 50, or 60 hours must also be possible,  depending on how this can be made compatible with the  operational and personal requirement. This will be a completely  flexible labor market. And the conditions for that must be  negotiated by the individuals themselves.    [Rappe] First of all, the people will certainly not,  generally, have to work more. This would just increase  unemployment. And we will quite certainly prevent such a wage  policy wilderness as you propose. What I can imagine, perhaps,  are annual work time contracts. How the work is distributed  over the year remains the business of the parties involved on  site. They must negotiate this in a way that both sides benefit.    [Rexrodt] Mr. Rappe, area wage contracts are outdated, both  regarding wages and work time.    [Rappe] Of course, I also see that, in the future, more and  more company-related elements will play a role. However, the  area wage contract is indispensable as a framework so as to  prevent distortions of competition between the companies and a  wage wilderness. We will never agree to a situation of wage  policy lawlessness, Mr. Rexrodt.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (4): Institutions impose tougher terms - Investors THE institutional investors, whose money funds the venture capital industry, are enjoying their new-found power. After spending much of the 1980s feeling they were being taken for granted, they now find themselves being courted by venture capitalists desperate to raise new funds. Frequently the institutions' response has been to refuse any further money until they have evidence of the venture capitalist's performance. But they have also used the shift in the balance of power to impose tougher terms on the venture funds. Most investors now expect their venture fund managers to jump a performance hurdle before they can earn their carried interest; management fees have come under pressure; and valuation guidelines have been introduced with the prospect of performance measures to follow shortly, (see page four: Painful adjustments to be made). The institutions have established a forum for discussing their concerns about venture capital in the Venture Investors Circle. This was set up in 1987 to give investors a single voice when dealing with the British Venture Capital Association, which speaks for the venture capitalists. The investors' circle now numbers about 25 fund managers who meet quarterly. Increasingly, the institutions are making their own direct investments. Some, like Legal &amp; General, a life assurance company, do all their venture capital investing this way. Others, like Postel Investment Management, which handles Pounds 20bn of investments for four Post Office and BT pension funds, have established direct investment teams as well as continuing to invest through funds. Postel initially took the view that it would be difficult to incorporate a venture capital team in the salary structure of a large institution. But in the past two years it has set up Postel Development Capital to make direct investments. Starting with a rump of unquoted investments transferred from other Postel funds, the four-person team now manages an Pounds 85m portfolio alongside the Pounds 175m which Postel has invested through funds. 'It gives us a different perspective and allows us to get a bigger return on our investments because we don't have to pay the venture capitalist's carried interest (20 per cent of the profit) or his management fee,' says Mr John Brakell, in charge of fund investments. Growing dissatisfaction with the returns delivered by the venture capital industry has meant that even when institutions continue to invest through funds they have become more selective. Postel expects to invest in two UK funds a year compared with half a dozen funds a year in the late 1980s. Having achieved an improvement in the terms under which they invest through funds, the institutions are now seeking to improve the way venture capitalists manage their portfolios. 'It is time for venture fund managers to concentrate on maximising the value of their investments,' comments Mr Rhoddy Swire, chairman of Pantheon Ventures (formerly GT Venture Management) which manages Dollars 450m on behalf of institutions. Pantheon, which selects venture funds for institutions in the manner of the 'gatekeeper' funds common in the US, believes UK venture capitalists prop up investee companies for too long, often pouring in good money after bad. Venture capitalists whose fees depend on the value of assets under management are sometimes reluctant to write down poorly performing companies, he says. This call for more active portfolio management is echoed by Mr John Hustler, venture capital partner at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick: 'Managers should spend more time on the middle-ranking performers in their portfolios instead of concentrating on the high-flyers and the poor performers,' he says. 'They need to be more active in selling and merging companies.' Postel's Mr Brakell believes that UK venture capitalists should emulate their US counterparts in looking more actively for 'exits' from their investments. 'Managers get too attached to their companies and think they can make more profit if they wait a bit longer. They should focus more on achieving a return from their investment.' Many investors take the view that if venture capitalists spent more time improving the performance of their existing portfolios instead of attempting to raise new funds as soon as they were fully invested they would have an easier time raising money at a later date. 'They make a sacred cow of their deal-flow,' says Mr Ray Maxwell of Postel. 'They fear that if they don't have any cash to invest it will dry up. They need to take a pause; deals would return once they raised new funds.' Some of the larger funds must keep raising new money to cover their overhead costs, he notes. At the same time as they are increasing their pressure for better fund performance, institutional investors are also pressing for a uniform method of measuring performance. A start is being made at devising performance measures in the UK and in continental Europe. Ironically, while an early concern of investors was that venture capitalists might be valuing their investments too generously, some now fear that the pendulum has swung too far the other way. Venture capitalists have been so cautious in their valuations that the industry now appears to many outsiders to be performing far worse than it actually is. This is bad news for the venture capitalists who have to report back to their investors and the fund managers who have to report back to their management committees and their trustees. 'We would like a slightly earlier recognition of value in portfolio companies,' says Mr Brakell. 'There was a significant over-reaction to the economic climate in 1991. We are concerned that this will discourage investment completely. We don't seek optimistic valuations, but we want realistic ones.' The British Venture Capital Association is keen to encourage its members to tell investors the difference between their internal valuations and the price achieved when investments are floated or sold. Because internal valuations contain large discounts for illiquidity and no account is taken of the premium which a buyer might be ready to pay for control, they frequently under-state values by a considerable margin. The institutions have made big strides in making the venture capitalists more accountable in recent years. But there is some concern that the measures which have been taken to curb early excesses may now be damaging the soundly managed parts of the industry.</p>

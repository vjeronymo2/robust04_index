			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Fashion: Back to the past at Laura Ashley - Jane Mulvagh reports on the revitalisation of a famous name LAURA ASHLEY, the UK clothing and home furnishings company, is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. The late Mrs Ashley's vision, bringing the rural idyll to the metropolis, touched millions of hearts and emptied just as many wallets. From Tokyo to Paris, my generation remembers the thrill of attending their first party dressed in a sprig-printed dress, looking like a Thomas Hardy heroine. Her clothes appealed to the innocent and to women who dressed for other women and children, not men. They were nurturing rather than predatory creatures. For homes she proposed nostalgic reinterpretations of the squire's country seat, be it the maid's quarters or the chatelaine's drawing-room. By translating these references into updated interior design language, within a few seasons she offered a sense of gracious country living to the humblest home. Her talent was intuitive, anti-scientific and could neither be anticipated by fashion's vagaries nor quantified by market research because she was tapping latent romanticism and nourishing a yearning for wholesome and enduring values. She surrounded herself with genteel girls from the shires and could disseminate her vision - Botany, Femininity and Nostalgia - instinctively. Such feminine instinct attracted big profits. By 1985, with a Pounds 13m profit on sales of Pounds 96.4m, the company was scheduled to be floated when Laura Ashley died following a fall at her home. As there were few British fashion companies with a global market and such international goodwill, the subsequent troubles in the company were witnessed by those who had welcomed and respected her look with widespread concern. Her death is too simplistic a reason for the company's troubles. It stumbled at that notoriously difficult hurdle: passing from a family-owned, cottage industry to a medium-sized, international, vertically integrated, mixed merchandise designer and retailer. Even prior to her death the management structure was unable to cope with global operations. The company had over-expanded, was too highly geared and over-stocked, and manufacturing standards were falling, especially in sizing and fit. It had lost sight of its core customer. By 1989 the banks were threatening to recall loans following losses of Pounds 4.7m on sales of Pounds 296m. The appointment of Dr James Maxmin (ex Volvo and Thorn EMI) as chief executive in 1991 promised a renaissance. Maxmin, reputed to be a risk-taker who favours aggressive action, has already downsized the American arm of Laura Ashley and slashed the staff from 8,000 to 5,400. Under a campaign of 'Simplify, Focus, Act' he has put the requisite managerial systems in place and bolstered morale. He realises that 'this company is only going to appeal to between 3 and 5 per cent of the world's population and we have got to serve them,' instead of trying to sell everything to everybody, like a competetively priced high street brand. He is seeking instead a higher degree of communality between his worldwide markets within a particular price bracket - below the top 15 per cent designer labels and above the lower 60 per cent volume markets. Maxmin acknowledges that insensitive managerial intrusion into the designers' domain led the company astray. For many years the marketing managers, having lost sight of their founder's vision, adopted a Pavlovian autoreaction to the markets - 'if everyone on the high street was selling blue and white polka dots at Pounds 4.99, so must we,' ran the thought. The designers were hobbled by the 'grey suits.' And so, in a symbolic rejection of the past, Maxmin now eschews the wearing of grey suits in the company in favour of casuals - he himself favouring a Richard Branson-style jersey. Some style-watchers are concerned that Maxmin is too steeped in an American marketing culture which sits uneasily within a company selling an elusive notion of the English rural dream. One also wonders why so many of the top managers are not English - surely, one feels, it is harder for them to tune into the innate Englishness that they are marketing. Management aside, a well-run clothing and home furnishings company will go nowhere without design vision. Nick Hawkins, stores analyst at Kleinwort Benson, summed up many City analysts' worries by admitting that he 'has been concerned by the design side, particularly in the garments. It was suffering from a design vacuum. But I do now feel that progress is being made.' Progress takes the form of fashion's changing cycle and the appointment of a new designer. The mode has turned again in Laura Ashley's favour. Besuited, unfeminine power dressing and vulgar embellishments have been eclipsed by soft, feminine and natural-looking dress. More designers are interpreting sentimental notions of environmentalism, ruralism and nostalgia. One only has to look at the recent interpretations of this mood by Ralph Lauren or Byblos to see that they are stealing a march on the Laura Ashley tradition. Though it may seem curmudgeonly to criticise this season's catalogue - 20 per cent hits the mark, the rest is dire - this is certainly a company in transition. The seeds are in place to flower in the spring-summer 1994 collection because, in a timely appointment last month, Maxmin selected Eric Bremner, trained at the Royal College of Art and poached from Maxmara, as chief designer. He has the right credentials. He has a strong affinity with the brand and has worked for a more upmarket label. Bremner showed me his preparatory sketches and sources of inspiration. Swatches of 1930s floral-printed chiffons, voiles and georgettes hung from scrapbook cuttings of Flower Power Hippies, 19th century rustic maids and shreds of Victorian wallpapers peeled by Bremner from a crofter's cottage in the Orkneys. These randomly juxtaposed layers of faded prints at one glance promised the rebirth of a great label. Cleverly Bremner, who realises that prints are the essence of the brand, proposes to introduce fading techniques to the Welsh factories to soften the new range. He also intends to concentrate on the dress as 'the vital part of our selection,' which will surely please many women I have spoken to who found it so hard during the power-dressing 1980s to find feminine dresses. Bremner has a keen sense of what the Laura Ashley core customer appreciates. He talks of femininity, fecundity, comfort and flattering fit and bemoans the cruelty of fashion in the 1980s when so many women felt over exposed and unnatural. As long as Maxmin restores the delicate balance between strong, forward-thinking design and the desires of the loyal customer base he will restore the firm's fortunes. Few labels - although Chanel and Dior come to mind - have survived the death of the original visionary, but so long as the marketing managers do not lose sight of the fact that women buy unsolicited dreams, not last year's market research statistics, under Bremner Laura Ashley has a strong chance of refocusing successfully on its natural market.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> AUSTRIA;  </P> <P> HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS TO GET REPARATIONS  </P> <P> The government of Austria agreed to pay about $25 million in reparations to  Jewish survivors of the World War II Holocaust.  </P> <P> The money will be invested in projects aimed at helping the survivors. The  announcement of the payments marked a sharp shift for Austria, which has  traditionally argued that the country itself was a victim of Nazi aggression.  Some Austrian Jews theorized that the change of heart stems from the  international uproar over the 1986 election of President Kurt Waldheim, who  served in the German army but has denied any complicity in war crimes.  </P></p>

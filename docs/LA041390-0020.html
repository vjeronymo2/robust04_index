			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SANDBERG MAKES MARK IN SPLIT  </P> <P> Ryne Sandberg has won seven Gold Glove awards for his always steady and  sometimes spectacular fielding for the Chicago Cubs.  </P> <P> Sandberg made history Thursday in Chicago, playing in his 92nd and 93rd  consecutive errorless games as the Cubs split a double-header with the  Philadelphia Phillies.  </P> <P> Sandberg eclipsed the record of 91 consecutive errorless games by a second  baseman set by Cincinnati's Joe Morgan in 1977-78. Sandberg had four putouts  and an assist as the Cubs lost the first game, 5-4.  </P> <P> Chicago won the second game, 6-3.  </P> <P> "He's the best second baseman I have ever watched," Chicago Manager Don Zimmer  said of Sandberg.  </P> <P> In the first game, Ricky Jordan drove in three runs for the Phillies and Terry  Mulholland allowed five hits and two runs in 5 2/3 innings to beat the Cubs for  the first time.  </P> <P> Andre Dawson hit a home run in the eighth-inning for the Cubs.  </P> <P> Roger McDowell earned his first save for the Phillies.  </P> <P> In the second game, right-hander Jose Nunez (1-0) pitched five inning to earn  his first NL victory. Nunez was obtained from Toronto during the off-season.  </P> <P> Mitch Williams pitched a perfect ninth inning for his second save.  </P> <P> Doug Dascenzo hit a two-run homer and scored the go-ahead run on a passed ball.  </P> <P> San Francisco 13, Atlanta 4 -- Will Clark drove in three runs with two hits to  pace the Giants' 14-hit attack at Atlanta, and Brett Butler tied a major league  record by drawing five walks.  </P> <P> The record, shared by many, was accomplished last by Atlanta's Dale Murphy on  May 23, 1987, against Chicago.  </P> <P> Butler also had a run-scoring single, scored four runs and stole two bases.  </P> <P> Mike LaCoss gave up five hits and a run in five innings to earn the victory.  Jeff Brantley pitched 3 2/3 hitless innings for his first save.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 6, New York 2 -- Pitcher Neal Heaton picked up where left off last  season, and outfielder Barry Bonds drove in three runs and threw out a runner  at the plate as the Pirates took two of three games in their season-opening  series at New York.  </P> <P> Heaton, who won five of his last six decisions in 1989, allowed an unearned run  and six hits against the Mets.  </P> <P> Bonds had a two-run single in the second inning and a run-scoring double in the  seventh. He threw out Met pitcher Sid Fernandez (0-1), who attempted to score  from second on a second-inning single by Keith Miller.  </P> <P> Gary Redus homered for the Pirates.  </P></p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Belgian justice reforms BELGIUM'S government is rushing through reform of its criminal justice and prison systems following a series of blunders, culminating in the suicide last week of the country's most notorious prisoner. Patrick Haemers was found hanged in his cell on Friday morning. He had been accused of masterminding a series of hold-ups and the kidnapping of former Belgian prime minister Mr Paul Vanden Boeynants. Haemers' trial had already been delayed once for lack of a jury and was undermined a fortnight ago by the armed break-out from a Brussels jail of two of the eight people accused alongside him. Haemers' lawyers claim he killed himself because he was demoralised by the delay in setting up the trial. But the escape has raised fears in Belgium that violent armed gangs may be linking up to support one another. When one of Haemers' associates was recaptured 10 days ago, his supporters machine-gunned the facade of the police station where he was being held overnight and threw grenades through the windows.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Unilever launches cash back scheme in soap war Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, has raised the financial stakes in its continuing 'soap war' with US rival Procter &amp; Gamble by offering hefty rebates to Dutch consumers who buy its new washing powder. For this week only, shoppers in the Netherlands are being offered a Fl 10 (Pounds 3.70) rebate on the normal Fl 16.85 price of a packet of Omo Power. Unilever claims the new powder has revolutionary cleaning power, but P&amp;G says it damages clothes after repeated washings. The rebate scheme is limited to the Netherlands, where Unilever has suffered most heavily from P&amp;G's claims. There are currently no plans to extend the temporary price cuts to Britain, where the powder is sold as Persil Power, or to other European markets. Unilever described the rebate as a normal marketing instrument designed to win customers for a new product. A smaller Fl 3 rebate had been offered on some packets when Omo Power was launched in the Netherlands last April. In early June, Dutch sales of Omo Power were hit hard after P&amp;G's claims first surfaced in a Rotterdam-based newspaper, but a spokesman said yesterday that sales in the Netherlands had picked up again in recent weeks. He declined to say whether sales had recovered to levels seen before the feud, or to give details of how much the rebates were expected to cost Unilever. The company said last week that market share had risen in the UK and France despite the controversy about the new powder. In large newspaper advertisements this week, Dutch consumers who buy Omo Power have been told to send the bar code from the packet to the company, together with an application form printed on the advertisement and a receipt from the supermarket to prove that the powder was purchased this week. The Fl 10, plus the cost of postage, would then be transferred to their bank account. Unilever's advertisements make much of independent tests into the effectiveness of Omo Power, whose composition was adjusted after P&amp;G argued that the powder's manganese-based accelerator could harm clothing. However, Unilever says its product has been a success. 'That's why we want to treat you - to Fl 10,' the advertisements say. Some analysts had expected the unusually public war between the world's two leading soap manufacturers to affect Unilever's second quarter results. However, the company on Friday revealed a better-than-expected rise in profits, with no obvious effect from the row.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Parliament Debates the Economy: Smith scoffs at Major's 'devalued' government IN A scathing attack on the policy failures which had resulted in the forced devaluation of sterling, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, warned that Britain faced relegation to the second division of the European Community. In his parliamentary debut as leader of the opposition - which won enthusiastic acclaim from his party - he branded Mr John Major as the 'devalued prime minister of a devalued government'. Mr Smith was equally scathing about the credibility of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in the wake of the minister's earlier repeated assurances that there was no question of devaluation. The Labour leader recalled that in addition to ruling out any change in the parity of sterling, Mr Lamont had also mocked every possible alternative to Britain's continued membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Mr Smith swept aside protestations from Mr Major that he had failed to appreciate the force of the speculative pressures which triggered devaluation. 'In the course of a few weeks, the one policy with which Mr Major was uniquely, personally associated, the contribution to policies of which he appears to have been most proud, has been blown apart,' Mr Smith said. 'With it has gone forever any claim by the prime minister or the party he leads to economic competence.' The Labour leader likened the prime minister's explanation to that of the seaman in charge of the bridge who complained: 'Along came a wave and overturned the vessel'. The prime minister had to endure sustained ridicule from Labour MPs as Mr Smith quoted a newspaper report - from the month before a 13 per cent devaluation - that it was his (the prime minister's) aim that sterling should replace the D-Mark as the anchor of the exchange rate mechanism. 'The more generous thought it was a case of audacity straining the bounds of credulity, others thought the prime minister had taken leave of his senses,' Mr Smith scoffed. He forecast that the prime minister's failure to deliver the economic recovery which he had promised would follow from a Conservative victory in April's general election would be intensified by a round of public expenditure cuts. Mr Smith claimed that the British people had reached the conclusion that they were governed by 'a prime minister and a government fatally flawed by incredulity and incompetence'. Mr Peter Shore, the Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Stepney and a leading critic of sterling's inclusion in the exchange rate mechanism, said the bad performance of the British economy had inevitably led foreign opinion to the conclusion that sterling's parity had been out of line. Mr Tony Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, who played a leading role in securing the referendum which endorsed Britain's membership of the European Community in 1975, renewed his call for a referendum on the Maastricht treaty. He said the debate had been 'totally unrealistic' because party leaders had not taken account of the anxieties of those who feared unemployment or having their homes repossessed. Mr Benn said he would launch a national petition and introduce a parliamentary bill in his attempt to ensure that the citizens of the UK were given the right to vote for or against the treaty. The bill would include a provision that the referendum result should be binding on parliament. Llanelli MP Mr Denzil Davies said the 'fault lines' which the prime minister had recently discovered in the exchange rate mechanism should have been apparent to him when, as chancellor, he persuaded Mrs Margaret Thatcher to agree to sterling's entry in 1990. Mr Davies, a former Labour Treasury minister, insisted that the ERM had changed a system of fixed and adjustable exchange rates to a quasi-monetary union in January 1987. Shadow chancellor Mr Gordon Brown ridiculed the chancellor's 'no devaluations' statement made outside the Treasury in August in front of the television cameras. He said: 'Forty-five seconds on the Treasury steps cost the Bank of England millions - think of the cost to the country if he had spoken for three minutes or even longer'. Mr Brown predicted that Mr Lamont's loss of credibility would soon bring about his departure from the Treasury. To Labour laughter he told Mr Lamont 'there is no point in setting monetary targets other than in negotiations with publishers about his memoirs'. Both the prime minister and the chancellor had a credibility problem which would have to be paid for by an interest rate premium or in some other way. Challenged by Tory backbenchers to spell out Labour's policy, Mr Brown said there was now a clear difference between the two main parties. Labour's policy was to have 'managed exchange rates,' while the chancellor was unable to say whether he supported managed or floating rates.</p>

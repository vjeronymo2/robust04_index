			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Skiing: Off the piste, Europe's ski slopes turn green - The campaign to preserve Alpine wilderness and the effect it is having on skiers OFF-PISTE skiers in the Alps are an endangered species. Europe's only surviving wilderness, the glaciers and peaks, are being fenced in. Skiers, who thrill to the open spaces and untracked terrain of the high mountains, are being told they are a threat to the environment. In the Swiss resort of Verbier, famed for its hard core off-piste skiing, ugly plastic fences have been erected around the forest under the main telecabines. Fights between forest rangers and rogue skiers whoinsist on getting the light, fluffy powder under the protected trees are routine. The fences replace less obtrusive warning ribbons, which proved inadequate to keep out skiers on days when heavy snow forced closure of the upper lifts, as it often does in Verbier, and the trees promised the only good skiing available on a Pounds 25 per day lift ticket. Verbier is not unique, except for the rapacious price of its lift ticket. All across the Alps, posters with cute little rabbits command a halt to skiing in the forests, an activity which attracts an estimated 10m skiers each year. In most cases the line between a gentle reminder and the force of law is not clear. Helicopter skiing is the environmentalist's biggest bugbear. Helicopter skiing is banned outright in France, on its last legs in Austria and restricted to designated sites in Italy and Switzerland. So sensitive is the issue among the environmentally-aware Swiss, that the national airline, Swissair, even declines to print photographs of helicopters in its inflight magazine. Most skiers are avid outdoors people, and would readily admit that any human endeavour has an impact on the environment. There is also little argument that laissez faire development has sometimes gone too far. Dr Toni Labhart of the Swiss Alpine Club, for example, does not hesitate to describe the chalet sprawl and creeping lift network of Verbier as, 'a cancer growing across the four valleys'. Some resorts have even seized on concern as a marketing point. Switzerland, where winter tourism is a Pounds 4bn business, advises motorists that salt on roads has been reduced out of respect for the environment. (There is no report yet on the accident rate). The Austrian Tourist Office publishes a chart claiming the highest level of ecologically friendly spending in Europe. Out in the clear mountain air swishing through the pristine sparkling snow, holiday skier may well wonder what all the fuss is about. They may accept that skiing in the forest frightens wintering animals, possibly to death, and that ski edges can cut young saplings. But arguments against snowmaking and piste grooming are less clear. nowmaking 'wastes' water and electricity. Bullet-like artificial snow granules, even when not generated by biologically engineered micro-organisms as they are in North America, are much more resistant to spring melt, especially when packed down by snow grooming machines. The grass comes later than 'normal'. Attitudes differ, and many people are indifferent. In the US I watched a professor of ecology cut down a young fir on the ski slope for his Christmas tree. The province of British Columbia politely sacrificed a corner of a wilderness park when the ski area of Blackcomb wanted to expand. 'What's wrong with snowmaking?' was the question every American asked with honest amazement. Most British holidaymakers react with equal astonishment when informed of the standard Swiss practice of switching off car engines at red lights. Inquiries at the Ski Club of Great Britain and the UK headquarters of the World Wildlife Fund revealed no ground swell of public interest in the ecology of holiday venues. To take a skier's view, the most important environmental issue is overpopulation, leading to lift queues. The calculation of how many people can pollute a piste before the snow suffers terminal brownout, is a concept taken seriously in the US. But Lech, in Austria, is the only resort in Europe to shut the tills at the ticket office once the pistes are full. I like the Austrian attitude towards the environment. When I once asked the tourist director of St Anton what his biggest ecological problem was, he frowned and said: 'Swedish vomit'.</p>

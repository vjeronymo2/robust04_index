			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROMANIA AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu, the last hard-line East Bloc Communist  holdout against reforms, was overthrown Friday.  </P> <P> Western leaders hailed the development, and the 12-nation European Community  quickly agreed to provide aid and cooperation.  </P> <P> THE NATION: Population: 23.1 million. Area: 91,699 square miles (slightly  smaller than Oregon.) Capital: Bucharest  </P> <P> ALLIANCES: Although a full member of the Warsaw Pact and Comecon (the Soviet  Bloc economic grouping), Romania traditionally has been considered a maverick  by the West. It maintained ties to China. Ceausescu's regime encouraged a more  relaxed form of socialism than Moscow had approved. Workers, for example, can  invest and acquire share in factory ownership. But political repression has  been extensive.  </P> <P> ECONOMY: Foreign debt was estimated at $2.2 billion in 1988. However, Ceausescu  claimed to have wiped it out after instituting a harsh austerity program and  exporting food to obtain hard currency.  </P> <P> Ceausescu urged better agricultural production to help ease food shortages.  Shoppers line up in streets of Bucharest for meat, cheese, edible oil and  flour. There are also shortages of electric power and fuel.  </P></p>

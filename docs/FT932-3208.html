			<p>930615 FT  15 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Banks lend Pounds 80m to property group LONDON &amp; Cambridge Properties, the privately-owned investment property group based in Dudley, West Midlands, has arranged an Pounds 80m loan from a syndicate of eight banks led by Svenska Handelsbanken of Sweden. Bank financing of property investment on this scale has been rare since the UK market turned down after the increase in values during the 1980s. The equity market has tended to be the main source of funding, through a series of rights issues for companies either strengthening weakened balance sheets or seeking funds for expansion. It is estimated that there are now only 40 banks willing to lend to property companies, compared with 150 during the 1980s. Mr John Davis, managing director of LCP, suggested that while banks were wary of property development, some were willing to lend on well-let investment properties. The LCP loan is for five years.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Giving it all away A silly old baggage, or a fragrant and saintly woman? Deciding which of those descriptions best fitted millionaire author Shirley Conran proved a close call this week, after I had read, in OK] Magazine, that she was shucking off the trappings of wealth and getting back to basics. Who is Shirley Conran? I shall tell you. She used to be married to some designer. Then she wasn't. Instead, she turned to book-writing - mainly bodice-rippers - and made a fortune. 'But happiness for me now,' she told OK] Magazine, 'is the simple things: sunshine, reading, writing, flowers, swimming, being with people I love. I've had my fill of material possessions.' So now she is discarding them. They include a property in New York, another in Monte Carlo, her chateau, her Jag, most of her paintings, two secretaries and Pounds 150,000 worth of jewellery, which she has given to 'five dear people'. To judge from her remarks, she will soon be a more modest and fetching creature than the one displayed, garishly, across six pages of OK] Magazine. One of the photographs shows her in the kitchen of her chateau wearing a peony-coloured robe with matching Yves St Laurent pumps. I believe she is on to something. So impressed am I by her return to basics that I plan to follow her example. Starting today, I shall give away large quantities of furniture, paintings, drawings, watercolours, sculpture, jewels, musical and scientific instruments, books, manuscripts, radios, televisions, clothes, cars, stocks, bonds and financial derivatives. As I told Miss Lee, my executive assistant, the other evening, we only need one Lawrence Alma-Tadema per room. I shall urge the British government to do likewise by reviving John Major's suggestion of a back-to-basics campaign waged by the entire population. John Major is prime minister of Britain. But he is not blessed by luck. He has the authority and the charisma of a paper cup. So when, last year, he suggested that we re-address ourselves to basic values - law and order, hard work, respect for our elders, family life  - it was no surprise that his campaign was overwhelmed, almost at once, by a cascade of scandals and sex frolics from within his own party. But Major had a point, just as Conran has a point. We should get back to basics. Life has become too complicated, thanks to the demented speed with which we are pursuing the scientific and technological revolution. We are over-reaching ourselves. It is monstrous that the western democracies tolerate, within their borders, any form of human wretchedness or hopelessness. Apparently, we cannot yet feed, clothe, house, educate or care for ourselves properly. More astoundingly, while millions of people live below the poverty line, we are spending billions on arcane scientific research. Some weeks ago Steve Jones, who is professor of genetics at the Galton Laboratory of University College, London, told me that he was alarmed at 'the way people blame science and scientists for bad news of all kinds . . . even ostensibly well-educated people hold science accountable for the things it discovers'. My objection is more sophisticated. I am not remotely anti-science. But I sometimes wonder, while sat at home at night, waiting for Miss Lee to finish dusting the Alma-Tademas, why we are spending so many man-hours on scientific exotica when we have not yet scraped together the cash to house and care for ourselves. Why are we bothered, for now, with the origin of the universe? Or with building high-energy accelerators to search for increasingly foppish particles of matter? Or with attempting to understand the mysteries of human consciousness? For 300 years, the number of scientists has doubled every 15 years or so. Things are getting messy. We should declare a 50-year interregnum in scientific programmes that are not directly related to eradicating poverty and hopelessness. While we are about it, we might as well wage war on all causes of crime and disaffection. Make a start today. Along with Shirley Conran, give away your wealth, eliminate excess, cast aside vulgarity - and burn, if you have any, your peony Yves St Laurent pumps. Suddenly you will be feeling a much better woman.</p>

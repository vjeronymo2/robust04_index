			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 13 June (MTI) -- Budapest Police  Headquarters (BRFK) on Monday [13 June] issued further details  about the Saturday dawn (2.40 A.M.) [0040 GMT] explosion at  Budapest's Parliament.    The two Dutch university students stopped by the police near  the spot before the explosion had been at an international  computer science conference, which had ended late at night. The  students decided to do some sightseeing. At around 22.40, they  wanted to take closer photos of the Parliament columns, so they  climbed the fence. That was when police noticed them and asked  for their passports. They were finally allowed to go.    On Sunday [12 June], they were taken in by police to be  questioned about what they had seen on Friday night. They have  been released, having said they did not see anything related to  the explosion.    Police are conducting a major investigation. Latest analysis  suggests the bomb was not detonated remotely, but by a  factory-made timing device, so is unlikely to be the work of an  amateur.</p>

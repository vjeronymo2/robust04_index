			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Interior Minister Nicola Mancino by </F> "fe.ge" in Rome on 23 February: "Interior Minister Considers  Indemnity Unlikely, Urges Excluded Candidates To Trust in Wisdom  of Judiciary and Urges Court of Cassation To be `Flexible';  `Impossible Without Unanimity'; Mancino: `Decree? I Hope  Not'"--first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- "How do you think things are? I am beset  with problems and troubles over this business of the electoral  lists. It is an absolute disaster. It is incredible, you  know...the classic Italian mess." It was 2000 hours [1900 GMT]  and Nicola Mancino really was struggling with innumerable  problems in his office at the Interior Ministry. The telephone  rang continuously, with calls from one "rejected" candidate  after another. Some were furious and railed against the "unfair  law." Others appealed for lenience and spoke -- or, rather,  whispered -- the magic word, indemnity.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Will there be an indemnity, Minister?    [Mancino] I do not know what to tell you. I see that there  is a great deal of talk about it, and that more and more people  are urging the government to act. But if you want my opinion,  this is properly a matter for the Court of Cassation.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you mean that there will be no indemnity?    [Mancino] I did not say that. Let us look at this logically.  What should the nature of this indemnity be? And above all, by  what means should it be introduced?    [LA REPUBBLICA] Well, actually, it is you who should explain  that.    [Mancino] Precisely, and I will explain: I think that the  only way is a government decree. But for this to take place two  preconditions must be met. The first is that such a measure be  accepted unanimously by the conference of parliamentary group  leaders. The second is that the government decide to introduce  an indemnity decree.    [LA REPUBBLICA] So?    [Mancino] So I think it is really unlikely that all the  political forces will be willing to accept the provision. As  for the government's will to intervene, well, I can tell you  that not a single meeting has been convened so far in connection  with the disaster of the candidate lists.    [LA REPUBBLICA] So, if this is the situation, and in view of  the shortage of time, we could say that the indemnity is dead  before it is even born.    [Mancino] As things stand, I would say so. Be that as it  may, for the present I will be sure not to propose a decree.    [LA REPUBBLICA] What, then? What kind of election will this  be? Is it not paradoxical that an election is taking place at a  time when many political forces have been eliminated entirely  from whole areas of the country?    [Mancino] I do not know what to tell you. Be that as it may,  I would not be so pessimistic. The decision lies with the Court  of Cassation, which will certainly decide wisely.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Perhaps but what does "wisely" mean?    [Mancino] It means that I think that it will reach a  flexible  decision. Look, judging from what I know, I can tell you that  there are many different reasons why candidates were rejected.  There are some instances in which I think nothing can be done.  But in others.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Where do you think nothing can be done?    [Mancino] Well, first of all, where there has been outright  dishonesty. There are instances in which signatures were  gathered for one list and then submitted in support of another  list. And of course, there are instances where there was a  shortage in the number of signatures gathered. Here the  candidate or list concerned clearly lacked sufficient strength.  Of course, this may be due to innumerable reasons --  bureaucratic impediments, a late start in gathering  signatures... But I would say that in such instances the Court  of Cassation has no choice but to turn down those lists and  candidates.    [LA REPUBBLICA] In which cases could it be more flexible?    [Mancino] Well, there are instances of real errors due to  negligence, instances of irregularities without any offense  having been committed. To cite a few examples, a couple of  Communist Renewal's candidates in Sicily, where the signatures  submitted were exchanged, though still in support of Communist  Renewal candidates; or the business of the senatorial  constituencies of the Italian Popular Party in Lazio, where the  error was the submission of signatures and candidates on the  old forms, not the new ones; and also, I would say, where the  number of signatures exceeded the ceiling set by the law.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Flexibility also in cases where there were  too many signatures? Do you not think that is going too far?    [Mancino] No, but let us be clear about this. There is one  instance of rejection, affecting the League, in which there are  only a few dozen signatures more than the set maximum. I can  understand the fact that gathering a thousand signatures for a  candidate in a municipality of 2,000 inhabitants is impossible,  is against the law. But in a major city, or in a constituency of  100,000 inhabitants, 50 signatures extra.    [LA REPUBBLICA] But basically the entire business is a  disaster. Be honest: There are parties and candidates here that  are not even acquainted with the new electoral law.    [Mancino] Well, that may perhaps be so. Or perhaps it is  even worse than that -- that is, a confirmation that this is a  country that is still lagging behind. Complex laws, a public  administration that functions badly, and a permanently complex  relationship between the citizens and the administration. Just  as I was saying, a country that is lagging behind.</p>

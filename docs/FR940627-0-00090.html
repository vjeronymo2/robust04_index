			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 20. LECs will be required to make a cost-based showing under the price caps new services test. This showing will enable the Commission to ensure that signalling services are reasonably priced. The Commission will not use the net revenue test in reviewing LEC tariff filings. The Commission stated that this is consistent with its decision to eliminate the net revenue test for new service offerings under price caps. That test is unnecessary, both because of the Commission's requirement that LECs submit cost support for new services, and because LECs clearly lack incentives to underprice signalling services provided to competitive tandem-switching providers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21. The Commission concluded further that LECs must establish new rate elements for CIC and OZZ signalling data as a separate service category within the trunking basket. This category will be subject to an upper pricing band of 2%. The Commission stated that because LECs have no incentive to price signalling services at predatory levels, it saw no need for a lower band and therefore did not impose one. The Commission believes that these measures are necessary to prevent LECs from offsetting increases in the price of signalling information provided to TSPs with price reductions in the LECs' own tandem-switched transport rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22. The Commission found that the co-carrier model does not aptly define the LEC/TSP relationship. It found that even though the Commission has stated in the past that cellular service providers are like co-carriers, it has never held that cellular interconnection charges should be imposed on all LEC customers or on all cellular users, rather than on the providers taking interconnection. Thus, a co-carrier model does not necessarily dictate that the costs unique to providing a joint service should always be directly imposed on the LEC's customers or on all customers of the service in question. The Commission also stated that a cost recovery mechanism that would have all purchasers of switched transport or tandem-switched transport bear the costs of making signalling information available to TSPs, is inappropriate and that instead, TSPs should pay for such costs. The Commission found that this is consistent with its long-held view that costs should be paid by the cost causer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Recovery of Support Flows <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 23. The Commission stated that it appears from the record that there is no need for additional support mechanisms in conjunction with adoption of this Order. The transport interconnection charge is sufficient to protect support flows potentially affected by this decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> ONA Framework <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 24. The Commission concluded that unbundled CIC and OZZ data are not BSEs as defined in its ONA orders and that there is no public policy reason to treat them equivalently. BSEs are ``optional unbundled features .&blank;.&blank;. that an ESP may require or find useful in configuring an enhanced service.'' <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  The Commission found that there has been no showing that the CIC and OZZ data that are the subject of the Order will be used by ESPs to provide enhanced services. Rather, these data will be used by TSPs to provide basic network services. Thus, these data do not fall within the Commission's definition of a BSE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Filing and Review of Open Network Architecture Plans, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  4 FCC Rcd 1, 36 (1988(, 54 FR 3453 (January 24, 1989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 25. The Commission also found that no party demonstrated that it would be in the public interest to treat CIC and OZZ codes as BSEs. The Commission stated that while some parties argued that the four-part test that LECs use in determining whether to offer an ESP-requested BSE should apply, it has relied on similar considerations in assessing the relative costs and benefits of LEC-provided signalling information. The Commission also stated that the ``flagging'' requirements associated with BSEs, under which BOCs must identify BSEs that they intend to use themselves, are irrelevant: There is no dispute that LECs use CIC and OZZ data for tandem-switched transport service. The Commission also found that there would be no added benefit from a pricing standpoint in treating CIC and OZZ data as BSEs, since it has already held that the new services test applies to their initial rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Tariffing and Implementation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 26. The Commission required Tier 1 LECs (except NECA members) to file tariffs, with requisite cost support, for the provision of CIC and OZZ codes within ninety days from publication of this Order in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , to be effective on forty-five days' notice. The Commission found that the record in this proceeding shows that LECs can provide CIC and OZZ codes to third parties from equal access end offices simply by modifying their end office routing tables, without purchasing new end office software and without making other costly and time-consuming modifications. The Commission concluded that under the circumstances, there is no reason why the LECs cannot tariff this offering for all of their equal access end offices within ninety days of publication of this Order in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> LEC Pricing Flexibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 27. The Commission did not grant LECs additional pricing flexibility but stated that it will continue to examine these issues in a broader context in future consideration of pending access reform petitions. The Commission also stated that it has already addressed virtually all of the specific proposals suggested by LECs in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Switched Transport Expanded Interconnection Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> First Transport Reconsideration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Thus, LECs may offer density zone pricing and volume and term discounts under certain conditions. In addition, they may price transport between their tandems and SWCs on a flat-rate basis. The Commission also stated that it had considered and rejected in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Switched Transport Expanded Interconnection Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  various other requests for flexibility. For example, the Commission rejected the suggestion that LECs receive the same pricing flexibility as their competitors, noting that giving LECs too much flexibility could stifle competitive entry and harm customers of less competitive services. The Commission also declined to eliminate service category pricing bands, stating that these bands serve important public policy goals. The Commission found that no party had shown that providing signalling information to TSPs warrants a different outcome. Nor had any party set forth any other specific pricing flexibility request related to providing signalling information. The Commission also found that no party had demonstrated that the availability of signalling information warrants authorization of LEC contract tariffs. The Commission has limited contract carriage to services found to be ``substantially competitive.'' The Commission concluded that while the measures it now takes should permit alternatives to LEC tandem-switched access services to develop, it could not conclude that these services are now subject to substantial competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28. The Commission concluded that for these reasons, it would not to grant LECs additional pricing flexibility in conjunction with its decision to make tandem signalling information available. The Commission stated, however, that this decision is not intended to prejudge broader questions regarding the possible need for access charge reform. The Commission stated that by opening the door to greater competition in the provision of tandem-switched services, it is continuing the process of removing barriers to the development of a more competitive access market in which CAPs and other entities can participate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

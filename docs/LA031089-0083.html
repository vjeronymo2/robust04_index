			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SLOW TO SPEND FEDERAL HOUSING FUNDS, STUDY SAYS  </P> <P> At a time when many Los Angeles public housing projects are mired in slum  conditions, the City Housing Authority has taken up to five years to spend  millions of dollars in federal housing improvement funds, an independent report  has found.  </P> <P> The study by the accounting firm of Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, obtained by  The Times, concluded that the Housing Authority has allowed numerous  contracting delays in processing a total of $35 million in modernization funds  in recent years.  </P> <P> The report said it takes the authority an average of 518 days to hire an  architect and nearly three years to contract engineering work. These delays do  not "reflect the urgency both HUD and (the Housing Authority) acknowledged when  prioritizing and allocating funds to those projects," the report said. The  report, received by board members in January, did not identify causes for the  delays.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley said Thursday that he is aware of the delays and finds them  unacceptable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mayor Sends Letter  </P> <P> The mayor said he sent a letter to the Housing Authority saying: "The  procedures take far too much time. I want them to reduce that time and take  action immediately."  </P> <P> At Bradley's request, the Housing Authority staff is expected to submit a  proposal to trim the contracting period to one year at a board meeting today.  </P> <P> The Housing Authority is in jeopardy of losing future modernization funds if  the delays in contracting procedures continue, said HUD spokesman Scott Reed.  </P> <P> The report, ordered by HUD officials last year, concluded that the Housing  Authority has met a five-year deadline set by the federal government to spend  the money.  </P> <P> But, the report said, the money has been spent too slowly for renovation  projects, given the substandard living conditions in many of the city's 21  housing projects.  </P> <P> The report follows recent disclosures in The Times that the Housing Authority  lost $5 million in improvement funds for the dilapidated Jordan Downs housing  project in Watts last fall after Executive Director Leila Gonzalez-Correa  revealed a controversial plan to sell the project to a private developer. The  Times also reported that Gonzalez-Correa has awarded contracts to her  acquaintances and to political supporters of Bradley without using competitive  bids as required by federal regulations.  </P> <P> Gonzalez-Correa declined to discuss the independent report on Thursday. But in  an interview last month, she conceded that HUD officials are "very, very upset  . . . that the money has not been expended as quickly as they would like. It's  unconscionable to get money and take five years in spending this money when  there are such needs out there," she said. Gonzales-Correa has headed the  agency since October, 1986.  </P> <P> The report confirms complaints by low-income tenants that the Housing Authority  has not fulfilled promises to repair broken-down kitchens, bathrooms, walls,  windows and floors in the city's housing projects, said Charles F. Elsesser, a  Los Angeles Legal Aid Foundation attorney.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complaints From Residents  </P> <P> "We often get complaints from residents about how long it takes to implement  projects," Elsesser said. "The residents are saying that they were promised and  told about these programs and how they were going to happen. Long periods of  time went by and nothing occurred."  </P> <P> Elsesser cited the multimillion-dollar face lift announced in July, 1987, by  Bradley and Gonzalez-Correa for the huge Nickerson Gardens housing project in  Watts. Under the plan, Nickerson Gardens is to be divided into village-like  compounds with their own managers, color schemes, laundry facilities,  playgrounds and additional landscaping and lighting. So far, the 1,064-unit  project has received only a fresh coat of paint and new windows.  </P> <P> Bradley said he learned of the unusual contracting delays recently when he  became involved in a Housing Authority plan to use federal money from HUD's  Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program to erect a security fence  surrounding Jordan Downs. Bradley said Housing Authority officials told him it  would take a year to prepare the fencing project before it could be forwarded  to HUD for approval.  </P> <P> "It took an entire year just to complete the review and recommendations; that  is totally unacceptable to me. They must move much more expeditiously," Bradley  said.  </P> <P> HUD officials notified Gonzalez-Correa in a July 27, 1988, letter that they  were "very concerned" about the Housing Authority's contracting delays. Reed  said that HUD ordered the Housing Authority to use an independent consulting  firm to study the problem.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Commissioners Upset  </P> <P> Gonzalez-Correa did not tell board members she had commissioned the $9,500  report until members were given copies of it at a January board meeting.  Several commissioners became upset because the firm advised board members to  allow Gonzalez-Correa more latitude in administering contracts at a time when  they are seeking stricter controls on her spending activities.  </P> <P> The Times reported last month that the Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells consulting  agreement was one of six contracts that Gonzalez-Correa had awarded without  following federal procurement regulations. Gonzalez-Correa issued the  consulting contract to Deloitte -- which has contributed $3,500 to the Bradley  campaign since 1986 -- "without any evidence" of a competitive bid, the city  attorney's office said in a Jan. 20 letter.  </P> <P> The consultant's report uncovered several deficiencies in the Housing  Authority's contracting procedures but failed to identify the causes, said Gary  Squier, the mayor's liaison to the Housing Authority.  </P> <P> "The potential answer is somebody is sitting on their hands not doing any work  or they are not competent to run a rehabilitation project," Squier said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Frederick M. Muir contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Inner-cities obstacle to council tax: Shortfalls of up to 22% estimated in property values SHORTFALLS OF up to 22 per cent in property valuations for the new council tax, which replaces the poll tax in April, are included in estimates by the Labour-dominated Association of London Authorities. The impact of the lower-than-expected valuations is partly offset by the valuers' discovery of more than 1m more homes than the government had estimated. But, according to the association's provisional results published yesterday, the base for the tax - the total value of homes in England - will still be 1.8 per cent below the value on which the government based its estimated tax rates. Millions of households could be in lower tax bands than estimated and the government appears to have overestimated values most in inner-city areas. The association's figures - based on data from the Department of the Environment - show that only 18 per cent of homes in England have been valued at more than Pounds 88,000 (in tax bands E to H). The government estimated last year that 28 per cent of homes would be worth more than this. More than 67 per cent of homes are worth less than Pounds 68,000 (tax bands A to C), against the government's 1991 estimate of 55 per cent. This overall figure conceals much larger reductions in the tax base in London and some large cities. In inner London, for example, the tax base will be 8.5 per cent below the government's 1991 estimate. It will be 9.6 per cent under in Bristol, and 15 per cent under in Liverpool. The tax base for the shire counties as a whole will be virtually as estimated. The variation is even more marked in inner-city London boroughs. Hackney's tax base, for example, is 22 per cent less than the government had estimated. The government had estimated that more than two-thirds of Hackney's homes would be worth more than Pounds 88,000: the valuers have assessed only 15 per cent at more than this, with 72 per cent worth less than Pounds 68,000. Kensington and Chelsea is one of the few London boroughs to show a rise in its tax base, which is up 13.6 per cent. The increase is largely because of a jump in the number of homes worth more than Pounds 160,000, up from 36 per cent to 45 per cent. The over-estimation of valuations means tax rates at every band would have to be higher if the tax is to raise the Pounds 6.8bn used in the government's figures last year. This could increase the problem of convincing the voters that the tax is an improvement, even though many households would pay less than expected because their home fell in a lower band. COUNCILS in England collected almost a quarter of this year's poll tax in the three months from April to June, compared with 12 per cent for the same period last year, according to environment department figures published yesterday. The figures showed 24 per cent of the 1992 tax was collected in the second quarter. Last year's poll tax collection was delayed by the Pounds 140 reduction announced in the Budget. However, non-domestic rate collection is also up this year at almost 26 per cent compared with 23 per cent in 1991/92. The figures show councils are continuing to collect poll-tax arrears from last year. Another 4 per cent of the poll tax for 1991/92 was collected, bringing the total income to more than 93 per cent of the target.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COUNCIL TAX - BAND CHANGES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 %               %             %                             Bands A-C        Band D        Bands E-H Authorities               1991     1992   1991    1992   1991     1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham                84.4     85.6    7.8     7.2    7.8      7.2 Bristol                   52.2     81.4   22.8     9.1   25.0      9.6 Liverpool                 68.8     91.9   16.0     4.6   15.2      3.4 Manchester                89.3     93.5    5.0     4.0    5.7      2.6 Inner London              16.8     47.4   19.6    20.3   63.6     32.2 City of London            10.0     11.4   10.0    17.4   80.0     71.2 Camden                     9.5     27.0   14.5    26.5   76.1     46.4 Greenwich                 13.0     64.1   22.0    18.4   65.0     17.5 Hackney                   14.2     71.6   16.3    13.1   69.5     15.3 Hammersmith                4.8     25.1   11.4    27.7   83.8     47.2 Islington                  8.0     33.1   16.2    36.0   75.8     30.9 Ken. and Chelsea          13.0     13.2   15.4    13.8   71.6     73.1 Lambeth                   11.6     58.0   19.5    20.7   68.9     21.4 Lewisham                  16.0     65.3   19.0    22.7   65.0     12.0 Southwark                 20.8     73.3   31.2    12.9   48.0     13.8 Tower Hamlets             58.4     77.5   20.6     9.8   21.0     12.7 Wandsworth                28.0     41.6   25.2    23.7   46.8     34.6 Westminster                9.5     15.7   18.2    18.9   72.3     65.4 Outer London              26.1     39.5   23.9    28.3   50.0     32.2 Barking                   37.2     88.9   45.2    10.1   17.6      3.0 Barnet                     6.6     26.0   10.6    22.1   82.8     51.9 Bexley                     9.0     43.3   18.0    26.2   73.0     30.5 Brent                     11.6     40.5   12.2    28.0   76.2     31.5 Bromley                   28.8     26.4   23.0    26.1   48.2     47.5 Croydon                   42.0     42.6   27.1    25.9   30.9     31.6 Ealing                    11.6     33.6   12.2    32.4   76.2     34.0 Enfield                   41.1     37.0   30.9    30.2   28.1     32.9 Haringey                  44.2     47.4   28.8    27.3   27.0     25.4 Harrow                     7.6     23.3   15.7    32.2   76.7     44.4 Havering                  30.4     39.9   34.0    35.3   35.6     24.8 Hillingdon                11.6     24.7   20.3    43.0   68.1     32.3 Hounslow                  19.0     31.6   23.2    39.4   57.8     29.0 Kingston                  14.0     26.3   15.0    30.9   71.0     42.9 Merton                    30.4     35.4   31.4    34.5   38.0     30.1 Newham                    47.0     82.8   36.0    15.1   16.9      2.1 Redbridge                 36.0     37.6   29.0    30.7   35.0     31.7 Richmond                  12.6     14.3   14.0    24.5   73.4     61.2 Sutton                    35.4     40.4   29.7    28.0   34.9     31.6 Waltham Forest            45.0     66.3   32.0    22.1   23.0     11.6 Greater London            22.6     42.5   22.3    25.3   55.1     32.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- % - homes falling into payment bands.

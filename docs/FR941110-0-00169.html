			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We recognize that a temporary manager in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public facility may be constrained in ways that he or she  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be in other facilities. We expect the temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager to work within any limitations under which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility operates and to abide by union agreements and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts. (See above response.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked whether HCFA or the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would sanction a temporary manager who fails to rectify an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate jeopardy situation within 23 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A failure to rectify an immediate jeopardy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation may be more indicative of the magnitude of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's deficiencies than the competency of the temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager, and neither HCFA nor the State will penalize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatically a temporary manager when his or her efforts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failed to remove the immediate jeopardy. However, if HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the State believes that the temporary manager was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficient in his or her duty, then that individual may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalized to the extent that he or she is excluded from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration for future temporary management assignments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters asked that we limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duration of the temporary management. Many recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the temporary manager be discontinued when the immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy is removed or when compliance with the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that triggered the temporary management is achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Temporary management will be removed when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility is terminated, or when HCFA or the State has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that the facility is in substantial compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and has the management capability to sustain substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. The temporary management might end when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate jeopardy has been removed and deficiencies have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been corrected, but it would not have to. It would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> premature to discontinue the temporary management before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA or the State is confident that the facility will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relapse into noncompliance. Effective enforcement involves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promoting sustained substantial compliance, and we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revising &sect;488.454, ``Duration of remedies'' to reflect this.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter recommended that HCFA or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State be able to continue special actions taken by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary manager which are necessary to protect resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health, welfare or safety. Facility management would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request termination of the special conditions once it could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> show that they are no longer necessary. The commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that this policy would ensure that the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> doesn't deteriorate when the temporary management ends.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Neither HCFA nor the State will discontinue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary management and restore control of a facility to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its own management unless it is convinced that the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is capable of and committed to sustaining substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. We do not believe an additional regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision is necessary to ensure this result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters were opposed to the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary management, and proposed alternatives to it. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested that, instead of using temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management in immediate jeopardy cases, HCFA require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-compliant homes to hire consultants approved by HCFA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correct deficiencies. Another commenter proposed that HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> itself create and train teams to act in an advisory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity. A few commenters asked that temporary management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be eliminated and replaced by State monitoring. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter requested that we allow facilities to devise their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> own plans of correction to remove immediate jeopardy and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the State agency monitor implementation instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposing temporary management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Temporary management is authorized by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 1819(h)(2)(B)(iii), 1919(h)(2)(A)(iii), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(3)(C)(iii) of the Act, and HCFA and the States are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to establish and implement it: we may not exclude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it as an enforcement option. Sections 1819(h)(2)(A)(i),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(1)(A), and 1919(h)(5) of the Act specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that temporary management be used in immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy situations when provider agreement termination is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not sought.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that the temporary manager is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oversee the operation of a facility and assure the health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and safety of the facility's residents while improvements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are made to bring the facility into compliance. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we conclude that the Act intends the temporary manager's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> role to be more than that of just a monitor of the progress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made by the facility or a consultant to management, and we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that inherent in the Act's rationale for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing temporary management is the assumption that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's management staff lacks the capability to bring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility into compliance. It would be insufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute the use of a consultant or monitor for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appointment of a temporary manager, because a consultant or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor would not have the authority to completely manage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the entire facility as a temporary manager does. Only a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary manager has a role active enough to substitute for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility management, whose deficient skills or practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would impede correction of deficiencies and protection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the residents' health or safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

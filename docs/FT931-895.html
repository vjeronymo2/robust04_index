			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / An instinct for survival: Yeltsin's opponents have been wrong-footed this week while he has kept popular support Mr Boris Yeltsin had won much by the time he strode into the Grand Kremlin Palace yesterday morning. This week, he had managed to steer a fairly consistent course while all about him disappeared up to their necks. In the many opinion polls which have appeared in the past few days, the Russian president has consistently scored near or more than 50 per cent on any question which contrasts his actions with those of his rivals in parliament. In spite of the obvious economic misery of the country - high inflation, falling living standards, vast gulfs between the poor majority and the conspicuously wealthy tiny minority - Mr Yeltsin appears largely to have kept a popular base. It is true that nearly all the mass media are either controlled by, or are loyal to, him; and that no single contender is directly challenging him. But Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, his press secretary, was probably right to claim yesterday that the opposition to the president had been wrong-footed by the 'wave of popular support'. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, certainly seems to have been wrong-footed. He switched from 'the case for impeachment of the president is as clear as day' on Tuesday, to 'frankly speaking, I'm no supporter of impeaching the president', on Thursday. Yesterday, his rhetoric when opening the Congress was muted. In contrast to the blistering off-the-cuff attack he made in the last Congress two weeks ago, this speech was read, stumblingly, from notes. Mr Khasbulatov now has many colleagues in parliament who want to shift him from his post: he, not Mr Yeltsin, may be the largest political victim of this week. The chairman of the Constitutional Court, Mr Valery Zorkin, has fared almost as badly. He, too, began the week with a flurry of rhetoric, following Mr Yeltsin's weekend appeal to the people, pre-judging the decision of his own court. The judgment, that the president had violated the constitution in some dozen places, was said by a court official to be 'mild' only because it did not call for his impeachment - an index of how politicised and extra-judicial the court is expected to be. Mr Zorkin appeared in Congress yesterday, still playing the politician, with a 10-point compromise programme which gave Mr Yeltsin much of what he wanted and decried impeachment as a dangerous move. In the four days between Mr Yeltsin's speech and the publication of the decree which gave it legal force, it was widely said he had watered it down. The phrase 'special powers', which he had said he was assuming, does not appear in his speech: but the mechanism for ruling by decree was set out. It consists of forbidding parliament to countermand his decrees and instructions unless the Constitutional Court judges them unconstitutional. He has already started shunting out decrees at a great rate. What the gap between speech and publication of decree did accomplish was to flush out his opponents. As Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister who is the grandmaster of the president's strategy, said on Thursday evening, they betrayed their weakness by taking an extreme position - impeachment - then being unable to muster sufficient votes to execute it. Mr Shakhrai sees himself as General Kutuzov to Mr Yeltsin's Tsar Alexander, drawing the Napoleonic armies deeper and deeper into Russia, fooling them with apparent victories, only to force them to retreat when their supply lines ran out. Finally, Mr Yeltsin has - at least he believes he has - given his government a clear space within which to operate. On Thursday, Mr Boris Fyodorov, now the head of economic reform in the cabinet, laid out a scenario which would restart the long-stalled radical reform. Thus, yesterday, among the accusations of treachery was the clear rustle of the suits for peace being handed in to the presidential office. His strongest case - that he wishes to put, at a popular vote on April 25, his own presidency and a draft constitution to the people - has won because of its essential simplicity. It is important that Mr Yeltsin wins, for it is important that a coherent source of power attempts to govern Russia. But his victory - if that is what it turns out to be - must be qualified by three serious considerations. First, if he does win the right to proceed with political and economic reform, this is only the beginning. He must in record time shape a constitution (whose fundamentals, he said, would not differ from a draft already approved by the Sixth Congress of Peoples' Deputies six months ago); he must support an economic programme which will, or should, bring real pain; he must find some rational settlement to the contradictory demands of the republics and regions in Russia. Second, he is not going to get too much help from abroad, in spite of western rhetoric on this score: the Russian president rather bitterly reflected in his speech yesterday that one of his mistakes had been to over-estimate foreign aid. The Group of Seven countries will repackage the kind of sums they were putting up last year, not extend them: they will seek to target them at more publicly obvious projects, and will probably give substantial debt relief. This could be very valuable, but at bottom, Russia is, as ever, on its own. Finally, Mr Yeltsin has taken a good deal of power into his own hands. He is likely to make some kind of compromise, but it does not appear that he will have to retreat too far. Can he be trusted? Perhaps more to the point, can Mr Yeltsin trust himself? If he wins the struggle over the division of powers and becomes indisputably the first in the state, he will be under great pressure to adopt tougher authoritarian measures to push through reform and to quell discontent. Mr Khasbulatov's consistent complaint that there is now a greater threat of monopoly of power is wholly correct, though he spoilt it by being so obviously in pursuit of a 95 per cent share. In the end, it all depends on Mr Yeltsin's instincts. The past week has shown that nothing is yet in place - no party structure, no parliamentary structure, no court structure - which can be a strong enough safety net for failing democratic institutions. His instincts have been good so far: it must be hoped they stay that way.</p>

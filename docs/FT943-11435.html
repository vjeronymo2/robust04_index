			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Japanese take a hesitant look at Aids: Drug users and prostitutes are honoured conference guests Japan's bureaucrats are being reduced to blue-suited bemusement at the arrival of one of the strangest and most feared processions of visitors from abroad since General MacArthur's occupying troops hit town 49 years ago. There will be 3,870 of them at latest count, with the US supplying the largest contingent. Known prostitutes will be waved through by immigration staff at Tokyo's Narita airport in the coming week, while intravenous drug users are assured they have nothing to fear from the normally scrupulous Narita customs as long as they bring in their prescribed methadone rather than heroin, its street equivalent. Narita personnel are among those who have been given special training in an attempt to ensure they do not offend these honoured guests, whose visit forms part of Japan's effort to secure a role in world affairs more commensurate with its economic stature. The country is hosting the annual international conference on Aids, which starts in Yokohama next weekend. The bulk of those arriving from abroad for the event will be men in white coats. But the conference, held last year in Berlin, has become an often rowdy meeting ground for the scientists seeking a cure, a vaccine or palliative treatments for the disease, companies hoping to profit from any such developments, and campaigning organisations representing those who have been exposed to the HIV virus. Activists may, as has become almost traditional, again zap the stand at the conference centre run by Wellcome of the UK, maker of the AZT treatment for which clinical trials continue to report patchy and sometimes detrimental results. But the campaigners will be present in smaller numbers this year. Some 13,000 participants of all persuasions gathered in Berlin, the large majority of whom came from outside Germany. This time the 4,729 Japanese delegates will predominate, according to figures released by the organising committee yesterday. In 10 years, it is the first time the conference will have been held in Asia, where after a late start the proliferation of HIV among largely urban populations threatens to cast a shadow over economic growth. 'Now the Aids epidemic is truly rampant in Asia, it is meaningful to hold the meeting here,' Dr Takashi Kitamura, programme committee chair, said yesterday. Up to 1m in India's great cities are estimated already to be infected, and the more developed economies represented by the six-nation Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) agreed last month they should seek to 'prevent the disease from spreading across our workforce'. The US, Japan and Australia are to help fund an Aids programme for Asean. However, fewer than a tenth of the delegates to the Yokohama conference, which aims to focus attention on the problem facing the region, will be drawn from the Asia-Pacific outside Japan. For most, the main impediment is a Y80,000 (Pounds 527) registration fee and the Y25,000 a night cost of a hotel room near the conference centre. Some 1,500 would-be delegates applied for subsidies, but conference organisers could not say yesterday how many had been granted. The Japanese government has committed Y150m over three years to the total costs of staging the conference, less than the amount required to fund each of these applicants for a one-day stay, airfare not included. Nonetheless, health ministry officials are wearing the red ribbon of Aids awareness on their navy lapels and have been educating everyone from their airport colleagues to those who make the beds in the Dollars 250 Yokohama hotels that HIV cannot be caught merely by handling a passport or a vanity towel. Along the way they are passing on the message, still only half believed, that Japan itself is by no means immune to the real risks. The health ministry said this week that 3,839 residents of the country had tested HIV positive, excluding those who had contracted the virus through blood transfusions in the first half of the 1980s. The majority of those newly diagnosed were Japanese nationals who were apparently exposed through heterosexual intercourse. In hosting the 10th annual conference on Aids, Japan has accrued better credentials than the US, where the assembly has not been held since its earliest years because of restrictive immigration policies. Medical researchers and pharmaceutical manufacturers arriving next week may be thankful that they are less likely than in the past to be accosted by those either decrying their treatments or demanding them for free. But if the event passes without undue incident, the Japanese bureaucrats will be the local heroes of the piece. For a small outlay on the part of their government they will have raised awareness of the real risks while dispelling many of the anxieties surrounding social contact with people with Aids - about 90 Yokohama high school volunteers will tend those in the 'care lounge'. And the conference may even bring broader trade benefits to foreign companies. The health ministry said US activists could import 3,700 condoms to distribute in Yokohama. Japan has until now prohibited condom imports by deeming them a medical product - one of its remaining non-tariff barriers to trade.</p>

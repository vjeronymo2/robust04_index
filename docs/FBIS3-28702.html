			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "The Very Dangerous </F> Bellicose Absurd Remarks"]    [Text] According to broadcast reports from Seoul, Han  Sung-chu, who is called the minister of the puppet Foreign  Ministry, raved about some kind of dialogue to resolve the  nuclear issue of the North at the conference of heads of  overseas missions. He added bellicose absurd remarks that when  circumstances do not permit dialogue, it was also the  government's consistent stance to take strict measures against  the North.    These very dangerous provocative absurd remarks are leading  the situation on the Korean peninsula to a phase of war  [chonjaeng kungmyon] and are outraging our people.    As everyone knows, the whole world recognizes that the  nuclear issue in our country is an issue to be resolved between  us and the United States. The reason the nuclear issue has been  raised on the Korean peninsula is because the United States is  increasing the risk of nuclear war [haekchonjaeng wihom] by  introducing more than 1,000 nuclear weapons of various types to  South Korea; is deploying them in forward positions in the areas  adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line; and is conducting  nuclear war exercises, including the Team Spirit military  exercise, against the Northern half of the Republic every day.    Therefore, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula should  be resolved between us and the United States -- the party that  introduced nuclear weapons to South Korea and that is increasing  the risk of nuclear war. The South Korean puppets are not  qualified to interfere in the resolution of the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula. They only have to act according to the  decisions made through negotiations between us and the United  States.    If the South Korean puppets have anything to say concerning  the nuclear issue, they should frankly apologize to all nations  for bringing U.S. nuclear weapons to the land of South Korea to  spread nuclear disaster among their fellow countrymen and for  increasing the risk of nuclear war with the United States, and  should ask to be given due punishment. It is intolerable that  Han Sung-chu did not mention one word about this in his attempt  to interfere in the resolution of the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula.    It is ridiculous that the South Korean puppets, which can  hardly be called human beings as they are first-class colonial  hunting dogs and flunkyist nation-sellers, are trying to  interfere in the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula.    What cannot be overlooked is that South Korean puppets are  raving about some kind of resolute measures while the United  States is threatening ultimatums by setting a deadline for us to  accept the full-scope inspection [chonmyon sachal] of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA].    The South Korean puppets have so far made innumerable  criminal outbursts disparaging us under the pretext of the  nuclear issue. However, considering the fact that they spat out  more belligerent outbursts, such as a stern measure, we can be  well aware that the rascals' new war provocation moves have  entered a very grave stage.    The South Korean puppets have committed every strategic move  to frustrate the DPRK-U.S. talks during the past period. Today,  the process of peaceful solution of the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula is facing a crisis situation because of the  betrayal of the United States [onul migugui paesin  haengwirohaeso chosonbando haengmunjeui pyonghwajok haegyol  kwajongi wigi sanghwange noigedoeja]. With this situation as a  motive, the South Korean puppets are frantically running wild to  prevent the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks from being realized  and to bring about a nuclear war in our country, which will  annihilate the entire nation in collusion with foreign forces.    Under the pretext of the so-called meeting, Han Sung-chu  will  visit the United States from 16 to 22 February, meet with the  U.S. President and secretary of state, establish the final U.S.  and ROK position, and discuss a follow-up measure regarding the  IAEA decision based on the North's attitude. This is one of the  criminal moves to crush the fellow countrymen in collusion with  foreign forces.    Even Han Sung-chu babbled about dialogue, this is nothing  but  a brazen-faced maneuver to cover up their antinational,  antipeaceful, and antireunification activity, which is driving  our country's situation into the brink of a war.    It is unreasonable for the South Korean puppets, who are  trying to enforce the large-scale nuclear war exercise against  our Republic in collusion with the United States and deploy  Patriot missiles to South Korea, to talk about holding dialogue  with us.    Babbling about dialogue while wielding guns [chongdae] is,  in  fact, an insult to dialogue and negation of dialogue. Han  Sung-chu confessed that a stern measure is a consistent  position. Thus, the unchangeable real intention of the puppets,  who are not interested in North-South dialogue at all and are  trying to separate and crush our Republic in collusion with  foreign forces, becomes clearer.    Facts show that the South Korean puppets are rushing toward  the road to North-South confrontation and war, not toward peace  and peaceful reunification, and that they do not hesitate to  endanger the entire nation with a nuclear holocaust.    The entire nation set this year as the year for the great  national unity and is accelerating the great advance for  national reunification. The South Korean puppets, however, are  taking the road to war and are the traitorous group that cannot  live together under the same sky.    The South Korean puppets should look straight at our  people's  will and determination and act with discretion. The rascals'  reckless new war provocation will only result in their own  destruction.</p>

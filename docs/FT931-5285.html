			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Futures drop sharply CASH rates in European markets dropped sharply yesterday after the Bundesbank surprised dealers by announcing a lower rate for securities repurchase agreements, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank said it was cutting the interest rate on the 14-day repo to 8.25 per cent from the previous 8.49 per cent in response to wide swings in German money market rates. The bank also said it was setting a 28-day tender for funds at variable interest rates. Both the Belgian and Dutch central banks said they would be lowering their money market intervention rates next week in response to the Bundesbank's move. The Bundesbank explained the timing of the move by saying that it was responding to strongly fluctuating money market interest rates, and difficulties in the market in setting rates on German call money. Dealers reported call money yesterday morning at rates varying from 8.75 to 8.90 per cent. The Bundesbank's move brought call money sharply down to 8.49 per cent and the level of 3-month D-Marks down to 8.02 per cent. At the same time, by putting the repo rate only 25 basis points above the discount rate floor, it rasied expectations of a cut in the officially posted rates at the next Bundesbank council meeting on March 18. Euromark futures rose 11 basis points to close at 92.05 in the wake of the move, predicting that 3-month money in ten days time will be at 7.95 per cent. The March French franc contract rose 29 basis points to close at 88.61, and the June contract closed 57 basis points higher at 91.41. Three month French francs closed sharply lower at 11 1/2 per cent from 11 per cent at the start of the day. Sterling futures also rose sharply on the move, despite another assurance from UK government officials that a drop in German rates would not automatically lead to an easing in UK policy. The March contract closed up 7 basis points at 94.04, while the June contract closed up 3 basis points at 94.58. At this level, the June contract assumes that 3-month sterling cash will be at 5.42 per cent by the summer. Three month money closed at 5 15/16 per cent yesterday, down  1/8 per cent on the day. The move was helped by the relatively swift removal of a Pounds 1.75bn shortage by clearing banks and discount houses.</p>

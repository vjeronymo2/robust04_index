			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkey has announced that if the citizens who went  to northern Iraq because they were forced into it at gunpoint or  intimidated into doing it by the terrorist organization want to  come back, the necessary steps will be taken to resettle them  safely.    Replying to a question during his weekly news conference,  Foreign Ministry spokesman Ataman said that the citizens who  went to northern Iraq in this way should see that they were  tricked. A terrorist organization can promise nothing but blood  and tears, he stressed, adding: Consequently, if they decide to  return to their country, we will naturally open our arms to  these citizens. There is no doubt that our state will do  whatever it can to resettle these people and ensure their  welfare.</p>

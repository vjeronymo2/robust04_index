			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi by Paolo </F> Guzzanti and unidentified journalists in Rome; date not given:  "People Want Us To Govern"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [introductory passage omitted] [LA  STAMPA] Prime Minister, what comment do you have to make on this  defeat for the government in an episode [escape of mafia leader]  in which organized crime defied the state?    [Berlusconi] I will tell you right away: The government  acted immediately to gather all the information it needs to  judge what happened and to report to Parliament. So much for  the immediate, technical level. But I perceive a certain  tendency toward the old game of buck passing and of artificial  polemics. I will tell you equally frankly that these are  matters that do not concern us and to which we, as a government,  refuse to attach any importance.    [LA STAMPA] But the impact on public opinion does have an  undeniable influence, and you will agree that this influence is  important.    [Berlusconi] That is very true. Indeed, I would like to tell  the public that, while we are not concerned with polemics,  results for the benefit of the community are this government's  prime objective. So I will say that dragnet of the 'Ndrangheta  in the North is a specific fact and provides reassurance about  the law and order forces' capacity to act, which is something  about which I have no doubts, moreover.    [LA STAMPA] Not even after such a brazen act?    [Berlusconi] The fact is that there are a couple of things  that need to be analyzed and understood properly,  dispassionately. We must discover how it is possible for  someone who turned state's evidence to go walkabout, as happened  with Santino Di Matteo, and also how it is possible for a  commando of experts to arm themselves and to draw up such a  skilful plan to enter a prison and achieve their purpose.    [LA STAMPA] These are the very questions that everyone is  asking....    [Berlusconi] I can assure you that my government wants to  secure precise answers and to act accordingly. This is our  method.    [LA STAMPA] Prime Minister, you have nurtured your image as  a  winner, and you have won in the European elections too. But it  seemed more like a plebiscite than a victory. Of course you are  pleased. But can you also see the overwhelming nature of the  Forza Italia phenomenon?    [Berlusconi] Plebiscite? Pardon me, but your question rests  entirely on this word, which suggests inappropriate parallels.  There was no plebiscite here; people were not asked to vote  "yes" or "no." If I may say so, it was a much broader choice,  because it was in fact carried out in accordance with the old  method, the proportional one.    [LA STAMPA] Very well, not a plebiscite, but a massive shift  in the vote. Did you expect it?    [Berlusconi] I am reassured by the fact that, with the  proportional system, the government commands the support of the  absolute majority of voters. So above all, it was a political  victory for the government. Did I expect it? No, frankly, I  did not expect it.    [LA STAMPA] What do you think was the reason for it? People  experience great crushes and tend to throng round a leader....    [Berlusconi] No, I do not think so. I am very thoroughly  acquainted with the voters' wishes and aspirations. They acted  clearly, with a very acute political awareness. They saw that  there is a government, they have witnessed some pigeon shooting  which could turn into obstacles to the government, and issued a  vote which means: We want the government to govern. Pigeon  shooting is a disappointing sport; it does not fire people's  enthusiasm.    [LA STAMPA] Your answer prompts me to ask right away whether  the clarification that you requested from [League Secretary]  Bossi will be a sharp one. But first I would like to know why  progovernment voters rewarded your movement in particular.    [Berlusconi] I think the basic factor is an investment of  confidence in us, a placing of trust which is not at all  unconditional. I think that people like calm but still resolute  language. A style of government which consists of producing  achievements. Our declaration of war on all that is tangled,  devious, and complex, and our ability to conduct this operation  of simplification without in the least impoverishing the  significance of the social battle. You see, I am convinced that  Forza Italia succeeded in communicating this attitude  successfully, and it is partly because of these characteristics  that it was not established as a party but takes the form of a  government class, the promise of a government of the  institutions. The Italian people are very well aware that this  is a strong and credible proposal, after the period of the  parties' invasion of the apparatuses. And that is the reason  for the vote and for its dimension.    [LA STAMPA] You are either very clever or very modest to  talk always about a collective and reassuring plurality. But if  it was not a plebiscite, let us say that it was a referendum,  and that you personally were the subject of that referendum...    [Berlusconi] Pardon me, but if it was not a plebiscite, I  must tell you that it was not a referendum either. Would you  like me to conceal the fact that I am pleased? Of course, I am  pleased with my results. I was a candidate, and people voted  for me generously, for which I am grateful to the voters, but  this success has nothing to do with any referendum. Decisions  about a single individual happen when the voters grant their  support directly to the prime minister. If and when this happens  in Italy, it will be possible to talk in terms of a personal  result. Sunday [12 June] was a reward for a leadership and a  program. As for my personal responsibility, I am fully aware of  it.    [LA STAMPA] Since they were European elections, here is a  European question: Where will you sit in that Parliament? With  the Liberals, as [Foreign] Minister Martino would like, or with  the popular group, as you say you would prefer?    [Berlusconi] Giscard d'Estaing -- and nobody could deny that  he is both a liberal and a democrat -- has joined the European  People's Group. God willing, there are no barriers in  Strasbourg, or they are less rigid, less bound to ideological  roots. I believe that Italian liberalism is historically fragile  because it did not come together with liberal Catholicism. As  you are well aware, if Sturzo and Giolitti had come together,  our country would have been spared splits which proved to be of  the most lamentable kind. Be that as it may, the Forza Italia  movement has deep roots in the Catholic world, which I  personally intend to cultivate -- an increasingly open world,  often comprising different languages and cultures, a world in  which major problems of our time are clearly perceived -- issues  so close to [Pope] John Paul II's heart, such as the family, the  imbalance between wealthy countries and poor countries, and a  freedom that can be true to itself without losing contact with  human and social solidarity.    [LA STAMPA] In other words, you will join the popular group  in Strasbourg. What about in Italy? Let us discuss the current  feelings that prevail between you and the League or, rather,  Bossi. For instance, in Milan your movement has swept away the  League. How do you explain this reversal?    [Berlusconi] I explain it by the fact that the inhabitants  of  Lombardy and Milan have been searching for years for someone who  can represent their problems in the spirit of their own  feelings, traditions, and history. And at times they have done  so in an excited manner. Now I think they decided to reward  values that are closer to their own approach -- an attitude of  calmness, seriousness, rigorousness, sobriety, which is  characteristic of the people of Lombardy, as well as us. And we  are also accustomed to entirely rejecting rough brawls. I think  this is the explanation.    [LA STAMPA] Your answer was very calm and balanced, but the  result was basically a sharp defeat for Bossi by Berlusconi.  You are devouring the League's representatives one by one. I  would like to ask you whether you intend to occupy their  political space too.    [Berlusconi] Listen, nobody is devouring anyone here. I do  not devour anyone, and it is enough to consider the National  Alliance's result to realize that. Of course, I was struck by  the citizen who greeted me and said, now you are worth a Bossi  and a half, referring to the results. But these are mere  anecdotes. I have no resentment toward Umberto Bossi, who is  still railing every day against "that fellow there," though he  never explains who it is. So I merely hope that he manages to  evade the temptation of neurosis, instability, and  self-consumption.    [LA STAMPA] Prime Minister, would try to answer me honestly:  Are you urging the League to replace Bossi?    [Berlusconi] I do not concern myself with other people's  leaders. This too is my custom, my style. [Democratic Party of  the Left, PDS, Secretary] Mr. Occhetto publicly acknowledged  this, when he thanked me the day he resigned.    [LA STAMPA] Let us consider it from another angle: As early  as last Sunday you mentioned the possibility of another  election. Is this not a threat to the League?    [Berlusconi] Look, it is the chief of state who decides on  elections, while a coalition's future is determined by its  progress. Obviously the European elections prompt us to proceed  even more vigorously. And now we must see whether or not we are  obstructed. By obstructions, of course, I am referring not to  the exercise of the opposition's rights, but to filibustering.  We shall see what happens, and we will draw the necessary  conclusions on that basis.    [LA STAMPA] Are you surprised by the PPI's [Italian Popular  Party] result? Do you expect it to disappear?    [Berlusconi] On the contrary. I wish the PPI a recovery of  its support and of its political role -- but in the right  direction: the government of society, within a moderate center  political area, with a liberal program. I am working to this  end, legitimately, within respect for their autonomous analysis.  I believe that a coming together is inevitable, without winners  or losers.    [LA STAMPA] What do you think the PPI should do now? Are you  in favor of its splitting? To which individuals and what  environment do you feel closest? And what line should that  party officially adopt?    [Berlusconi] I will not dictate other parties' lines, nor  will I choose my favorite friends. I will confine myself to  expressing an opinion, which is this: The first-past-the-post  system makes desirable, and perhaps inevitable, a polarization  -- not forcible, but free and deliberate, within the Catholic  world too. In other words, I neither want nor foresee a split,  but I do believe it senseless for a Catholic who sees things the  same way as a left-wing opposition to remain in a forcible union  with a Catholic who inclines more toward the values and programs  of the government area which I believe I represent.    [LA STAMPA] Is it true that, as [National Alliance, AN,  leader] Fini said, Forza Italia and the AN could establish a  single movement in the near future?    [Berlusconi] With the AN, the Center Union, the Christian  Democrats, and the Reformers, we must work within the context of  a coalition political cartel, the context of the pole for  freedoms and good government which prevailed in the general  election and gave the country a government. Very loyal  cooperation is under way with the AN and Fini within this  context.    [LA STAMPA] [Former President] Cossiga has urged you to  initiate a number of constitutional reforms. Do you agree?  Could you indicate the principal ones?    [Berlusconi] The new electoral law, which has worked despite  its obvious imperfections, is the nucleus for any future  constitutional reform. The ideas about federalism and  presidentialism that people have been talking about for years  make sense now only if we make both the letter and the spirit of  the first-past-the-post system effective -- the direct choice of  those who govern and supervisory powers for the opposition  forces, who will plan an alternative. This is the democracy of  rotation to which the country aspires, and which is now taking  its first steps.    [LA STAMPA] After the victory in the European elections,  will  the desire for a reckoning which was apparent within the ranks  of the majority increase, or do you intend to control it?    [Berlusconi] There is no such desire. To govern means to  have the instruments to intervene effectively in the fields of  the economy, security, public order, and foreign policy.  Efficiently and discreetly, since I am talking sincerely about  a liberal government. What does any reckoning have to do with  this? These are tribal concerns, which are alien to us.    [LA STAMPA] More specifically, will the offensive against  RAI  [state broadcasting corporation] and the press (which you too  accuse of having failed to support you) continue?    [Berlusconi] I know of only one RAI offensive -- that on the  part of RAI itself against a balanced budget and rational  management. Its new management board has made some effort to  remedy a situation of great indebtedness. But I wonder whether  it is enough. We will disentangle the knots with a sense of  balance. As for the newspapers, I have no issue with them; on  the contrary. I confine myself to the normal dialogue that a  democratic politician builds with whoever criticizes him  legitimately. Sometimes you have the right to reply, do you not?    [LA STAMPA] How do you envisage the future of Forza Italia?    [Berlusconi] A splendid future, with a movement of opinion  that will shape attitudes, engage in political organization, and  forge links with its elected representatives and the country in  order to build the right kind of social establishment within the  institutions, instead of an apparatus, a filter, or a dividing  wall between institutions and society.    [LA STAMPA] What do you think of Occhetto, who thanked you  on  the day he resigned? Who do you hope will become PDS secretary?    [Berlusconi] I have said several times that Mr. Occhetto is  a  very likable person. His resignation was a well-balanced and  politically correct gesture, which I will leave it to the  members and leaders of his party to judge. I have no favorite  candidates within the PDS. I neither sanctify nor diabolize any  of my adversaries, and still hope that they will treat me and my  allies in the same way.</p>

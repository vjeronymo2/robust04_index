			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Profit margins still falling Sir, Philip Coggan is incorrect in concluding in his article 'Mixed picture on inflation prospects poses problems for Clarke' (March 2) that manufacturers' margins have been widening. Far from it. Input prices are only a relatively small proportion of total manufacturing costs. Declines in manufacturing productivity over the past few months, and consequent increases in unit wage costs, have been significant contributory factors to the 3.7 per cent rise in output costs recorded by the CSO index. Margins, according to a reading of these indices, are flat. Further scrutiny of the official data and evidence from several industrial sectors suggest these price indices do not fully reflect the increasing extent of trade discounting. Taking these factors into account, manufacturers' unit profit margins are undoubtedly still falling.

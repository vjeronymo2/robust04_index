			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNLEASHING THEIR POWER;  </P> <P> DOG OWNERS LOBBY FOR RIGHT TO LET PETS RUN FREE IN PARKS  </P> <P> The knot of people gathered in the West Los Angeles park chatted amiably in the  waning sunshine, leashes in hand, as more than two dozen dogs raced and tumbled  over each other on a carpet of grass.  </P> <P> When strangers approached on a recent afternoon, the dog owners eyed them  warily: Were they animal control police come to ticket scofflaws flouting leash  laws? They weren't, but it started them debating again -- should they push to  make it legal for their pooches to romp sans leash.  </P> <P> Claudia Harrington and her year-old Dalmatian don't have to worry about that  anymore. On Saturday, her hometown of Santa Monica christened its first haven  for untethered dogs at Memorial Park.  </P> <P> "This is a giant first step," the Santa Monica woman said approvingly, as  Abercrombie bolted among more than 30 dogs in the rectangular 21-foot by  230-foot fenced run at the northwest corner of the park.  </P> <P> Until now, Santa Monica has banned even a leashed animal from setting paw to a  blade of city grass or grain of city sand. But the opening of the dog run this  weekend on a six-month trial basis, if successful, could lead the City Council  to approve other such dog facilities.  </P> <P> The Memorial Park Dog Run, the first such legal off-leash area for pets on the  Westside and only the second in the Los Angeles area, is proof of the growing  clout of a determined new interest group: the canine lobby.  </P> <P> It began in Los Angeles at Laurel Canyon Park in the Hollywood Hills, where  dogs were allowed off leash during certain hours of the day in 1988, after a  bitter three-year-battle between dog owners and other neighbors.  </P> <P> Last July, Harrington's group, PAWS (Parks Are Worth Sharing) persuaded the  Santa Monica City Council to consider the needs of people with dogs.  </P> <P> And despite some setbacks -- as in Hermosa Beach, where voters last fall  rejected a dog-park ballot initiative after a campaign dominated by debate over  growth, public safety and dog droppings -- the canine lobby is slowly marking  wider territory, targeting parts of Woodley Park in Van Nuys and Griffith Park  for free-ranging Fidos.  </P> <P> "Dog owners are becoming more organized and are starting to flex their muscles  in the political arena," said Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo, who  turned the tide for the Laurel Canyon group, ParkWatch, becoming the first City  Council member to endorse relaxing the city's leash laws for certain hours of  the morning and evening.  </P> <P> The movement has hopscotched across Northern California, where at least half a  dozen dog parks now exist in the Bay Area. It has spread to the Midwest, and  even to the Big Apple, where dog owners are lobbying for a piece of mid-town  Manhattan. Even city officials in San Clemente and Bloomington, Ind., have  contacted groups such as ParkWatch for information.  </P> <P> Said Doris Richards, who led the successful fight for Berkeley's Ohlone Dog  Park in 1979: "We've been forced into it because dogs -- and people with dogs  -- are being discriminated against" in an ever more urbanized society.  </P> <P> As rolling hills and fields have given way to skyscrapers, condos, shopping  malls and freeways, leash laws have been imposed by litigation-conscious public  officials over the last four decades.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles alone, a city of 3 million people that has 15,098 acres of  recreation land in 350 parks, only four acres so far have been set aside for  people with dogs, pet owners say. Santa Monica's dog run adds only one-ninth of  an acre to that total.  </P> <P> But that does not equal discrimination, Hermosa Beach City Councilman Chuck  Sheldon insists heatedly. He also terms "ludicrous" dog owners' claims that  since they, too, are taxpayers, they deserve as much consideration in park  planning as Little Leaguers, swimmers, archers, bowlers and others.  </P> <P> "I cannot fathom the use of the word discrimination about requiring a dog to be  leashed," said Sheldon, a dog owner who nonetheless voted to extend the city's  leash law to a 21-acre strip of green along railroad tracks, where owners  historically had taken their dogs to run.  </P> <P> "I don't see (that) a dog owner getting some prurient unique pleasure in  watching their dog run free (compares with the enjoyment) a Little League or  Pop Warner (football) player gets . . . out of parks," he said.  </P> <P> Sheldon noted that since all Hermosa Beach taxpayers are footing the  $7.5-million bill for acquiring the 3-mile-long park, "It seems to me that (it)  should be for the benefit and use of all the citizens."  </P> <P> "To have relegated (it) to dogs off leash would have diminished usage . . . to  dog owners (who) are a substantial minority of Hermosa Beach citizens," he  said. "There are only 1,000 dog licenses in the city and about 20,000 people."  </P> <P> There as elsewhere, those who oppose relaxing leash laws in parks say dogs,  especially large or aggressive ones, can frighten children and be a nuisance to  joggers and bicyclists. Inevitably, too, the discussion turns to the piles of  droppings that dogs often leave behind.  </P> <P> Last fall, opponents who sought to end Laurel Canyon off-leash rules arrived at  a hearing of the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Commission bearing 35 pounds  of the stuff, which they claimed to have gathered at the park. It was proof,  they said, that ParkWatch members were not living up to their promise to clean  up after less diligent dog owners.  </P> <P> Commissioners ordered them to leave with the offending sackful.  </P> <P> ParkWatch's Purse, a 77-year-old self-described "activist" for a variety of  causes, said dog owners simply need education, which her group's 1,500 active  members are more than willing to provide.  </P> <P> At Laurel Canyon Park, those who don't pick up their dogs' droppings or rein in  their pets' aggressive behavior are shown proper methods. If they still don't  observe the rules, they are shamed into complying or ostracized.  </P> <P> Just to make sure, though, a ParkWatch volunteer can be seen circling the  four-acre park just below Mulholland Drive with an industrial grade scooper and  sack. The group also funds 24-hour security patrols at a cost of $1,500 a year.  </P> <P> For Jennifer Wolch, a professor at USC's School of Urban Planning, parks such  as Laurel Canyon show that dog owners as a social group have needs that were  not designed to be met in an urban area. And, she added, maybe it is time for  city planners to take their needs into account.  </P> <P> "Playing with your dog may not be a recognized sport, but it certainly is a  popular pastime," she said. "A lot of people don't have kids, they have dogs.  And spending time with their dogs and letting their dogs play in an  unrestricted area is important."  </P></p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Recovery lifts Kohl's poll chances Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, appears to have reversed the trend of declining popularity for both himself and his Christian Democratic Union, in line with a series of important indicators of reviving economic activity. The latest opinion polls show a revival in the fortunes of Mr Kohl and his party for the first time since 1992, while the worsening trend of unemployment also seems to have stabilised. Figures for the capacity utilisation of German industry, published yesterday, confirm the upward trend in the economy indicated by industrial production and industrial orders' statistics this week. The turn in the fortunes of Mr Kohl and the CDU may well have come too late for the party to avoid further setbacks in the European, state and local elections in June and September, but it suggests that he may have a chance of hanging on to power in October's general election. It is also looking increasingly likely that Mr Kohl's party candidate for the German state presidency, Mr Roman Herzog, will defeat Mr Johannes Rau, the former leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), in the electoral assembly vote for the presidency on May 23. The outcome depends on the votes of the minority Free Democratic Party, whose leader, Mr Klaus Kinkel, is inclined to support his current partners in the ruling coalition. Yesterday's moderately good news on the economy included a slight drop in unemployment - down 93,800 to 3.8m - although on a seasonally adjusted basis, that still amounted to a slight 16,000 increase. Nevertheless, the underlying growth of unemployment - the single most negative factor for Mr Kohl in his election campaign - has clearly slowed. All predictions hitherto have suggested that unemployment would continue to rise through the year, in spite of economic recovery. The latter trend was confirmed by yesterday's capacity utilisation figures published by Ifo, the Munich economic research institute, showing a recovery in March to 80.3 per cent, from 79 per cent the previous December. Capacity utilisation in German industry reached a peak of more than 90 per cent at the end of 1990, coinciding with the economic boom of unification, according to Ifo, since when it declined steadily until the middle of last year. The improvement seems to be having a direct effect on Mr Kohl's political rating, with a reversal in the popular view that the SPD would handle the economy better than the CDU. According to Die Welt, the conservative Berlin-based daily newspaper, 36 per cent of voters now trust the CDU to solve the country's economic problems today, compared with 32 per cent for the SPD. In January, the positions were reversed, with 35 per cent supporting the SPD and 29 per cent for the CDU. As for absolute levels of voter preference, most polls still put the SPD in front, but with a declining lead. A poll from the Forsa institute published yesterday puts the CDU on 38 per cent, up 2 per cent on the previous week, and the SPD on 42 per cent, down 2 per cent. At the weekend, one poll put the two parties neck and neck, on 38 per cent. The Forsa poll suggests that the personal popularity of Mr Kohl has also recovered to a rating of 31 per cent, only 1 per cent behind Mr Rudolf Scharping, his SPD challenger. The popularity of the Social Democrats has undoubtedly been hit by publication of their plans for major tax reforms, which would increase the tax burden on higher income earners, in order to relieve the low-paid.</p>

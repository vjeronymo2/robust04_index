			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Serbs await 'Slobo' v 'Rado' contest: Serbia's President Milosevic is gambling on an early victory Half a century ago, the founder of modern Yugoslavia, Marshal Tito, astonished the world by breaking with Moscow and turning the apparatus of Stalinist repression against his comrades who remained loyal to the Soviet dictator. Now Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, the most formidable politician to emerge from the ruins of Tito's state, is attempting a political conjuring trick that is equally audacious. Having built a large following, and an iron grip on the reins of government, by playing the nationalist card, Mr Milosevic has changed tack and is now staking his future on reconciliation with the other ex-Yugoslav republics and the world. The president, who once seemed to enjoy the role of international pariah, is now basking in the approval he won by accepting a partition plan for Bosnia and severing most links with his kinsmen there. Pro-Milosevic politicians and journalists who formerly trumpeted the slogan of a Greater Serbia have adjusted rapidly to the new dogma - it was never feasible to unite all Serbs in a single state. Professor Mihajlo Narkovic, an ideologue of the president's nationalist movement, now says it was 'too optimistic' ever to suppose that the Serb minorities in the other Yugoslav republics could assert the rights to self-determination. In the new atmosphere, few would be surprised if the president were to recognise the government of Croatia - even at the price of surrendering some of the Croat territories now under Serb control. The president's transformation has placed him on a collision course with the Serbs' other political strongman: Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian-Serb leader, who opposes the peace plan and has virtually been abandoned - at least for now - by his erstwhile protectors in Belgrade. The immediate cause of this rift is the plan, which would force the Bosnian-Serbs to surrender a third of the territory they control; but there is also personal antipathy between the two men, and rivalry for moral leadership of the Serbs. Mr Karadzic, who was portrayed previously in Belgrade as the defender of an embattled community, has been frozen out by the city's officially-guided, pro-Milosevic media. One of Belgrade's toughest nationalist politicians, Mr Vojislav Shefhel, has been arrested, and there have been several compulsory retirements in the upper ranks of the army, where senior officers have close links with Bosnian-Serb commanders. All these moves should shore up Mr Milosevic in his new role of conciliator. But he is still taking a big gamble. If he succeeds, he could be held up as the man who guided the Serbs back into the European mainstream. If he fails, he could be branded as a cynic who sacrificed his fellow Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia. In Pale, the straggling village which is 'capital' of the Bosnian Serb republic, there is bitterness and disbelief at the community's apparent abandonment by Belgrade. So far, there is a reluctance among Pale's residents to blame Mr Milosevic personally. 'The Americans were putting pressure on Milosevic and he could not continue the back-up,' says Mr Slavisha Rakovic, one of the 250 government officials who rub shoulders with soldiers, peasants and farm animals on the narrow streets of Pale. Officially, the Bosnian Serbs are preparing a self-sufficiency plan which will enable them to fight without Belgrade's help. But privately, they acknowledge this is impossible. 'Let's be honest, we can't survive without Serbia,' said one official in Pale. Since Mr Milosevic closed the border with Bosnia, the crisis in Bosnian-Serb territory has risen, and the shops look bare. There is only a handful of vehicles on the road, and ironically, people rely on Croat smugglers for fuel. Yet so far, the plight of the Bosnian Serbs is not doing much damage to the standing of Mr Milosevic, because his control of the Belgrade media helps keep this issue out of the public eye. Mr Milosevic is also widely believed to be meddling in the politics of the Serb community in Croatia, hoping to remove obstacles to a reconciliation with Zagreb. One of the trump cards of Mr Karadzic is that he controls supply lines between Belgrade and many Serb-controlled towns in Croatia. But he loses this advantage if Mr Milosevic makes peace with Zagreb. Critics of Mr Milosevic insist that he will pay a heavy price for abandoning his kinsmen in Bosnia and Croatia. 'Milosevic does not have support for his new policy . . . most people are against the embargo on the Bosnian-Serbs,' says Mr Vajisrav Kostunica, a nationalist politician in Belgrade. He sees the church and the army as forces of resistance to the new policies of Mr Milosevic, whose power base is strongest in the police. Mr Kostunica warned that the army already had reason not to be satisfied, including the fact that the police had been treated better than them. He thinks Mr Milosevic is afraid to call an election. Yet ultimately, the president's best hopes may lie in the deferential attitude of many Serbian voters, who have succumbed to his propaganda before and may be persuaded that whatever 'Slobo' says, goes.</p>

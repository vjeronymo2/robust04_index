			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Lloyd's to boost corporate funds Lloyd's of London is expecting to raise between Pounds 125m and Pounds 250m in capital from corporate investors over the next few months, according to Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of the insurance market. The extra funds will help offset a decline in capital supplied by Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market, but the market's capacity is still likely to fall in 1995. Capacity, the amount of premiums Lloyd's syndicates can accept, is currently about Pounds 11bn but could drop next year to between Pounds 9bn and Pounds 9.5bn, said Mr Middleton, giving details for the first time in an interview with the Financial Times. The new money is likely to be channelled towards so-called 'dedicated' insurance funds, which provide capital for syndicates exclusively managed by particular agencies. Several agencies - including Venton and Kiln - are working on schemes using dedicated corporate capital. Last year corporate investors put some Pounds 800m into Lloyds investment vehicles, which spread their investments across a range of syndicates and agencies. Mr Middleton also predicted that a large number of Names would limit their liability by joining new schemes which are expected to allow individual Names to form insurance companies. Names would transfer their liabilities to the new incorporated entities. He expected 'the bulk' of Names to switch to the new arrangements over the next few years. Lloyd's was considering a scheme proposed by Citibank as well as 'three or four other very imaginative approaches'. If approved, the new schemes would allow individuals to trade on an incorporated basis next year. 'We have no problems with the main principles,' said Mr Middleton. The number of Names underwriting as sole traders, without any limit on liability for their losses, could eventually fall to 3,000, he predicted. However these initiatives are not expected to help Names who have insufficient resources to continue trading in the market. Mr Middleton said that while Lloyd's was keen to secure payment by Names who could afford to meet their debts, those unable to meet their obligations would not be pursued. 'We are absolutely not going to knock the doors down of old women and twist their arms until they sign us a cheque,' he said. Although some Pounds 2bn is owed by Names, as much as Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m a day in payments have been made over the summer months. Earlier this year, Lloyd's announced a loss of about Pounds 2bn for the 1991 year of account. Mr Middleton also predicted that corporate investors would commit larger sums as soon as details became available on the formation of NewCo, a new reinsurance company. Lloyd's aims to transfer all liabilities on insurance policies underwritten before 1986 to NewCo, early in 1996.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Company failures decline 15% The number of companies failing during the first half of the year fell 15 per cent compared with the first six months of last year, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business-information group, said yesterday. In the period 21,887 businesses in England and Wales entered liquidation or receivership which did not lead to the rescue of the company. The number of failures in Scotland over the same period fell 77 per cent to 1,529, which Dun &amp; Bradstreet said reflected changes to Scottish bankruptcy regulations.</p>

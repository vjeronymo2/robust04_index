			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Warren Fernandez and Brendan Pereira] </F>   [Text] Raymond Foo was reckless in communicating secret  information as he uttered it when a former government economist  was close by, the Attorney-General [A-G] said yesterday.    Mr. Chan Sek Keong argued that the court could find Foo in  breach of the Official Secrets Act [OSA] even if it decided that  there was not enough evidence to show that Foo had intended to  communicate the information to Mr. Choy Keen Meng.    The A-G said Foo knew or ought to have known that when he  mentioned the figure 4.6 percent to Mr. Kelvin Quek, a  government economist, his utterance would have been heard by Mr.  Choy.    This was because the latter was close by. Yet he took the  risk, said the A-G.    Foo is alleged to have communicated the flash estimates on  the way to lunch on June 19 with Mr. Quek and Mr. Choy.    The A-G said the evidence of Mr. Quek and Mr. Choy, which  the  prosecution had relied on to prove that Foo knew that the flash  estimate for the second quarter was 4.6 percent, had not been  rebutted.    For instance, he noted that Mr. Quek's testimony that he was  certain he had discussed and explained the nature of the flash  estimates to the accused remained "unshaken".    Under cross examination by Mr. Chelva Rajah, counsel for  Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Mr. Quek had shown he was a truthful  witness, said the A-G.    "He was prepared to admit that it was not proper for him to  have given an indication of the direction in which the economy  was heading."    During his lunch meeting with Foo, Mr. Quek had indicated  how  certain sectors of the economy were performing.    During his hour-long submission, the A-G yesterday asked  that  a number of inferences be drawn against Foo.    Among them:    -- That he had heard Manu Bhaskaran utter the words "first  flash" as otherwise he would not have remembered the expression  when giving his statement to the Internal Security Department.    -- That Foo also understood from Mr. Quek's explanation that  flash estimates are never published, and only the final figure  would be published.</p>

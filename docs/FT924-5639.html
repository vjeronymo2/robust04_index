			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Technology: Putting a price on tradition - Claire Gooding explains how Coutts Bank is using computers to assess the cost of its exclusive service, in a series on getting the most out of software / Software At Work A frock-coated gentleman seated at a computer is a commonplace sight at Coutts. The bank revels in a deliberate juxtaposition of old and new. The varnished 200 year-old Chinese wallpaper from a previous boardroom dictated the exact dimensions of the one so painstakingly reconstructed in its London headquarters. Coutts prides itself on a different sort of service from the bustle of high-street banking. It preserves tradition, but at a cost. Known for its wealthy clientele, including the Queen, the bank now wants to know more about its customers: how much they are worth to the bank, and how much it costs to preserve its exclusive service. In the late 1980s, Coutts had to respond to the commercial pressures imposed by its owner, National Westminster Bank. Julian Robarts, Coutts' managing director at the time, triggered a project known as Product and Customer Profitability Information (PCPI) to understand better where the bank makes its profits, whether it be in asset management or standard banking services. 'The bank recognised the increasing pressure upon it to improve profitability through a greater understanding of its business, and a need to streamline its financial reporting,' explains Nick Willmer, the senior manager who leads the project. The next concern was to understand individuals. 'We're interested in the relationships, the connections between customers,' explains Willmer. 'We genuinely believe we look at every person to see whether they would bring the amount of business that would benefit us and benefit them.' This factor drives the account management at Coutts. It wishes to re-focus the business, which means dividing it into personal and commercial customers. Where an entire family is looked after by one account manager, these are bound to overlap, but it is still essential to determine a key factor and assign the account accordingly. 'We need to recognise where the influences are, the driving forces, as it were, within the wider context,' says Willmer. Costing information did exist for some activities in the private banking sector. The length of time, skill of staff, and grades of staff needed to perform certain tasks were available. To define the 'relationship' with the customer, Coutts needed similar and more detailed information on its advisory and investment work. 'What we have to have as a relationship bank is a complete picture of the profitability of the customers' activities. We need to know everything, and if we only know 70 per cent, we could be missing out on critical information,' says Willmer. Robarts' strict deadline of July 1991 ruled out a bespoke solution, which would have needed skills Coutts did not have and also demanded much management time. A package was likely to be quicker and cheaper, and Coutts started to search for a PC-based solution. Local UK support was a priority. Willmer came across a new offering through a long-standing business contact who was now part of a start-up business, CSI. London-based CSI's On-Q package seemed to be a lucky find. 'The people involved have worked in this field for 20 years, and it shows,' comments Willmer. Despite his confidence in them, he was taking a risk by hiring a company which had never undertaken a job of this size. The package met Coutts' criteria for user-friendliness, data integrity and adaptability. It could hold data at a detailed level which made reports flexible. It also looked as though it could be successfully implemented using in-house resources, which was an important consideration for Willmer. Where some would have rejected CSI and its product on the basis of its new and untried status, Willmer saw it as a positive advantage since he could input his own requirements into a piece of software which was still developing. The aim was to look at the data by customer, instead of by account. This demanded the ability to summarise at customer level, which effectively meant starting from scratch. Much of the data was held in-house in NatWest systems, but not under Coutts' direct control. CSI helped write interfaces to bring in static customer information. Although the bank is not given to using outside resources, it also enlisted help from Price Waterhouse in analysis. The data is taken from bespoke in-house systems, such as a relational database running on a Dec Vax computer, and a wholesale banking system running on a McDonnell Douglas minicomputer. Sources include the bank's main transaction processing system, for information on income, balances, volumes of transactions, and a marketing database for static data about those customers. Cost information comes from computerised ledgers and payroll, with a minor amount coming from manual ad hoc records such as timesheets. Willmer, who describes himself as 'a sort of information man, a true hybrid', knew enough about system design to be convinced that CSI's product was viable. It has proved robust and bug-free, and he still says he could not have done better. While the project works in one small corner of the bank, it draws on almost every area of operation. There is a reluctant recognition that it is necessary. 'There is a natural resistance and fear of change in a company which prides itself on consistency of service to customers and its continuity of employment,' comments Willmer. The On-Q system was implemented by July 1991 on PCs that were later linked together on a Novell 3.0 network. CSI designed the system with the expansion of PC power in mind, and the limits on the number of customer details stored disappeared as larger PCs appeared. The PCPI project demands some heavy manipulation of information, and despite 'exciting' volumes of data, the system has proved reliable, if sometimes slow. Inevitably, there will be some crossing of responsibilities and reporting, as account managers in one area will have to deal with issues in another to retain the personal service ethic. But the hope is that the customer profiles will become clearer cut. The project is still in its early days. It has taken a painstaking approach to costs, using actual (not budget) figures, and reconciling exactly to official accounts, including all overheads, shown separately. There is sometimes resistance, according to Willmer: 'People don't always understand the necessity of re-examining certain areas.' John Galley, manager of costing and profitability, sends summarised reports to 50 or 60 people. 'We don't get as much feedback as we'd like, but that's part of the educational process,' he says. Willmer expects the marketing users, only three at present, to refine and make selective choices as they begin to use the database properly. At present the reports go to about 20 senior managers, but he is hoping usage will percolate down. 'In future the data should change our marketing approach,' he comments, 'although we really need a full year's data to make sense of it.' He feels Coutts has come a long way, and is ahead of the game, because people are beginning to understand the role of the system. 'The size of our customer base made it possible, but also made it more necessary. Some users are saying that they knew some of this information anyway, but now we have proof.'</p>

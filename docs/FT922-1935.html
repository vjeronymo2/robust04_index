			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Philippines coconut output falls sharply COCONUT PRODUCTION in the Philippines, the world's leading exporter of coconut oil and copra, may be 29 per cent less this year than originally forecast, officials of the Asian and Pacific Coconut Community said yesterday. Mr PG Punchihewa, executive-director of the APCC, said that more than eight months of low rainfall had severly affected the Philippines' production and that 1992 production, measured in copra equivalent, was likely to be between 1.4m and 1.5m tonnes. In January the APCC estimated production would be 1.98m tonnes. Industry officials say low rainful has been excacerbated by the eruption of Mount Pinatuba and they do not expect production to recover until 1994. In 1990 the Philippines produced nearly 2.5m tonnes of coconuts. Stocks of coconut oil in Rotterdam, the main trading centre, have fallen sharply in the past year to 61,175 tonnes in mid-May from 134,575 tonnes in May last year. Copra meal stocks have also declined as a result of a 35 per cent year-on-year fall in exports from the the Philippines for January-April to 141,019 tonnes. Indonesia's exports of copra meal also declined, by 59 per cent in January and February to 38,162 compared with the same period last year. However, Mr Punchihewa said that Indonesia had enjoyed better than forecast rains and 1992 estimated coconut production at 2.25m tonnes remained unchanged. APCC officials said they expected the world market price of coconut oil to average Dollars 600 a tonne cif this year, up from Dollars 433 per tonne in 1991. In the longer-term, officials believe world prices will be sustained by demand growing faster than supply.</p>

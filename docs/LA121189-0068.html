			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Bernini Sculpture at Auction: A white marble bust of Pope Gregory XV by  17th-Century master Gianlorenzo Bernini will be auctioned at Christie's New  York on Jan. 10. The rare sculpture is expected to bring more than $7 million.  Bernini, considered the greatest sculptor of the Baroque Age, is best known for  his work at the Vatican and his fountains in Rome. He made the 33-inch-tall  portrait bust in 1621, when he was 23 and Alessandro Ludovisi was elected Pope  Gregory XV. The sculpture is being sold by Toronto collectors and  philanthropists Joseph and Toby Tanenbaum, who bought the piece in 1983.  Claudia Puig  </P></p>

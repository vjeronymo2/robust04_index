			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Polish cable group sold for Dollars 16.8m THE POLISH government yesterday sold the Bydgoska Fabryka Kabli (BFK), a leading cable producer, for Dollars 16.8m to a private consortium made up of Elektrim, a trading company specialising in energy and telecommunications equipment, and the Export Development Bank (BRE). The deal is the largest involving a Polish private investor since the privatisation programme started in 1990. The Polish consortium made the purchase in the face of competition from three other bidders - including Siemens of Germany, which is negotiating to buy the Elwro electronic works in Wroclaw. The successful bid was lower than Siemens' offer, of but the government opted for domestic investors. Elektrim has purchased 60 per cent of the equity in BFK, while BRE is taking a further 20 per cent and the remaining 20 per cent will be sold to BFK's 856 employees and management. BFK reported a net profit of Dollars 1m on a turnover of Dollars 60.3m last year.</p>

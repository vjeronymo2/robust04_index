			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Quality v quantity in investment decisions Sir, Your reports on the Confederation of British Industry survey into companies' investment appraisal methods focus on the widespread use of high-hurdle rates and/or rapid pay-back periods ('CBI survey fuels 'short-termism' debate', July 25). Bank of England governor Eddie George and others have suggested that these methods are preventing worthwhile investment opportunities from being pursued and constraining economic recovery. As highlighted at a recent conference sponsored jointly by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, the real issue may be more about the quality of the investment decision-making process rather than the quantum of the output. Where hurdle rates are set at levels well above the cost of capital, the rationale is generally to provide an arbitrary margin for risk. This approach may or may not be limiting the quantity of investment that is taking place. Some secure, but unspectacular, projects will be rejected in favour of much more speculative ventures that offer the uncertain prospect of a rapid pay-back. It must be better to allow for risk in a calculated manner than to seek crude protection through artificially high discount rates. There is little doubt that the quality of investment decisions would be significantly enhanced by the adoption of a more rigorous approach to the identification and analysis of risk, which would enable lower hurdle rates to be employed.

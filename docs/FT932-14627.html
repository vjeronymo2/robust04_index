			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Lacklustre gilts The UK authorities must be painfully aware that their borrowing programme leaves them little latitude to choose the timing of gilt auctions. Yesterday's announcement of a sale of short-dated paper came on a day of disappointing inflation figures at the end of a week in which the chancellor has reaffirmed his reluctance to cut interest rates. The inflation news may be less serious than it looks. Some impact on food prices from the green pound devaluation was inevitable and it is natural for stores to limit discounts on clothing and footwear as retail demand returns. That does not add up to a serious inflationary threat, but it was enough to unsettle long gilt prices. Since it also makes the prospect of lower base rates even more remote, there is even less incentive than before at the short end. It is unclear where the natural demand for the new auction stock lies. This contrasts with the last sale when domestic institutions were queueing up to lengthen the maturity of their holdings. The government must hope the difference of nearly one percentage point between five-year gilts and three-month deposit rates will again attract hedged funds, but the gap may have to widen further to entice. It would be different, of course, if sterling's strength were to change the government's mind on base rates. Then it could sell short gilts hand over fist and the equity market might awake from a lethargy which caused it to all but ignore Wednesday's manufacturing output figures.</p>

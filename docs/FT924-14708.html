			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard to focus on telecoms IT HEWLETT-Packard of the US has formed a new worldwide business unit focused upon developing and marketing information technology products for the telecommunications industry. Formation of the new organisation reflects the group's increased commitment to the telecommunications market, the company said. 'The new business unit's mission is to build, on top of HP's broad computer foundation, advanced telecommunications solutions,' said Mr Willem Roelandts, an HP vice-president and general manager of the Computer Systems Organisation. 'Hewlett-Packard will boost its contribution to the telecommunications industry by introducing more focused products and services as well as developing strategic alliances to better meet the needs of worldwide customers,' he said. The telecommunications industry spent Dollars 14bn on information technology products and services worldwide last year and the market is expected to expand to approximately Dollars 26bn by 1996, HP said. The new business unit consists of three product operations, each having worldwide product responsibilities and three geographically dispersed business-development teams in Singapore, France and the US. These groups will develop and market products for advanced networks, telecommunications network management and customer network management. HP is already one of the top suppliers of computer products to the telecommunications industry. It aims to expand its share of the market by developing products that will 'enable faster integration of operation support systems, business support systems and telecommunications networks,' said Mr Lewis Platt, an HP executive vice-president. Pyramid Technology, which designs and makes high-performance open systems servers, has unveiled a restructuring that will result in a charge of between Dollars 22m and Dollars 24m in the fourth quarter ended September 30, Reuter reports from San Jose, California. The company said it expected to report a 'substantial loss' for the fourth quarter.

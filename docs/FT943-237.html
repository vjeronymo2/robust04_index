			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Rival to Exchange plans extra facility Tradepoint, the new electronic share-dealing system, says it has completed the arrangement of settlement facilities which will enable a wider range of clients to use it. Tradepoint, which is seeking authorisation as a registered investment exchange, will offer an 'order-matching' facility for institutions and investment banks to buy and sell securities outside the London Stock Exchange. The exchange sees competition from potential rivals such as Tradepoint as one of its biggest challenges. The only system available for the settlement of UK equities in London is the Talisman system, which is owned and operated by the Stock Exchange. The exchange's control of the settlement process has limited the growth of competing exchanges. Tradepoint's settlement will be done through the London Clearing House, which clears trades for four London-based futures exchanges. It is owned by the UK's six largest banks. At the close of each day's trading, the Clearing House will calculate the open settlement position of each participant and compare it with the price at which the security was bought or sold. If the price of the purchased securities has fallen, the participants will be asked for additional margin. Tradepoint will be able to use the Crest settlement system, being developed by the Bank of England, when it becomes fully operational.</p>

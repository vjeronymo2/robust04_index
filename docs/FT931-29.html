			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (18): 'The Queen, our Duke' is the toast  -Here you can learn everything you want to know about Guernsey / A guide to the museums GUERNSEY was built on stone, said Mrs Rona Cole, the director of museums, and the best way to find out about the island's history was to start with the huge chunk of pink and blue granite to be found in the purpose-built and award-winning Guernsey Museum and Art Gallery in Candie Gardens, St Peter Port. Here you can learn everything you want to know about Guernsey and why, when islanders talk of the mainland today, they're not referring to France just 30 miles away and visible on a clear day, but England, 80 miles across the Channel. And this, in spite of the fact that Guernsey's parliament spoke French until well into this century, local people used a French patois until the Second World War, and house deeds were in French until the 1950s. The French connection started, as so much else, with William the Conqueror. His duchy of Normandy included the Channel Islands - Les Iles Normandes - and when he conquered England they became part of his realm. In 1204, King John lost most of Normandy, but the Channel Islands remained loyal to the English crown and have been so ever since. No islander can be called up for military service - although some volunteer - unless it is to protect the Sovereign and when it comes to a Royal toast, the Queen is 'The Queen, our Duke'. Of Normandy, of course. Occupation in Guernsey has been traced back to neolithic times and with the recent discovery of a 4,500BC site, the island has what is thought to be the earliest stone structure in western Europe. There are 2,000BC passage graves, a megalithic tomb, and ancient churches such as the little chapel built in 1392 with 14th century frescoes dedicated to St Apolline, the patron saint of dentists (she had to have all her teeth out, apparently), and the St Marie du Castel with its 13th century frescoes. For Guernsey's maritime history, go to the superb new Maritime Museum in Castle Cornet, the sturdy fortress that juts out into the sea to form an arm of the harbour. Here you can learn about the island's nautical life from Roman times to the present day, with a vivid reconstruction of an old harbour scene complete with fishing boat, crane, tomato baskets and a hand cart. A video shows under-water excavation of a wrecked Roman vessel found a few years ago in St Peter Port harbour by a local diver. He discovered it one Christmas Day, the only day it is legal to dive in the harbour. He thought it was nothing important and waited until the following Christmas to dive again and discover that it was an exciting find. Also in the castle is an art gallery, the 201 Squadron Museum, an armoury, German occupation exhibits and a refectory for light meals. Almost every bay in Guernsey has some kind of fortification built over the centuries and the Tourist Board has launched an ambitious 'Fortress Guernsey' project to restore several and open them up to the public. This summer they hope to complete work on a German naval signals bunker which had direct links with Berlin during the war and has not been opened since. Several museums show exhibits depicting what it was like to live for five years under German occupation in the Second World War. Many islanders were evacuated to the UK and 2,000 were deported to camps in Germany. The German Occupation Museum near the airport shows tableaux, bunker rooms, and a lifesize street. La Valette Underground Military Museum, housed in a former U-Boat fuel storage tunnel, has a display of Guernsey's military history. One French visitor to whom Guernsey gave a friendly welcome was Victor Hugo. Exiled from France in 1855, he took refuge and stayed for 15 years, living in Hauteville House, St Peter Port, writing Les Miserables and dedicating another book, The Toilers of the Sea, to Guernsey 'The Rock of Hospitality and of Liberty' and its 'noble little people of the sea.' His house is open to the public. For a different kind of history, there's Guernsey's Telephone Museum, with 'hands-on' switchboards, teleprinters, telephones and enthusiastic staff to explain how everything works. Note: Several museums are shut in the winter months.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Cadbury may add to audit fees THE SCRUTINY of companies' compliance with the Cadbury code of corporate governance may add at least 10 per cent to audit fees, a leading accountant said yesterday. Meanwhile, the Department of Trade and Industry confirmed that it will be considering the changes in the law recommended by the Cadbury committee. The details came as executives and professionals digested the final recommendations of the committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury, which were published on Tuesday. The Cadbury committee said that all quoted companies will be required as part of the Stock Exchange's listing requirements to make a statement in their annual reports from next June that they comply with the code, or state where they differ from it. The committee also recommended that auditors should also be required to ensure that a company's statement is accurate. Mr Roger Davis, head of audit at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, said the additional audit fee for conducting this service might be 10 per cent to 15 per cent, although he emphasised that this had to contrasted with the sharp reductions in audit fees over the past few years. The Cadbury committee focused on issues of best practice, but also recommended three changes in the law: that audit and non-audit fees paid by a company to its auditor should be clearly disclosed in the accounts; that statutory protection to report fraud should be provided to auditors of all companies; and that directors' contracts should be limited to three years without shareholder approval. Mr Nigel Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, said: 'The fundamental issue is raising professional business standards rather than regulation.' But he added he would now 'carefully consider the recommendations addressed to government'. The DTI said that greater disclosure of auditors' fee could be introduced through a statutory instrument. The other two changes would require primary legislation, which would be considered as part of the comprehensive review of the 1985 Companies Act it announced last month. The auditing profession had made strong representations to the Cadbury committee, arguing that it would not be feasible to scrutinise the code to ensure that companies were complying. Mr Bill Morrison, chairman of the Auditing Practices Board, which will produce guidelines on auditing the code, said yesterday that it would be feasible to audit the more limited, quantifiable aspects of the code highlighted in the final version of the report.</p>

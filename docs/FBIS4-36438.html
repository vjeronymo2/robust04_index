			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat arrived in  our country this afternoon on a visit to Morocco. [passage  omitted]    'Arafat is accompanied by a delegation made up essentially  of  Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, the culture minister, and Marwan Kanafani and  Khalid Salam, advisers to the Palestinian president.    At the airport lounge 'Arafat made the following statement:    [Begin 'Arafat recording] First, you all know the  deep-rooted, strong relationship which exists between us and his  majesty the king, his rightly guided government, and his  fraternal people. As is also known, we have for his majesty the  king all the affection, all the fraternity, and all the strong  brotherly feelings of which we are always proud.    We are about to leave for Palestine, God willing. We have to  come and see the king in order to listen to his valuable advice  and to his great wisdom which we, our people, and our nationals  are in need of at this historic, critical, and important moment.  God willing, we will pray together in the first of the two  Qiblahs [Jerusalem], the third holy place, the place from where  Prophet Muhammad, God's prayers and peace upon him, made his  midnight journey to the seven heavens, and the birthplace of  Jesus, God's peace be upon him.

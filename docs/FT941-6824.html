			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Accountancy firms 'should be monitored by single watchdog' The UK's three regulatory bodies for auditors should be merged and subject to independent public scrutiny, according to a confidential report commissioned by the government. The report says the current system for monitoring accountancy firms will do little to improve the practices of the larger firms. The draft report, which was submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry late last month, was written by Mr Peter Moizer, professor of accounting at the University of Leeds. Ministers commissioned the report to assess the effectiveness of the first two years of the system of self-regulation which was established by law in 1989. The regulation of the profession's standards is split between three bodies. The Joint Monitoring Unit examines the work of all the larger accounting firms, which audit nearly all public limited companies. The unit is controlled by the UK's three institutes of chartered accountants. The other regulators are the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants and the Association of Authorised Public Accountants. The report says ideally there should be only one body to regulate the professsion as the split between the regulators, which act as commercial rivals, is inappropriate, wasteful and not the best way to improve the quality of auditing. It calls for the creation of a body similar to the Public Oversight Board which has operated in the US since 1977, which would deal with customer complaints and produce an annual review of the regulator's work. The report says that short of radical reform, the Joint Monitoring Unit run by the institutes of chartered accountants should follow the approach of the other regulatory bodies, which are more effective. The Moizer study says the unit spends more time on each visit to auditors than the certified accountants' regulators, costs more, is less flexible and is seen as more threatening by the firms being examined. It recommends the unit should increase the number of annual visits so that it matchs the other regulators by inspecting all firms in its jurisdiction within the next five years, and then target those which are likely to be higher risk. Under the existing procedures, the unit examines a sample of firms each year to draw general lessons which it can use to educate others. At the current pace, it would take 50 years for all accountancy firms to be visited. The report also recommends that there is an urgent need for an authoritative statement on how auditors should deal with problems peculiar to small companies. See Lex</p>

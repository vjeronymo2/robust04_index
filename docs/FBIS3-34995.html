Of course, the Gaza-Jericho First agreement is not the first  imperialist Zionist plan designed to liquidate the Palestine  question and the Arab-Israeli conflict, but it certainly is the  most dangerous development, not only to the rights of the  Palestinian people, but also to the very existence of the Arab  nation, its future, rights, and higher interests.    The conspiracy against the Arabism of Palestine began with  the first organized Zionist emigration in 1882. Its chapters  then unfolded one after the other. At the first Zionist  conference in Basle, Switzerland, a decision was made to  establish "a Jewish state" in Palestine, which Herzel claimed  was a land without people, and people without land!    The ominous Balfour Declaration followed on 2/11/1917,  expressing Britain's symnpathy with "the establishment of a  national homeland for the Jewish people." Under the declaration,  Britain promised to do all it could to facilitate the  achievement of this objective. This promise was reinforced by  the agreement establishing the British mandate in Palestine in  September 1923.    Under the British British mandate, Zionist emigration to  Palestine intensified in an organized and militant manner. On  29/11/1947, the UN General Assembly approved under Resolution  181 the "partition of Palestine into two independent states; an  Arab state and a Jewish state" and "a special international  status for the City of Jerusalem."    The Arabs in Palestine and other parts of the Arab World  rejected this plan, and so the armed resistance intensified. On  14/5/1948, the Zionist entity was established with the departure  of the British high commissioner and the termination of the  colonial British mandate in Palestine.    However, the Palestinian people's struggle to regain their  land, freedom, and honour did not stop. Throughout the past  decades, there were uprisings; foremost, was the ['Izz al-Din]  al-Qassam Uprising of 1936. There were also upheavals, the  latest of which was the Intifada of 7 December 1987 which  crowned the Palestinian Arabs' struggle experience and showed  their full readiness for struggle and sacrifice, using stones  and knives in order to resist the invader Zionists. The  aggressions of 1948, 1956, and 1967 resulted in the complete  occupation of the Palestinian homeland, the Syrian Golan,  southern Lebanon, and the Egyptian Sinai. This honorable Arab  struggle was also the target of continuous plots and suspicious  plans which were hatched during or after every Arab setback.    The most serious conspiratorial plan followed al-Sadat's  visit to occupied Jerusalem, when on 17/9/1978 the Egyptian  regime and the Zionist entity reached an agreement under U.S.  patronage, namely, the treasonous Camp David Accord and the  Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty, which excluded Arab Egypt from  the circle of the conflict against Zionism.    The initiative of the Iraqi leadership to convene an Arab  summit in Baghdad on 1/18/1978 came as an important step toward  isolating al-Sadat's regime and circumventing the Camp David  Accord in order to prevent its application to the other Arabs.  Leader President Saddam Husayn played a significant role in  this regard.    After the cease-fire in the immortal Mother of Battles  against the U.S.-NATO-Zionist coalition, war criminal Bush  declared his initiative before the U.S. Congress on 6/3/1991 --  one week after the end of the hostile 30-state aggression  against Iraq -- to avoid the mounting Arab and international  pressure resulting from the initiative, which leader President  Saddam Husayn declared on 12 August 1990 calling for settling  all problems of our region on common bases and principles and in  accordance with the so-called international legitimacy, whose  falsehood, hypocrisy, and bias had been exposed. Thus the  Madrid talks took place under a clear disequilibrium in the  balance of powers, especially following the treacherous  aggression against Iraq and its strategic capabilities, the  divisions of official Arab ranks, and the assertion of U.S.  monopoly in the absence of an effective Soviet and European role.    The timing of the Madrid talks and their terms of reference  as well as the failure to seek a comprehensive solution of the  Palestine question and the Arab-Israeli conflict are all gross  mistakes, into which the official Arab negotiators and the PLO  have fallen. Even under this rejected peaceful settlement, the  representatives of the Arab parties ceded their best pressure  cards in advance. They gave up all the gains which have been  achieved by pan-Arab struggle on international levels, including  the resolutions issued by the UN General Assembly and the  Security Council.    Let us now go back to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which was  hatched in the dark and which surprised the legitimate  Palestinian leadership and stunned the Arab nation, causing its  frustration and indignation.    We do not want to judge the Declaration of Principles on  administrative self-rule on the basis of a capitulatory  settlement, but on the basis of liberating and asserting the  Arabism of Palestine, all of Palestine. (With regard to the  Palestine question, it is essential in all phases, and under all  circumstances, to take into consideration the nature of the  conflict with the Zionist enemy. As leader and founder comrade  Michel 'Aflaq said: "This is a crucial and cultural conflict."  The Ba'th Party has affirmed right from the start that  confrontation with the Zionist enemy is inevitable, and that  popular struggle is the best method for this inevitable  confrontation. It was on this basis that the Ba'th Party  rejected the peaceful settlements propagated by some people  because they serve the Zionist entity.)    Leader President Saddam Husayn has pointed out that "when  the  conflict is crucial and cultural, then it is a long, continuous  conflict, and it must cover all aspects of pan-Arab development."    (As stated in the National Command statement issued on  1/10/1978, the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party which, throughout its  pan-Arab struggle history, has made the question of liberating  the usurped land of Palestine the pivot of the entire Arab  liberation cause, cannot consider the conflict with Zionism as a  geographical one depending on the liberation of a few kilometers  here and a few kilometers there. This stand stems from its  awareness that Zionism, which has usurped a dear part of the  Arab homeland that forms a link between the Arab East and the  Arab Maghreb and displaced its people, is also an aggressive  racist, sectarian, fanatic, malicious, and expansionist colonial  movement. The conflict between Zionism and the Arab revolution  movement cannot be settled through negotiation, bargaining, or  attempts at compromise solutions, but through full and allout  confrontation until the pan-Arab objectives are achieved.    (The party has been aware that the Zionist movement does not  derive its strength from within itself, but from enormous  imperialist support, and the fact that it is a forward  imperialist stronghold, which imperialism preserves and provides  with the means of strength in order to use it as a bridgehead  for achieving its exploitative, monopolist interests in the  region, and as a sharp tool for keeping the Arab homeland  divided and dominated by reaactionary Arab forces, and the huge  monopolist exploitation of its resources and wealth.)    (On the basis of this awareness, the Arab Socialist Ba'th  Party has always believed that confrontation, not surrender and  negotiation, is the means to counter the dangers of Zionism.  Confrontation of the Zionist enemy cannot also be separated from  confrontation of the imperialist enemy.)    In light of this firm, principled pan-Arab stand, we find  that the signatories of the Gaza-Jericho agreement have acted to  the contrary and have given the right, without being authorized  by anyone, to put an immediate and unjust end to the Arab  conflict with Zionism and imperialism. The agreement's preamble  calls for: "an end to decades of confrontations and conflicts,  mutual recognition of political and legitimate rights, and  achievement of an honorable peaceful coexistence, mutual  security, and a historic reconciliation."    Just as al-Sadat committed the sin of talking, negotiating,  and signing on behalf of the Palestinian people in the second  part of the Camp David Accords, the Palestinian side also  behaved as a trustee for the Arab nation by signing in Oslo and  Washington an agreement prejudicing all its rights, without any  approval or authorization from legitimate Palestinian  constitutional institutions. In fact, the Oslo-Washington  signatories forced the Governments of Jordan and Egypt to  participate in establishing closer cooperation and liaison  arrangments with the government of Tel Aviv and the  representatives of the Palestinian self-rule. (Clause 12 of the  agreement)    The danger is not just in the provisions of the agreement,  but also in the letter recognizing "Israel." This recognition  has been the most important objective sought by the Zionists  since the first Zionist congress. It means accepting the  historical Zionist plan regarding the establishment of "Greater  Israel" from the Euphrates to the Nile.    Thus, the signatories of the agreement have abandoned the  liberation of all of Palestine as stipulated in the PLO charter.  They also conceded the rights of their people in exchange for  mere administrative responsibilities within the framework of the  usurper Zionist state.    This is because the Oslo-Washington agreement does not at  all  entail any concept of national sovereignty or right of self-  determination. Therefore, this agreement cannot lead to the  establishment of an independent Palestinian state, as the  signatories and their supporters are trying to delude us. Their  delusions are refuted by the clear provisions of the agreement  and the rejection of the racist Zionist enemy and its strategic  ally the United States of America, the leader of terrorism and  evil in the world.    Someone tried to justify the signing of the agreement by  saying: "True, the agreement has not achieved all our  aspirations, but it is the best available in the present Arab  circumstances and the new world order."    Palestinian opposition to the agreement is based on the  following considerations:    1. It is a recognition of the legitimacy of the Zionist  entity in Palestine. It also means that the rightful owners  have conceded their rights and acknowledged the legitimacy of  the vicious aggressions, crimes, and violations which have been  committed against them.    2. It is an abandonment of Jerusalem, including al-Aqsa  Mosque and the other holy places, although UN Security Council  Resolution 552 considers them occupied territory. That  resolution neither recognizes the annexation of Jerusalem to the  Zionist enity, nor does it consider it the eternal capital of  this entity. The current population of Jerusalem shows that 55  percent are Zionists and 45 percent Palestinian Arabs. The  Jewish percentage will increase with the building of more  settlements in the so-called Greater Jerusalem.    3. It does not include withdrawal of the Zionist occupation  forces, but only speaks about redeployment and relocation of  these forces. The Zionist negotiators held firmly to this  concept in the Cairo and Taba talks, saying their security comes  first.    4. It is a shaky self-rule under the hegemony of Zionist  occupation. It does not at all mean the creation of a sovereign  national authority. There is no reference to a Palestinian  state in the agreement, which also keeps the crossings and the  borders under enemy control.    5. It entrenches the existence of the settlements which have  swallowed up more than 50 percent of the lands of the West Bank  and Gaza. The enemy refuses to dismantle any of these  settlements. In fact, it encourages settlers to hold on to  these settlements, expand them, and build more. It also places  the security of the settlements under the control of the Zionist  forces. The enemy has confiscated 46,000 donums since the  signing of the agreement.    6. It does not guarantee repatriation under Resolution 194;  neither to the refugees of 1948, nor to the deportees of 1967.  The PLO chairman has acknowledged that.    7. Its price is stopping the blessed intifadah and any kind  of resistance despite the continuation of the occupation. Armed  struggle is described terrorism and violence despite the rivers  of pure Arab and Palestinian blood which the righteous martyrs  have shed for the sake of liberating Arab Palestine.    8. It makes the self-rule authority a tool of oppression in  the hand of the Palestinian police, which has pledged to  maintain security, law, and public order under Clause (9) of the  agreement. Therefore, they will be sparing the Zionist  occupation authority any further burdens and sacrifices.    9. It deepens differences within the one people, exacerbates  internal conflict, and weakens the resistance against the  occupiers by turning Palestinians against each another despite  the talk about democracy and respecting the right of those  opposing the agreement. The implementation of the agreement  necessitates the suppression of any opposition voice by every  method, including physical and moral pressure.    As for the dangers resulting from the Gaza-Jericho agreement  on the Arab level, they can be summed up as follows:    1. The agreement is a basic contradiction to the cultural  pan- Arab plan to achieve the unified socialist democratic Arab  society. It is also a deviation from the Arab League Charter,  the Arab summit resolutions, and all pan-Arab principles.    2. The agreement torpedoes the idea of greater Arab unity  by reecognizing the expansionist Zionist enemy and entrenching  the existing regional divisions in accordance with the map of  the Sykes- Picot Agreement of 1916 which divided the Arab  homneland and the one nation into weak small states; in fact,  the Gaza-Jericho agreement wwould lead to further  imperialist-Zionist disintegration of the Arab states into  ethnic and sectarian cantons and regions.    3. The agreement replaces the existing official Arab order  represented by the Arab League by a new Middle East order, which  would include Israel in security and political arrangements as  well as economic agreements, in addition to other non-Arab  states. Thus, the pan-Arab bond would be replaced by regional  economic and development interests of mixed nationalities, in  favor of Zionism, imperialism and their agents. This is  referred to in Annex No. 4 which is attached to the agreement.    4. The formation of a Palestinian-"Israeli" liaison  committee referred to in Clause (10) of the agreement which will  deal with issues of cooperation and common interest, constitutes  a threat to Arab national security. It is also considered a  blatant violation of the Pact of Collective Arab Defense and  Economic Cooperation signed by the Arab states and attached to  the League Charter.    5. The agreement is a Zionist "Trojan Horse" which is openly  and directly infiltrating Arab society through a new Palestinian  channel without the need for maneuvering. It paves the way for  full normalization with the Zionist enemy on the political,  economic, and cultural level.    6. The agreement torpedoes the institutions of joint Arab  action, especially economic ones, such as the Economic Unity  Council. It disrupts the implementation of the economic  instruments approved at the 1980 summit in Amman which are  concerned with achieving Arab development and separating  economic cooperation from political differences.    7. The agreement ends the Zionist entity's isolation and  cancels the Arab economic boycott of the enemy that has gravely  affected an economy burdened with problems and dependent on U.S.  and Western aid and international loans and the provision of  investment opportunities, raw materials, cheap labor, and large  markets for its prosperity.    8. The agreement lifts all Arab, Islamic, and international  barriers to cooperation with the Zionist enemy and recognition  of its usurper entity after the rightful Palestinian owners have  themselves recognized the enemy. The collapse is already  evident in the new attitudes of several Arab regimes, as well as  China, the Vatican, African states, and others.    9. The agreement will lead to giving up all positive gains  and the resolutions issued in the interests of the Palestinian  people and the Arab nation by the Islamic Congress Organization,  the Nonaligned Movement, the OAU, the UN General Assembly and  the Security Council and other specialized agencies and  organizations.    10. The agreement has led and will lead to a further split  in the Arab ranks by dividing these ranks into those supporting  and those opposing the agreement, after the Palestine question  had been a rallying factor and a source of strength and  unification for the nation throughout the great Arab homeland.    11. The split will spread to the Arab masses, where the  popular organizations and federations as well as the  professional unions will be in a real dilemma about how to deal  with the Palestinian organizations supporting the agreement,  especially since the resolutions of the popular Arab federations  have previously blacklisted whoever called for the support of  the Camp David Accords or recognition of and normalization with  the Zionist enemy and its institutions.    And now, three months after Gaza-Jericho First, and last,  stumbling and failure are still pervading the negotiation  situation due to Zionist procrastination and exploitation of  every weak point in the opposite party. So the Palestinian  negotiator has no choice but to retreat further and make more  concessions.    U.S. imperialism and its ally world Zionism are now seeking  to liquidate the Palestine question and the Arab nation's rights  as rapidly as possible by using the pressure of blackmail on the  PLO and the broken-down agent Arab regimes.    At the same time, however, the numbers of those supporting  this humiliating agreement is receding, the brave Palestinian  intifadah operations are escalating, and the objectives of the  enemies of Palestine and Arabism are being exposed more and more.    Our party has already declared its rejection of this  capitulatory settlement which is being led by Washington, and  affirmed the nation's rejection of these conspiratorial formulas  and its insistence on regaining its usurped rights, especially  the Palestinian people's right to their homeland.    Awakening the Arab nation's forces through struggle  sacrifices, escalating the Palestinian intifadah, adhering to  the spirit and message of the Mother of Battles epic, and  strengthening the cause of common struggle, aim, and national  destiny is the correct way to preserve the Arabism of Palestine  and guarantee its liberation from the yoke of  imperialist-Zionist occupation.    The Gaza-Jericho agreement is bound to fail despite all the  foreign support and protection.    Finally, victory shall be for Arabism and Palestine under  the  flag of the faithful, courageous leader Saddam Husayn, may God  preserve and protect him.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fresh suitor bids for hand of jilted NY exchange JUST A week after being jilted by the Chicago Board of Trade, New York's Commodity Exchange (Comex) has received a proposal to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The Nymex board of directors voted to offer a Dollars 10m consolidation plan to Comex yesterday morning. The proposal would create two separate divisions at NYmex, one for metals and one for energy. Nymex members would retain exclusive rights to trade their own products but would be allowed to trade Comex metals contracts for their private accounts. Under the deal Comex members would gain limited trading rights to new Nymex products. The merger plan, which is subject to exchange reviews and ratification by both Comex and Nymex members, would make the combined exchanges the fourth largest futures and options arena in the world, with a unique dominance in oil and gold. Nymex had volume of 47m contracts in 1992, while Comex had a turnover of 13m. The CBoT withdrew its three-month-old take-over offer for the Comex in the face of strong Comex member resistance. The CBoT had failed to offer Comex members any cash for the exchange, and also refused to give them access to its own successful grain and interest rate products. While the Nymex's Dollars 10m offer is modest, and there is historical animosity between the two New York markets, it may have a chance of success. Comex has been forced to seek a partner because of declining volume and revenues. In addition to cash, the Nymex board today said that the plan would provide significant cost-savings. The deal would allow the two exchanges to combine trade-clearing operations, would give Comex access to the Nymex's electronic after-hours global trading network set to be launched June 24, and would allow the two exchanges to seek combined trading space outside their current quarters in New York's World Trade Center.</p>

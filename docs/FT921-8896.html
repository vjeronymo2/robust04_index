			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Membership limited to 50 - Greater London authority A SLIMLINE strategic author-ity for London, elected by some form of proportional representation and made up of equal numbers of men and women, was promised by Labour yesterday. Stepping up the party's campaign to win marginal seats in the capital Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said the planned Greater London Authority (GLA) would have no more than 50 members, representing large, multi-member constituencies. Mr Gould's stress on the streamlined nature of the GLA follows Tory criticism of Labour's plans as simply an additional layer of bureaucracy. Mr Gould said the new body would have some wider powers than the Greater London Council, the former strategic body for the capital which was abolished in 1986. For example it would act as a police authority. However, Mr Gould promised that the GLA would have only a fraction of the GLC's 22,000 staff. He also emphasised that many services delivered by the GLA could be 'bought in' rather than provided by the authority itself. Under the plans the City of London would lose its local authority functions, but would continue to exist as a ceremonial or symbolic body. Labour plans a bill to establish the GLA in the first year of a new parliament if it wins the general election. The first elections in London would take place the following year. In the meantime an environment minister would be given special responsibility for the capital. The cost of the GLA could be met from rationalising the network of residuary bodies currently carrying out some of the functions of the former strategic authority. Mr Gould poured scorn on what he said would be Tory manifesto plans for an unelected agency to promote London internationally, and a minister for London transport. They were, he said, 'mere PR gimmicks which concede that the Tories have lost the argument'.</p>

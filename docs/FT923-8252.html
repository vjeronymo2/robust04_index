			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / CIS living standards fall Living standards and production throughout the Commonwealth of Independent States are plunging sharply, according to figures produced by the CIS statistical committee, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. The figures show national income for CIS states down more than 18 per cent for the first six months, compared to the same period in 1991. In Armenia, fighting neighbouring Azerbaijan, national income was down to 53.4 per cent of the previous year. In Moldova, where a civil war raged for much of the early part of 1992, it was down to 72.1 per cent. Production declines of 12 and 20 per cent were recorded in most states.</p>

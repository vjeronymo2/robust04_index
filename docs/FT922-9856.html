			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Hungary eases sale of state companies HUNGARY yesterday launched a scheme giving consultants free rein to sell medium-sized state companies. Under the 'simplified privatisation' plan, the state is devolving to private consultanting firms responsibility for 278 of the country's 2,000 state companies, with an estimated total book value of Ft70bn (Pounds 493m). Each company will have to choose a consultant from a list of about 130 which will then privatise the company as it sees fit. The fees - a percentage of the sale price on success  - are structured to give incentives to achieve rapid and fully-priced sales and as a deterrent against corruption. The scheme, announced by Mr Tamas Szabo, privatisation minister, came after the success of 437 trial privatisations of the smallest state enterprises. The authorities say the method will become the main vehicle of Hungarian privatisation as ever larger state companies are included. Simplified privatisation comes in reaction to the failure of centralised programmes, which have been crippled by lack of staff, political infighting and government inflexibility. The flagship 'First Privatisation Programme', launched in 1990 to sell 20 of Hungary's most attractive companies, has run into the ground and only two significant transactions have been concluded.</p>

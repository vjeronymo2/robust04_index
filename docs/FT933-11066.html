			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Barclays to amend client data policy BARCLAYS YESTERDAY promised to amend its customer application forms after banks were told that they had to allow customers to choose whether their personal account details can be used by subsidiaries to market products. Barclays, Britain's biggest bank, has required customers applying for new accounts, credit cards or loans to sign forms saying that they consent to account information being given to other companies in the Barclays group. The review committee considering amendments to the voluntary code of banking practice said that it would alter the code from next March to ensure that this approach to consent to the internal use of data for marketing products was barred. The committee warned in its annual report that if customers were asked to agree to their names and addresses being passed to other companies in a banking group they should be 'given a clear option to say no if they wish'. The committee also criticised banks for their 'undesirable coyness' over informing customers about their internal complaints procedures, and for using 'gobbledegook' in contracts setting out conditions of services. The ruling comes after controversy over the ways in which banks have interpreted the code's requirement that customers should give 'express consent' before their account details can be used for purposes such as life insurance selling. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, and Mr Eric Howe, the data-protection registrar, have both expressed concern about apparent efforts by banks, including Barclays and National Westminster, to circumvent this. Sir Bryan recently accused some banks of breaking the 'spirit and perhaps even the letter' of their code. NatWest has assured its life insurance sellers access to the bank's current account data by making them bank employees. Mr Howe said in his annual report this month that the code's benefit was 'clearly negated' if banks refused to allow customers access to services unless they signed forms giving consent for data disclosure in the group. The committee said that 'tacit acquiescence' as a result of customer inertia or 'their understandable failure to read through the fine print to the end will not be regarded as an acceptable form of consent' when the code is amended. The committee, chaired by Sir George Blunden, is reviewing the code after receiving more than 20 submissions from organisations including consumer groups. Barclays said it could not estimate the cost of the change, although it would have to alter application forms. It said it was complying with the code as it stood, but would make any changes necessary to comply with the revised version. The difference in interpretation among banks has caused some tension. Lloyds Bank, which asks all customers to sign consent forms, said in its submission that the definition of express consent should be standardised.</p>

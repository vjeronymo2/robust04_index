			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "`Equality and Legality' Gets Ready </F> for the Elections"]    [Text] Last Saturday a conference was held by the "Equality  and Legality" [RIZ] electoral bloc. The bloc was founded early  in 1992 and was registered at the Tatarstan Ministry of Justice  on 27 January 1994.    At the conference three candidate deputies from the RIZ bloc  presented their programs: V. Belyayev, leader of the  multinational movement "Accord," from Moskovskiy Okrug No. 24;  V. Mikhaylov, Tatarstan Supreme Soviet people's deputy, from  Privolzhskiy Okrug No. 27; and Yu. Rostovshchikov, deputy  chairman of the Vakhitovskiy rayon soviet and leader of the  Tatarstan social democrats, from Naberezhno-Chelninskiy Okrug  No. 25.    The participants at the conference were greatly concerned by  the fact that there are several prodemocratic candidates running  for election in the okrugs. The general opinion was that this  situation could lead to the scattering of the votes of  democratically inclined voters and to the defeat of the  democrats in the elections, particularly in the Privolzhskiy  Okrug.    Therefore, a resolution was passed recommending that parties  and movements belonging to the "Equality and Legality" bloc  refrain from supporting candidates not nominated by the bloc.    After the resolution was passed a press conference was held  by Russian State Duma Deputy I. Grachev and candidate deputies  V. Belyayev, V. Mikhaylov, and Yu. Rostovshchikov.</p>

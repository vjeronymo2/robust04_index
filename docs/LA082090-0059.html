			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAILING AGAINST A LITERARY TIDE;  </P> <P> BOOKS: CHARLES JOHNSON'S LATEST NOVEL, 'MIDDLE PASSAGE' IS A SEA TALE THAT ALSO  RELATES A SLAVE REBELLION. ONCE AGAIN, THE CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED AUTHOR DEFIES  CATEGORIZATION OF HIS WORK.  </P> <P> Sixteen years ago, critics were describing "Faith and the Good Thing," Charles  Johnson's book about a young black woman's quest for the meaning of life, as  "brilliant" and "ebullient," the sort of first novel with which to anchor a  major career.  </P> <P> Eight years later, his second novel, "Oxherding Tale," traveled forlornly from  publisher to publisher, like a flagless ship searching for a port, before  diminutive Indiana University Press finally accepted it.  </P> <P> "My agent said selling that book was the major triumph of her career," says  Johnson, 42, an impeccably polite man, who took 10 minutes to answer a  stranger's question about writing workshops, while other fans at a recent Los  Angeles book-signing affair fidgeted restlessly.  </P> <P> Johnson was in town to talk about his latest book, "Middle Passage," an offbeat  sea tale about a 19th-Century slave ship rebellion, and about some of the  extra-literary stereotyping he has met with in his career as a novelist. When  he's not writing, he teaches creative writing at the University of Washington  and he lives in Seattle.  </P> <P> Still far from being a household name despite three novels, a book of short  stories, a book of literary criticism and 16 years of mostly raves, Johnson has  garnered a lot of respect. He has established himself as a prime experimenter  ("If there's a rule in creative writing, I have to look at it real carefully,"  he says) and a wordsmith, the kind of writer who might sketch a bumbling Karl  Marx into a story or create a swamp crone who spouts philosophy as if she were  a Yale doctoral candidate.  </P> <P> He's "part of the wave of the future . . . one of a few who are going to the  head of the class," says critic Stanley Crouch.  </P> <P> Johnson wasn't complaining about the indifference with which publishers met his  second novel, just making a point about the powerful undertow that any black  literary experimenter must swim against. "The publishers wanted a different  kind of book from me," says the writer, an unobtrusive man behind thick glasses  and a dark suit, like an extra in a crowd scene.  </P> <P> Of course, things changed for all American writers in the early 1980s, he says.  "There was a slump in the publishing industry," recalls Johnson. "Suddenly, the  kinds of books that were projected to sell less than 10,000 copies weren't very  popular. Publishers were going after the bestsellers." Despite good reviews,  "Oxherding Tale," an updated slave narrative with Zen allusions, wasn't the  kind of book that you'd expect to climb the charts.  </P> <P> But the Illinois-born novelist had to face another big obstacle -- the notion  that the African-American community somehow serves up its writers one at a  time.  </P> <P> "First it was Richard Wright, then James Baldwin, right?" says Johnson, a  longtime teacher who likes to add a little interrogatory fillip to the things  he says, as if he's leading the listener, point by point, through an exegesis.  "The mantle was about to be passed on to Amiri Baraka when he decided that he  didn't want to have anything to do with the white world. There was a little  valley then, and Toni Morrison came along."  </P> <P> The idea is that there's such a unity of experience among black people that one  writer is enough to interpret it, while others are supposed to fall in as the  top dog's imitators. "It's one writer speaking for 12 million people," says  Johnson.  </P> <P> Johnson passionately rejects the notion. His work has never fit into the  categories that have defined recent black literature -- like the  "up-from-the-ghetto" novel -- and he believes strongly in the variability of  the black experience in America.  </P> <P> "The attitude has always been since, God knows, the days of Frederick Douglass,  that, instead of richness and diversity, we see one level of expression,"  Johnson says. "But that's changing, I think."  </P> <P> Along with "the novel of black pathologies . . . rats, roaches and drugs," he  says, publishers and reviewers are at last recognizing black writers as diverse  as David Bradley ("The Chaneyville Incident"), Clarence Major ("Emergency  Exit") and Al Young ("Snakes," "Sitting Pretty").  </P> <P> "Hundreds of stories could be written about black professionals, black people  who are mayors of cities," Johnson says.  </P> <P> Johnson's latest novel tells of the voyage of the Republic, a 19th-Century  slave ship. It's written from the perspective of a freed slave, the well-read  thief and stowaway Rutherford Calhoun. There are hurricanes, mutiny and a  rebellion by members of a mystical tribe -- who have been imprisoned in the  hold along with a powerful African idol -- as the ship's Faustian captain, an  American buccaneer named Ebenezer Falcon, leads the ship recklessly towards  destruction.  </P> <P> The writer uses the Republic's voyage along the slave route to explore the  philosophical underpinnings of slavery and the nature of a larger republic,  another variegated construction that requires a lot of cooperation to stay  afloat.  </P> <P> Calhoun ultimately concludes: "If this weird, upside-down caricature of a  country called America, if this land of refugees and former indentured  servants, religious heretics and half-breeds, whoresons and fugitives -- this  caldron of mongrels from all points of the compass -- was all I could rightly  call home, then aye: I was of it."  </P> <P> There is some hair-raising description of a small ship in a storm ("And then it  was full upon us: a sea hot with anger, running in ranges like the Andes or the  Rockies . . . "), mostly based on research rather than on direct experience,  Johnson says.  </P> <P> The closest Johnson ever came to taking a sea voyage was a ferry on Puget  Sound. But he rejects the idea that, before you can be a novelist, you have to  work as a merchant seaman, a lumberjack and a short-order cook to provide the  raw material for fiction.  </P> <P> "I do enough research on a book for a dissertation," he says. For "Middle  Passage" "I read all the sea stories -- Apollonius of Rhodes, Homer, the Sinbad  stories and, obviously, Melville, Conrad and London. I read all of the  narratives of slaves who came over by the middle passage."  </P> <P> Several reviewers have said that the book is in the tradition of Herman  Melville, whom Johnson candidly acknowledges as one of his literary forebears  -- not because "Middle Passage" is a sea tale but because it is, like all of  Johnson's fiction, consciously philosophical.  </P> <P> "All the characters in 'Middle Passage,' in fact, sound as if they're double  majors in classics and philosophy," said one generally laudatory review in The  Times.  </P> <P> As the narrator alludes freely to Bishop Berkeley and Parmenides, Falcon, whom  Johnson modeled on the ruthless and erudite 19th-Century explorer Sir Richard  Burton, ranges wide on the subject of slavery, describing it as "the social  correlate of a deeper ontic wound."  </P> <P> Johnson, who earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from the State University of New York  at Stonybrook, is unapologetic about his characters' philosophical  inclinations. "I believe firmly in the philosophical novel," he says.  </P> <P> Born the son of a night watchman in Evanston, Ill., Johnson grew up with the  idea of becoming a cartoonist. He almost made it. By the time he was 17, he was  selling cartoons to Ebony, Jet and the Chicago Tribune, and in 1970, he became  the host for 52 episodes of a PBS series on cartooning called "Charlie's Pad."  </P> <P> But Johnson had an irrepressible literary bent that cartooning couldn't  satisfy. He wrote six "unpublishable" novels, he says, before attending  Southern Illinois University, where he came under the sway of novelist John  Gardner. The author of "Grendel" and "Sunlight Dialogues" got his youthful  protege to discard formulaic writing and to explore philosophical issues.  </P> <P> "He instilled a spirit in students which suggested that, even though there were  high-wire performances by previous writers that were really up there, you could  do it too, if you were willing to work hard," Johnson says.  </P> <P> Johnson has taught at the University of Washington since 1976, pounding away  tirelessly at egotistical tripe in some of his young charges. "I have a real  problem with literature that's full of interpretive cliches," he says, using an  analogy that reverts to his days as a draftsman. "When you paint the model's  hand, are you looking at the unique hand in front of you or are you drawing  what you've seen hundreds of times in other drawings of hands?"  </P> <P> Johnson has studied the martial arts -- kung fu and karate -- since he was 19.  He's the co-administrator of Twin Tigers School in Seattle, where he and other  instructors seek to emphasize, aside from chops and kicks, "respect for the  forms."  </P> <P> But martial arts belt rankings are an American obsession that are really  unimportant, he says. "The main purpose of a belt is to hold up your pants,"  Johnson laughs.  </P> <P> Belt coloration originally came from hard work, he says. "The harder you  worked, the dirtier the belt got, until one day it was brown and finally it  turned black," Johnson says with a glint of amusement. "If you kept at it, the  white threads started to show through again, which meant a return to  innocence."  </P> <P> The emphasis on spiritual, rather than material, improvement is something  Johnson tries to instill in his writing students. "Ultimately, the book is more  important than the author," he says. "As a writer, there are tremendous ego  pressures on you."  </P> <P> Johnson, an "off-again-on-again" Buddhist, meditates daily. "It has been said  in the (Zen) literature that every meditation is holding a funeral for the  ego," he says. "That's what it's all about."  </P> <P> Like a martial arts teacher or a Zen master, Johnson leads his writing students  through a careful study of their predecessors. He demands that his students  understand and work with traditional forms -- fables, allegories, sea tales,  slave narratives.  </P> <P> "We didn't get here except by standing on the shoulders of others," he says.  </P></p>

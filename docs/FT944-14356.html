			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Asian tiger cub heading for a tumble: Despite rapid growth, Malaysia's economic problems are brewing up It is tantamount to heresy to question the performance of Malaysia's economy. In the lexicon of economic analysis, Malaysia is one of Asia's emerging tigers. GDP is likely to grow by about 8.5 per cent this year and similar growth is forecast for 1995. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, is convinced that his country is on course to achieve its long term goal of full industrialisation by the year 2020, which requires more than 7 per cent growth in each of the next 25 years. 'We are not an ambitious upstart, we are in fact very modest,' says Dr Mahathir. But is it all too good to be true? Amid all the euphoria, sceptics say, a number of problems are being brushed aside. In its seventh year of plus 8 per cent growth the Malaysian economy is showing clear signs of overheating. Imports are growing faster than exports and consumer spending has risen sharply. The excess liquidity is causing inflationary pressures and wage rises are outstripping increases in productivity. When Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the deputy prime minister and finance minister, delivers the budget this week, his overall message will be upbeat. The good news for Malaysia is that the fast pace of export growth is being sustained. In the first seven months of 1994 total export revenues were MDollars 83.7bn (Dollars 32bn) - a 22 per cent rise on the same period last year. The bad news is that imports grew even faster, up 30 per cent to MDollars 84.3bn. Malaysia's MDollars 3.4bn external trade surplus from January to July last year turned into a MDollars 606m deficit this year. Malaysia also faces an increase in its perennial deficit in services trade, such as shipping and insurance. There are forecasts that the deficit on the current account could widen to more than MDollars 7bn this year, compared with a deficit of MDollars 5.4bn last year. Much of the increase in imports is due to the purchase of equipment associated with a multi-billion dollar programme to develop infrastructure and relieve bottlenecks caused by years of strong economic growth. Military and commercial aircraft imports have also been heavy. Imports of consumer goods have risen by more than 20 per cent in the last quarter. Growth in consumption credit is well ahead of overall loan growth. Official statistics show that despite strong economic growth, inflation has been kept in check at well below the 4 per cent mark. But many analysts say the figures are understated: prices for foodstuffs are rising faster than government statistics suggest. The improvement on the foreign investment front cannot be disputed. In the first eight months of this year Malaysia approved more than MDollars 7.6bn of foreign investment projects in the manufacturing sector - compared to MDollars 6bn for the whole of 1993. Some investors have become wary of China's economic prospects and are switching back to what they feel are the safer economies of south-east Asia. There has also been a sudden spurt in regional investment by Japanese companies keen to escape the burden of the high yen. The downside for Malaysia is that it imports far more from Japan than from anywhere else: already the price of the Proton, the Malaysian car, made in co-operation with Mitsubishi of Japan, has had to be increased due to the surge in the yen's value. In the medium to long term there are concerns about Malaysia's ability to remain competitive with other fast emerging regional economies like Indonesia and Vietnam. Serious skills shortages constrain Malaysia's ascent up the technological ladder. A large part of Malaysia's manufacturing sector is still based on labour intensive enterprises. Labour shortages have developed in virtually every area of the economy exerting upward pressure on wages. A recent survey found that nationwide wages rose 7.3 per cent in the first six months of 1994 while productivity increased by only 2 per cent. Over the last 20 years the Malaysian economy has been transformed. Manufactured goods have replaced primary commodities as the main engine of economic growth. But Malaysia still has a narrow industrial base. Electronics and electrical appliances account for about 60 per cent of manufacturing exports. About two thirds of manufactured exports have import ratios of 60 to 80 per cent. At this stage in their economic development South Korea and Taiwan were developing their own electronics and heavy industrial companies. This is not happening in Malaysia where multinationals dominate almost every sector of the electronics industry. Professor Jomo Kwame Sundaram of the University of Malaya says that far more needs to be done to nurture the sources of industrial dynamism in Malaysia. 'Unlike Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and even Hong Kong, Malaysian industrialisation has been heavily dependent on foreign capital and technology,' says Professor Jomo. Malaysia is proud of its economic achievements of recent years. But hubris could lead to unpleasant surprises ahead.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The DIY tax bill - Income Tax Self Assessment / The Budget and You DECIDING for yourself how much tax you have to pay sounds like a dream, but some 8m people who fill in a tax return will, for the 1996/97 tax year, have the choice of assessing themselves for tax. Half are self-employed, the rest are pensioners and employees who receive tax return forms. Employees under the pay-as-you-earn system and deduction at source arrangements will not be affected. Under the proposed system, those who fill in a tax return would make their own assessment by working out how much tax is due on their income. At present they declare their income and expenditure and leave it to the Inland Revenue to calculate tax liability. 'The new system will do away with the present rigmarole of raising assessments, appeals, agreeing payments and adjustments to the final payment, which is unproductive,' said Maurice Parry-Wingfield, tax partner at Touche Ross. 'If more taxpayers understand and are more involved in their tax affairs, that can only be welcome.' Self-assessment will be made possible because the current system will be simplified. The complex 'preceding year' basis of income tax for the self-employed will be changed: if all goes to plan, all income tax will be taxed on a common current year basis from 1996/97. This means that tax from self-employment will be paid in the year in which it is earned, rather than a year later. One year will drop out of the tax calculations for the self-employed and transitional provisions will be made so that businesses will not be taxed twice. Another change is the decision to issue the self-employed with one tax statement and one tax bill for all income regardless of whether it comes from employment, freelance earnings or investment. The taxpayer will have to deal with only one tax office. The Inland Revenue says the changes are intended to make the process of tax returns and payments 'simpler and fairer.' But self-assessment has disadvantages. Those who choose it will have their tax payments brought forward since assessment will be on a current year basis and their payments to the Revenue have to be included with their completed tax assessment form. There is also the issue of 'random audits' which the revenue says is necessary to deter those hoping to pay less tax as a result of self-assessment. This would give the Inland Revenue an unrestricted right to check accounts, without giving a reason, within one year of them being filed. At present, the Inland Revenue has to tell a taxpayer why it wants to check the account. 'Most of the benefits are for the Inland Revenue and their administration,' said John Battersby, tax partner at KPMG Peat Marwick. 'They will have the prospect of money coming in more quickly as a result. Random audits mean that for a whole year after you have filed you do not not know whether your assessment will be accepted and if the Revenue challenges you, you will not know the reason.' 'I do not think it will be that wonderful,' said Martin Ben-Nathan, of chartered accountants Casson &amp; Beckman. 'You will have to work out your own tax and if you get it wrong, there will be penalties. It might be better to get the Inland Revenue to do the work.' Consultation is continuing between the Revenue, employers and representative bodies.</p>

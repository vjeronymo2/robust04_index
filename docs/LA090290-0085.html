OF NURSERYMEN ON WHAT TO DO IN THE GARDEN THIS WEEK:  </P> <P> If you have a perfect spot for a shade tree, plant it now.  </P> <P> It will become established by spring and be better able to take the heat of  next summer.  </P> <P> Now is a good time to plant pyracantha or cotoneaster shrubs with their  colorful red or orange berries.  </P> <P> September weather can cause mildew problems for roses. Spray roses for mildew.  </P> <P> For delicate looking white, pink or rose blooms this fall, plant cyclamen in  the ground or in containers in an area that doesn't receive direct sun.  </P></p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: How to get the best from your patron / Sponsorship / Antony Thorncroft gives potential sponsors - and beneficiaries - a guide to do's and don'ts ONE OF the restraints on the growth of arts sponsorship has been the mutual suspicion between arts companies and potential sponsors. Arts companies are worried about interference in creative programming. Would-be sponsors feel arts organisations are unbusinesslike. Experience suggests that sponsors have more justification for their fears than the sponsored. Here are some guidelines which might help create better relationships: Ten tips for sponsors Take advantage of government money available to encourage arts sponsorship. There is Pounds 4m a year in the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme to boost new sponsorships, as well as tax concessions for the arts in Gift Aid and Give As You Earn. Set out targets for your sponsorship. If it is to generate goodwill, fine, but do not expect wonderful publicity. Sponsored events are ten a penny and no longer news. If it is to create opportunities for corporate hospitality make sure the arts organisation has adequate facilities. If it is for marketing purposes carry out some research after the event. Most sponsors complain of poor media acknowledgement of their commitment. This can be improved if critics are personally alerted to sponsorship and its importance to arts organisation. The Royal National Theatre has adopted this approach with some success. Ensure that your guests do not numerically overwhelm a sponsored event and that they behave. In a famous case Ladbroke's actually attracted bad publicity when its guests returned late and noisy after the interval at a performance of Hamlet. Make sure that your sponsorship actually helps an arts organisation with real money. Too much spending can be taken up with promotion, consultants fees, and entertainment. This looks bad. It is bad. If you want to make a big splash as an arts sponsor the most effective way is to launch a new tailor-made event, a major competition, perhaps, or a regional touring programme. This can carry your name, or that of one of your brands. Take advice from the specialist consultancies, notably Kallaway, Crowcroft Gourley, Spero Communications, Arts &amp; Industry. Involve your workforce. In the US one development is for companies to match the money given by their employees to arts organisations. Make sure the arts programme extends throughout the country and is not concentrated on, say, London and top management. Often the best results are achieved by supporting your local theatre, or orchestra, or gallery. Have a structured programme. Don't fritter away a Pounds 250,000 budget on too many small sponsorships, or devote it to one elitist event - unless you are convinced that that is what you want. Make a fixed commitment, ideally three years, and add on another year to enable the arts company to find a new sponsor. Take risks. Backing the experimental - in theatre, dance, contemporary music and art - tends to attract a more favourable media response, and often excites guests. It gives the impression that a company is go ahead and adventurous. It can also be very cheap. Film and photography are two areas currently under-exploited by sponsors. Be enthusiastic. There is nothing worse that a sponsor going through the motions. It probably works best when the chairman, or an important director, supports his, or her, favourite art form. Their enthusiasm inspires the company. TIPS FOR THE ARTS Target the decision-maker in a potential sponsor. Companies such as British Telecom receive about 50 letters a week from arts groups seeking aid. For good or ill the most effective means of securing sponsorship is through personal contacts, getting your trustees from the Great and the Good to lean gently on businessmen they come across at work or play. Offer sponsors a range of commitments. They can sponsor one concert and entertain 50 guests for Pounds 12,000, or take an international tour for Pounds 250,000. They can sponsor a touring play in Norwich, or Taunton. Be flexible. One area of sponsorship which has largely withstood the recession is corporate help for educational, youth and community projects. Theatres such as the Tricycle Kilburn are not alone in finding this the most fruitful area for sponsorship. Money raised here acts as a good introduction to the arts group and releases funds for mainstream creative work. Seek out successful companies: the privatised industries, food and drink companies, some multinationals are doing well. Small local firms are often intrigued at the idea and every Pounds 2,000 given by the neighbourhood greengrocer or restaurant is virtually certain to be doubled by a BSIS grant for a first-time sponsor. Understand that, with the best will in the world, companies facing a dive in profits cannot be expected to continue their sponsorship indefinitely. Reckon a sponsorship to have a three-year duration, and plan accordingly, but be aware that, like Shell with the LSO, the link can extend over 20 years. Work with existing sponsors to find new sponsors Be grateful. BATS once invested around Pounds 200,000 in sponsoring an opera and failed to receive a thank-you letter for its pains. Politeness costs little but carries great weight with a sponsor. The biggest complaint of sponsors is that arts organisations are lacking in basic business skills, especially marketing skills. Be flexible where possible. Many sponsors complain that arts organisations want their money but give little in return. It is self-defeating to brandish a corporate name too ostentatiously in a theatre or concert hall but with some ingenuity the audience can be gently and amusingly made aware whose cash is helping the event happen. Explore corporate aid other than direct sponsorship. Under the Business in the Arts scheme, businessmen with useful skills, like accountants, computer specialists, and marketing personnel, are seconded by their companies to local arts organisations on a part time basis. There are also bursaries, sponsored by English Estates, which allow arts managers to pick up new business skills by attending management centres. Investigate help in kind. Companies have little spare cash at the moment but often an excess of idle goods. Airline tickets for foreign artists, cars, computer systems, could all help an arts organisation to prosper, with due credit to the suppliers. The arts should examine approaches to sponsors which make a connection seem like a good investment rather than a case of unstructured patronage. The Royal Academy does this by getting sponsors to guarantee its exhibitions against loss: a few have walked away without signing a cheque. The regional and London suburban theatres are more and more the source of West End hits. Companies could come in as Angels on selected productions. Sponsored recordings by orchestras could have greater potential, as could art shows which provide the backer with at least a corporate Christmas card and at most a commercially exploited print. Arts organisations should show business that it can speak its language. The arts should co-operate more in seeking sponsors rather than establish competitive positions, which often amounts to little more than poaching each others backers. Good links should be formed with ABSA and the Sponsorship department in the Arts Council. The Government should be lobbied, with the arts pointing out that sponsorship long ago stopped being the icing on the cake but is now a basic ingredient. One of the great dangers today is that if the Government reduces its arts subsidy sponsors, rather than making good any shortfall, will feel that their commitment over recent years has been taken for granted, and cut back their aid in proportion. Arts organisations have accepted sponsorship with amazing alacrity. Many theatre and museum directors spend too much time courting existing and potential sponsors. But the collective voice of arts organisations on sponsorship remains weak. ABSA is the spenders organisation. The recipients should join forces to make their views better known.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / 'Tailhook' prompts navy chief to quit Admiral Frank Kelso, US chief of naval operations, is to retire two months early, the victim of controversy over his alleged role in the notorious 1991 'Tailhook' convention of naval airmen held in Las Vegas. 'I became the lightning rod for Tailhook,' he told the press yesterday, 'and the lightning keeps striking.' With statements from the Pentagon's civilian command 'reaffirming my honour, integrity and leadership, we can finally close this difficult chapter,' he said. The immediate chain of events leading to the departure of the senior Navy uniformed officer started last week when a military judge dismissed charges of sexual harassment and lewd conduct against three officers on the grounds that Admiral Kelso had lied about his knowledge of incidents which he had allegedly observed in person. On Monday the admiral, clearly incensed, rebutted this ruling by releasing internal Navy documents which found no credible evidence either that he had first-hand knowledge of what went on at the convention or that he had sought to obstruct subsequent inquiries. Dozens of women, including naval officers, had complained they were molested at the convention. Earlier yesterday, after intense consultations inside the Pentagon and with the White House, Mr William Perry, defence secretary, said in a statement: 'I regard Frank Kelso as a man of the highest integrity and honour.' In similar vein, Mr John Dalton, navy secretary, who last year sought the admiral's dismissal over the affair, said that though he had 'questioned the leadership which permitted the excesses of Tailhook to take place, I have never questioned the personal integrity and honour of Frank Kelso.' With these assurances, Admiral Kelso, considered a most progressive officer, took the option of early retirement. 'It is time for me to go away,' he said,' and let the Navy have a new leader.'</p>

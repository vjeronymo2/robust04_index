			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / NatWest security probe on Lamont card disclosures THE DATA protection registrar launched an inquiry yesterday into security at National Westminster Bank's Access credit card subsidiary after apparent details of the card debts of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, were published in The Sun newspaper. The newspaper alleged that Mr Lamont had received five legal warning letters for failing to make regular payments on his Access card, and had overspent his Pounds 2,000 credit limit. Neither the Treasury nor Downing Street denied the claims, but they provoked protests from senior Tories at the intrusion into Mr Lamont's personal affairs. They also prompted an internal investigation by NatWest. Labour MPs could barely disguise their delight at the disclosure, with several asking how the chancellor could be expected to keep the nation's accounts in order if he was unable to keep track of his own. By contrast, Downing Street defended the chancellor, saying that the oversight was caused by his heavy workload and would be immediately rectified. Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman of the Commons' Treasury committee, also supported Mr Lamont saying the leak of the account's details constituted an 'outrageous' breach of customer confidentiality. 'I would expect NatWest to conduct a very rigorous inquiry to find who it is in their organisation who has been disclosing this sort of information,' he said. In spite of the protests, the revelations are an embarrassment to the chancellor. His judgment has attracted some criticism over the years, most recently when he left the Grand Hotel in Brighton after the Conservative party conference without paying his Pounds 900 bill. The bill was later settled in full. Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, said he was investigating the incident under the 1984 Data Protection Act. If the bank or any of its employees are found to have breached the act, they could face an unlimited fine in the High Court. Mr Howe said he would ask an inspector to investigate the incident under two sections of the act. 'I am concerned that if there is substance in this report, other people's financial details could be at risk,' he said. Like other companies and individuals using computers to store personal data, NatWest has to register the use to which it intends to put information. It also has to follow a series of 'data protection principles'. The bank or any of its employees could be fined either for using data for an unregistered purpose, or for breaching the principle that any organisation should have 'appropriate security' to prevent the unauthorised use of data. The maximum fine on either count in a magistrate's court is Pounds 500, but the registrar can ask for the case to be heard in the High Court. The registrar makes about 50 enforcement orders to encourage data users to improve security each year. NatWest said it was launching its own inquiry into the apparent disclosure of the information. It said it took very seriously unauthorised disclosure of any data, but it was not yet clear that the bank was at fault.</p>

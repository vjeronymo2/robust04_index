			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hamlet will have near Pounds 40m valuation HAMLET GROUP, the clothes importer supplying the UK retail trade, will have a market capitalisation of Pounds 38.8m after its flotation next month. The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, shows that a total of 15.4m ordinary shares are to be placed at 130p per share. The historic p/e ratio at the issue price is 11.5 and the gross yield 5.5 per cent on a notional net dividend of 5.8p for the year to March, 1993. After the float, there will be 29.8m shares in issue. Hamlet began life as a family concern in the late 1960s. Last year a buy-out left management and Causeway Capital with 80 per cent and Southend Property with 20 per cent. The company is raising Pounds 14.4m via its placing and intermediaries offer, which closes next Wednesday. This will enable it to redeem its preference shares for Pounds 6.92m and give it Pounds 6.9m of additional working capital. Further, existing shareholders are selling 4.29m shares valued at Pounds 5.58m. Beeson Gregory, the sponsor, said that directors who were selling were disposing of less than half their stakes. After the flotation, existing shareholders will retain 14.46m ordinary shares, or 48.4 per cent of the enlarged capital. Causeway is redeeming its preference shares, but holding on to 22 per cent of the group's ordinary shares. Hamlet reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 3.1m) on turnover of Pounds 58.9m (Pounds 32.8m) in the year to March.</p>

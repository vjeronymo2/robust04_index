			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Estuarine Standard Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter thought the Service should not adopt EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bay/Delta water quality standards as part of the designation of critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat for the delta smelt. The commenter asserted that because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service had not described the biological relevance of the standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopting the standards would be ``throwing water at the problem''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter thought EPA's criteria were developed to serve non-habitat purposes, reasoning that their purpose was to remove organisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from risk of mortality at the pumps. Another commenter thought flow,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than salinity or the location of the entrapment zone, was a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate parameter to protect the western Delta and Suisun Marsh. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter at the public hearings believed the Service should not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected such a strict standard of salinity (2 ppt) for the delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt's critical habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service does not adopt EPA's water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards in the designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service identifies water quality (salinity) as a primary constituent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> element to protect and recover the delta smelt. This point is described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in detail in comment 27, below, and is clarified in the section entitled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Primary Constituent Elements'' in this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has considered and discussed the biological relevance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's water quality standards. The biological relevance of providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ample estuarine habitat for the delta smelt was first discussed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original proposed designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991. The biological significance of salinity in the Estuary was again  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in the sections entitled ``Revisions to the October 3, 1991,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Critical Habitat Proposal'', ``Habitat Requirements'', and ``Primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Constituent Elements'' in the January 6, 1994, revised proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation of critical habitat. These sections discuss the habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the delta smelt, the need for temporal and spatial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variability of low-salinity waters in the Estuary, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification of primary constituent elements essential for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery of the smelt. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the above cited discussions illustrate, EPA's water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards were developed to mimic historical habitat conditions and were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not developed to simply serve non-habitat purposes. The standards may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidentally serve ``non-habitat'' purposes by removing organisms from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk of mortality at the pumps. This topic is discussed in this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule in the ``Primary Constituent Element'' section for larval and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> juvenile transport. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requiring flows to maintain salinity at critical locations in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delta will not be ``throwing water at the problem.'' The Service has used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the best scientific data available to prescribe conditions that will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitate the recovery of the delta smelt, relying on scientific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence and testimony presented during the State Board's 1992 hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process, as well as information from the Service and the panel of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientists who participated in the San Francisco Estuary Project (SFEP). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Act and its regulations, the Service may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refer to either flow or salinity as water quality criteria when critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat is designated for the delta smelt. Because the Act is flexible,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Service may accomplish recovery in a variety of ways, so long as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed species are recovered. With critical habitat defined, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service must identify the physical and biological features essential to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the conservation of the species, and which may require special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management considerations or protection. A primary constituent element  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may include either water quality or water quantity. Special management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations include ``any methods or procedures useful in protecting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical and biological features of the environment for the conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a listed species.'' (50 CFR 424.12(b); 424.02(j)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the best available information, the Service concludes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the criteria are necessary to protect and recover the delta smelt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delta smelt are associated with the freshwater edge of the mixing zone,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the salinity is approximately 2 ppt (Ganssle 1966, Moyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993). In most years, the majority of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delta smelt population lives at salinities of less than 2 ppt for most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the year (Moyle 1976, Ganssle 1966). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 2:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although several water purveyors agreed with EPA that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is a relationship between the average position of the 2 ppt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> isohaline and the health of the Estuary, they believed that the Roe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Island criterion was too protective and should be abolished. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another commenter thought the water quality standards as proposed by EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were not protective enough of the delta smelt (addressed in comment 7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters thought that requiring compliance at Roe Island may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) reduce the within-year variability in hydrology in Suisun Bay, thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having an adverse impact on the biology of the Estuary; (2) place the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entrapment zone too far downstream of Suisun Bay, thereby pushing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phytoplankton and delta smelt out past Carquinez Strait into San Pablo  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bay; and (3) either greatly benefit or adversely affect native and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduced estuarine species by enhancing or adversely affecting habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity and quality. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To the extent feasible, maintenance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> near-historical water quality conditions at Roe Island is essential to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery of the delta smelt. Not only is it important to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low-salinity conditions at critical locations in the Estuary depending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the life-stage of the delta smelt, but also to simulate year-to-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural spring storm cycles so that natural processes and historical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions can be mimicked in the Estuary. The water quality standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed by EPA, including criteria at Roe Island, Chipps Island, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence, were developed to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both within-year and between-year variability in salinity levels,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristic of the Estuary in the late 1960's and early 1970's. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variability does not currently occur frequently enough in the Estuary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain estuarine processes, because the construction of water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conveyance facilities in the Central Valley and Delta, as well as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of diversions and upstream dams, have reduced and dampened  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual fluctuations in Delta outflow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A low-salinity reference point at Roe Island will provide within-year and year-to-year variability essential to maintenance of a healthy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estuary. Requiring salinity be maintained intermittently at Roe Island  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also will provide flows to carry juvenile fish from the Delta downstream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Suisun Bay, and will maximize nutrient inputs from Suisun Marsh and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the shallows of Suisun Bay into the mixing zone. Providing periodic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low-salinity water at Roe Island will significantly increase the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area of medium to low-salinity nursery habitat available for delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt. Spring storm events are also beneficial to aquatic resources of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Estuary, providing areas of flooded vegetation for the spawning of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some estuarine species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the 2 ppt isohaline is needed sporadically at Roe Island  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to mimic seasonal variability of Delta flow to deter the invasion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduced species. The lack of seasonal and yearly variability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delta outflows has contributed to the invasions of introduced species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because variable salinity is one of the dominant features of an estuary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensuring natural variability in the Estuary can only benefit native  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estuarine species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

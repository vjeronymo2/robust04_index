			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Generali pulls Milan to new 1992 low MILAN reached a new low for the year while bargain-hunting lifted Paris, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN was pulled to a 1992 low by Generali in technical trading on the final day of the June account. The Comit index fell 4.06 to 468.79 in turnover estimated at more than Monday's L65.8bn as the screen-based trading system came back into operation. Many stocks are due to go ex-dividend at the start of the new account today, including Eridania and Burgo. Dealers said there was no specific reason for the L350 fall in Generali to L28,000, other than end-account position squaring. Among other larger stocks, Fiat closed L45 higher at L5,245, but then slipped back to L5,215 later. Sip was heavily traded, losing L39.50 to L1,311 in technical trading. PARIS saw some bargain-hunting in blue chips such as Suez, up FFr4 to FFr314, LVMH, FFr30 higher at FFr3,930, and Alcatel, up FFr5 at FFr633; but trading remained modest. The CAC 40 index rose 13.27 to 1,931.41, in turnover of FFr1.8bn. Total fell FFr7.70, anticipating the fact that it is going ex dividend of FFr7 today. Late on Monday the government said that it would sell 12.4 per cent of Total's share capital by July 10 to domestic and international investors. Among smaller stocks, the home appliance maker, Moulinex, fell FFr3.60 to FFr157.50 in spite of news that its UK unit had entered a joint venture with Regal of the US, a move which won favour with analysts. The company also said that it might raise capital and issue bonds in order to expand. FRANKFURT had another quiet day yesterday, as it approached Thursday's holiday and Friday's options expiry. Turnover fell from DM4.4bn to DM4.1bn as the FAZ index rose 0.87 to 909.10 at midsession, and the DAX by 5.20 to 1,779.10 at the close. The construction group, Philipp Holzmann, down DM30 on Monday, roared back with a rise of DM70 to DM1,155 on a strong gain in group operating profits, and expectations for further earnings gains in 1992. In retailing, Asko rose DM26 to DM748 after a fall from DM838 at the end of May. In both cases, said Ms Heidemarie Hoppner of B Metzler in Frankfurt, there were indications that a selling order had been completed on Monday. The special situation of the day was Schaerf, the office furniture company, which raised the dividend by DM1, added a DM3 bonus, produced much better than expected earnings and encouraged Metzler to take its current earnings estimate up from DM25 to DM36.50. The shares rose DM29 to DM429. ZURICH ended a moderately active session with the SMI index 15.6 higher at 1,881.3. Slightly lower money market rates, strong SMI futures and good performances elsewhere in Europe supported sentiment. Alusuisse, the chemicals and aluminium group, topped the active list as the bearers rose SFr9 to SFr522. Roche certificates came second with a gain of SFr50 to SFr3,380. The pharmaceuticals group is launch an American Depositary Receipt program in about four weeks. AMSTERDAM improved with a little more activity in view than on Monday. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.4 higher at 128.8. A stronger dollar helped sentiment with Royal Dutch improving Fl 1.30 to Fl 159.10 and Unilever gaining Fl 2.20 to Fl 187.00, a buy note from a UK broker giving the latter an extra lift. KLM lost 10 cents to Fl 39.20, some analysts noting that the airline's decision not to cut fares on its transatlantic route was unlikely to have a big impact. MADRID rose, a buy program in the last half hour of trade helping to boost volume. The general index closed 1.90 higher at 248.78. Agroman gained Pta70 to Pta1,060 on rumours that Banesto, up Pta50 to Pta2,725, was planning to sell its 50 per cent stake in the construction group. STOCKHOLM closed fractionally higher after profit-taking wiped out earlier gains inspired by better than expected four-month results from Svenska Handelsbanken. The Affarsvarlden General index ended 2.0 higher at 950.10 with Handelsbanken B SKr1.50 lower at SKr53. COPENHAGEN quivered as central bank sales of bonds at below-market prices damaged sentiment already beset by persistent concern over Denmark's future in the European Community. The CSE index fell 2.51 to 322.91, a new low for the year, Danske Bank falling DKr6 to DKr275 and Unidanmark DKr9 to DKr163. Danish banks have large bond holdings and take unrealised gains or losses on bond and share holdings into their profit and loss accounts. OSLO's poor performance continued with the all share index closing 3.11 lower at 428.62 in turnover of NKr221m. The insurance sector remained positive with UNI Storebrand gaining NKr0.50 to NKr42.50. HELSINKI held as Huhtamaki, the consumer products group, rose FM5 to FM128 on sharply higher four-month profits. The Hex index rose 0.5 to 791.8.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100 - Jun 16  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1164.27  1164.33  1164.52  1163.68  1163.74  1164.26  1165.20  1165.38  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Day's High  1165.90    Day's Low  1163.34  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Jun 15       Jun 12       Jun 11       Jun 10       Jun 9       1159.75      1167.48      1162.52      1174.58      1174.96  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

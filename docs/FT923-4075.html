			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Inquiry into medical fees: Senior figure to head team MR PETER DEAN, a deputy chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, will chair the inquiry into the supply of private medical services. Mr Dean, aged 53, is a freelance business consultant and was an executive director of RTZ, the mining group, from 1974 to 1985. He is a solicitor and a non-executive director of Associated British Ports Holdings and Liberty Life Assurance Company. He became a member of the MMC in 1982 and was also a member of the British Transport Docks Board in 1980-82. His recreations in Who's Who are listed as choral singing and skiing. He was unable to comment on his appointment yesterday because he was recovering from an eye operation. A further group of between three and six people will be chosen later this week to run the investigation. They will gather written information, and also invite oral representation to a series of hearings.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour revolt on EC vote FRESH evidence of muscle-flexing by Labour backbenchers emerged last night after more than 60 MPs were reported to have signed a round robin calling on the party leadership to rethink its tactics on next week's Maastricht debate, Ivo Dawnay writes. Lobbying led by Mr Dennis Skinner, the veteran leftwinger, has mustered support on all sides of the party for a rethink of Labour's decision to abstain once the bill, ratifying the European Community treaty changes, is put to a vote. Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, and Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary, argued vigorously at a parliamentary Labour party meeting on Wednesday that voting against the bill would contradict Labour's election stance on the Maastricht agreement and the stand it had taken in early votes. It would also prove an albatross at the next election, they said. Eight MPs argued from various viewpoints that the party could justify voting against the bill because of its failure to include UK involvement in community forums.</p>

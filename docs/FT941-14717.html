			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Arts: Today's Television For once the waterfall of publicity preceding a new series is justified. The Day Today is yet another example of Radio 4 serving as a forcing house for television comedy. The radio series 'On The Hour' is wickedly funny because it mocks other programes not for their content but their style. It does this with such accuracy that the listeners' reaction programme, Feedback, has received letters of complaint which assume 'On The Hour' is the real thing, whatever the week's target: news, sport, religion and so on. Now producers Armando Ianucci and Chris Morris and impressionist/comedian Steve Coogan have brought the idea to television and tonight's targets include sports round-ups and those ghastly 'video boobs' programmes (9.00 BBC2). That is followed by Part 2 of Middlemarch in which Dorothea's marriage, doomed from the outset, gets stickier, and young Dr Lydgate discovers his enemies when he becomes head of the fever hospital (9.30 BBC2). Building Sights USA at 8.50 on BBC2 features Frank Lloyd Wright's 'Ennis-Brown House'.</p>

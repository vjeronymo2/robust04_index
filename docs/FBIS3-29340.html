			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Ang] </F>   [Text] Mitsubishi Petrochemical, one of Japan's largest  chemical producers, is taking a 30 percent stake in the Shell  group's $750 million [Singapore currency] styrene  monomer/propylene oxide project in Singapore.    A Shell spokesman said yesterday that the two parties have  agreed in principle to team up for the proposed project, which  is a part of a $4 billion plan to expand Singapore's  petrochemical complex. But the joint venture agreement is to be  signed only after the larger expansion plans for the  petrochemical complex are finalised. Details of these plans,  delayed since last year, are likely to be ironed out in the next  few weeks.    In essence, Shell's deal with Mitsubishi will see the two  chemical giants form a joint venture -- Seraya Chemical  Singapore. Shell will own 70 percent, and Mitsubishi, 30  percent, of the company which will build a styrene  monomer/propylene oxide plant on Pulau Seraya. The new plant  will produce 310,000 tons of styrene monomer and 140,0000 tons  of propylene oxide per year. These petrochemicals are used in a  wide range of products including packaging materials, toys and  electrical goods.    Construction is scheduled to begin next month, with  completion and a trial production run slated for the second  quarter of 1997. Raw materials for the proposed plant will come  from the main petrochemical complex on an adjacent island, Pulau  Ayer Merbau.    For Mitsubishi, the tie-up with Shell will help it establish  overseas production bases and avoid both rising production costs  and flat petrochemical demand in Japan. The group said in a  statement issued in Tokyo on Monday that its decision to take a  stake in Shell's project is prompted by the need to keep tight  reins on its competitive edge.    Also, Mitsubishi's existing styrene monomer capacity of  480,000 tons per annum, largely exported to Southeast Asian  markets, could be insufficient to meet future demand growth in  these markets. Under the Shell-Mitsubishi agreement, the  Japanese group will be entitled to 95,000 tons of styrene  monomer and 42,000 tons of propylene oxide per year. Mitsubishi  said it plans to sell the bulk of these products in Southeast  Asia.    On Shell's part, the latest joint venture will further  deepen  its ties with its Japanese partner. The Anglo-Dutch group  already holds a 20 percent stake in Mitsubishi Petrochemical. A  Shell spokesman said Mitsubishi could help contribute capital  and additional marketing channels for the new plant's products.</p>

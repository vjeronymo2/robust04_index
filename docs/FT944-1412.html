			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Ahold's US properties may be put into investment fund Ahold, the Dutch food retail group which operates six supermarket chains in the US, may hive off some of its US properties into a property investment fund. A decision on the fund, which would be opened to participation from institutional rather than private investors, is expected in early 1995. The company is discussing the idea with Dutch institutional investors. Ahold declined to say how much money it hoped to raise through the investment fund. However, it said it was not likely to seek a listing for the fund. The company operates 600 supermarkets in the eastern US, making it one of the 10 largest food retailers in the country. Some of these properties are owned outright, while others are leased. A study into a US property fund got under way several weeks ago, in response to keen interest among Dutch institutional investors for new property funds, particularly in the US. Ahold said it was too early to say how many of the properties on which its US supermarkets are located might be transfered to the fund. It would not comment on a report in the Dutch property trade magazine Vast Goed Markt which said the fund would start with assets of Dollars 100m divided over 10 supermarket properties. The company's 600 US stores are in six regional chains from South Carolina to New England. The US supermarkets generate about half of Ahold's annual turnover.</p>

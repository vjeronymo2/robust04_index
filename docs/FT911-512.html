			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Markets: The New York barometer registers cloudy - Wall Street THE QUALITY of life in New York City, which gloom-mongers suggest has been deteriorating ever since the Dutch planted their flag at the foot of Manhattan, is about to take another turn for the worse. David Dinkins, the mayor, went on television this week to warn that unless people rallied to solve his budget crisis, the city would be facing unpleasant cuts in services. One in four street lights would be extinguished - in a metropolis where gun-toting teenagers have taken to murdering people for the very coats off their backs. Numerous homeless shelters would close - in a city which has so many beggars and deranged wandering its streets that cynics call it the leading capital of the Third World. Even Central Park zoo would have to close. Some of this may be brinkmanship, but there is no doubting that New York's finances are in serious difficulties as the recession that has swept through the north east, and on to the rest of the US, undermines its tax base. New York's fiscal crisis is hardly new, but the spotlight thrown on it this week by the mayor's appeal does raise some wider questions about the strength of the US equity market. For New York is not alone: across the US, cities and states are desperately trying to balance their budgets, and are doing so by slashing jobs and services and raising taxes. Serious cuts in Government spending hardly seem conducive to the sustained recovery in consumer confidence which economists are hoping will start moving the US out of recession some time over the next few months. Yet current equity prices, which are discounting a gradual second half economic recovery, leading to a much stronger rebound in 1992, allow little for the possibility that the recovery timescale could be substantially slower than this. Why is Wall Street ignoring the fiscal evidence in front of its nose ? One reason is that New York is not particularly representative of the US as a whole, since for structural reasons the recession has hit the north east much harder than other regions. Another is the belief that the Federal Reserve will keep on cutting interest rates until the economy is bound to start rallying. Third, there is a gathering body of statistical evidence to suggest that the recession may indeed be bottoming and that inflation is sufficiently under control to allow further scope for Fed easing. But that evidence is hardly conclusive, and the overstretched nature of the financial system (banks with huge bad loan portfolios and consumers already loaded down debt) mean that even if the trough is nigh, the economy could yet spend months bumping along the bottom. A fourth reason is simply Wall Street's congenital optimism. Fund managers who gather in investors' cash, on the strength of their ability to make the money multiply, have to believe for the sake of their sanity that growth is just around the corner. This Panglossian predisposition has been much in evidence over the past two months, with stocks rallying on the merest sliver of good news, but failing to react strongly to bad, in the belief that poor statistics will merely encourage the Fed to stand ready as rescuer of last resort. Much is being made by the optimists of the equity market's historic predictive powers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, it is said, has been an accurate leading indicator of every economic recovery since before the Second World War, and that is precisely what it is now. However, there are sceptics who question whether this still holds true in a share trading world transformed in the 1980s by the advent of futures markets, program trading and indexed funds. And even if the Dow is accurately predicting a recovery, the precise timing remains in doubt and, in investment, timing is all. The main corporate news on Wall Street this week was agreement after a five-month battle on a takeover of NCR, the fifth largest computer manufacturer in the US, by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which hopes the deal will help it turn around its loss- making computer arm. AT&amp;T had to pay out Dollars 110 a share to clinch agreement, compared to its initial Dollars 90 hostile offer. The battle underlined how difficult it is for a target to escape a determined and deep-pocketed bidder - in spite of all the takeover barriers erected by companies in the 1980s. But having paid a full price, AT&amp;T now has to convince a sceptical world that it can break a long-established pattern of unsuccessful computer mergers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Monday      2941.64   +2.8 Tuesday     2917.49  -24.15 Wednesday   2930.9   +13.41 Thursday    2971.15  +40.25 Friday      2920.17  -50.98  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

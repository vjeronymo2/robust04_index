			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "K.P.": "KERM Adopted a Program of Cooperation </F> With the East; Fifty Percent of Export Growth by 1997"]    [Text] The Council of Ministers' Economic Committee  [KERM] has prepared a time schedule for measures that are  necessary for an increase in Polish exports. Speeding up the  rate of trade with the East is regarded as especially  important.    KERM adopted a program entitled "Principles of Economic  Cooperation Policies With Countries of the East and East Asia,"  which is an integral part of "Programs Supporting Eastern  Policies," which is being recommended to the Council of  Ministers.    In recent years, our trade exchange with countries of the  former USSR and some countries of the East has suffered a  substantial decline.    According to the principles adopted by KERM, at least a  partial reconstruction of our economic relations with the East  is to become an important element of Poland's trade policies  (this applies also to the fast-growing countries of the Pacific  region and China). As Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko  said, Polish exports in that direction should be increasing at a  clearly faster rate than exports to the remaining countries of  the world. The deputy prime minister insists that we should  continue trading despite the fact that sometimes transactions  are dangerous and that there are problems with payments, while  barter constitutes a significant portion (35 percent) of the  exchange.    Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko's assumption is that Poland's  economic growth will be occurring through increased exports. He  said he believes that growth will continue at a level of  approximately 4.5 percent. But, for exports to be "the motor"  of general economic growth, the rate of development of exports  must exceed by half the rate of development of the economy in  general. The structure of our exports should be changed toward  greater participation of investment goods. A negative balance  of payments in merchandise and monetary exchange (which is in  the range of $700 to $800 million) is also a disadvantageous  phenomenon. Kolodko expects trade exchange with that region of  the world to reach the amount of $7.6 to $7.8 billion by 1997  (as compared with approximately $5 billion currently, which is  40 percent of the amount from 1990).    In the assessment of KERM, direct reserves of increases in  exports eastward have already been exhausted. It was announced  that a review of procedures applied in returning taxes (VAT  [value-added tax], customs duties, investment breaks) associated  with financing cooperation with that region shall be implemented  over the next five weeks. Interest rates on credits in  investment exports shall be subsidized. Principles of payment  with Eastern partners will also be put in order. Systemwide  protection of the exchange is being prepared (setting in motion  guarantees provided by the Corporation for Export Credit  Insurance). A fund for state-provided guarantees in this kind  of trade is said to reach the amount of $1.1 billion.</p>

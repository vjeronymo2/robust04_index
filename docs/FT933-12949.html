			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Clarke hails 'all-round' upturn: Chancellor renews warning that tax rises may be needed to cut deficit BRITAIN is experiencing an 'all-round recovery' that was 'good and balanced so far', Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said yesterday as new figures confirmed rising business activity in Britain's high streets and a narrowing trade gap. But Mr Clarke warned that growth this year would not suffice to cut the budget deficit as much as needed. He said that 'further government action' might be necessary in another indication that the government is considering raising taxes while limiting public expenditure in its first unified Budget in November. In a two-hour session before the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee, Mr Clarke said the size of the deficit - estimated by the Treasury in March at Pounds 50bn in 1993-94 - was 'the biggest single thing' that he had to tackle. Unless the deficit was reduced, recovery would be constrained and it might be difficult to keep interest rates down, he said. The chancellor disclosed that the Budget would be on November 30, but told the committee he had not yet started to think about its specific contents. However, he did say the Conservative party preferred to have indirect taxation take a bigger share of the tax burden than direct taxes. Mr Clarke was careful not to sound euphoric about Britain's present economic performance, at one point describing the recovery as 'incipient'. But his testimony to the committee, just two months after he moved into Number 11 Downing Street, came at the end of a fortnight of favourable economic indicators and shortly before provisional figures tomorrow are expected to show good growth in gross domestic product in the second quarter. Figures yesterday showing a surprisingly strong jump in retail sales and strong export growth added to evidence that the UK recovery is not as vulnerable as initially expected. Seasonally adjusted retail sales volumes rose 1.3 per cent in June for a 3.9 per cent increase on the corresponding month last year, the Central Statistical Office reported. Other official figures showed that the value of exports to countries outside the European Community jumped to their highest ever levels last month, reducing the non-EC trade deficit to Pounds 613m, its narrowest since July 1991. The figures added to sterling's recent strength, with the pound closing in London  3/4 of a pfennig higher against the D-Mark at DM2.5725. Against the dollar it was just over a cent higher at Dollars 1.5145, with little change against either currency in New York. Several MPs asked Mr Clarke if he was worried that sterling's recent rise would hurt recovery. But the chancellor said the pound's rise since he took office had been 'modest' and reflected 'underlying economic reality' such as the healthier performance of the economy. Mr Clarke said inflationary pressures in Britain were weak but pointed out that forecasters envisaged inflation rising by the end of the year. Yesterday's economic news failed to enthuse the stock market, partly because investors saw less chance of an early interest rate cut. The FTSE 100 share index dropped 9.8 to 2814.1.

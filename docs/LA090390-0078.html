			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARD TIMES HAVE ROCK PROMOTERS SINGING THE BLUES  </P> <P> After selling out arenas in more than two dozen cities earlier this year, the  New Kids on the Block pop group was so confident their box office would  continue to boom that they scheduled two concerts this month at 50,000-seat  Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> But after a four-month marketing effort that included promotional tie-ins with  McDonald's restaurants and local radio stations, promoter MCA Concerts canceled  the second show for the group, which is one of the hottest in the nation.  </P> <P> Marc Bension, president of MCA Concerts, a subsidiary of the entertainment  conglomerate MCA Inc., said New Kids didn't want to do an extra show. Yet with  only days to go before the Sept. 14 event, MCA was still advertising tickets  for the single show.  </P> <P> Rock 'n' roll promoters are facing turbulent times as they get squeezed by  higher costs, a dearth of music superstars with staying power and a fickle  generation of teen-agers who -- in the 1990s -- have video games, MTV and other  post-Woodstock diversions to compete with live concerts.  </P> <P> In the past decade, nearly half a dozen California promoters have gone out of  business, including Pacific Concerts, which folded three years after being  established in 1986, said Jacobs Moss, general manager of Avalon Productions,  Southern California's largest independent concert promoter.  </P> <P> Those still in business are having a tough time.  </P> <P> Slow ticket sales recently prompted Bill Graham, perhaps the nation's  best-known concert promoter, to move a show featuring the Ramones, Debbie Harry  and two other groups from the 15,000-seat Arco Arena in Sacramento to the  2,250-seat Warfield Theater in San Francisco.  </P> <P> A Labor Day weekend concert that was to feature 50 acts -- including Tanya  Tucker and Tony! Toni! Tone! -- in San Bernardino had sold just 20,000 of  90,000 tickets a day before the show, promoter Michael Scafuto said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, ticket prices in the past 18 months -- paced by the Rolling Stones'  then-record $30 tickets in 1989 -- have jumped 20% to an average of more than  $20 as promoters have scrambled to cover higher costs of talent, insurance and  facilities.  </P> <P> "The cost of going to shows has gotten so high, people can't afford to go to  concerts every month," said Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the concert promotion  trade magazine Pollstar.  </P> <P> "I am concerned about the concert industry in the long run," added Peter  Patton, assistant manager of the Richfield (Ohio) Coliseum. "I don't know if  we'll ever get back to the days of having the number of concerts we used to. We  are experiencing worse business in terms of ticket sales," he said, citing a  recent Linda Ronstadt concert.  </P> <P> Long considered a glamorous enterprise, albeit one in which reliable financial  figures are hard to come by, concert promotion today is undergoing dramatic  change as promoters and musical groups pay more attention to the bottom line to  reduce the financial risk in a business that's long been known for its cyclical  nature.  </P> <P> Although Pollstar estimates that the top 100 moneymaking concerts generated  $110 million in ticket sales in the first six months of this year, compared to  $64 million in the first half of 1989, the midyear tally was boosted by a  larger-than-normal number of tours from superstars who rarely go on the road,  such as Paul McCartney, Madonna and Janet Jackson. Moneymaking concert tours  have fallen off sharply this summer, and most experts say they expect fewer  successful concerts the next few years.  </P> <P> "I think the business has been in a trend toward fewer concerts across the  country," said MCA's Bension. "I think the MTV argument is a valid one. Bands  get TV exposure, and they burn out more quickly."  </P> <P> Already, touring has fallen off in secondary markets such as Richmond, Va.,  said Peter Luukko, a regional vice president for Spectacor Management Group,  which operates 22 arenas around the country. Although major markets such as Los  Angeles and New York still attract brisk business, promoters say they're  meeting resistance to high ticket prices, and they're becoming reluctant to  promote acts that aren't superstars.  </P> <P> In the old days, promoters lavished time and money developing bands, starting  them out in small clubs and moving them up. By doing so, bands developed a  loyal following and were considered a long-term investment. Money flowed so  freely that few promoters balked at artists' demands for expensive  accommodations or paying expenses for "groupies" and other concert hangers-on.  </P> <P> But today, promoters and facility operators are streamlining their business to  cut out middlemen, protect their margins and control more links in the concert  chain.  </P> <P> "The groupies have been replaced by MBAs," said Moss of Avalon. "The amounts of  money that are on the line today demand that everybody be more businesslike and  professional."  </P> <P> Spectacor's Luukko said settlement of the $9.3 million in ticket receipts from  last year's Rolling Stones concert at the Los Angeles Coliseum took just 20  minutes with the aid of the band accountant's portable computer. Years ago,  Luukko said, he often stayed up until 3 a.m. haggling over ticket receipts with  band financial personnel who were often intoxicated or inept.  </P> <P> Concert promotion began changing about a decade ago, when the advent of cable  television's 24-hour rock music channel, MTV, enabled musicians to become stars  without having to go on lengthy tours to meet fans face-to-face, according to  promoter Graham.  </P> <P> Faced with the new video competition, promoters and facilities operators fought  back, trying to make concerts more enjoyable.  </P> <P> They rushed to build open-air amphitheaters, which were not only cheaper to  construct than enclosed arenas but offered concert-goers outdoor ambience with  their music. And promoters made it easier to buy tickets by using agents, such  as Los Angeles-based Ticketmaster, that market tickets nationwide with  computers and an army of telephone sales people.  </P> <P> Artists changed too.  </P> <P> To compete with TV, they added special effects to increase the visual spectacle  at live concerts. Lasers, smoke bombs and other gimmicks are now commonplace at  shows.  </P> <P> But while promoters and artists worked on making concert-going easier and more  entertaining, they were getting squeezed by rising costs, particularly for  insurance, talent fees and facility rentals.  </P> <P> Since 1985, for example, liability insurance for concerts has more than  tripled, according to Alicefay Prine, vice president of Marsh &amp; McLennan  Worldwide, a New York-based business insurance broker. Insurers now charge  between 15 cents and 30 cents a person for $1 million of liability coverage.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, artists who once got a flat payment from promoters now often receive  a guaranteed fee, a percentage of ticket sales and income from merchandising  deals, said Richard Walters, a vice president at Famous Artists Agency, which  represents over 150 artists, including New Kids on the Block.  </P> <P> Talent fees are negotiable and can vary dramatically according to artist, venue  and even time of year. But artists who got $25,000 to $50,000 a decade ago to  perform can now make 10 times that, promoters say.  </P> <P> Typically, a major artist now gets 50% to 70% of gross ticket receipts, experts  say. Of that percentage, the artist's agent and manager get 25%. The remaining  30% to 50% of receipts go to the promoter, who must pay insurance fees,  facility rental, security and advertising.  </P> <P> Based on those rough figures, the Rolling Stones and their managers may have  received as much as $60 million from the estimated $98 million in ticket sales  generated in their 33-city concert tour last year. Neither representatives of  the group, which was without an agent at the time, nor promoter BCL  Entertainment of Toronto could be reached to comment on Pollstar's financial  estimates of the tour, which don't include income from merchandising deals.  </P> <P> The national promotion deal that BCL brokered with the Stones, and the huge  sums of money they paid for the group, are troubling signs of how the concert  business may be changing, some observers say.  </P> <P> "When you are spending X millions of dollars for the Rolling Stones, what's  going to happen with the other (less well-known) artists?" Bension asked  rhetorically. "This type of operation is not going to buy the Tracy Chapmans of  the world. But (such artists) need exposure too."  </P> <P> With promoters such as BCL offering huge sums of money to major acts for a  national tour, less well-financed local promoters are being squeezed out.  </P> <P> They are being replaced by big outfits such as MCA Concerts, Bill Graham  Presents and Ft. Lauderdale-based Cellar Door Co., as well as arena operators  such as Ogden Allied Facility Services that are developing their own staffs to  book and promote talent.  </P> <P> These promoters have stayed afloat financially by cutting costs.  </P> <P> MCA, Graham, Avalon and many other major promoters, for instance, have been  buying more of the amphitheaters where they stage concerts.  </P> <P> Theoretically, said Bension of MCA Concerts, a promoter who owns his own  facility could lose money on the concert but make a profit overall when arena  rental, merchandising, parking and other fees are figured in.  </P> <P> Yet with costs continuing to rise, such vertical integration may not be enough.  </P> <P> "Everybody's margins are getting squeezed today," Spectacor's Luukko said.  "Promoters are paying more for talent; buildings are getting more favorable  rental deals; tickets cost a lot more. About the only person coming out ahead  is the act. . . . Maybe I should go on stage."  </P></p>

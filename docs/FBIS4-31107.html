			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "bog, mh, rk": "Vojtech Bugar: Agreements Are </F> Being Successively Fulfilled"]    [Excerpt] Bratislava--According to a CTK report, Miklos  Duray, chairman of the Coexistence Movement, said in Lucenec on  28 May that Moravcik's government was not keeping the promises  it had given the Hungarian political parties when it came into  being. According to Coexistence representatives, the present  government should sign the European charters on local  self-administration and regional languages by September.  According to Duray, if the government fails to sign the two  documents, Coexistence will consider whether it wants to  continue supporting the government. We have asked  representatives of the coalition parties whether the agreement  between the coalition and the Hungarian parties is being  fulfilled and whether the commitment to sign the two  aforementioned European charters forms part of the agreement.    Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian Christian  Democratic Movement: It is true that we would be glad if  the two charters were signed, and it does not matter whether  this happens in September or October. However, this issue is  not part of the agreements between the coalition and us. In  other words, we cannot demand that the government sign the  documents. The eight points of the agreement that we discussed  during the government's formation are being successively  fulfilled. They could be fulfilled quicker, in our opinion, but  claiming that the government is not fulfilling our demands is  too strong a statement. The passage of the law on [birth,  marriage, and death] registers and the prepared law on bilingual  signs furnish clear evidence of the fulfillment of mutual  agreements. Even a blind person must see that. Therefore, I  cannot agree with Mr. Duray's view published in the press.  Ultimately, his words will be abused by the opposition and the  mass media, which is unfortunate. This will complicate our  efforts to prove that the ethnic Hungarian parties are capable  of effective cooperation with the Slovak Government. We do not  have the moral right to link the support of Jozef Moravcik's  government to the signing of the aforementioned European  charters because such an agreement simply does not exist.    Jozef Moravcik, chairman of Democratic Union:  During the formation of the government, we held talks with the  Hungarian parties and explained to them the government's coarse  of action in matters that are of interest to them. The result  of these talks was that everything on which we agree would be  contained in the government's policy statement, which is what  happened. There exists no other document, apart from the policy  statement, in which we would commit ourselves to something. I  see no reason for the Hungarian side to arrive at the conclusion  that was suggested by Mr. Duray--that is, to stop supporting  this government.    Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic  Movement: The present government coalition's promise to the  Hungarian parties was that we would meet the Council of Europe  recommendations--that is, we would resolve the problem of  Christian and family names and the problem of bilingual signs.  We also agreed that we would not deal before the elections with  the issue of alternative education and the territorial and  administrative arrangement. At the same time, we have not  abandoned these ideas. There exists no written document about  all of this. The coalition did not undertake to sign the  European charters on local self-administration and regional  languages. It is true that the Coexistence Movement had  proposed this in the initial phase of talks, but we did not come  to an agreement on this issue.    Ludovit Cernak, chairman of the National Democratic  Party-New Alternative: I was present at all talks that  preceded the formation of the present coalition and declare that  there exists neither an agreement with the Hungarian parties nor  a relevant supplement to the original coalition agreement.  Everything that had been agreed upon at these talks and that  was approved by all of the coalition partners is being complied  with and honored. Likewise, I do not know anything about a  commitment adopted by the coalition to sign the charters on  local self-administration and regional languages by September.  [passage omitted]</p>

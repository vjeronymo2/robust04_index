			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / EC ministers rule out realignment of ERM: Italian lira pushed through the floor against D-Mark EUROPEAN Community finance ministers last night ruled out a realignment of the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism, after a tense day on currency markets in which the EMS suffered its most severe strain in five years. The ministers' statement came after investors switched more funds into the D-Mark, forcing the Italian lira through its ERM floor against the German currency. The stronger D-Mark also put more pressure on other weak EMS currencies such as sterling and the French franc, and increased the likelihood of Italy, the UK and France being forced to raise interest rates to defend the value of their currencies. The EC finance ministers said that 'a change in the present structure of central rates would not be the appropriate response to the current tensions' in the EMS's 10-currency exchange rate mechanism. The statement was co-ordinated by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, in his capacity as current president of the European council of finance ministers. He took soundings earlier yesterday from the other 11 EC governments, and talked by telephone to Mr Michel Sapin and Mr Theo Waigel, the finance ministers of France and Germany. The remarks by the ministers were seen in the currency markets as an effort to prevent further investor selling of the weak currencies in the EMS, in favour of the D-Mark. Mr Lamont tried to amplify the statement's effects by saying it 'demonstrates the willingness of our European partners to co-operate intensively to maintain stability in the financial markets. Membership of the ERM remains the cornerstone of Britain's anti-inflationary strategy'. Mr Sapin said the EMS 'will remain a fundamental point of stability in the international monetary system'. Last night the D-Mark closed in London at the top of the EMS grid for the first time since late 1989. The last time the strong D-Mark caused such acute pressures in the EMS was in 1987, shortly before the last broad realignment of currencies. Yesterday the lira slipped below its EMS floor of L765.4 to the D-Mark. That triggered action under EMS rules by the central banks of Italy, Germany and Belgium to buy lire for D-Marks to prevent further weakening. Despite the intervention, the lira closed in London at L765.7 to the D-Mark, just below the floor. This value was reached after the end of EMS trading at 4pm London time, after which EMS nations are not required to support the system's currencies. The pound also traded weakly, losing  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark to close in London at DM2.7875, about 1 pfennig above its DM2.778 floor, although it later recovered all its lost ground in New York trading. The French franc closed at FFr3.409 to the D-Mark, unchanged after coming under pressure during the day. Against the dollar, the D-Mark gained less than 1/2 pfennig, closing in London at DM1.4070. In New York it closed at DM1.4095. The Dutch government increased money market rates by 0.1 percentage points to strengthen the guilder against the D-Mark. In the past two weeks, the D-Mark has risen strongly against other EMS currencies and the dollar. That has happened partly because of high German interest rates and also because many investors believe the move towards economic and monetary union may collapse.

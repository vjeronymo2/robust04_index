			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-INCUMBENT MOOD BLAMED IN WAKE OF UPSETS  </P> <P> An unexpectedly strong tide of resentment against incumbents, claims of  strategic brilliance and admissions of fatal gaffes dominated the day-after  explanations behind the unseating of one San Diego congressman and two state  Assembly members in Tuesday's elections.  </P> <P> As campaign consultants, party activists and the candidates themselves  struggled Wednesday to make sense of the most dramatic political housecleaning  in San Diego in years, most explanations for the apparent defeat of Democratic  Rep. Jim Bates and Republican Assembly members Sunny Mojonnier and Jeff Marston  originated from the belief that the three were victims of a much-predicted  anti-incumbent mood among the electorate.  </P> <P> "We knew there was a sea of discontent -- we just didn't know it was a tidal  wave," said Karl Higgins, administrative assistant to Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San  Diego), who narrowly escaped with a 5-percentage-point victory over a  Democratic challenger whom he had trounced by 2-1 margins in his past two  reelections.  </P> <P> That sentiment was exacerbated in some of the races, consultants argued, by the  officeholders' own ethical transgressions, which made them more likely targets  for voters' wrath against Washington and Sacramento.  </P> <P> For example, Bates and Mojonnier, both tainted by recent disclosures, lost in  districts where their respective parties hold voter registration advantages so  overwhelming that partisan elections there normally are races in name only.  Noting that both had easily triumphed in bruising primaries last June, some  political consultants argued that their party's failure to nominate an  alternative to a wounded incumbent produced one of the overriding lessons in  Tuesday's election.  </P> <P> "The message here is that, if one party doesn't take out its own garbage, the  other party will," longtime San Diego political consultant Jack Orr said.  </P> <P> With about 43,000 absentee ballots countywide remaining to be counted next  Tuesday, there is an outside chance that Bates or Marston could reverse their  982-vote and 1,858-vote deficits, respectively, while Mojonnier's prospects of  wiping out her 5,821-vote shortfall are dimmer. Officials at the San Diego  County registrar of voters office said Tuesday it is not known how many  uncounted absentee ballots remain in each of those districts.  </P> <P> Final unofficial vote totals showed that Republican Randall (Duke) Cunningham  edged Bates by a razor-thin margin in their 44th Congressional District race,  46,171 votes (46.1%) to 45,189 votes (45.1%). Two minor-party candidates --  Peace and Freedom Party member Donna White and Libertarian John Wallner -- drew  the remaining 8.8% of the vote.  </P> <P> In the 75th Assembly District, Democrat Deirdre (Dede) Alpert blocked  Mojonnier's try for a fifth two-year term, outpolling the Encinitas Republican  52,102 votes (45.9%) to 46,281 votes (40.8%), with the other 13.3% of the vote  going to two minor candidates.  </P> <P> Republican Marston, meanwhile, lost his bid to retain the 78th Assembly  District seat that he won in a special election last June to the same candidate  whom he defeated in that race -- former Democratic San Diego City Councilman  Mike Gotch. Gotch received 37,727 votes (45.7%), Marston drew 35,869 votes  (43.5%), and two minor candidates attracted a combined 10.8%.  </P> <P> Those losses represent a rarity in San Diego politics. Before Tuesday, the last  San Diego congressman to be defeated was Democrat Lionel Van Deerlin, who was  upset by Republican Duncan Hunter in the 1980 Reagan landslide. It had been  even longer since an incumbent assemblyman from San Diego was unseated, the  most recent example being Republican E. Richard Barnes' loss to now-Judge Larry  Kapiloff in 1972.  </P> <P> "This election was the beginning of a revolution that will restore competitive  democracy to San Diego," said former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock. "What we  had was a rubber-stamp democracy with 'safe' seats and non-races, and the  people are finally fed up with it."  </P> <P> Within political circles, the three incumbents' losses, Lowery's scare and the  surprising results in several other races were widely seen as clear evidence  that the backlash against incumbents struck with a vengeance here.  </P> <P> Even in several races where incumbents won handily, minor-party candidates, who  historically draw only several percentage points of the vote, polled  double-digit totals Tuesday, ranging up to the 28% (38,819 votes) received by  Libertarian Joe Shea in his 45th Congressional District race against Hunter.  </P> <P> "You've got to read those strictly as anti-incumbent votes, because most of  those (minor-party candidates) don't spend a dime or campaign," said Bates  consultant Rick Taylor. "For whatever reason, voters in San Diego decided it  was time to tell incumbents, 'Don't take us for granted.' "  </P> <P> Although Marston's 4 1/2-month tenure in Sacramento was dwarfed by Gotch's own  former eight-year council record, the Democratic challenger went to lengths in  his mailers to clearly identify Marston as the incumbent.  </P> <P> "He kept hammering away at the word incumbent, and that made it very difficult  for us to get across that I'd been one for only a few months," Marston  conceded. "When a lot of people heard the word incumbent, that was it."  </P> <P> Similarly, Bates blames his narrow apparent loss more on "generic  anti-incumbency" than on voters' specific displeasure with his 1989 sanction by  the House Ethics Committee on sexual harassment charges lodged by two female  staff members. Even some of his own supporters, however, acknowledge that the  controversy weakened Bates' political immunity system, even in a district where  Democrats hold a 53%-35% registration edge.  </P> <P> Moreover, in Cunningham, a highly decorated former Navy fighter pilot who  entered the race with relatively high name recognition and solid financial  backing from national GOP leaders, Bates faced his most formidable challenger  since winning the then-newly created seat in 1982. In addition, Bates, an  indefatigable campaigner noted for door-to-door politicking even in  non-election years, was severely hampered by being stuck in Washington until  late October during the budget impasse.  </P> <P> "All of those things . . . offset the tremendous advantages of incumbency,"  said Cunningham, whose upset came in a supposedly "Republican-proof" district.  </P> <P> Alpert overcame similar numerical obstacles in defeating Mojonnier in the 75th  Assembly District, where the Democratic challenger faced a 52%-33% registration  disadvantage. But, like Cunningham, Alpert, a Solana Beach school board member,  was perfectly positioned to capitalize on the embarrassing headlines that  chronicled Mojonnier's recent years in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Last February, Mojonnier agreed to pay $13,200 in fines and restitution for  double-billing the state and her campaign committee for business trips, as well  as for using political donations to pay for fashion and beauty treatments for  her staff. Along with other state legislators, she also has been faulted for  routinely using state-paid sergeants-at-arms for personal tasks, such as  chauffeuring her children and escorting her home after evening parties.  </P> <P> Despite that heavy political baggage, Mojonnier easily survived a  three-candidate challenge in last June's GOP primary. Alpert believes the June  victory gave Mojonnier false confidence.  </P> <P> "I think she believed that her real competition was in the primary, and that a  Democrat just didn't have a chance in this district," said Alpert, who waged a  vigorous campaign but was heavily outspent by Mojonnier. "Sunny had a lot of  liabilities, and they finally caught up with her."  </P> <P> Gotch, meanwhile, argues that he might have fooled Marston into underestimating  him.  </P> <P> Criticized even by some fellow Democrats for his virtual invisibility during  most of the race, Gotch claimed Wednesday that his so-called "stealth campaign"  actually was a matter of strategic design -- not, as many thought, reflective  of his loss of heart after his earlier losses in last spring's special primary  and runoff.  </P> <P> Gotch said his campaign advisers decided that, if they waged a full-blown,  nonstop campaign, it would simply prompt Marston to mount a similarly  high-profile race, thereby raising his name identification.  </P> <P> "We decided to take the hits for the so-called 'stealth campaign,' hoping that  the other side would take the bait," Gotch said. "And they did."  </P> <P> Marston said he was not deceived by Gotch's low-profile stance, which lasted  until the final several weeks of the campaign.  </P> <P> "I saw this very clever strategy for what it was from day one, but couldn't get  anyone to listen," Marston lamented. "I never believed all this talk about  Gotch practically throwing in the towel. The problem was, where before people  had been telling me, 'Jeff, I don't think you have a chance' when I asked for  contributions, now they were saying, 'Jeff, we don't think you need it because  you don't have a race.' "  </P> <P> In the closing days of the race, the Republican Assembly caucus in Sacramento  even withdrew a previous commitment to finance a mailer for Marston -- a  decision that Marston admitted he was "very, very, very bitter about." When he  protested, Marston said, Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson told him, "We're  not in the business of financing landslides."  </P> <P> "That was the brilliant decision of the best political minds in Sacramento --  just ask them, and they'll tell you," Marston said angrily. "Like they say,  with allies like that, you don't have to worry about your enemies."  </P></p>

Did he accept your resignation or did he accept  your conditions? How did your conversation actually finish?    [Fedorov] I repeat once again -- I have never resigned and I  am not going to do so. I have not accepted the invitation to  take a certain post in the cabinet which is being reorganized --  I mean the post of finance minister. The president confirmed  this invitation and I, of course, did not accept it. I tried to  explain my position to the president. He regretted that I did  not accept this proposal. He advised me not to go away too far.    [Svanidze] Are you actually fulfilling the duties of the  finance minister at the present moment?    [Fedorov] No, I am not. I have already signed an order. The  order has not been yet formally issued, so I am still a  minister. But I signed the order yesterday that my first deputy  is to fulfill my duties.    [Svanidze] Dubinin?    [Fedorov] Yes.    [Svanidze] Boris Grigoryevich, you said in your statement  that the country is rolling away and there is an economic coup  in the country. What do you mean?    [Fedorov] I mean that if the government's program had some  certain guiding lines, some certain methods of economic policy  and instruments during the past two years and suddenly this  direction has been changed -- instead of 3-5 percent inflation  there will be 8-9 percent, although I could guarantee that in  the present atmosphere, even 20 percent would appear to be a  good result -- if we are told that economic romanticism has now  gone and some non- monetary methods will be used and there will  be some other policy, this means a change of policy [sentence as  heard]. But I was invited by the president to carry out a quite  definite, specific policy directed at fighting inflation and  creating a normal market economy in our country. I worked on  this for a year.    [Svanidze] You say that at the moment there are fundamental  and open opponents of the policy of reforms in the government.  Whom do you have in mind?    [Fedorov] The government is roughly the same as it was  before, only the addresses, so to speak, of the people have  changed. Clearly, that was the task in mind. You realize that  even before the reorganization there was no majority of  reformers in the government. They were in the minority, but  there was an opportunity, at least, to carry out a certain  policy. There was confidence in the premier. As soon as the  premier changes course -- which he has spoken about -- naturally  the status, say, of the minister of finance is reduced and the  general correlation of forces in the government changes. In  other words, naturally, to pursue the same course as before is  extremely difficult. Therefore, if what the western press calls  the worst central banker in the world -- Gerashchenko -- remains  in the post of chairman of the Central Bank, then naturally, it  becomes impossible to pursue a civilized normal financial  monetary-credit policy. It is natural that those positions  which Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Aleksandr  Nikolayevich Zveryukha put forward were also fundamentally at  variance from my own views and with those tasks which were set  out in the program, and his presence in an office which was  higher than the minister of finance, this also naturally makes  this work very, very difficult, or rather, impossible.    [Svanidze] One must suppose that you did not hide these  views  from the president, and what was his reaction to them?    [Fedorov] I did not hide my views -- I never conceal my  point  of view. The president said that there was no need to hurry,  that there might be changes, and that Gerashchenko, too, in  principle, of course, was not going to be there for ever. He  reaffirmed that he was opposed to changing the course.    [Svanidze] What is your prediction for inflation by the end  of the year?    [Fedorov] As always, I gave my predictions in good time, way  back in December -- a Christmas prediction, so to speak -- where  I spoke about it increasing 20-fold, 2,000 percent, a rate of  10,000, then I defined it a litle more precisely at something  like a 12,000- fold drop in real per-capita incomes. There  would still be a fall in production and capital investments and  a devaluation of the savings of the population. In other words,  I do not foresee any area where the indices will be any better  than they were in 1993. On the contrary, we are getting close to  going the same way as Ukraine.    [Svanidze] What do you intend to do now?    [Fedorov] Well, I'm a member of the Duma, and I intend to  work there.    [Svanidze] In other words, you will move from a financier  and  an economist to becoming a professional politician?    [Fedorov] Well, you know, a minister, if he is a real  minister, is also a professional politician. If he is just a  cashier who dishes out cash then yes, of course, he is purely a  technocrat. A technocrat has nothing to do with politics. I  have pursued a policy and I have certain convictions that I will  continue to uphold.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Music to Critics' Ears: "The Piano Lesson," August Wilson's Pulitzer  Prize-winning play, opened Monday at Broadway's Walter Kerr Theater to rave  reviews.  </P> <P> "This is Wilson's most accomplished work to date, resonating with a poetry that  enhances a strong story and illuminates a half dozen or so expertly drawn  characters," wrote AP drama critic Michael Kuchwara. Frank Rich of The New York  Times wrote: " 'The Piano Lesson' is joyously an African-American play: It has  its own spacious poetry, its own sharp angle on a nation's history and its own  palpable ghosts." And from the New York Post's Clive Barnes: "This is a  wonderful play that lights up man. See it, wonder at it, and recognize it."  BETH KLEID  </P></p>

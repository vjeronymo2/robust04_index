In a statement issued at State House, Nairobi, President  Moi said his attention has been drawn to the gross distortion  and misinterpretation by the FORD [Forum for the Restoration of  Democracy]-Kenya Luo members of parliament concerning his  statement in Kericho severing relations between their political  party and KANU [Kenya African National Union].    However, his excellency the president noted that he wants to  make it abundantly clear that he only announced the severing of  the relations between the two political parties--that is, KANU  and FORD-Kenya--in his capacity as the president of KANU. The  president further pointed out that his reference to the  Kipsigis, Maasai, and Kuria was within the context of  cooperation in stamping out cattle rustling among themselves and  had nothing to do with party politics. The head of state,  therefore, said the claim by the Luo members of parliament that  this move was meant to isolate the Luo community has no basis  whatsoever unless they want to make the world believe that  FORD-Kenya is a party exclusively for the Luo.    President Moi pointed out that he had so far thought that  FORD-Kenya was a national party with a countrywide following,  but said it was now interesting to note that the Luo members of  parliament consider FORD-Kenya as being synonymous with their  community. The president said as far as he is concerned, this  perception is entirely their own and not a corcect reflection of  his statement, which was at party level and had nothing to do  with ethnic communities.    He also observed that he would like to believe that the  highly insolent, inflammatory, and provocative utterances by a  FORD-Kenya member of parliament, James Orengo, during the burial  of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga were made on behalf of FORD-Kenya and  not on behalf of the entire Luo community.    His excellency the president noted that as a nationalist who  sees tribalism as a cancer, his intention is to strengthen KANU  in Nyanza in order to hasten the peace of development in the  area. The KANU government, he added, has initiated ambitious  development projects in that region covering all sectors, but  also intends to increase them in order to serve more effectively  the rising population.</p>

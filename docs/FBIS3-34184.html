In today's Tehran  Friday prayer sermons President Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin  Hashemi-Rafsanjani gave an analysis of the trend of the  revolution as a crucial historical happening. He said: The  causes and instruments of that most important happening -- which  requires a most scholarly analysis from various global,  regional, Islamic, ideological, and political dimensions -- must  be looked for in three important factors: the vigilance and  awareness of the people and their presence in the arena, the  role of the leadership and guidance, and the creation of trust  between the people and their leaders.    Tehran's ad hoc Friday imam considered the people's  vigilance  and awareness to be the most powerful factor in the victory of  the Islamic revolution. He said: The vigilance and presence of  the people in the arena are not only factors in the victory of  the revolution but also its safeguard in the face of all events,  such as the war and the conspiracies, and give continuation to  the revolution during the period of construction, planning, and  implementation of important and infrastructural tasks.    Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani described  the  human forming ideology of Islam as the most important factor in  the awareness of the people, and he referred to the role of the  pioneer clerics and religious scholars -- especially the most  crucial role played by His Eminence Imam Khomeyni, the departed  imam, may God Almighty be satisfied with him -- in making people  aware during the 20 years of struggle before the revolution and  the human forming role of that worthy source of emulation. He  said: If a leader -- or a party -- with an objective wishes to  succeed he must nurture vigilant and knowledgeable people. And  in Iran, under the auspices of the wise leadership of the imam,  may his soul be sanctified, such a thing came to pass.    The president called the existence of trust between the  people and their leaders as the basis of movement and progress  and as the instrument of eliminating problems and struggle  against sabotage. He considered it as one of the most important  factors of concern for the enemies. In this regard he said: The  enemies of the revolution, who had discovered this secret of  success, embarked on an extensive effort, from the first days of  the Islamic revolution, to create a rift between the people and  the leadership and the authorities. The imperialist propaganda  in this regard never ceased and their satanic move still  continues. But what has broken the back of the enemy is the  existence of the popular sentiment and the wholesale and  constant presence of the arena.    Referring to the assassination attempt on his life and the  aims of the enemies of the revolution, the president said:    [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] This incident to which  your attention has now been drawn -- the assassination attempt  -- to my mind this is a very minor issue which can always  happen. A few people can always give rise to a small incident.  However, these things are no longer of any importance to the  revolution. You should feel quite reassured about that. The  revolution has now become quite separated from individuals. I  said that the revolution has reached the stage of maturity; it  is no longer a child which needs suckling. It provides its own  sustenance. A lofty figure like the imam of the ummah departed  from among these people. At that time we shuddered to think  about what would happen when the imam would no longer be among  us. Then we witnessed this calm movement of an ocean of people,  and this Islamic revolution continues forever on its path.  Through divine guidance, this ship correctly continues its  voyage toward its destination in this tumultuous ocean.    How effective can individuals be any longer in this  revolution that others should put themselves in trouble, should  put themselves in danger so that a certain individial may or may  not be there; and that a person like me who is one of the most  minor soldiers of this revolution!    I say that world arrogance, America, and others should  really  know that in Iran they should give up the hope that by the  physical or psychological elimination of individuals they can  overcome the revolution.    May God protect you, your revolution and the leader of the  revolution. We are very weak soldiers. There are many people  like me who can be in the service of the people. [end recording]    Describing the assassination attempt on his life, Mr.  Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: The plotters thought that by carrying  out such a plot on the first day of the ceremonies marking the  Ten Days of Dawn at a gathering which was attended by all  foreign guests and reporters, they could disrupt the ceremonies  marking the anniversary of the revolution, through a move which  was minor in itself but which would have caused a great deal of  publicity. By doing that, they wished to show to the world that  the Islamic revolution has lost its luster [kamrang shodeh ast]  in Iran. But, fortunately, they did not achieve any of their  goals.    The president sincerely thanked the people for all their  good  wishes and sentiments in expressing their anxiety about the  assassination attempt on his life. Thanking all the political  and religious figures, various strata of the people and  departments and organizations, the president asked that all the  messages in this connection should come to an end.    Continuing his remarks, Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to the  inauguration of a number of very important projects during the  Ten Days of Dawn, noting the inauguration of the Arak  petrochemical complex and thousands of urban and rural projects.  He said: The people are very well aware of the realities and  enemy propaganda which says that the revolution has lost its  glamor has no effect on them.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed: After the passing of 15 years,  the Islamic revolution is now, more than ever, blooming and very  well supported and we see its roots solid, its sacred offshoots  healthy and the people most aware and in line with the  revolution. The conspiracies hatched traditionally by the  enemies aimed at the destruction of the revolution no longer  have any effect. The 22 Bahman [11 February] marches will be a  strong response to those who design such plots to weaken the  revolution and the presence of the people on the scenes.    The president stressed: The people today find that what they  staged the revolution for remains as strong as ever. Magnifying  the problems and belittling the services, a ploy always used by  arrogance, no longer undermines their resolve.    In the second sermon, the president referred to the fourth  day of the Ten Days of Dawn, the day of prayers, jihad, and  propagation of virtue and prohibition of vice. He described the  role of such issues in the continuation of the Islamic  revolution as fundamental.</p>

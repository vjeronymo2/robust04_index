			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Union 'should still be the goal' EUROPE should continue to work towards introduction of a single currency despite the recent turmoil, including sterling's suspension within the Exchange Rate Mechanism, a leading German banker said last night. Mr Wolfgang Roller, chief executive of Dresdner Bank, said there was a need to continue with establishment of a European monetary policy and a European central bank. Referring to sterling's suspension in the ERM, he said on television: 'We've got to get the ERM back into line. . . to get the constraints back together and set the parities in relation to respective economic situations (of European countries). 'That can only mean a stronger D-Mark. . . one can be happy as a private individual holding D-Marks but it makes life more difficult for industry as we are an export country.' He said inflation was likely to fall as a result, enabling the Bundesbank to lower interest rates. Mr Roller said that the lira devaluation last weekend had not been enough to get over the crisis within the ERM and the UK had had to 'pull its emergency parachute' by leaving the ERM temporarily. But European countries should carry on with plans for monetary union, he said. Even if the French voted No in Sunday's referendum on the Maastricht treaty, this would not mean the end of the process of European integration. The suspension of sterling in the ERM might relieve pressure for action by the German Bundesbank at its meeting today, according to some bankers. The Bundesbank's policymaking council will hold its regular fortnightly meeting, four days after agreeing to trim both its Lombard and discount rates on Monday. Mr Peter Pietsch, an economist at Commerzbank, said last night: 'I wouldn't expect too much from the Bundesbank at its meeting.' Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist of BHF-Bank, said the decision of the UK government to suspend sterling from the ERM was a better solution than constant intervention, which cost a good deal and achieved nothing in the end. However, he could not say whether the Bundesbank would take any action to cut its interest rates further at today's meeting. He noted that Monday's interest rate cuts had not been caused by domestic pressures - the Bundesbank still thinks German inflation is too high and money supply growth too rapid - but by external market forces and the resulting need to intervene heavily to support the lira. In France, Britain's decision on the ERM could provide ammunition for the country's anti-Maastricht campaign in the final days before the referendum. Critics of the treaty such as Mr Philippe Seguin, the Gaullist MP who has led the anti-Maastricht campaign, argue that monetary union could impose artificial restraints on countries' freedom to conduct monetary and economic policies. They could seize on Britain's decision to pull sterling out of the ERM as evidence that the current European Monetary System needs to be perfected before closer monetary co-operation can be made to work.</p>

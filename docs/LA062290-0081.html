			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HIGHLAND HIGH TO GO YEAR-ROUND IN 1991  </P> <P> The Antelope Valley Union High School District will follow the course of a  growing number of year-round elementary schools by placing its first high  school on a similar schedule, officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Highland High School, one of five campuses in the Antelope Valley Union High  School District, will convert to the year-round schedule in July, 1991,  officials said.  </P> <P> The school, now in bungalows, is scheduled to move into permanent facilities  about that time.  </P> <P> Officials in the 9,800-student district said they hope the year-round schedule  will improve learning for students, reduce overcrowding in the district and  keep the district eligible for state school construction funds.  </P> <P> The district's Board of Trustees decided Wednesday night that Highland will  operate on a rotating four-track calendar, with three of the student tracks on  campus at a time. Each student group will have three 60-day periods of classes  interspersed with three 20-day vacation periods.  </P> <P> The Palmdale School District, which started the Antelope Valley's first  year-round elementary school last summer, plans to convert two more of its 18  campuses this August. The neighboring Lancaster School District plans to make  two of its 14 schools year-round this fall.  </P></p>

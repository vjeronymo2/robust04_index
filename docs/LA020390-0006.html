			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MEMORIES LIVE ON AFTER VOICE IS GONE  </P> <P> For over 20 years, at work or at play, in my car or at the games, I'll always  remember that famous bellowing voice announcing such superstars as Garvey,  Wills, Chamberlain, West, Gabriel, Youngblood, Dionne and Berry. Whether I was  in a good mood or bad, it was always a pleasure to hear that ever-present  foghorn.  </P> <P> Thanks for the memories, John Ramsey.  </P> <P> JIMMIE SHAW, Hermosa Beach  </P></p>

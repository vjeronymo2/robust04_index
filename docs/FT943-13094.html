			<p>940721 FT  21 JUL 94 / Manila agrees Dollars 469m debt deal The Philippines has concluded an agreement for the rescheduling of Dollars 469m (Pounds 308m) worth of debts from its Paris Club of official creditors, the government announced yesterday. The rescheduling, agreed in Paris, follows the approval on June 24 by the International Monetary Fund of a Dollars 685m credit package to support the country's growth-oriented economic programme for the period to June 1997. It also precedes a meeting today, also in Paris, of the consultative group that co-ordinates a World Bank-led multilateral assistance programme for the Philippines. Pledges of some Dollars 2bn concessional loans and grants are expected at the meeting. With these financial packages, the Philippines now stands 'on the threshold of a full and dramatic recovery,' Mr Roberto de Ocampo, the finance secretary, said. The rescheduling, Mr de Ocampo said, supports 'the soft-landing approach to the country's exit from exceptional financing. . .to achieve growth consistent with sustainable external accounts primarily supported by voluntary flows.' The economy grew by 4.8 per cent in the first quarter of this year, a big jump from 0.3 per cent in the same period last year. This has led to expectations that the 4.5 per cent growth targeted for the full-year will be exceeded.</p>

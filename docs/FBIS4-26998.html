			<p>BFN     [Text] The special status of the Hong Kong branch of the  NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY (XINHUA) is unique within the Chinese  Government. Ostensibly, it is a local branch of the central NEW  CHINA NEWS AGENCY, which is a top-level government department.  Other local branches, such as those in Beijing and Shanghai,  are also top level. But XINHUA is the same grade as the central  branch, that is, both are ministries.    Apart from its news section, XINHUA has no subsidiary  relationship with the central organisation. Its function  corresponds only minimally to its name.    The Hong Kong Government and all other representative bodies  of foreign governments in Hong Kong recognise XINHUA as the  Chinese Government's chief representative in the territory. But  it has no legal status, and has no diplomatic immunity. Its  legal status is not as high as that of the Sino-British Joint  Liaison Group [JLG] or of the Land Commission, or even of the  Foreign Ministry's visa-issuing office.    The directors and deputy-director of those bodies are  equivalent to the director of XINHUA. All three bodies enjoy  the diplomatic immunity that XINHUA lacks. If XINHUA needs to  purchase a car, it does so in the name of the JLG or the Land  Commission in order to pay lower import tax.    XINHUA's unique circumstances are a product of Hong Kong's  unusual history. When the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY organisation  was established in Yanan (Shaanxi Province) during the Japanese  occupation, it was openly an organisation of the Chinese  Communist Party [CPC].    When a branch was set up in Hong Kong in 1947, it was as a  private organisation, with a corresponding legal status. When  the PRC was established on October 1, 1949, the Chinese  Government publicly announced that XINHUA was a national news  agency (and at the same time was the news agency of the CPC).  The Hong Kong Government did not recognise it as part of the  national news agency, and even intended to close it down.    In 1949 and 1950 the Hong Kong Government made the growing  power of leftists in Hong Kong a target, passing many new laws  intended for use against them and even using laws to disband  some leftist organisations. One of those laws was the Control  of Publications Consolidation Ordinance. This ordinance  required the re-registration of all news organisations in Hong  Kong and payment of a deposit of $10,000, even for private  organisations.    At the beginning of 1951, XINHUA registered in accordance  with this law of the British Hong Kong Government but it  registered as a national news agency. The British Hong Kong  Government rejected this application on the grounds that XINHUA  was originally registered as a private organisation. This was  the reason the Hong Kong British Government gave for allowing  Agence France-Presse to register as a national news agency, but  rejecting registration of XINHUA. The intention was to close  down XINHUA.    When XINHUA was established in 1947, the PRC was itself not  yet established, so there was no possibility of it having  national news agency status. When the PRC was established, the  government officially announced that XINHUA was a national news  agency and it naturally followed that XINHUA had the status of a  national news agency.    The Chinese and British Governments did not have formal  diplomatic relations at that time but the British Government  announced that it recognised the PRC and the government in  London had already recognised the London branch of XINHUA as a  national news agency but the Hong Kong British Government still  did not acknowledge this status for XINHUA.    In 1951, the news division of the Chinese Government and  XINHUA issued a joint statement to clarify the status of XINHUA  as a national news agency to counteract the intentions of the  British Hong Kong Government. This conflict continued for  nearly a year before it was resolved. In the meantime, Xinhua  had made all the necessary preparations for being shut down.    In April 1951, the director, Huang Zuomei, sent me to Macao  to establish a branch there. Huang's instructions to me were  explicit: if the Hong Kong branch was closed down, the Macao  branch should immediately be activated to take over work  relating to Hong Kong.    When the Macao branch began operations, I was the only one  working there. Later there were two people, but at no stage did  the number exceed 15. Only in 1952, when the Hong Kong British  Government could no longer continue to refuse recognition of  XINHUA as a national news agency, was I able to shut down the  Macao branch's operation and return to Hong Kong.    Even though the Hong Kong British Government was forced to  recognise the official status of XINHUA, it used every means to  ignore it. For a very long period, lasting nearly 20 years, the  Hong Kong British Government would only assign a member of the  police special branch to deal with XINHUA. This situation  continued until the end of the 1960's when the political adviser  was assigned to deal with XINHUA.    Right up until the early 1970's, the Hong Kong British  Government still treated XINHUA as a mere news unit. When  members of the royal family visited Hong Kong, the Hong Kong  British Government refused to invite a XINHUA representative for  an audience in his official capacity.    Only at the end of the 1970's did a Hong Kong governor meet  the director of XINHUA, and take part in XINHUA's national day  celebration.    Once XINHUA's official status was established, in 1956 Mao  Zedong, monitoring the work in Hong Kong through Guangdong  Province, recommended that the fullest possible use be made of  XINHUA's status in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong and Macao Working  Group was also transferred from Guangzhou to Hong Kong. Liang  Weilin was appointed the director of XINHUA, and also the  secretary-general of the CPC's (CCP) Hong Kong and Macao Working  Group.    From the time that Chairman Mao began monitoring Hong Kong,  the CPC's central leadership became increasingly well-informed  about Hong Kong.    The preservation of Hong Kong's unique status would be of  enormous benefit to China. In 1958, Zhou Enlai set the  direction of the basic approach to Hong Kong: "In the long-term,  aim for maximum utilisation." At the same time, Hong Kong's  relationship with the mainland was becoming increasingly close.    Even though XINHUA had taken on the status of a national  organisation, it was still a national organisation in the form  of a news agency, and a news agency could not easily take on the  official duties of a top-level government department. For this  reason, beginning in the 1960's, the premier, Zhou Enlai, told  the British Government that China hoped to have an official  central government representative in Hong Kong. The British  Government refused outright, saying it did not want a system of  "two governors" to take root.    Apart from the development of closer relations between Hong  Kong and the mainland, there were many issues that required  official government discussions. For the Hong Kong Government  simply to send a special branch official to communicate with  XINHUA was plainly inadequate.    One example will illustrate the problem. Hong Kong people  will remember that from the mid-1950's Hong Kong experienced  frequent water shortages. Reservoirs were built one after  another, each one larger than the last but, if there was not  enough rain, the problem remained unsolved. Not only did the  people's livelihood suffer but industry also lacked adequate  water and the serious water shortage limited Hong Kong's  industrial development. In 1962, the situation became so  serious that water was only available for four hours every four  days.    Looking back, it is clear that if the water shortage had not  been solved through communal use of the Pearl River, Hong Kong's  industrial development would have been impossible. At the end  of the 1950's, the Hong Kong British Government agreed to talk  with China about a plan to purchase water from the Pearl River.    Talk alone would not bring the water to Hong Kong. It had to  come a long distance via engineering works through Shenzhen.  Because the Hong Kong British Government lacked even the most  basic communication channels with the Chinese Government, this  plan, so crucial to Hong Kong, was delayed for several years.  Only at the beginning of the 1960's did the Hong Kong British  Government send an unofficial member of the Legislative Council,  Chau Ling-nin, to seek out representatives of XINHUA.    The British trusted Chau Ling-nin, and he had a very high  standing in society, but he was not an official of the Water  Supplies Department and he was also quite advanced in years.    When he was sent to XINHUA to talk, he knew very little  about  the subject. He could not even clearly put across the message  that the Hong Kong British Government had sent him to convey.  The Hong Kong British Government had only given him basic  information in writing, which he read out loud. Any reply from  XINHUA to the Hong Kong British Government had to be sent in  writing through him.    It became obvious that it would be impossible to continue in  this manner beyond a few such talks but the Hong Kong British  Government then sent a younger, unofficial member of the  Legislative Council, Lee Ming-chak, in his place. This is what  actually happened at that time. For this reason, not long after  the talks on water supply were concluded in the mid 1960's, Zhou  Enlai suggested to the British Government that a representative  of the Chinese Government should be allowed to be posted in Hong  Kong.    Zhou repeated this suggestion many times from the mid-1960's  right until the early 1970's, spanning a period of nearly 10  years. The British Government had no reason to refuse, but it  counter-proposed that it hoped the Chinese Government would  establish a consulate or embassy in Hong Kong.    This was clearly unacceptable to the Chinese Government  because the Chinese Government's basic position was that Hong  Kong was Chinese territory and the Chinese Government did not  recognise the three "unequal treaties." This position had been  stated worldwide since the establishment of the PRC. If the  Chinese Government established a consulate or embassy in Hong  Kong, it would be acknowledging Hong Kong as a foreign country,  as a British colony, and thereby would be recognising the  validity of the three "unequal treaties."    Even the old government of China under the Kuomintang had  been unwilling to establish a consulate in Hong Kong. At that  time its representative organisation was "the Office of Two  Special Envoys from the Foreign Ministry Office in Hong Kong"  headed by Guo Dehua. That organisation was disbanded at the end  of 1949.    After the beginning of the 1970's, when Zhou Enlai again  suggested that China establish a representative in Hong Kong and  again was refused by the British Government, the subject was no  longer raised between the two countries.    Having eliminated this form of official channel, the Hong  Kong British Government continued to raise the status of XINHUA,  in effect recognising it as the Chinese Government's channel for  communication in Hong Kong and in that way solved the problem.  Finally, the Chinese Government also tacitly conceded this  point. That is how XINHUA's unique status came about.    In the 1980's, when the Chinese Government set out a  timetable for resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong, and the  mainland's reforms and open policies developed steadily,  relations between Hong Kong and China developed to an  unprecedented extent. Correspondingly, XINHUA as the Chinese  Government's highest organisation in Hong Kong, also became  increasingly important, and its operations became more diverse  and all-encompassing.    XINHUA's relations with Hong Kong society and Hong Kong  people naturally grew much closer. The Hong Kong British  Government, representatives of foreign countries in Hong Kong,  and people from all sectors of Hong Kong society, all recognise  XINHUA without any doubt as China's highest representative body.    Few people understand how unique that status is. Most  interesting is the question of the status XINHUA will hold three  years from now, after 1997. This question has been discussed  for some time within the local branch.    According to Annex 1 of the Sino-British Joint Declaration,  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will come under the  direct jurisdiction of China's central government. At that  time, all its "ministers" can be in direct communication with  the central government. Hong Kong's foreign relations and  defence will be handled by the central government.    So, after 1997, there should be a bona fide foreign ministry  office in Hong Kong and a military representative from the  Defence Ministry. At that time, XINHUA will no longer need to  exist under its current special status. It will revert to its  ostensible and legal status. That is, it will be no more than a  local branch of the central NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, and carry out  genuine news agency functions.    XINHUA at that time will perform the same functions as the  existing office in Sharp Street West. At that time, XINHUA, by  then in existence for exactly 50 years, will have fulfilled the  role set out for it in history and its brilliance will dim.    Is that how it will be? I think that's how it should be.</p>

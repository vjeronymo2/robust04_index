			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Expansion fired with the personal touch - How Denby has rejected the limits of technology in favour of its craft-led image The view has been obscured deliberately by a row of trees, but it is hard to ignore the open-cast mine opposite the Denby Pottery factory in Derbyshire. Here, Joseph Bourne, Denby's 19th century founder, first extracted the raw materials to make his ginger beer bottles and butter churns. Denby, which now manufactures brightly-glazed table and cookware, has come a long way since the factory was established in 1809. It has survived several near fatal upheavals but one of them cost it its independence as a public company in 1981. Today, the company announces the price at which it will ask investors to back its second attempt to survive as a public company and its plans for international expansion. The management, which bought into the group following the collapse of its parent Coloroll in 1990, is confident that past mistakes will not be repeated. There is a sense of deja vu as Denby's management watches its larger colleagues in the industry consider applying their brand names to products such as glass and textiles. Denby's unhappy foray into similar areas in the US in the 1970s left it reeling under heavy stock losses, and eventually led to takeovers, initially by Crown House, the engineering company, and then by Coloroll. Denby is now taking a different view to others in the industry, and not just on product development where it plans to stick with producing its glazed stoneware. Unlike some of the larger, more prestigious manufacturers, Denby has eschewed the latest developments in technology. Mr Stephen Riley, managing director, says emphatically that Denby intends to remain a craft-based company. He proudly states that some 23 pairs of hands will have dealt with a single Denby mug, and there are no plans for change. Manufacturers such as Wedgwood and Royal Doulton have used technology to reduce substantially the labour costs of producing fine china. Whereas plates used to be made by individual 'throwers' using wet clay pressed by a hand-driven machine, the process can now be fully automated. Grains of dust are molded into plates by a high pressure press. Many manufacturers have also introduced automated glazing machines, where cups and plates pirouette through a spray tunnel before being fired. Denby still retains its army of human 'dippers and rinsers' to meet the particular demands imposed by its distinctive combination of highly-volatile, coloured glazes. Their skill lies in rinsing the inside of a vessel with one colour of glaze and dipping the outside up to the edge in another. This must be done repeatedly to the same thickness - just one-thousandth of an inch out and the glaze will change colour completely in the firing. Industry insiders also argue that the most modern technology limits flexibility for smaller manufacturers. Once you introduce integrated flow lines, and highly automated machinery, it becomes less easy to switch between products to meet demand. 'All you do is create a very inflexible situation where you become a slave to the machine,' says Mr Kevin Farrell, director of the British Ceramic Confederation, the industry body. Mr Richard Booth, Denby's production director, insists the company is not complacent about technological improvements. However, initial attempts to use some types of automation have convinced him that Denby is best served by the more tried and tested methods. Denby is seeking to turn this 'crafty' element to its advantage, as the trend shifts towards more informal dining habits. But it has not been the first to spot the opportunities this provides. Even the likes of Royal Doulton have announced their intention to introduce more casual ranges. If such a player decides to enter the market in full force, smaller manufacturers, like Denby, could face increasing competition. 'With all their factories and spare capacity, they could make a serious impact,' says one manufacturer. This is where smaller companies will have to capitalise on image and brand. For Denby, that means selling its unique glazing skills and rounded shapes. 'I don't think Royal Doulton, or even we, would be able to make that transition overnight,' says Mr George Hesp, managing director of Portmeirion Potteries. While Denby makes the most of its niche in the UK, it must move quickly to build exports. Compared to similar companies, such as Portmeirion, which exports more than 50 per cent of sales, Denby's record of 20 per cent is poor. The company intends to move rapidly into the US, the world's largest market. The key is distribution. 'If you want growth in the US, you have got to be in department stores,' says Mr Hesp. By securing 15 of the leading chains, Denby is moving down the right path. The US, so far, appears to be responding to Denby's message. Sales have doubled in the last two years and are set to double again in 1994. Yet it is still early days. 'A lot of companies think if you can sell there you can make a fortune,' says Mr Hesp, who has spent 13 years building up Portmeirion's successful US business. 'The road to hell is paved with people who thought that and ended up bust.' Mr Riley is not expecting any quick fix. 'We are giving ourselves another four years to get anywhere close to Portmeirion's level,' he says. He is confident that Denby's efforts to identify itself with a craft-led image and narrow product range, will carry the group successfully in what promises to be a competitive market. 'You have got to specialise first, and then spread your wings worldwide,' he says. 'There is no option anymore.'</p>

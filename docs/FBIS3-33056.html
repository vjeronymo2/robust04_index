			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shining Path [SL] members who fled to Sweden have  issued a lengthy and confusing leaflet, dated 3 December, under  the letterhead Popular Movements Peru [Movimientos Populares  Peru], which reveals their acceptance of a "peace agreement"  proposed by SL leader Abimael Guzman to President Alberto  Fujimori's government. The leaflet, entitled "New Great  Decision: Strive for a Peace Agreement in Peru!", was sent to  EXPRESO together with -- and this is what is amazing -- a  "Directive" signed by Guzman.    The directive, text of which we publish below, was drafted  on  22 October 1993 and nobody knows how it got from Guzman's cell  in the Callao Naval base to Stockholm. As can be seen in the  "contents and grounds" of the "Directive", Guzman says that with  him and the rest of the leadership in prison, the "revolution"  is not possible and proposes to postpone it until the 21st  Century.  <H5>  Directive: Contents and Grounds </H5>   By thoroughly assessing our situation and prospects, we have  come to the conclusion that the PCP [Peruvian Communist Party]  must assume and strive for a New Great Decision and Definition.  The following are the main grounds for this:    1. One phase of the revolution has ended. Here's to the  next phase of the World Revolution! Each party and organization  must clearly and deeply determine how it serves and will serve  the RPM [World Proletarian Revolution]... Our Decision and  Definition adjusts to our situation.    2. The bureaucratic path is gaining shape and becoming  feasible!    3. The GP [Popular War] can only remain as it is, rather  than develop and pose growing threats.  <H5>  Six indispensable conditions for victory are at stake: </H5>   1. Proletarian leadership;    2. Support of the masses;    3. Strategic centralization;    4. New type of army;    5. Extended war; and    6. Favorable international situation.    (The first is the most important of the six conditions.)    4. The Leadership problem cannot be solved on a timely  bases.    5. New Great Decision: "Strive for a Peace Agreement!" and a  Great Definition: Second Congress. The first represents the  grounds, and the second the guidelines. Aim for the 21st  century as a decade.    6. Miracles will be possible as long as the masses and Party  exist.    This is the Directive. It should be firmly and resolutely  implemented.    22 October 1993    Signed: President Gonzalo, leader of the PCP.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Daniel Santoro, copyright CLARIN 1994] </F>   [Text] The announcement of the candidacy of Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria to the OAS General Secretariat on 24  December 1993 was for various reasons a Christmas present for  the diplomacy of President Carlos Menem. This is why, when  Gaviria's victory was known on 27 March by 20 votes in favor and  14 against, the Argentine Government expressed its satisfaction  and presented Gaviria's victory as its own achievement. The  government changed candidates three times to obtain this victory.    The first reason for a change was that Foreign Minister  Guido  Di Tella's hopes collapsed that his Radical predecessor, Dante  Caputo, would be able to restore democracy in Haiti, and so gain  enough political support to replace Brazilian Joao Baena Soares  as OAS secretary general.    In view of this situation, the Foreign Ministry, after  unofficially promising its support for a Venezuelan candidate,  endorsed with little enthusiasm the candidacy of Costa Rican  Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, after sounding out without  success Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle and Chilean  President Patricio Aylwin.    The possibilities of transforming the OAS into a regional  institution at UN level, and incorporating the Inter-American  Defense Council into the OAS, which was one of Di Tella's more  valuable projects, began to disappear with Niehaus' candidacy.  This is another reason why Gaviria's candidacy came as a gift  from heaven.    Argentine sources told CLARIN that the first news about the  bold step taken by Gaviria -- it was the first time that a  president in office was a candidate -- was learned by the  government from Argentine Ambassador to the OAS Hernan Patino  Mayer. On Christmas eve Patino Mayer received the following  message: The United States wanted Gaviria to become a  candidate, but before deciding Colombia wanted to know if it had  Argentine support.    Four hours later President Carlos Menem phoned Gaviria to  tell him: "If you become a candidate, you can count on my full  support."    Then, Di Tella had to carry out the difficult task of  telling  Niehaus -- who on 27 March in Washington charged that the United  States was acting imperialistically, to its colonies, in  opposing his candidacy -- that Argentina was withdrawing its  support.    Meanwhile Menem talked with other presidents. His agenda  included the presidents of the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and  Chile, among others. Soon, most of the South American countries  gathered around Gaviria, who had the blessing of Washington. It  is assumed that Chile, more meticulous, kept its original  commitment to vote for Niehaus (the vote is secret).    Finally, the debate before the voting on 27 March ended in a  scandal. Niehaus left the OAS in Washington denouncing those  who had betrayed him, and now Gaviria will have five years to  heal the wounds opened during this political debate.</p>

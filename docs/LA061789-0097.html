			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRESHMEN PLAY KEY ROLE IN JOURNEY TO SYRACUSE  </P> <P> Lee Miller, UCLA's assistant crew coach, spends his days bellowing instructions  to rowers at the team's boat house in Marina del Rey.  </P> <P> But when Miller ordered 19 freshmen to voluntarily relinquish their seats on a  flight home from a regatta in Redwood City, Calif., last April, many wondered  about their coach's motives.  </P> <P> Miller's resourcefulness, however, assured the financially strapped crew of 19  ticket vouchers worth $200 each, compensation for giving up the seats on an  overbooked flight from San Francisco.  </P> <P> The circumstance allowed the varsity to send eight- and four-man crews and a  pair to Syracuse, N.Y., to the prestigious Intercollegiate Rowing Assn. regatta  recently.  </P> <P> The Bruins' flight to Syracuse cost $238, so each rower needed only about $40  to make the trip. UCLA finished second in the varsity fours and fourth in the  varsity eights.  </P> <P> "We're doing anything we can to stay competitive," Bruin Coach Zenon Babraj  said. "We couldn't have afforded that trip, but it was important for us to be  there."  </P> <P> Babraj said the crew needed the competition to prepare for the national regatta  today in Cincinnati. He said funds had been budgeted for the nationals but not  the Syracuse regatta.  </P> <P> What did the freshmen say, when asked to wait for a later flight?  </P> <P> "What could they say?" Babraj said. ELLIOTT ALMOND  </P></p>

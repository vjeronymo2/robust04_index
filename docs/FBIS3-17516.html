The government of the Republic has instructed the  Central Bank to strictly limit credit and cash flow. [passage  omitted] The Finance Ministry and the Central Bank must, within  a period of one month, formulate the mechanism for the formation  and exploitation of the gold and currency reserves of the  Central Bank to create a stabilizing fund and provide measures  to support the course of the national currency. Enterprises  with all forms of ownership, including those involved in trading  operations with states of the former union, must give 15 percent  of their earnings to the hard currency funds of the Republic.  Specialists consider these measures adopted by the Government  of the Republic of Uzbekistan to be an important stage in  preparing for the introduction of the national currency that  will replace the current transitional sum-coupon.</p>

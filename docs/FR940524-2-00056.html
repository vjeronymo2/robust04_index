On March 29, 1994, District Judge Oberdorfer ruled that 50 CFR 15.11(b)(2) and the final sentence of &sect;15.11(c) [which were promulgated by the Service as part of the final rule published on November 16, 1993, 58 FR 60524], violate the language of the WBCA because those regulatory sanctions purported to exclude from the coverage of the automatic import moratorium those exotic birds listed on appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) that did not originate in the country or countries that listed them in appendix III. Therefore, in keeping with the district court order, the Service announces that all exotic birds listed on CITES appendix III are covered by the automatic import moratorium of the WBCA, regardless of their country of origin. Future rule-making notices will delete the regulatory provisions that were invalidated by the court order. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </AGENCY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Dr. Susan S.

On November 16, 1993 the Service published a final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 60524) which implemented the prohibitions stipulated in the WBCA and provided permit requirements and procedures for some allowed exemptions. This final rule finalized the proposed rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  of August 12, 1993 (58 FR 42926) with some modifications based on comments received and further analysis by the Service. This notice serves to announce that the Service will propose to amend 50 CFR 15.11 (b) and (c)_Prohibitions, of the final rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 16, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the final rule of November 16, 1993, the Service interpreted that appendix III species are considered CITES-listed species for the purposes of these regulations only if they originate in the country that listed them in appendix III. The Service noted that the listing of a species in appendix III is a unilateral action by a particular CITES Party, thereby requiring CITES permits and implementation of CITES permits issuance requirements for that country only; when the species is found in other countries that did not list it in appendix III, only a certificate of origin is required, stating that it did not originate in the country that listed the species in appendix III. Therefore, when the species is found in countries other than where listed in appendix III, it is not subject to the same level of CITES controls, and indeed is only listed in the appendices to assist the listing state in implementing its domestic legislation. Based on its understanding of the intent of Congress, the Service implemented a final rule whereby appendix III species were subject to the automatic import prohibitions of the law, if they originated in the listing country. Otherwise, they would be subject to the discretionary prohibitions of the law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Humane Society of the United States and Defenders of Wildlife brought a civil action against the Secretary of the Interior in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging that part of &sect;15.11 which restricts the importation of certain appendix III exotic birds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Humane Society of the United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Babbitt,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Civ. No. 94&hyph;0296 (D.D.C., Mar. 29, 1994). A hearing in District Court took place on March 7, 1994. Plaintiffs argued that this provision, which was adopted through notice and comment procedures, violates the language of the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992. They sought relief to suspend or invalidate the following exception, contained in the final rule, to the prohibition on importation of birds listed in the Convention's appendices: ``This paragraph (b) does not apply to an exotic bird species listed in appendix III to the Convention that originated in a country that has not listed the species in appendix III'' (50 CFR 15.11 (b) (2)). Plaintiffs argued that this provision violates the plain language of the Act, which bars the importation of ``any'' species listed in ``any'' appendix to the Convention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 29, 1994 U.S. District Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer found the contested regulation to be invalid. Therefore, effective immediately, no birds listed in CITES appendix III can be imported into the United States unless they are accompanied by an import permit or are on an approved list, pursuant to 50 CFR part 15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a future notice, the Service will propose to amend 50 CFR 15.11 (b) and (c) consistent with the declaration in the Court Order. The Service will propose that all exotic bird species listed in CITES appendix III (in addition to those in I or II), wherever found, cannot be imported into the U.S. unless accompanied by an import permit issued pursuant to subpart C of 50 CFR part 15 or are included in an approved list. On March 17, 1994 the Service published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 12784) a proposed rule establishing those approved lists. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated May 4, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  16 U.S.C. 4901&hyph;4916.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> George T.

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The ERM And Maastricht: Peseta reacts well to easing of controls THE PESETA yesterday remained above its Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) floor against the D-Mark 24 hours after the Bank of Spain eased exchange controls to reassure worried currency markets. The currency held at Pta71.40 to the D-Mark, above its Pta72.6 ERM floor and virtually unchanged from its Monday close. But there was continued market scepticism about the currency's value. Residents were once more allowed to conduct commercial operations on the forward peseta market and there were no new restrictions on the spot market. Mr Pedro Perez, secretary of state for the economy, said an interest rate rise was 'not on the government's agenda for the moment,' and that a devaluation of the peseta 'should not necessarily take place'. There has been intense lobbying by Madrid for a general realignment of the ERM, with a lower peseta parity. Spain hasmaintained penalties on peseta loans through foreign exchange markets.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Julio Reyes] </F>   [Excerpts] President Rafael Caldera has outlined his  government's decision to face difficulties with courage during a  speech at a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the  Chamber of Commerce of Maracaibo.    In his second visit to the region after becoming president  for the second time, Caldera expressed his faith and optimism  that the country will overcome the serious difficulties it is  facing.    He said our problems are not the result of nature or  Providence but, rather, of errors made in setting national  policy. [passage omitted]    The president delivered a speech at the closing of the  commemoration ceremony. He affirmed that there are large  differences between the Venezuela that never knew what oil was  and the Venezuela that experienced the oil boom, but, more  important, he said was the fundamental fact that there now  exists a "willingness to promote and open new possibilities and  horizons."    He added: "Maracaibo is being increasingly incorporated into  the nation's development each and every day, and it is  constantly showing its ability to compete for the best position  in the task of making Venezuela a prosperous country.    "We are, without a doubt, confronting a difficult situation  that has not been prompted by natural causes, nor by the  cyclical development of national life, but by the serious  mistakes and errors in forming national policy.    "Within this difficult situation, however, there is  undoubtedly a common objective, as has been outlined in the  speech by Chamber of Commerce President Jorge Porras: `It is the  responsibility of all Venezuelans to overcome the obstacles  posed by the current situation.'" [passage omitted]    The president also said: "We are convinced that our efforts  to reactivate the economy will not be enough if we fail to  understand that the fundamental objective is not wealth in and  of itself, but wealth in favor of human needs to improve the  standards of living of all human beings."    The president said the country is experiencing a yearning  for  victory, a feeling of hope, and a favorable outlook, adding that  it has the deep feeling that there exists a healthy, firm, and  decisive resolve to guide the nation toward meeting established  objectives." [no opening quotation marks as published]    "At this moment, we feel there exists, both within and  outside of Venezuela, a favorable trend to invest in various  economic activities, because it is perceived that we live in a  country blessed by nature and protected by Providence and that  all well-intended initiatives will be successful."    He added that on this 100th anniversary of Maracaibo's  Chamber of Commerce he sees signs of hope and encouragement for  all Venezuelans.    Caldera remarked: "This 100th anniversary represents for all  a great inspiration and the reaffirmation of self-esteem, which  has been crippled in recent years."    Meanwhile, the president explained there are people who, in  recent years, have experienced the diabolical pleasure of  harming, destroying, and sowing doubts in our own country and  ourselves.    Caldera concluded: "I feel that at this time it is our duty  to fight to make the Venezuelan people take pride in our  traditions. This is a time for action, faith, and unyielding  resolve to get Venezuela back on its feet. We must recognize the  difficult situation the country has been in, but we must also  understand that there exists a vitality that will enable us to  overcome these difficulties. There is a powerful national and  regional vitality that lets us see that we will enter the 21st  century with the distinct opportunity to progress and achieve  reaffirmation and stability.    "I congratulate the people of Zulia at this commemoration.  Here is a confirmation of endurance and a contribution in favor  of the greater needs of the region and country."</p>

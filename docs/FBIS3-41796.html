"A decade ago women and children seemed on the periphery of  the AIDS epidemic. Today they are at the centre of our concern,"  Dr. Michael Merson, executive director of the WHO global  programme on AIDS, said.    "AIDS has not spared women and their children. On the  contrary, the epidemic wave has affected millions of them, and  millions more are threatened."    More than 13 million women will have been infected by 2000,  and nearly a third of them will have died, Dr. Merson told an  international conference on HIV in children and mothers held in  Edinburgh.    Even if all new infections were stopped in their tracks now,  total AIDS cases would still quadruple by 2000. Almost one in  two of newly-infected adults were women. "The number of women  acquiring HIV a year cannot be counted in the thousands, or even  the hundreds of thousands.    "More than 1 million women will be infected in 1993.    "By the year 2000, over 13 million women will have been  affected, and about 4 million of them will have died."    As infections increased in women, so did infections in their  babies. So far, these totalled about 1 million, and more than  half already had AIDS.    [Passage omitted]    Guardian Newspapers Limited, September 8, 1993</p>

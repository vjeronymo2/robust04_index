			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Theories behind the UK fiscal debate Should the next UK Budget contain tax increases - or spending cuts - in spite of a modest and fragile recovery from a prolonged recession? Behind this over-familiar question are issues of principle which affect every advanced industrial economy and which have never been resolved since the second world war. The chart shows a familiar stylised picture of booms and slumps around an upward underlying trend of output. The first point to note is that the upward trend, shown by the dotted line, remains unaffected by fluctuations. Some economic analyses state this explicitly, for instance the Bank of England Working Paper No 13, from which I have adapted the chart. Granted the central assumption, the risks of doing nothing beyond Norman Lamont's deferred tax increases are overwhelming. The risk of inaction is that the UK will end up with a high burden of interest payments, or even a debt trap in which that burden rises out of control. (The latter is still a remote risk for the UK.) Suppose that the UK is at point C on the chart after a prolonged recession. Then a relatively lax fiscal policy might make some contribution to ensuring that the economy does indeed recover along the path CD, instead of carrying on longer in a depressed condition below trend. But the gains will be very limited. Output will end up, in any case, in a few years at point B on the trend line. All that chancellors can hope to do is to reduce the oscillation of the wavy line around the trend. Given all the difficulties of fine tuning and the well-known dangers of doing 'too much too late' or 'too little too late', anti-cyclical fiscal policy is as likely to aggravate fluctuations as to flatten them out. Now, however, let us make the different assumption that the long-run course of output - or supply potential - is not predetermined, but can itself be reduced by a protracted recession or period of below-trend growth. There are many ways in which this can happen. Human beings can lose valuable work habits if unemployed for too long. Investment will be held back if final demand is not there, especially investment in increased capacity. (If you want to show that you are up with economic writing while making these commonsense points, you can use the word 'hysteresis'.) Thus, after a prolonged recession, aggravated by perverse fiscal soundness, the economy may not be able to go back to the dotted line and stay there without overheating and explosive inflation. After a series of such episodes the British economy (or more seriously the combined economies of the industrial world) may end up instead at point E. If the trend itself is deflected downwards, national income is lower and less revenue raised at any given tax rates than if the economy had remained on the dotted line. The argument is still not resolved without some estimate of how much long-run loss of output is incurred by overtight financial policies - that is how far E is likely to be below B. If it is by only a modest amount, it might still be worth correcting the budget deficit in good time to avoid the process of collecting large sums of tax from citizens just to hand them back in the shape of debt interest. This is a costly irritation involving distortionary taxation which could itself inhibit supply potential. Gavyn Davies, in the Goldman Sachs Economics Analyst which provides the thinking behind the IFS Green Budget, hints at such a cost benefit analysis but does not provide it. Of course, if the economy continues to face a threat of depression for years on end it would be sensible to try to reduce the deadweight burden of interest payments under national debt, by trying to switch the weight of stimulative policy to the monetary side, that is by cutting interest rates so much that tax rates can safely be edged upwards. But whether one likes it or not, monetary policy has an international dimension; and it would be more prudent to allow fiscal policy to continue to bear some of the weight of economic stimulation until we have seen how far international interest rates are likely to fall, after the German cut. These are highly important details, which have caused ministerial resignations and prime ministerial tantrums. But the point of principle is whether fiscal policy can affect the path of output to any worthwhile extent; and, if so, whether the short-term path of output can affect the underlying trend. Learned treatises on the need for budget tightening which do not consider these matters should go into the bin.</p>

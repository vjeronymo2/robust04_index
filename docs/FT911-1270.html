			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Building downturn seen to be deepening THE recession in the UK construction industry, already the worst for a decade, has deepened further during the first three months of this year, according to a survey of 600 construction companies published today. The Building Employers' Confederation, which conducted the survey last month, said some companies were making suicidal bids to win work in an effort to maintain cash flow. Almost three quarters of the companies questioned said workloads had fallen further during the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months of last year. The only sector to show any improvement was private house building. Sales of houses had improved since interest rates started to fall in mid February but the pick-up had been only modest. Orders for private-sector commercial and industrial work, by comparison, have fallen steeply during the past 12 months. Mr David Woods, the confederation's chairman, said yesterday: 'The construction industry is firmly in the grip of its worst recession since 1980-81. Confidence about general workloads is at a very low level, with nearly four fifths of firms expecting lower output during the next 12 months compared with the previous year.' The confederation said that it saw no reason to change its forecast that 100,000 jobs might be cut this year. Mr Woods said he was concerned at reports of companies making suicidal bids to win orders. 'Buying work at absurdly low prices is a recipe for bankruptcy,' he said. The confederation is Britain's largest construction industry trade association. It has more than 9,000 members with combined annual turnover of Pounds 30bn, more than three quarters of the UK total. The proportion of companies reporting falling output had risen in every region except Yorkshire. The recession had taken a firm grip in most of the north of England and in Scotland, the confederation said.</p>

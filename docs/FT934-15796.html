			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: Daimler chief sees DM1.5bn nine-month loss at parent DAIMLER-BENZ'S Stuttgart-based parent company made a loss of DM1.5bn (Dollars 924m) in the first nine months of this year, according to Mr Edzard Reuter, group chairman. The company, which recently announced a first-half deficit of DM949bn, would offer no further details on Mr Reuter's forecast, made in a television interview on Thursday. However, officials confirmed that a DM1.5bn charge to cover the cost of job losses would all be taken in the third quarter instead of being spread over the second half as originally planned. 'If we record an operating loss for the third quarter then in any case the January to September loss will be more than DM1.5bn,' a spokesman said. It was not clear if the turnround point had been reached. The first half deficit, reported under US accounting standards adopted for the technology group's listing on the New York stock exchange earlier this month, included DM300m losses on exchange rates and an unspecified amount for job cuts, he added. In common with other automotive industry stocks, the Daimler share price weakened in Frankfurt yesterday - down DM3.8 at DM744 - even though the blue chip Dax index closed at a record high. Daimler, which includes Mercedes-Benz, the AEG group, Deutsche Aerospace and Debis financial and computer services, is in the middle of a radical cost-cutting programme.</p>

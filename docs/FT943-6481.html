			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / UK Company News: New homes favoured by buyers - Andrew Taylor reports on the latest study of housebuilders' trends The UK housing market's slow emergence from recession is unlikely to dent sharp increases in housebuilders' pre-tax profits, according to brokers Credit Lyonnais Laing. Its annual study of the housing sector's state of health says that the pace of recovery is likely to be sluggish, with borrowing costs remaining high. Potential house buyers are unlikely to be as active as in previous recoveries because confidence has been sapped by the fall in house prices in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This should not, however, prevent housebuilders' profits from rising rapidly over the next 18 months. New homes this year have been selling faster than existing properties, where estate agents have complained that the price expectations of many sellers have remained too high. Best placed are companies with large land banks which have not been forced to replenish stocks as land prices have risen sharply since the beginning of 1993. The Credit Lyonnais study has been published at the start of a busy results season for construction and building materials companies. Some of these have already benefited from the rise in new housebuilding in the UK and also in the US. Last week Marley, the building materials group, announced that pre-tax profits had almost doubled to Pounds 26m during the six months to end-June - its best first-half performance since 1989. Next Wednesday housebuilder Persimmon and cement group Rugby are both expected to show higher interim profits. Credit Lyonnais argues that housebuilders have increased their market share while the overall housing market has remained sluggish over the summer. Its profits model, based on the performance of 20 quoted housebuilders, expects the number of homes built by the companies to increase by 13.5 per cent this year to 41,534 and by a further 22 per cent next year to 50,630. Higher house sales for the same fixed overheads will enhance builders' margins, depending upon how many new sites are started. But 'the most significant impact on profits this year and perhaps even next year' is likely to be the elimination of expensive land bought at the peak of the market. Builders will have been assisted further by the removal of sales incentives, accounting for as much as 5 per cent of the sale price of a home, even though house prices in general have seen little uplift. Credit Lyonnais believes the recovery will remain slow, with purchasers likely to move because of need rather than to take advantage of rapidly rising prices. Capital growth of 1 or 2 per cent a year against long-term mortgage rates of 9 per cent for 10-year loans will not encourage people to move. The main constraint on the market, however, is the continuing impact of negative equity which 'has not just altered the purchasing power of those directly affected but has affected the attitudes of potential house purchasers who, in a more inflationary environment, might now be rushing to join the housing bandwagon.' The study concludes: 'In a recovering economy the bull points will win but the contraints will be of sufficient import to make the recovery a slow one.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               The Top Ten Housebuilders - Units Completed  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Year  1989  1990  1991  1992  1993  *1994  *1995                       end  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Wimpey                Dec   7100  6263  6380  5542  6936   8000   8500 Tarmac                Dec  12027 11038  9327  7820  6837   7000   7500 Barratt               Jun   6600  5950  4963  4706  4988   5750   6700 Beazer                Jun   6066  5372  5006  4266  4805   4050   6000 Wilcon (Wilson Connolly)             Dec   1800  2350  2750  2880  3840   4300   4800 Hassall (Raine)       Jun   1913  1976  1893  2375  2923   3350   3700 Bryant                May   1890  1600  1865  2330  2815   3200   3700 Persimmon             Dec   1796  2028  2324  2274  2771   3250   4000 Lovell                Sep   2963  2823  3101  2571  2770   2700   3100 Ideal (Trafalgar House)                Sep   3402  2525  2235  2354  2554   2500   2500  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Estimate Source: Credit Lyonnais Laing  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

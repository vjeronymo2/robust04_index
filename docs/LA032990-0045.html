			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TAR BALLS ON N. COUNTY BEACH PUZZLE OFFICIALS  </P> <P> Small tar balls have washed onto a five-mile stretch of beach in North County,  sparking a U. S. Coast Guard investigation into its source and causing joggers  to watch their step.  </P> <P> The oil was first noticed Tuesday at Camp Pendleton and by Wednesday afternoon  had moved to the southern edge of Oceanside's city beach, authorities said.  </P> <P> Coast Guard investigators, who were sending samples of the oil to a laboratory  for analysis, said they were unsure whether it may be the result of natural  seepage from the ocean floor or from an ocean-going ship. But local officials  said there was no reason to link the tar balls with last month's tanker spill  off Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Oceanside city officials characterized the oil as more of a nuisance than  anything else, and sent two beach-sweeping machines onto the strand to remove  the goo.  </P> <P> "We're finding dabs here and there," City Hall spokesman Larry Bauman said.  "The biggest ones are the size of small, misshapen cookies."  </P> <P> He said the city was notified of the oil Tuesday by Camp Pendleton officials,  who discovered the oil on their own beaches. The city sent out its Harbor  Patrol boats to search for a slick, but none was found.  </P> <P> Camp Pendleton officials said the oil began appearing about 2 p.m. Tuesday. "It  was nothing very significant," said Staff Sgt. John Midgette, a base spokesman.  </P> <P> "Our natural-resources people went out to look at it again this morning, but it  was all gone," he said Wednesday.  </P> <P> He said there was no danger to wildlife.  </P> <P> Oceanside's Bauman said lifeguards found three dead birds on the beach  Wednesday, but that it was unclear whether any had been oiled and that one or  two dead birds are usually found every day.  </P> <P> Officials with the state Department of Fish and Game said they knew of no  unusual problems caused by the oil. The Coast Guard could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> Natural oil seepage from fissures in the ocean floor is not unusual. Off Santa  Barbara, more than 2,000 gallons of crude oil leaks from the ocean floor daily,  according to Coast Guard estimates.  </P></p>

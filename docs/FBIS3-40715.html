			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tamil </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Dominance of Contributions in Elections"] </F>   [Text] It is indeed a mighty big problem to regulate the  election expenses of the candidates and political parties. The  Chief Election Commissioner T.N. Seshan has again embarked upon  a good mission to focus attention on the issue. Due to serious  drawbacks in the election laws, it has not been possible to  strictly monitor the election expenses. Among all the various  aspects of the election law, the rules and regulations  concerning election expenses have become ridiculous aspects.    It is estimated that a major party, on national level spends  up to Rs.1,000 crores (10 billion rupees) on each election. How  does it get this huge amount? The elections create an illicit  relationship of ties between politicians and leaders of  industries. This is the cause of black money (unaccounted or  hidden) growing into millions of rupees, according to the  intelligence experts. So far no serious effort was undertaken to  put an end to this most unpleasant chapter in the history of  Indian democracy.    In order to rectify these drawbacks, suitable amendments to  the law have to be made. Without waiting for the parliament to  do this, Seshan has begun to make use of the existing provisions  of the law to take effective action. He has decided to revise  the forms intended to get the data regarding election expenses;  Candidates should give not merely expenses incurred by them, but  also paid by others, meaning their parties, or other individuals  or organizations. It is also essential that the candidates  should solemnly swear and declare that they do not hide anything  and no expense was omitted. Of course, those who cheat and  deceive may still invent ways to escape from strict measures.  Yet there is nothing wrong in making these regulations as rigid  and strict as possible.    It is of course, true, that the dominance of money power in  elections cannot be eradicated by the action of the Chief  Election Commissioner. It will be possible only if political  parties and the government give their full cooperation in the  matter. Politicians should not hesitate in giving the election  commission the authority to audit the expense accounts of the  political parties. In the absence of such an arrangement,  candidates will show only a fraction of their real expenditure.  This is because politicians have been practicing the art of  cheating for so long a time that they have made a mockery of the  election rules regarding the excessive election spending.</p>

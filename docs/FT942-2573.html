			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: LVMH sees strong profits growth LVMH, the French luxury goods group, was on course for strong profits growth in 1994 after benefiting from buoyant sales during the opening months of the year, Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman, confirmed yesterday. The group expected net profits to rise by 'more than 30 per cent' during the first half of 1994 from FFr935m (Dollars 164m) during the same period last year, Mr Arnault told the company's annual meeting. It is in the throes of acquisitions after reducing its debt by unravelling a cross shareholding agreement with Guinness, the UK brewer. Mr Arnault forecast the group, which last year was affected by a downturn in the champagne market and by the impact of restructuring costs on the contribution from its Guinness stake, would achieve a profits increase of 'at least 20 per cent' in 1994 from FFr3.57bn in 1993. The improvement in the group's fortunes reflects a wider recovery across the international luxury goods industry. The luxury market, which flourished during the 1980s, was one of the first casualties of the economic recession in the early 1990s. However, the industry has since last autumn benefited from increased demand in the US and in its emerging south-east Asian markets. LVMH owns some of the world's most high-prestige products including Hennessy cognac and Louis Vuitton luggage. The group recently reported a 28 per cent increase in turnover to FFr6.02bn in the first quarter of this year, fuelled by healthy sales growth for cognac and luggage. Mr Arnault yesterday confirmed that the upward sales trend had continued during the second quarter. LVMH, he said, had registered a 22 per cent increase in sales in the five months to the end of May. In the meantime the group is pressing ahead with its acquisition plans. Mr Arnault said he hoped to develop the group's interests outside the drinks sphere by expanding its other luxury activities, such as fashion and beauty products. Since the unravelling of the Guinness agreement LVMH has taken control of Guerlain, the French fragrance house in which it held a minority stake. It is understood to be in negotiations over the acquisition of Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, the Paris-based jeweller. If the deal goes through Van Cleef could become LVMH's first foothold in the real jewellery market dominated by France's Cartier and Tiffany of the US.</p>

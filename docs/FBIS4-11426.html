			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fernando Davalos] </F>   [Excerpt] There are no paradoxes or dizzying figures  involved. The surprise potential is zero. We are speaking of a  ready, available, and burning fuel that has enabled the country  to produce electricity, cement, and other goods to an extent  unprecedented in the history of Cuba--1.1 million tons of oil  extracted in the critical year of 1993.    This is an undeniable record that can be attributed only to  the integrity of the workers in the sector, who are laboring  with materials in short supply and with badly worn technical  facilities. These workers began production in January of this  year at a steady rate of 25,000 barrels per day, an absolute  record that is also unprecedented.    The domestic recovery of oil, spurred by the shortage of  imported fuel, was thus pushed beyond the high-water mark of  936,000 tons achieved in 1986 under better technical conditions.  By way of reference, the UNO-UNO [expansion not given] campaign  in 1992 set the previous record. In that year the total reached  was 882,000 tons, although by then we were already short of  replacement parts and without foreign technical aid.    In 1993, modern techniques for stimulating wells were  effectively introduced by the foreign oil companies operating in  Cuba. But only 16 percent of the total extracted in the country  (about 170,000 tons) can be ascribed to "enhanced production,"  as these methods are called.    Nor can there be talk of new wells (which could almost be  counted on one's fingers) or of spontaneous "miracle" gushers,  nor of any sensational discoveries by these foreign firms  either. Since this is the case, and given such difficult  conditions, what explanation can there be for the 26-percent  increase in oil extraction in 1993, as compared with that in the  preceding year?    The skill and experience of these workers, apart from their  honor, played a role in these results. Also, the effects of a  series of measures set forth in the oil program previously  approved by the highest Cuban Government bodies began to make  themselves felt. These measures included substantially  increasing wage rates and linking wages with labor-productive  yields; improving working and living conditions (nutrition,  camps, protective gear, clothing, transportation, housing,  etc.); and careful rationalization of personnel strength, which  was reduced to the indispensable minimum, among other things.    Efficiency increased, and only in this way would it have  been  possible to cope with the difficulties. The oil workers are  aware, however, of the inadequacies--their own and those of  others, which were seen in 1993, despite the achievement of the  UNO-UNO goals. The workers say that there were also  technical-organizational problems unrelated to the geology of  the deposits, which have a greater extraction potential than the  level reached (the production program for this last year had  even been set at 1.3 million tons).    Thus the shortage of vessels for shipping crude oil through  Cardenas was again a factor in 1993, although it was less  important in that year, and some notable records were even set  in the transportation process. Nowadays almost all of the fuel  extracted from the so-called Varadero deposit (which is not in  Varadero, but south of the beach that bears the same name) and  in the fields surrounding it converges on this port in Matanzas.  All of these fields belong to the Central Petroleum Drilling and  Extracting Enterprise (EPEP), which achieved the highest  production level in its history--825,000 tons--in 1993.    If a vessel reaches port late, this contributes to keeping  the storage tanks on land full, which in turn makes it necessary  to shut down wells. Once a well has been shut down, it sometimes  takes 15 days to regain the previous extraction level. It is  true that the use of an old oil pipeline, which has inadequate  capacity and is in poor condition, was also a factor in this  situation.    The operation of the "ship-pipeline" process of taking oil  out of Matanzas was also affected by the unavailability of the  steam needed to liquefy the oil to some extent for easier  handling. In the past, this steam came from the boilers of the  nearby Jose A. Echeverria Distillery. In 1993, there was also a  shortage of solvents, such as the cutter stock used for the same  purpose of reducing the viscosity of this crude oil, which is  very dense.    There were technical problems of all kinds, most of which  were overcome, one after the other. It can be said that the lack  of supplies, in particular replacement parts for the old Soviet  technological apparatus still in use, was a constant factor.  Replacement equipment and other imported materials were in short  supply, as were masks, gloves, boots, and other protective gear.  It was necessary to employ inventiveness to find substitutes and  to impose stricter disciplinary and organizational measures.    The exploitation of the wells and oilfields became  increasingly efficient. The least productive wells were shut  down in the course of the process, and the operation of the  others was guaranteed. They were even protected against power  failures.    The battle to increase production was very dramatic. A  decisive role was played by geotechnical measures. At many  sites, the method used was the recirculation underground of  injected light oil beneath the productive zone, so as to clean  it, leaving more space for the influx of the crude oil (this  technique is called "PPG," [expansion not given] an analogical  reference to the famous Cuban medicine). In 1993, pumps were  installed at wells that had initially operated on the basis of  spontaneous gushers and had later ceased to produce. Extraction  pumps were also installed at other previously inactive wells  that promised good yields. Also, the Cuban oil workers, on their  own account, made successful use of the "enhanced production"  technique, which they assimilated rapidly.    But the principal guarantee was provided by the workers.  Lazaro Campoalegre emphasized what many people in the Central  and Western EPEP zones had told me. "The effort made by the  workers has been decisive. The nation's limitations have made it  necessary to be inventive in order to keep the old equipment  operating and to extract from each well all it can produce, so  as not to lose a single gram."    Campoalegre, who is the deputy director of human resources  in  the Western Zone, is contemplating the rehabilitation of the  Soviet A-50 trucks for use in well repair, aeration, and  circulation. "This struggle depends on man, and even technology  will not work if the human effort is lacking. Perseverance and  the systematic checking of each well are basic. Thus more than  ever, man provides the primary guarantee," Campoalegre says.    The people anticipated the difficulties. In the Central EPEP  zone, problems developed with the seals and gears on the pump  used for our heavy oil (the seals alone cost between $10,000 and  $15,000). A solution was sought and found, working jointly  within the Cupet [Cuban Petroleum Enterprise]. Now there is  production here and there, ranging from nuts and washers to  small-capacity extraction pumps.    There was a positive reaction to the difficulties, apart  from  the encouraging effects of the wage-scale reform implemented.  The workers began to receive basic wage increases, as well as  premiums based on the fulfillment of the production plan (the  average monthly wage of 238-240 pesos increased to more than  300). The technicians and administrative directors also  benefitted from income adjustments based on the progress made in  the programs. The existing jobs and the duties involved were  studied, interchangeable tasks were introduced, and the  organizational structure was simplified.    The work force was reduced and the oil enterprises began  preparations for the introduction of the system of  self-financing in foreign exchange. Beginning in 1993, all of  this led to a substantial increase in efficiency, and first and  foremost, in the production rates.    The oil workers adopted a labor regime wherein attention to  the human element began to make itself felt. They began to build  housing for themselves. Hundreds of bicycles were given to them.  Farm plots for food self-sufficiency were established in order  to improve the dining-room menus and to provide additional  nutrition, from which the workers directly involved in  production have benefitted. Transportation points inside and  outside the oil-producing zones were organized. The Black Gold  contest helped to mobilize this great effort.  <H5>  The Central EPEP </H5>   The Central Petroleum Drilling and Extracting Enterprise  (EPEP), which covers the provinces of Matanzas and Villa Clara,  is credited with 75 percent of domestic hydrocarbon production,  obtained essentially from its approximately 170 active wells.  They constitute a part of the Varadero deposit, the largest  source of heavy crude oil in the country, located south of the  beach that bears the same name, and the peripheral  areas--Cantel, Serpentina, Caliza, Camarioca, Varadero South,  and Guasimas, as well as other smaller ones.    Today it is within the area of this MINBAS [Ministry of  Basic  Industry] enterprise, which is also a part of Cuba Oil, that  there is the most collaboration with foreign oil firms. This has  helped somewhat to alleviate the material shortages.    In the year that has just begun, the employees of this  enterprise, who are in the main the protagonists in the efforts  made in the sector in 1993, are faced with new challenges. They  will now continue their decisive investments and extend their  efforts to increase the yields of more wells. In this way, they  will be able to come close to 1 million tons. This is an  attainable, and not a distant, goal. The challenge in 1994 will  in addition include assimilation of new technologies, and the  continuation and development of exchanges of mutual aid with the  oil companies operating in the various areas.  <H5>  The Western EPEP </H5>   The second EPEP in Cuba is that in the western region. Its  interests extend to Pinar del Rio and Havana, although the  deposits are located in Boca de Jaruco (the largest one),  Yumuri, Puerto Escondido, and Martin Mesa.    This EPEP has about 180 operating wells from which it  extracted 25 percent of the total 1993 domestic hydrocarbon  production (almost 300,000 tons). The oil produced here is of  medium density. It is sent to the East Havana Thermoelectric  Power Station (in Santa Cruz del Norte) and to other nearby  points.    The technical base of this EPEP lies in the Caribbean--Boca  de Jaruco--zone, from which 90 percent of this oil is extracted.    The gas and oil pipelines soon to be linked up with the  electric power station mentioned above originate at these  oilfields. This will make the current transfer of the fuel in  drums unnecessary (at present, for example, there is one well  there producing more than 100 tons per day thanks to a  spontaneous gusher, so that constant rotation of the tank trucks  is required). Foreign companies also operate within the  territory of this advanced western oil enterprise. They are  mainly engaged in "enhanced production," and excellent  cooperation has developed in this connection. These  relationships will be continued and extended in 1994 to keep  pace with the productive goals. According to realistic  predictions, new historic records will again be set.    It is not only the magnificent brigade responsible for  capital and subterranean well repairs, entrusted with the task  of keeping the wells operating and stimulating production, that  merits special mention in connection with the 1993 results. It  is reported that almost every one of the men participated in  this extraordinary effort, despite the shortage of resources,  suitable clothing, and footgear, and the extensive technical  difficulties.

			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COEXISTING WITH BEACH DENIZENS  </P> <P> When frequenting local beaches, there's a philosophy that can help people  peacefully coexist with jellyfish and stingrays.  </P> <P> "The only problem is that they're the residents, and the visitors are the ones  who are encroaching," said Andy O'Leary, director of marine safety for Solana  Beach.  </P> <P> With that in mind, to avoid stepping on a stingray, waders should shuffle their  feet through the sand rather than running or striding in shallow water, said  John Schooler, a Del Mar lifeguard.  </P> <P> Normally, the commotion will cause a stingray to quickly swim away to a  less-populated spot, Schooler said.  </P> <P> "With jellyfish, there's not a lot you can do other than look for them,"  Schooler said.  </P> <P> If a swimmer does get stung, there are simple remedies available at the nearest  lifeguard tower.  </P> <P> Nothing takes the sting out of a stingray sting like soaking the wound in hot  water for 30 to 45 minutes, Schooler said.  </P> <P> And, for jellyfish stings, it's best to treat the affected area with either  rubbing alcohol or a mixture of equal parts of ammonia and cold water, said  Chappy Mico, a Mission Beach lifeguard.  </P> <P> Pour the solution over the wound rather than rubbing it in; rubbing or  scratching a jellyfish sting will cause the poison to spread, said Rodney  Ferrif, an Oceanside lifeguard.  </P> <P> And, if alcohol and ammonia aren't available, vinegar and water can be used as  a substitute, Schooler said.  </P> <P> Although neither type of sting is usually very serious, some cases might  require more extensive medical attention, Mico said.  </P> <P> "People who are allergic to bee stings are allergic to stingrays as well," Mico  said.  </P> <P> As with other types of open wounds, stingray victims need to make sure the  injury doesn't become infected, said Robert Snodgrass, associate aquarium  curator at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

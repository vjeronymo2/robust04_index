			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY FAILING, THATCHER SAYS  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Friday that the West is witnessing "the  failure of the Communist ideology and the meltdown of authoritarian regimes."  </P> <P> In a broad-ranging speech after receiving the honorary "freedom" of the City of  London, Thatcher said there were "great upheavals" in the Soviet Union,  Hungary, Poland and China.  </P> <P> "We are witnessing what is perhaps the greatest change for many decades: the  failure of the Communist ideology and the meltdown of authoritarian regimes,"  she said.  </P> <P> "The attractions of democracy and free enterprise are ever more apparent, not  only for the prosperity they create but because they give life dignity and  meaning.  </P> <P> "Can anyone now doubt that the tide is turning in the struggle for the hearts  and minds of people the world over?"  </P> <P> But Thatcher added: "Times of great change are times of great uncertainty.  </P> <P> "More than ever we shall need to keep our defenses strong and sure, in case the  clouds of tyranny should gather and spread once more."  </P> <P> The ceremony in the medieval Guildhall Building, site of civic administration  in London for 800 years, was to mark Thatcher's 10 years in office.  </P> <P> As an Honorary Freeman of the City, London's financial district, Thatcher  follows such former prime ministers as David Lloyd George and Winston  Churchill. The honor bestows a centuries-old right to herd sheep across London  Bridge.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonid Goldin: "The Hasidim's First Joys in </F> Russia"]    [Text] We described the disturbing details of the  story of Schneerson's private library in the article "The  Misadventures of the Hasidim in Russia" (NOVOYE VREMYA, No  46/93). Recently there have been some new developments in this  story.    Albert Gore received one of Schneerson's books from the  Lenin Library depository, and Bill Clinton was given seven of  them. They say that the question of the return of the Lubavitch  collection to the Hasidim has been settled. Rabbi Baruch Kunin  is full of energy and vitality at the age of 50, but he is not  certain that he will live to see the day when all of the books  are returned to Rabbi Schneerson.    Yosif took a large cardboard box, which had once held  packages of rice (part of the humanitarian aid his father, Rabbi  Baruch Kunin, sends to Moscow from California), and carefully  wrote the following inscription on the box in Russian: "Please  return our books." He put on a black Russian sheepskin coat and  set off for the Lenin Library.  <H5>  The Hasidim Go to the Library </H5>   Yosif and his friends decided that it was time for the books  of the Lubavitch rabbis to be returned, now that parliament is  not keeping the Russian president and government from doing good  deeds. During the October standoff, the Hasidim had helped the  Russian democrats as much as they could by delivering kosher  sausages and apple juice to the Moscow Soviet, where a huge  crowd had gathered in response to Gaydar's appeals.    This year the Hasidim celebrated Hanukkah with the slogan  "The Freedom of the Schneerson Library and the Genuine Freedom  of Russia Are Indivisible," and Rabbi Schneerson said: "Kindness  will prevail in Russia, and the sacred books will be returned  with a smile."    The Hasidim have extremely ambivalent feelings about the  Lenin Library. They are grateful to it: The books have been kept  safe there since 1916. The Hasidim have also experienced many  distressing moments on its steps, however, when they were driven  away from the door and were not allowed anywhere near their  sacred writings. Once again, Yosif was getting ready to go to  the library with a heavy heart. This time, however, the  inaccessible books were not the only reason. The 20-year-old  rabbi was certain that the books would be returned to their  owners sooner or later, but he felt sorry for the people who  were committing such a grave sin by keeping them in the dusty  dungeon. "Woe to those who do not return the books to us," said  Rabbi Schneerson, the head of the present generation of Hasidim.  The rabbi had never been mistaken! Yosif felt so sorry for  Gorbachev: He had made many promises but had not kept his word.  He felt sorry for Gubenko: They say he is a talented man, but  now he is facing one problem after another. And what about the  Russian parliament, which had rescinded the governmental and  judicial decisions to return the books to the Hasidim? Is it  possible that people do not understand why all of this happened?    The new heads of the Ministry of Culture were also  responding  in peculiar ways to the requests of the rabbis and senators.  They offered copies..., but the Hasidim needed the sacred  objects that had been handled by seven generations of Lubavitch  rabbis. If the Russian library wants Hasidic books, it can have  them, but not the ones that had been handled by the rabbis. It  can also have much more: for example, the possibility of  on-the-job training for its staffers in libraries in the United  States and Israel.    Rabbi Yitzhak Kogan was getting ready to go to the library  with Yosif. His requests to leave Russia had been denied for 15  years. When he arrived finally in the Holy Land, he heard the  rabbis' decision: "Go back to Russia. You are needed there."  Yitzhak Kogan is busy with synagogue affairs 24 hours a day:  humanitarian aid, prayer, the study of the Torah, and the  thousands of minor and major requests and questions people  address to their rabbi. In addition, of course, there are the  books, which he does not forget for an instant. Kogan had  prepared a whole file of recent articles and older documents for  his trip to the library. They included Rabbi Yosif Yitzhak  Schneerson's letter of November 1922 to the director of the  Rumyantsev Library: "In 1921 the Science Library Department of  the People's Commissariat of Education issued a decree on the  return of the books.... I am renewing my petition for the return  of my books."    There were also contemporary case documents. Here is an  excerpt from a report by Lenin Library Deputy Director V.M.  Grigorov to the Ministry of Culture: "There are still more than  10,000 books from the collection in the Lenin Library depository  in Khimki. They are stacked in piles and are not being stored in  the most desirable conditions. The delays in the processing of  this collection are due to the fact that the Lenin Library has  only one specialist who reads Hebrew--S.A. Goldenberg. He is a  pensioner and is suffering from cataracts."    "I feel that Rabbi Schneerson's manuscripts and books in the  Lenin Library should be returned to their legal owner, the  seventh Lubavitch rabbi, because they are of no scientific value  in the development of Hebrew studies. Academician D. Likhachev."    Here is an excerpt from a letter the Ministry of Culture  received from A.L. Khasroyev, the head of the library of the  Oriental Studies Institute of the Academy of Sciences: "Given  the present shortage of Oriental and Hebrew scholars in the  libraries and the shortage of storage space and of funds for the  restoration and processing of private collections, and in view  of the absence of legal grounds for the inclusion of this  collection among the assets of the Lenin Library, the continued  storage of these books seems absolutely pointless and can only  destroy the collection." In addition, there were new petitions  from scholars, politicians, Jewish Heroes of the Soviet Union....    Rabbi Kogan also took around 10 books with him to the Lenin  Library as substitutes in case Yosif's cardboard box did not  remain empty. These books were later returned to the synagogue  and the box was thrown out with the trash.    The Hasidim did notice some changes, however, in the  attitude  of library personnel: They were given a copy of the catalogue,  and a few days later they were allowed to enter the depository  and hold the old rabbi's books in their hands. They found two  interesting documents in the archives:    "I hereby verify that library staffer Lapin delivered 35  crates, 5 of which were damaged, of Jewish books from Warehouse  No. 19 on 28 June this year and that the crates were stored in  the depository (formerly a church). Report by Lebedev, 20 June  1924."    "Act No. 186, 28 June 1924. According to Jewish library  storage invoices, 411 poods and 4 pounds of books...were turned  over to the Public Library imeni Lenin...."    "Our sacred objects have already been listed in terms of  weight in other times and other places," Y. Kogan said. "In  1242, 18 wagonloads of volumes of the Talmud in manuscripts from  all of the provinces in France were delivered to Paris.... They  were burned in the square in front of the Cathedral of Notre  Dame. I think they suffered a better fate than the eternal  prisoners of the Lenin Library. The Talmud has this to say about  burned books: 'The parchment burns, but the letters rise to the  heavens.' The sacred letters locked in the storehouses of the  Lenin Library, on the other hand, have been invisible to the  heavens and the human eye for seven decades now."  <H5>  Contacts on the Highest Level </H5>   The Hasidim had great hopes for the Russian visit by  American  Vice-President Albert Gore, who had been actively involved in  the Schneerson cause when he was a senator. These hopes were  largely justified. He went to the Lenin Library and saw the  collection of books and manuscripts. He was shown a dozen unique  publications, including volumes printed in Poland in 1594, in  Amsterdam in 1659, and in Constantinople in 1502 and a prayer  book printed in 1541, but the main thing was that Gore left the  library holding a copy of the "Taniya"--a leather-bound and  gold-embossed book published in Russia in 1902. This was the  main philosophical work of the Habad Lubavitch movement. It was  written almost 200 years ago by Rabbi Schneur Zaman, who was  then the spiritual leader of the group. The book was to be  presented to the 92-year-old Rabbi Schneerson. Rabbi B. Kunin  and his sons, Rabbi Y. Kogan, and Maimonides Academy Director V.  Irina flew to Brooklyn with the precious relic as soon as they  had received it from A. Gore. The rabbi has been gravely ill for  a long time and is confined to a wheelchair. He has difficulty  speaking. The Hasidim were certain that the book would be the  best medicine for him.    "This is a sign of goodwill and a step in the right  direction," said Minister of Culture Yevgeniy Sidorov. "We  applaud this gesture wholeheartedly. The problem of the  collection now stored in the Lenin Library is close to  resolution," A. Gore said. Rabbi Baruch Kunin added that  "receiving this book is only the start of a long journey, but it  is a phenomenal beginning."    In some respects, however, the situation became even more  complicated. In the past everything was clear: The Hasidim  insisted on the unconditional return of the books, and their  opponents were firmly convinced that the books belonged in the  Lenin Library. Now, however, the Ministry of Culture suggested  that the collection should remain in Moscow, in a special  building next to another building for religious ceremonies. This  option was acceptable to many, even the president of Russia, who  had approved this plan back in November 1993.    This turn of events did not please the Hasidim, however,  because they saw it as a treacherous maneuver. Now they had to  pin their hopes on the American President's arrival in Moscow.  Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador in Russia, was of  tremendous help to the Hasidim. I had a chance to speak with him  on the first day of the presidential visit in Moscow, when we  met by accident in the conservatory and were greeted by Grand  Hall Director Svetlana Gorbacheva. The ambassador already knew  all of the details of the case of the Lubavitch collection.  Pickering's diplomatic artistry produced results: Clinton was  given seven books and was promised, in the words of some of  those who accompanied the American President, that almost the  whole collection would be loaded onto his plane, but there was  not enough time for this. The Associated Press and Radio Israel  reported that the issue of the return of the collection had been  resolved completely, citing sources in the American  administration, but Rabbi Kunin, who has devoted the last few  years to the fight for the books, believes that this is not the  end and that the speculation over the Lubavitch collection will  continue. The only certainty is that the summit-level meetings  added eight books to the library in Brooklyn.    Once again the future is indeterminate. The Hasidic books  are  a tougher nut to crack than the nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the  Partnership for Peace program, the credits to save Russian  democracy, and the transmission of KGB secrets connected with  the Kennedy assassination. All of these matters have been  cleared up, but how much more time and effort can our high-level  statesmen waste on the resolution of a matter that is certainly  not of primary importance to Russia?! The whole Lenin Library  and all of the liberal arts in Russia are dying, and this is  arousing less concern and anxiety than a few crates of books no  one can read. How much longer can this misapplication of  authority and manipulation of the law be tolerated? How can even  one book be returned if this is against the law? And if the law  requires that the whole collection be returned to its owner, why  has this not been done? Did we grace Clinton with a generous  gift, or did we put him in an ambiguous position by presenting  him with something that does not belong to us? America is  particularly scrupulous in matters of property rights and, in  contrast to us, draws strict distinctions between church, state,  and private or personal property.  <H5>  How Can We Live Together as Friends in the Future? </H5>   Russia is the birthplace of the Lubavitch movement, and  although Rabbi Kogan said that "our history in Russia is coming  to an end," this genetic link cannot be broken even in the event  of a total exodus, like the one from Egypt. A special center  devoted to the history of the Lubavitch movement might be  established here, and the Hasidim are prepared to supply it with  all of the necessary literature. A Russian translation of the  "Taniya" is already being prepared for publication in an edition  of 10,000 copies. Religious Jews are not the only people with an  interest in Hasidic literature. I saw a large collection of  works by Martin Buber--the greatest religious philosopher on the  metaphysics and history of Hasidism--in Paris in the home of  Valeriy Afanasyev, the famous contemporary pianist and novelist.  Valeriy is particularly interested in the Cabala and the  mystical aspects of this philosophy. Habad, of course, is not on  the same level as Blavatskaya. Here, for example, is what the  Lubavitch rabbi told his congregation on Hanukkah about the  difference between the two worlds--Jewish and Hellenistic: "On  the one hand there is a special way of life, based on pure  monotheism, in which the prevailing idea is that daily life is  sacrosanct in all of its details, even the most minor ones; on  the other there is the hellenistic culture with its polytheistic  and materialistic ideas." The readers of this message, mostly  craftsmen, small businessmen, merchants, and kibbutz farmers,  are completely conversant with this discussion. The educated  Hasid is usually well-versed in the works of Maimonides and  esoteric and mystical theories that even a philosopher with a  degree may not understand. The Hasidim themselves should want  others to know more about their life and ideas. After all, many  of their contemporaries see them as borderline fanatics, and  even those who sympathize with them often equate them with the  aborigines of Australia and Argentina, but the Hasidim are  primarily scholars, who are steeped in idealistic dialectic from  infancy.    New approaches can and must be found by the Hasidim and by  their Russian partners, but Schneerson's books are Schneerson's  books. Their fate should be decided by the rabbi and the people  he authorized to do this. The Hasidim would consent to keeping  the Schneerson collection in a building of its own in Russia  only as a necessary transitional measure. I have to say that I  do not think the books should be turned over to the synagogue on  Bronnaya Street, to the Maimonides Academy, as the Hasidim  insisted at one time: Conditions there are not suitable for  this. Other options are certainly possible, but the search for  the best of these options will require respect for the law, for  property rights, and for religious values.  <H5>  When Many Are Erudite But Few Are Wise </H5>   The legislative aspect of this matter warrants special  discussion. If legal standards were more precise, these  disgraceful cases would be much fewer in number. After all, the  problem is not confined to the Schneerson collection. During the  ceremonies marking the restoration of the Kazan Cathedral on Red  Square, the president of Russia announced a decision to move  sacred Orthodox icons--the Vladimir icon of the Blessed Mother  and Rublev's "Trinity"--from the Tretyakov Gallery to the  church. The decision aroused the anger of museum personnel, and  now a long and troublesome series of judicial hearings is  anticipated.    A scandal with no precedent in our cultural history broke  out  in connection with the contract Ostankino signed with U.S. Art  Group Inc., an American corporation. General Director Yuriy  Kornilov of the State Television and Radio Program Library was  arrested for taking bribes from corporate executive Tristan  Dell, which were paid...with the knowledge of the Russian  special services. Pianist Nikolay Petrov testified in court  against the transaction, and his property was impounded. Now the  case is moving up the judicial ladder, but this was actually a  case involving national property: unique tapes including  performances by Chaliapin, Oistrakh, Kogan, Sofronitskiy, and  Rostropovich. While the country was preoccupied with the  Schneerson rarities, which no one really understands, the deal  of the century was being concluded in the Ostankino offices  without any excess publicity, and even without the consent or  knowledge of the minister of culture!    Germany, Holland, Italy, Austria, and other countries have  serious claims to some of the cultural treasures that remained  in Russia after the war. These include the greatest artistic  treasures, but the methods of quiet diplomacy have prevailed,  and there has been almost no mention of this in the press. The  experience of the guileless Hasidim, who go to the Lenin Library  with their empty boxes, taught many people a lesson. Many issues  which cannot be settled on the presidential level can be  resolved in confidential talks with the officials who hold the  keys to storage rooms and official seals. This will continue as  long as there are no precise legal standards on the use of the  country's cultural property. This will continue as long as the  people responsible for this property act as its managers and  owners instead of as its custodians.    According to a Hasidic parable, the world once had many wise  men of integrity. They met regularly to make decisions, guided  by the spirit of the Torah. They could even move the Sabbath to  a different day. In time, however, there were more erudite men  than wise men of integrity, and erudite men are not necessarily  wise or honest, and this is why they can substantiate and  justify anything that is advantageous or convenient for them.  Then the commandments of the Torah were supplemented by the  specific standards of daily life, which defined what could and  could not be done. There were particularly detailed standards  regulating the ownership of the eternal sources of discord.  These strict laws allowed society to survive instead of being  destroyed by conflicts and clashes of interests and beliefs.    I do not know any Hasidim or people close to their community  who agree on even the most minor issues. They argue their own  point of view without listening to others and they can be  extremely competitive and arrogant, but the law tells them that  there is one serious matter, one constant--the Torah. This is  where all debates come to an end. This is what allowed the Jews  to endure and survive the difficult millennia of their history.  This is what helped them in their fight with the Soviet  bureaucracy for Schneerson's books. After all, they have already  accomplished so much: The books have been released from  captivity and are being handled by individuals who regard them  as the most sacred objects on earth. The road to further  advancement has been cleared.</p>

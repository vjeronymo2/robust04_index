			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Talk Radio aims for year-two profit Talk Radio UK, the highest bidder in the tenders for Britain's first national commercial radio licence, says it will break into profit in its second year on-air. The company bid Pounds 3.8m a year for its licence, more than Pounds 1m a year more than its nearest rival Newstalk UK, a consortium led by Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail. Talk Radio UK will be awarded its licence by June or July as long as the Radio Authority is convinced of its business plan. Mr Christopher Turner, a director of media investment fund Media Ventures, which has a 31 per cent stake in Talk Radio, denies allegations from rivals and some advertising specialists that Talk Radio's bid is too high for its format to sustain. If the Radio Authority were to judge that the bid was not viable, the licence would pass to Newstalk UK. Mr Turner said yesterday: 'This isn't a potty scheme. It's been thoroughly thought through.' The company is expected to spend Pounds 12m in its first year with a loss of Pounds 1m and then move into profit. Talk Radio is planning to have only 50 permanent staff with presenters, many of them journalists, on contracts.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / New head for Vestey subsidiary UNION International, the troubled arm of the Vestey Group, one of Britain's largest private companies, has appointed Mr Terry Robinson, a former executive director of Lonrho, the international trading group, as chief executive and a director. The appointment comes amid mounting speculation over the future of Union, which could face administration if it is unable to win the support of bankers for a rescheduling of its substantial borrowings. Union, which announced in October that it may breach its banking covenants, is in discussions with more than 70 international banks over the rescheduling of loans totalling about Pounds 350m. It recently appointed Schroders as financial adviser and the appointment of a chief executive from outside the group is part of its restructuring. Mr Tim Vestey, who has led the group through its recent rocky period, will remain a director of Union and general manager of Vestey Group. Mr Robinson, 47, recently resigned from Lonrho where he has been a group management accountant and since 1981, a director of the group. As one of Lonrho's most outspoken directors, he has often been mentioned as a possible candidate to succeed Mr Tiny Rowland, the group's 74-year-old chief executive. At Lonrho, he was instrumental in shaping the group's defence against Mr Alan Bond, the Australian entrepreneur who built up a hostile stake in the group nearly three years ago. Mr Robinson said his appointment at Union was 'very useful in establishing a positive relationship with the banks', and that the experience with developing countries which he gained at Lonrho would serve him well at Union. Union, which is involved in businesses ranging from meat wholesaling and retailing to property development, is burdened with unlet property developments that are likely to lead to a write-down of more than Pounds 60m. It has also been hit by recession in its main markets and hyper-inflation in Brazil where it has huge cattle interests. While there was 'every chance of moving out of any of the businesses', Mr Robinson said he believes the agro-industries would remain the rationale for Union. Observer, Page 18</p>

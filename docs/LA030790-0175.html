			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 FINGER LAKES TRAINERS INDICTED, SUSPENDED  </P> <P> The licenses of two Finger Lakes Race Track trainers have been suspended in the  wake of their indictments in federal court for allegedly conspiring to fix a  race at the track.  </P> <P> New York State Racing and Wagering Board officials said a hearing has been  scheduled on the suspension of Michael Ferraro's and Edward Babcock's licenses.  </P> <P> In the meantime, they "can't go to a race track in New York state," said board  secretary Thomas Davide.  </P> <P> Ferraro, Babcock and Ferraro's former wife, Patricia, pleaded innocent on  Tuesday in U.S. District Court to charges that they fixed the eighth race at  Finger Lakes on Sept. 26 to ensure that two horses finished out of the money.  An indictment released last week said Patricia Ferraro bet heavily on other  horses in the race.  </P></p>

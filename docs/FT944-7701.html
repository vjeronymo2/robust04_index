			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Italian sector tumbles on renewed political worries While activity in most European government bond markets was muted, Italian bonds and the lira tumbled sharply yesterday amid renewed political worries surrounding Mr Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister. Bonds fell by as much as a point on news that Mr Berlusconi had received formal notice that he is under investigation for allegedly paying bribes to Italian tax authorities in connection with his media empire, Fininvest. Although the corruption probe has been rumoured for months, its confirmation threw the market into disarray, raising fears that political upheaval would delay the passage of the 1995 budget. Parliament has to pass the package, which includes measures to cut some L48,000bn from next year's public sector deficit, before the end of the year. However, after dropping steeply on the initial news, prices soon stabilised as traders decided the news merely confirmed market worries. 'Considering the seriousness of the matter, the drop wasn't as bad as it could have been  -a lot was already discounted,' said a dealer. 'The key questions now are: will Berlusconi be forced to resign, and will it throw the budget process into disarray?' said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets. Although he thought the budget was likely to be passed by year-end, he said the market would remain nervous over prospects of political upheavals - possible coalition realignments or even new elections - in the new year. The December BTP future on Liffe fell as low as 99.75 but recovered slightly to end at 100.11, down 0.78 point on the day. The Italian 10-year yield spread over German bonds widened to 476 basis points, from 455 on Monday, and some traders said it could move towards 500 in coming days. German bunds ended a trendless day slightly higher, buoyed by short-covering in the futures markets and a firmer tone in the US Treasury market. Participants are awaiting the release of October M3 data, expected some time this week. The December bund future on Liffe ended at 90.41, up 0.33 point. UK gilts continued their pre-Budget slumber, tracking bunds slightly higher in the absence of domestic impulses. The Bank of England announced that a Pounds 200m tap issue of 7 per cent Treasury stock due 2001 had sold out, having been supplied at 92.02. The issue was part of a total Pounds 750m package of tap stocks of existing gilts set on Monday. US Treasury prices benefited from a weakening stock market as fears of future interest rate increases caused investors to favour putting assets in bonds. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/16 at 93 5/16 yielding 8.091 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 29/32 , yielding 7.284 per cent. Adding to the gain was relatively strong demand for five-year notes, which were auctioned early in the afternoon. In the early morning prices dipped slightly as traders sold bonds to make way for the new issue. Prevailing sentiment in the market has been pessimism and uncertainty since the Federal Reserve boosted its Federal funds target interest rate last week without closing the door on a further tightening in the near term. Although the Fed raised rates by a stronger-than-expected 75 basis points to 5 1/2 per cent, the move was insufficient to calm the market's fears of inflation. Almost immediately after the interest rate increase traders began expecting rates to go up again soon. Such interest rate instability causes investor unease and undermines bond prices. Even yesterday's boost in prices is not expected to last as most investment strategists are not advocating moving from stocks to bonds, but rather from stocks to cash. Also, the dollar declined from late Monday levels, which hurts the bond market by deterring foreign investors from buying US instruments such as bonds.</p>

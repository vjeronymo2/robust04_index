			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> MS DRUG'S VALUE QUESTIONED  </P> <P> A drug developed in Israel that showed promise in treating multiple sclerosis  does not appear effective against the most severe form of the disease,  researchers said last week.  </P> <P> The drug, called Copolymer I, may be of value for a less-devastating form of  the disease, the report said.  </P> <P> Aaron Miller, director of neurology at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn,  said a study using the drug on 106 patients with chronic, progressive multiple  sclerosis -- the worst form of the disease -- showed "no evidence that the drug  is an effective treatment" for such patients. His findings were presented at  the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology.  </P> <P> The drug has been used as a treatment for multiple sclerosis in Israel for  several years but has not been approved for general use in the United States.  </P></p>

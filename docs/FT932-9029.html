			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK music industry If there really is something wrong with the pricing structure of the UK CD market, then the national heritage committee did not find it. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission may hope to do a better job. They should also aim to devise a better solution than simply urging producers to cut their prices by Pounds 2. But the MMC's earlier investigation found no evidence of collusion or scale monopolies. Besides, it is hard to see what practical changes it could propose. Changes to the copyright law ending restrictions on parallel imports would risk conflict with EC regulations. There must be doubt over whether such a move would affect UK prices anyway - the evidence from other countries is inconclusive. Multinational music companies, such as Thorn EMI and PolyGram, will hardly be quaking in their boots. The UK market is lucrative but only accounts for 8 per cent of global music sales. The top three UK retailers, though, which control 53 per cent of the market and stand accused of not exerting their buying power to the listener's benefit, will be less sanguine. Whatever the MMC concludes, WH Smith, Woolworths and HMV face consumer pressure for lower prices. Retailers' margins seem set to suffer although higher volume sales and returning consumer confidence may soften the blow.</p>

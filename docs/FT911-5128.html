			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: European sales lift CPC 6% EUROPEAN sales and profit gains helped offset recessionary conditions in the US, and allowed CPC International, the food company which takes in Hellman's Mayonnaise and Ambrosia custard, to post a modest 6 per cent earnings advance in the first quarter. CPC reported earnings per share of Dollars 1.07 during the three months to end-March, up from Dollars 1.01 in the same period a year earlier. Worldwide sales rose by 12 per cent, from Dollars 1.35bn to Dollars 1.52bn, while after-tax profits clocked in at Dollars 83.4m, against Dollars 78.9m. CPC said it believed the worst of the North American recession was over, but conceded this had affected Best Foods, its US consumer foods business. Economic problems in Argentina and Brazil also hit operations in South America, and CPC expects these difficulties to persist into the second quarter. However, the European operations fared well - showing a 41 per cent sales advance and a 78 per cent improvement in operating income. The advances result partly from acquisitions - CPC bought the UK Ambrosia, Marmite and Bovril businesses last year, together with Mateus jams and jellies in Portugal, and Heidelberg salad dressings in Denmark  - but the company also stressed there had been good volume growth.</p>

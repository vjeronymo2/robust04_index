			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: More O'Ferrall 35% ahead at Pounds 2.8m More O'Ferrall, the UK's biggest poster advertising group, increased profits from its UK and Irish operations by 78 per cent, but interim profits were held back by the impact of the recession in Europe. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose 35 per cent to Pounds 2.81m (Pounds 2.08m), on an increase of only 7 per cent in group turnover to Pounds 33.8m (Pounds 31.6m). The UK division was the driving force. The Advertising Association forecasts a 7 per cent increase in the poster market this year, the highest since 1988, but More O'Ferrall lifted its UK and Irish revenues by 15 per cent, and profits rose to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 958,000). Mr Russel Gore-Andrews, chairman, said the group had succeeded in pushing through meaningful price increases for poster space. It also benefited from a programme of converting bus shelter sites to the higher value added Adshel Superlite format. The group is broadening its coverage of Ireland, having previously focused on Dublin. The Belgian market, its most profitable a year earlier, achieved flat revenues and a marginal increase in operating profit, in Belgian franc terms. Devaluation of the franc left its contribution virtually unchanged at Pounds 1.13m. France was worse affected, with operating profit well down at Pounds 256,000 (Pounds 603,000). Mr Gore-Andrews said cost-cuting measures had been put in place that would reduce overheads by Pounds 500,000 per annum, and this should benefit the performance in the second half of the year. Taiwan continued to perform strongly, with operating profit rising from Pounds 148,000 to Pounds 177,000, and More O'Ferrall is currently looking to expand further into South East Asia. Interest costs fell from Pounds 744,000 to Pounds 464,000, reflecting lower interest rates and debt reduction. However, capital investment is on the increase, with about Pounds 10m of expenditure expected this year. It spent Pounds 3.44m in the first half. The interim dividend is maintained at 3.2p, while earnings per share rose to 5.7p (4.4p).</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Arts: In search of the individual voice - Television Here we are at the start of television's autumn season when the clocks go back, the weather turns colder and the broadcasters bring out their choicest wares. The viewers are back from holiday, the evenings are too dark for gardening, and ratings consequently shoot up. That, anyway, is what we have always been told, and in the past there has been much truth in it. But for those of us returning to Britain at the start of the 1992 autumn season matters look rather different. Perhaps this year the broadcasters' sights have been moved. Maybe they are so preoccupied with the revolution in commercial broadcasting due to begin in January 1993 that they can scarcely bring themselves to concentrate on the here and now. There are, of course, new series but these days, with four terrestrial channels running day and night, there is nothing unusual about that. The most striking aspect of so many of the series that have started in the past few days is not that they seem so different or fresh, but that they seem so terribly familiar. Viewers who were relieved when the lacklustre Wogan show was finally removed from the early evening may be baffled and even appalled to find Terry Wogan's Friday Night now turning up at 10.25. Ah, but had we not noticed the dramatic differences? The only noticeable differences last Friday were that instead of sitting in armchairs and being sycophantically polite while hyping their latest disc or movie, the 'guests' sat at a table and Edwina Currie shouted at Max Clifford. We consequently learned nothing about Clifford (said to be responsible for such tabloid scoops as Mellor and the actress and 'Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster') but this incident will probably be seen by the producers as 'good television'. The most striking concentration of derivative material occurs on Saturday evening. The new autumn schedule includes Gladiators on ITV, a British copy of the series described here last autumn as 'a po-faced American version of It's A Knockout'. BBC2 offers The Brain Drain with a billing that declares 'Jimmy Mulville and a panel of comedians continue the eternal search for answers to questions such as 'Is there a god?' and 'Why am I here?'' They are there because the biggest comedy success of the last year or so has been Have I Got News For You, and everyone is now determinedly copying it, not least Hat Trick Productions, the independent company responsible for both these series. Most derivative of all is Dame Edna's Neighbourhood Watch on ITV. Barry Humphries' astounding dame presides over a 'game' in which a hapless woman has to watch a video of her own house being examined - bread kept under the sink, extensive scuff marks on the walls behind the bedposts, and so on - and listen to Edna's commentary: 'You adorable and slightly grubby woman, I mean that in a nurturing way . . .' There are reminders here of several other 'embarrassment' series including Beadle's About, Through The Keyhole and Surprise Surprise but, as with Edison's light bulb, though the idea may not be original this looks like the perfect development of the genre for those who like such stuff. As ever it would be unfair to imply that there has been nothing worth watching. Tony Parsons' polemic 'The Tattooed Jungle', directed against the pot-bellied Nike-shod lager louts of today's working classes, in Channel 4's Without Walls, was one of the most vivid and vitriolic expressions of personal opinion ever screened. It was all the more powerful for being directed, in Parsons' own impeccably working class accents, against one of the most untouchable of the medium's sacred cows. No doubt Parsons is wrong in believing that most British workers ever were the paragons of grace, decency and wit that his rose tinted spectacles suggest, and no doubt today there are numerous exceptions to the mindless yobs he deplores. But after all the years of fond idealisation of the working classes on television, especially in drama, this was a long overdue backlash. With all the cynicism about the American presidential election and the way in which the mass media supposedly cheapen the electoral process, it was also peculiarly heartening to watch, on BBC2 late on Sunday night, the first three-way debate between Bush, Clinton and Perot. Maybe it was not the most profound political discussion ever televised, but at least the American candidates, unlike their British counterparts, do face each other on television, do address the issues, do talk about broad political principles, and are held strictly to time limits. Nobody would pretend, however, that this was one of the big events of Britain's television week. What were they? If you judge by attention given in the other mass media they must have included the appearance of a Jesus Christ puppet on Spitting Image and the first showing of the new Madonna video, Erotica by Channel 4. Given that Spitting Image has regularly featured a puppet of God in the past it seems odd to get excited now about a puppet of his son, and anyway the sketch in question was anodyne when compared to - say - Salman Rushdie's material concerning equally sacred figures in The Satanic Verses. As for the Madonna video, first of all the woman deserves three cheers for the open enjoyment that she brings to matters sexual. The contrast between her relish and the obscurantism and hypocrisy which usually surround the subject on television, and elsewhere, is striking. Feminism clearly has its uses since no man would be allowed to perform material as explicit as this. That said, this video, like her previous one, would be more attractive if it were less brutal and more subtle. Moreover it is surely time to break away from the machine-gun editing which seems to have become mandatory in the video world; viewers will not fall asleep if a shot is held for more than two seconds. Most important of all, it seems clear that, however slick the marketing, Madonna's songs and videos are powerful expressions of her own individuality, an increasingly unusual phenomenon in the modern world of pop with its corporate packaging machinery. And not only in pop. It is the individual voice which seems so rare, whatever category of programmes you choose, in this autumn season. True, there are whole swathes of material - drama and documentary for example - not touched on in this column, and we shall be coming back to them. Yet here too there seems precious little so far of striking individual merit. The irony is that even as television becomes more and more formulaic so more and more attention is lavished upon it. The process by which the mass media feed upon themselves is a little like 'howl round', that awful technical phenomenon in which a microphone picks up some of its own amplified noise and feeds it back into the system to produce an intensifying screech which goes round and round and reaches a crescendo which is unbearable to the ears. With this now occurring so often the danger is that the only individual voices remaining audible will be those that are backed and amplified by Madonna-style promotion machines, a process which is itself nearly always destructive in the end. Will the quieter individual voice be noticeable at all in the television of the nineties? We shall see.</p>

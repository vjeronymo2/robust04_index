			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL DAVIS  </P> <P> So, Al Davis will talk about staying in L.A. if he gets $15 million (Metro,  April 7)? This is on top of the $10 million from Irwindale to talk about going  there!  </P> <P> When I was dating, my boyfriend used to give my little brother a quarter to "go  away and leave us alone."  </P> <P> If everyone who would like Al Davis to go to Oakland and leave Los Angeles  alone would send him a quarter, maybe he'd get the message in the only language  he seems to understand -- money.  </P> <P> KAY BURK  </P> <P> Duarte  </P></p>

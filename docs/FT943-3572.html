			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Singapore SE relaxes rules The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) plans to boost trading of foreign currency-denominated stocks by allowing overseas brokers to trade the shares directly, said finance minister Richard Hu, Reuter reports from Singapore. The exchange will also give priority to regional stockbrokers who want to take an equity interest in local firms, or who want to set up in Singapore as an international member of the exchange, Mr Hu said at the Asian Securities Analysts Council annual conference. Mr Hu told the conference the Singapore government wanted the SES to develop as a centre for regional securities trading, and these measures would increase liquidity as well as improve the exchange's competitiveness. 'The SES will allow foreign brokers, who are not members of the exchange, but which are licensed by the MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore), to become subscribers to the trading terminals provided by the SES to deal in stocks quoted in foreign currencies,' Mr Hu said. Foreign brokerages will no longer have to put such transactions through an SES member broker.</p>

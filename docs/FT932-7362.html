			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System The D-Mark came under pressure and, although still third from bottom in the system, is now only 1/3 percentage point above the French franc, the weakest ERM currency. Expectations of a further interest rate cut in the Netherlands were raised after the Dutch central bank allowed the spread between the guilder and the D-Mark to widen to 59 basis points at the end of last week. The bank has an informal commitment to keep its currency within  1/2 percentage point either side of the German currency. Currencies, Page 25</p>

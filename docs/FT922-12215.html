			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Rover chief warns of Japanese surge THE SURVIVAL of Rover Group and other UK-based carmakers will increasingly depend on exports as Japanese rivals increase their share of the UK market, Mr George Simpson, Rover's chairman, said at a briefing in London. Mr Simpson expects Japanese carmakers at least to double their present 11 per cent market share as they increase assembly in their UK factories. They might even take as much as 30 per cent, he said. He gave a warning that it was important for other European countries to accept the increase in Japanese market share and to grant free access to Japanese cars built in Britain. Even so, France and Italy in particular were likely to continue to resist any substantial increase in Japanese penetration of their car markets. 'If the UK's car production rises to 2m,' he said, 'then all the present producers could survive. As long as Rover continues making the same number of cars at similar margins, we will be okay.' If UK-assembled Japanese cars were given a fair chance to compete in the rest of Europe, Rover's output should settle at about 500,000 a year. Rover hoped to develop a distinctive image that would allow it to charge premium prices compared with competitors with much higher volumes. However, he warned that Rover's UK dealer network, which had fallen from 1,200 to 850 recently, would have to shrink further. Rover expects to lose some of its market share of 14.4 per cent last year to UK-produced Japanese cars this year, Mr Simpson said. He warned that output would fall this year because although Rover hoped to increase exports, that would not compensate for the UK losses and its determination to reduce stock levels. Mr Simpson said the UK industry was at a crossroads. 'It has a wonderful opportunity but faces horrible risks. There are 12m customers in Europe and there will still be 12m customers when the new (Japanese) factories set up.' New car assembly plants were also planned for eastern Europe, Mr Simpson said. He added: 'Being in the car business in the next 20 years will be a very tough proposition.'</p>

Yuriy Meshkov and his administration and the newly-elected  Supreme Council will not be able to work constructively at  maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula, says a  statement by the Ukrainian sociopolitical organizations of  Crimea and the Crimean Tatar National Rukh. This document is  devoted to the outcome of the elections of 27 March in Ukraine.    The organization of the Crimean Tatar National Rukh will  support the Ukrainian organizations in questions of maintenance  of territorial integrity and affirmation of Ukrainian power on  the territory of Crimea, the statement says. The authors of the  document cite cases of a crude breach of legislation on the  peninsula in the course of the election campaign and the  elections themselves, but the greatest breach noted in the  statement was the canvassing speech by the president on the eve  of the elections on local TV.</p>

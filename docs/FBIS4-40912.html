			<p>BFN     [Text] Kyrgyz Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov called on  Japanese businessmen to play a part in reforming his country's  economy. When he met with them in Bishkek Monday [20 June], he  called on Japanese businessmen to invest in the reconstruction  of defense, engineering and food processing industries.    Dzhumagulov believed that as little as 7 to 8 pct of the  country's rushing water is used to generate electricity and that  Japanese participation in construction of small, medium, and  large hydro power stations would be profitable to both countries.    He also invited them to invest in the construction of a  factory manufacturing semi-conductors in the south of Kyrgyzstan.    Dzhumagulov emphasized that he pinned great hopes on the  Kyrgyz-Japanese Economic Cooperation Commission, which he heads.  He will attend its session in Tokyo next November.    Dzhumagulov said that the government had set up a  reconstruction and development bank which reflects the Japanese  way of doing things. The bank will mobilize state resources to  finance and credit priority projects and support small and  medium business in priority fields.</p>

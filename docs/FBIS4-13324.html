			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Under the slogan of "With Bullets We Fight, With  Rocks We Resist, and With Gliders We Fly to Palestine" the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command  [PFLP-GC] held a speech rally at al-Yarmuk Camp at 1600 today,  15 April, on the occasion of the 29th anniversary of the front's  establishment.    The rally was attended by Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of  the PFLP-GC; Dr. 'Ala'-al-Din 'Abdin, secretary of the Damascus  Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party; Staff Brigadier  General Tariq al-Khadra', chief of staff of the Palestinian  Liberation Army [PLA]; leaders of the Palestinian Forces  Alliance; leaders and representatives of patriotic parties in  Lebanon; leaders and representatives of the National Progressive  Front in Syria; a number of ranking PLA officers;  representatives of Arab and friendly liberation movements;  members of the Arab and friendly diplomatic corps; relatives of  the martyrs and prisoners; and members of the PFLP-GC's  Political Bureau and Central Committee. [passage omitted]    PFLP-GC Secretary General Ahmad Jibril delivered the speech  of the Palestinian revolution and the PFLP-GC. He began his  speech by asking: How far have we reached and when will we get  there? He said: It is the right of our people and the martyrs  of our revolution and front to ask: How far have we come, and  what have we accomplished throughout this long militant march.    He added: From the very beginning, since 1959, we have laid  the first stones of the armed struggle. We have said the road  to the liberation of Palestine is difficult and long and the  battle against the Zionist enemy is an open one because we are  not just fighting a Zionist group, but are fighting colonialism  and its agents, represented by reactionary Arab regimes and the  renegades and deviants in the PLO leadership.    Jibril touched on the issue of independent Palestinian  decisionmaking and said: Those who have called for this want to  separate the national cause of the Palestinian people from the  pan-Arab cause in order to reach what they have now reached.  The deviations that have occurred, the last of which the Oslo  Accord, are the natural outcome of this idea, which is aimed at  isolating the Palestine question from pan-Arabism. He described  those who have called for independent Palestinian decisionmaking  as the owners of the separatist veto in the Palestinian  community. He said: The real Palestinian decisionmaking is the  decisionmaking of the Arab and Islamic nation and the Muslim  Arab people. [passage omitted]    Ahmad Jibril dealt with the current political situation and  strongly criticized the visit to Oman and Qatar by the Zionist  delegation led by Zionist Deputy Foreign Minister [Yosi] Beilin.  He said: The enemy's penetration into reactionary Arab regimes  is not new. This time, however, it not only aims to achieve  public and direct normalization but also to find new cards to  pressure the forces hostile to the settlement and to give the  Tunis leadership and 'Arafat a new dose of strength now that  they have become exposed and fragile before Arab and Palestinian  public opinion. He said: The Zionist political course at this  stage aims at dissolving the unified Arab position in order to  force Syria and Lebanon to accept what Clinton and the others  seek.    Ahmad Jibril says: Today, there is a current called peace  that has its own way to reach agreements -- in Oslo, Washington,  Muscat, and tomorrow Bahrain.    Jibril says: The 'Arafat-Rabin agreement has been concluded  in two files -- security and economy. He noted that the  security file calls for stopping and ending the intifadah  through 'Arafat's police now that the Zionists have failed in  confronting the intifadah. He said that 'Arafat's task is now  to go to Gaza and Jericho to foil and destroy the intifadah  instead of the Zionists. The Zionists aim at infiltrating the  Arab world through the economic file.    Jibril says: If the Zionists and 'Arafat succeed in stopping  the intifadah, it means opening the door wide open for  Jewish-Zionist immigration into Palestine, reinforcing Zionist  settlements in Palestine, and imposing a siege on the  Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.    Ahmad Jibril said that the heroic intifadah has aborted the  schemes of 'Arafat and Rabin and will continue to resist them.    In his speech Jibril praised the firm and solid stands of  Syria, Libya, and Iran.</p>

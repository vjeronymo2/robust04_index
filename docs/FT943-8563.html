			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Calor slips Calor, the bottled gas producer, was a poor performer among the energy stocks following a press report suggesting that Calor had been losing market share because of intense competition and price-cutting in the bottled gas market. The stock opened sharply lower at 275p, but then embarked on a sustained rally which left it a net 9 off at 281p. The story led to a big increase in turnover in Calor shares. Some 470,000 changed hands, compared with usual volume levels of well below 100,000 per day. The rally was helped by soothing comments from the company, which insisted that it had maintained market share at around 50 per cent but conceded that there had been pressure on profit margins. Calor shares have fallen steeply since the start of the year, from 361p in late January to a 1994 low point of 261p in June. Speculators were active in the drugs sector again, inspiring some chunky volumes and firm movement in selected shares. Wellcome was said to be attracting particular interest, speeding forward 13 to 692p on turnover of 2.4m. The sector has been buzzing since last month's Dollars 8.5bn bid from US drugs group American Home Products for American Cyanamid - the sector's first unsolicited takeover attempt since Roche launched an attack on Sterling six years ago. One leading US broker, Wertheim Schroder, recently put a 900p a share bid value on Wellcome, among a forecast of Dollars 40bn worth of merger and takeover activity over the next 18 months. Takeover chatter also swirled around Reckitt &amp; Colman, spurred on by weekend press speculation that the household goods group was indeed a frontrunner for the corresponding business owned by Eastman Kodak. Analysts believe the move would make good strategic sense, although fears of a rights issue to fund the mooted Dollars 1bn price tag saw the shares come off in early trading. However, they later rallied to close 4 up at 635p. Brewers were firm as the sector's recent strength was compounded by rumours that the government was at last listening to the industry's big bug-bear - the rate of excise duty. However, analysts were wholly sceptical that the government would consider a cut in duty, particularly given the political sensitivity of increasing VAT on fuel bills this autumn. This failed to dampen investor enthusiasm from some quarters, with Scottish &amp; Newcastle advancing 5 to 532p, Whitbread 8 1/2 to 560 1/2 p, Bass 6 to 574p and Greenalls 4 to 439p. Granada was the subject of a big bought deal, with SG Warburg said to have been the engineer. According to dealers, the broker took 5m shares on at 507p and was selling them on at 510p. Turnover by the close had reached 10m, suggesting that given the daily average trade in Granada is around the million mark, not all the shares had been sold. The price dropped 8 to 513p. Shares in the regional electricity companies (recs) ran into profit-taking and fell into retreat. Eastern was the exception, with talk in the market of another big buyer around. Last week, a US fund was thought to have been behind the purchase of a 2.9 per cent stake. The shares climbed 3 to 766p. Dealers pointed out that, given their sparkling run since the Offer document last week, the recs had lost some of their attraction for income funds and that some sideways trading was likely until some more corporate activity - such as share buy-backs, or takeovers - excited investor interest. Marginally firmer crude oil prices, coupled with evidence of keen buying from the US, helped the oil majors move ahead. Shell Transport, which disappointed the market last week in announcing results a little below expectations, advanced to 728p before easing back to close a net 4 up at 724p, while British Petroleum hardened 2 to 412p. Among publishing stocks, Telegraph shares were firm following publication on Friday after the market had closed of official figures showing that its UK newspaper's daily circulation was sharply ahead. The shares improved 5 to 350p. A sparkling debut from Pillar Property Investments, coming in the face of a weak property market, saw the shares go to a 7p premium to 157p by the close of trading. Turnover reached 8.6m. Catalogue retailer Argos receded 7 to 367p after unveiling mildly disappointing interim results. Profits came in line with forecasts, 16 per cent up at Pounds 15.3m. Analysts were pruning full-year expectations by around Pounds 2m to about Pounds 93m. National Westminster Bank moved forward 12 to 462p after analysts at Strauss Turnbull advised investors to switch into the stock and out of Barclays, which nevertheless gained 5 at 544p ex-dividend. Reports suggesting that August car sales would fall below expectations hurt dealer Cowie Group, the shares ending 8 lower at 252p. The building and construction sector eased slightly after a press report published yesterday suggested that the price of land for residential building in England rose 35.3 per cent in the year to June. Analysts feared that the rise would hit future profit margins in the sector as Taylor Woodrow and Beazer Homes both retreated 4 1/2 to 134p and 150p respectively. Other statistics, Page 31</p>

We welcome, Chigwedere said at the air terminal, someone who  represents a state that has shown its solidarity with Zimbabwe  since its struggle for independence and with which we share many  positions.    The high-ranking official spoke on behalf of Foreign  Minister  Nathan Shamuyarira, who will be abroad until tomorrow.    Robaina described as a privilege the visit of the delegation  he is heading, because it affords the opportunity of a direct  contact with something that is part of our African history and  traditions.    "We aspire to know each other better, to explain how my  people live and work, and to exchange mutually beneficial  experiences," he stated.    The Cuban minister will complete a three-day visit during  the  third leg of an area tour which started in Ghana and Angola and  will continue in Zambia and Namibia.    The welcoming ceremony was attended by Cuban Ambassador  Designate Pedro Nunez Mosquera and Charge d'affaires Marcos  Rodriguez Costa, among other officials.</p>

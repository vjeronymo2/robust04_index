			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Ericsson bounces back as first-half sales surge 35% ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, expects profits to at least double in 1993 following a dramatic recovery in first-half net income, to SKr1.28bn (Dollars 162m) from SKr59m. The result, which nearly equalled the SKr1.3bn profit for the whole of last year, was made on the back on strong increases in orders and sales. All business areas increased income, the company said. Orders for the period jumped 27 per cent to SKr34bn, while sales rose 35 per cent to SKr27.4bn. About half of the increase in both figures was due to the depreciation of the Swedish krona. The group now has an order backlog of SKr46bn, up 33 per cent from mid-year 1992, after increasing its order intake for the last seven consecutive quarters. The most spectacular growth came from the radio communications division, which includes mobile telephones. For the first time these have overtaken public telecommunications to become the group's biggest revenue earner. Sales rose 75 per cent, to SKr10.65bn, in the first half, while public communications sales increased 15 per cent to SKr10.04bn. The group's largest market is Italy, which accounted for 12 per cent of sales, followed by the US, Sweden, the UK and China. China is the group's fastest growing market, and deliveries of public telecommunications equipment there have doubled in a year. The group's gross margins improved in the second quarter, rising to 48 per cent from 47 per cent in the first quarter, and a further increase is expected in the second half as the company's income starts to benefit from the weaker krona. The group's income has so far only been marginally affected by the currency depreciation because of its hedging policy. Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive, said the company's extensive investments in new technology provided the basis for continuing growth.</p>

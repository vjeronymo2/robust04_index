			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed Ph.P: "Chinese Puzzle in the Walloon Party </F> of Labor: Belgium-China Association Funds Belgian Extreme Left"]    [Text] We knew that the Belgium-China Association (ABC)  (officially attached to promoting Belgian-Chinese relations) was  infiltrated by the Walloon Party of Labor (PTB). Its financial  practices were said to be curious, at the very least. Documents  that have come into our possession confirm both of these facts.  Tourism in China helps to finance the extreme left in our  country. A report by the ABC auditors, in defiance of the  majority of the board, thus condemned the 1992 use of the  Association's tourism license by the Anti-Imperialist League, an  outgrowth of the PTB devoted to the "liberation" of the Third  World! The auditors were amazed, moreover, to see "hundreds of  thousands of Belgian francs paid to airlines, without any  invoices...."    Just as confusing for the auditors was "the reason why,  without a valid accounting document, an ABC debt of over 1  million Belgian francs was written off overnight by Luxingshe,"  the official Chinese tourist body. Was this a hidden payment by  Beijing to its Belgian lackeys? Or was it fraud destined to  refloat a nonprofitmaking association which, while its tours  have generated "turnover of over 70 million Belgian francs," has  regularly run up debts to the point where it could no longer pay  its various rents? This paradox adds further fuel to the theory  that funds are being transferred to the PTB.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: Brilliant Byzantium - There is more to Byzantine art than icons and mosaics THE LOUVRE has done it again. A year after exhibiting the treasures from the abbey of Saint-Denis, Byzance is another show which anyone who cares for the middle ages simply must try to see. Lucky indeed will be those visitors who can pick up almost where they left off, immersed in contemplating artifacts which according to the taste of our medieval ancestors were the most precious human hands could make. Two things are going on in this exhibition. On the one hand, it is a chronological survey of a thousand years of Byzantine art, illustrating the high peaks of its achievement between the Later Roman Empire and the Fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453. And of course, it is absolutely right that the first object you encounter in this superbly lit, impeccably designed show, is a little agate cameo bust of Constantine. Here is a virtually mass-produced image of the youthful commander who was the first Christian Emperor and founder of the Eternal City on the shores of the Bosphorus. In style, this little treasure returns to the classical manner after the thick-set brutalism of third-century fashion which, from Gibbon to Berenson, gave such a bad name to Later Roman art. Constant turning back to classical inspiration is a dominant theme of the exhibition, as time and again Byzantine craftsmen provided courtly patrons with an art refreshed by copying and adapting pagan beauties. Carving hardstone, a skill which was apparently lost under the century of Iconoclasm, was revived under the reign of the great Macedonian emperors. The central rooms are filled with manuscripts, carved ivory caskets and plaques, jewellery and silks made from this great period of Byzantine art which stretched from the later 9th to the 12th centuries. Their exquisite craftsmanship and also the mixture of sacred and secular themes will surely for many visitors be a revelation - there is, after all, so much more to Byzantine art than mosaics and icons. However, there is something even more absorbing about this exhibition. As with the Saint-Denis show, the question that proposes itself over and over again is, by what means did each of these treasures find their way west? Each of the 400 exhibits has been borrowed from 'French public collections'  -the Louvre itself, of course, being the major source. But in the majority of cases, the museums are themselves heirs to the cathedrals and abbeys of the pre-Revolutionary era. Some exhibits, such as the extraordinary Holy Shrine from Sens, the miraculous 15th-century icon of Our Lady from Cambrai, and the silks used to wrap holy relics, still belong to churches. From Rheims cathedral comes something which, to my mind, is one of the most affecting survivals of the entire middle ages; a cushion of Byzantine silk embroidered, as the gold threads spell out, by Alpaidis, a 9th-century princess, to pillow the 'sweet and blessed head' of St Remi. The saint's winding-cloth, a length of wine-red samite the size of a sheet, still has the opulent shimmer of the silks which Byzantine court official wore. What more fitting to wrap the bones of the saint who baptised Clovis, the 'new Constantine' of barbarian Gaul? Look at the bust of Constantine again, and at once it is clear that a medieval goldsmith has been up to the usual game of bending and bodging prestigious remnants of Rome. In the late 14th century, with gold and enamels, the cameo was made into a staff for an ecclesiastical dignitary serving at the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. One outstretched hand holds a crudely twisted circle of metal, representing the Crown of Thorns. And where did that numinous object come from? From Constantinople, purchased at a crippling price by St Louis, king of France, who actually built the Sainte-Chapelle to provide the fit setting for his fabulous purchase. We meet the acquisitive St Louis later in the exhibition, as purchaser of a reliquary made of gold actually in Byzantium. In low relief the figures are shown of the angel appearing to the Holy Marys at the empty tomb. 'With what brilliance did the angel appear to the women]', proclaims the inscription. For centuries, the brilliance of Byzantine court art gave western kings and nobles a kind of indigestion, so desperately did they crave the luxury of those effeminate Greeks. In 1204, the Fourth Crusade turned aside and simply swallowed the object of desire. In this way, a large part of the history of the medieval west could be spelled out from the objects in this memorable show. Sadly, however, objects are labelled with such parsimony (a very French habit) that without the sumptuous and costly catalogue (FFfs 490), you may miss the historical reverberations. So breathe deeply, and buy - the stories it contains are incredibly evocative as the barbarian west bought, smuggled, begged, and ultimately pillaged Constantinople for its treasures. Daily (not Tuesdays) 10 -22.00; until February 1.</p>

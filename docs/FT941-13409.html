			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / World Trade News: China-Japan trade increases by 31% Trade between Japan and China rose by 31 per cent last year to Dollars 37.84bn making China Japan's second largest trading partner after the US for the first time, according to the Japan External Trade Organisation. The strong growth in trade between Japan and China shows a conspicuous increase in economic activity between the two countries at a time when Japan's overall trade with the rest of the world grew only 5 per cent, Jetro said. It highlights both the growth of the Chinese economy and the rising sophistication of manufactured goods from China, which were up strongly last year. Jetro said that exports from Japan to China, which jumped 45 per cent to a record Dollars 17.3bn, were supported by buoyant economic activity in China which increased demand for capital goods. The boom in construction activity, the rise in foreign investment in China and growth in consumption by companies and government organisations alike increased demand for machinery, equipment and cars. Imports from China, meanwhile, were up 21 per cent to a record Dollars 20.6bn. While imports of textiles surged 30 per cent, those of machinery, including audiovisual products such as video cassette recorders also rose a firm 61 per cent and imports of office equipment increased by 213 per cent. Jetro expects trade between the two countries to continue to increase this year on the strength of growing foreign investment in China. However, it warns that inflation, and concerns over a lack of foreign reserves could slow the pace of increase in Japanese exports to China. Meanwhile, imports from China are expected to continue growing on the strength of firm Japanese corporate investment in that country.</p>

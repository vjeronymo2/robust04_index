			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (2): 'Metal bashing' moves over - Investment IN 1963, the government of the day decided to try and bring about economic regeneration in the Telford area by creating a new town with a development corporation. The chosen solution was to create a new town based on Dawley, but in 1968 the designated area was expanded to take in the more buoyant nearby towns of Wellington and Oakengates and renamed Telford. The idea was that jobs and investment would be drawn off from the busy West Midlands. At the same time, the development corporation would use public money to provide the land needed for factories, homes, roads and shops, and would reclaim the violated landscape of slag heaps and played-out mines. The problem was Telford's dependence on traditional, so-called 'metal bashing' industries. When recession struck in the late 1970s, the local economy was hit hard. As one development corporation official puts it, 'when the national economy sneezed, Telford caught pneumonia'. Between 1968-78, Telford's population increased from 75,000 to 100,000. But growth in employment over the same period was more modest, from 36,000 to 45,000. Unemployment, which in 1968 had been 2.9 per cent, had risen to 7.9 per cent by 1978. In the following four years local engineering companies were devastated, losing one-third of their employees. Unemployment continued to rise, peaking at 22 per cent in 1984. Telford was almost back where it had started in 1963. Almost, but not entirely. By the early 1980s the development corporation had received permission to spread its net beyond the West Midlands. It started to pull in investors not only from south-east England, but also from overseas. Unusually for a town seeking new investment, Telford remains primarily a manufacturing centre. Although there has been some diversification into service industries, in 1990 manufacturing accounted for 44 per cent of total employment, against a national average of 24 per cent. The manufacturing base has been significantly diversified. Although engineering is still important, the town is also a supplier of auto components, office automation equipment and electrical goods. It is also becoming an important centre for plastics production. In the trying to attract new forms of investment, the development corporation was helped by a number of factors which gelled in the early 1980s. The M54 motorway was opened. The town was designated an assisted area, which meant that many forms of aid became available. Some 270 acres of Telford were set aside as an enterprise zone, which meant capital allowances and rates holidays. As the national economy recovered, the area's engineering background and high unemployment meant there was a pool of relatively cheap skilled labour. But these advantages should not detract from the real marketing coups which the development corporation has brought off. After years of trying, and through the good offices of a high-powered agent in Tokyo, Mrs Mie Teno, Telford managed to attract Hitachi Maxell to Telford. The company, which manufactures video and audio cassettes and floppy discs, now employs more than 500 people in the town. Other Japanese companies followed. There are now 20 such concerns in Telford, mostly manufacturing companies, employing 2,000 people. It is thought that this is the largest concentration of Japanese investment in the UK. Milton Keynes has more companies (34), but they do not employ so many people and are are not so concentrated in manufacturing as Telford-based companies. While Japanese concerns have tended to make the headlines, there has been considerable investment from other countries. A total of 115 foreign companies have invested in Telford, creating 9,210 jobs and occupying 411,930 sq m of floor space. Of these, 32 came from the US, 21 from Germany and eight from Sweden. Taken together with the hundreds of British companies which have invested or relocated to Telford since 1980, it means that around 30,000 jobs have been created. Total gross investment has run into hundreds of millions of pounds. Given what has happened in previous recessions, it is pertinent to ask whether there will be a divestment or a collapse in employment. After falling back to 5.5 per cent in 1990, unemployment is now back at 7.5 per cent. Mr Mike Morgan, the general manager of the development corporation, does not think so. 'There are less than a dozen companies which employ more than 500 people. It is very different to the old days. It is now a much more diversified economy. Moreover, most of the companies are on freehold premises. There is very little leasehold. There is a much greater commitment now. I do not think there is going to be any kind of exodus, although there will be lay-offs and hardship.'  --------------------------------------------------------------------- TELFORD IN FIGURES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- POPULATION:  1968      74,750  1989     117,300  1995**   128,000  --------------------------------------------------------------------- EMPLOYMENT:  1968      35,670  1989      58,180  1995**    70,000  --------------------------------------------------------------------- DEVELOPMENT:  Factory floorspace (sq m):  1968       478,000  1990     1,421,317  1995**   1,744,180 Corporation owned:   27% Privately owned:     73%*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Office space (sq m):  1968           (-)  1990       142,182  1995**     351,256  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Retail floorspace (sq m):  1968        53,600  1990       187,924  1995**     219,954*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- HOUSING:  1968:  Public      10,707  Private     12,416  Total       23,123  1990:  Public      14,668  Private     30,385  Total       45,053  19951:  Public      11,914  Private     39,124  Total       51,038 Corporation houses sold to occupiers: 6,338 (55%)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPANIES*:  In TDC-built factories   453  In private factories     371  Total (1990)             824  --------------------------------------------------------------------- **Forecast. *These statistics relate to developments on land provided by Telford Development Corporation.

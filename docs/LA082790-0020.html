			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> NOTES PROVE HARD TO CARRY IN 'MOTOWN REVUE'  </P> <P> In the early '60s, Motown Records helped launch the careers of newcomers like  Stevie Wonder, the Supremes, the Miracles and Marvin Gaye by giving them  exposure and performing experience in traveling revues. The '90s version of  that concept, "The Motortown Revue," rolled into the Hollywood Palladium on  Friday.  </P> <P> Anyone who saw those early Motown revues can see that this one, featuring  Motown's crop of new artists, is comparatively minor-league. Though the show's  major acts -- the Boys, Today, the Good Girls -- have had hit records, none  seem unusually talented. Singers like Gaye and the Supremes were impressive and  loaded with star quality even as rookies.  </P> <P> The new revue included six acts performing sets lasting between 15 minutes and  a half-hour. All were backed by musicians except the rappers who, of course,  were accompanied by taped tracks.  </P> <P> By far the most talented artist was Milira, a 19-year-old gospel/R&amp;B  singer. But her style could use some toning down and fine tuning, and she was  hampered by lame material.  </P> <P> Rapper Rich Nice was backed by some potent music tracks but his delivery was  woefully weak. The trouble with female rapper M.C. Trouble was that her  mile-a-minute delivery made her lyrics unintelligible.  </P> <P> Today, a male vocal quartet, spent too much time trying to be cool and sexy --  playing the teasing playboys. If they want to live up to their billing as the  next Temptations they'd better learn to sing on key consistently. The Good  Girls, touted as the new Supremes, are known for their remake of their  forerunners' "Love Is Like an Itching in My Heart." They performed  energetically but sang erratically.  </P> <P> Much of the crowd at the Palladium, which slowly filled up during the nearly  three-hour show, was pre-teen, and clearly was there to see the Boys, whose  half-hour set closed the show. Though cute and poised, the four young Compton  brothers now based in Northridge are not the reincarnation of the Jackson 5.  These youngsters can barely carry a tune. They weren't impressive, except to  the young females who regarded them as swoon-bait.DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

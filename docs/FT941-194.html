			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / 'Bribes' strike shuts PNG mine Production halted yesterday at the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea, controlled by Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary, after about 1,000 workers went on strike, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The strikers were protesting at alleged bribing of officials to obtain visas for expatriates. But in Port Moresby, BHP said it had already conducted an internal investigation into these accusations, and found no wrongdoing. It expressed surprise they had been cited as grounds for industrial action. BHP said it viewed the strike as illegal under PNG's industrial relations laws, and had called on the labour department for assistance. Ok Tedi has a relatively stable industrial relations record, but suffered three industrial disputes last year, which shut the mine for several days.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENTERTAINERS SWEETEN WALK IN GARDENS;  </P> <P> MUSIC: ABOUT 15 GROUPS REPRESENTING DIFFERENT CULTURES WILL PERFORM IN DESCANSO  GARDEN NOOKS FOR VISITORS WHO STROLL PAST TODAY AND SUNDAY.  </P> <P> Strolling entertainers are nothing new, but it is the audience that will do the  strolling at Descanso Gardens during the Los Angeles Festival's closing weekend  today and Sunday.  </P> <P> Performers will set up in nooks and crannies throughout the lush Los Angeles  County park in La Canada Flintridge while the public circulates like diners  sampling food from an exotic smorgasbord.  </P> <P> "The sound will lead you through the gardens," said Patty Mannatt, special  events coordinator for the county Department of Arboreta and Botanic Gardens.  "Descanso Gardens has a lot of camellia trees that have grown into a camellia  forest, and there are lots of little pockets that will hold 25 or 50 people who  can stop and listen to a performer."  </P> <P> Organizers opted for the unusual setup in part to give people a chance to see  performers who have appeared at locations throughout the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Among the groups scheduled: the Chinese Classical Music Ensemble; Garba-Ras,  Indian folk dancers who invite audience participation; the Nigerian Talking  Drum Ensemble; the World Kulintang Institute, performers of gong music of the  Muslim Philippines; Bibak, 130 performers from the Philippines; Los Pregoneros  del Puerto featuring harp virtuoso Jose Pepe Gutierrez and Hawaiian dancer  Randy Chang.  </P> <P> In all, about 15 groups are scheduled, including last minute additions like the  traditional Bolivian music group, Miriam Mita and Ayllu Sankayo.  </P> <P> Schedules of final times and locations of performances will be handed out at  the park entrance.  </P> <P> "There will always be something going on," said Peggy Riley, producer of the  Descanso Gardens weekend. "It's very free-form. People can sit and listen, then  move to a new place and hear something new."  </P> <P> The park will open at 9 a.m.; entertainment begins at noon each day and ends at  6 p.m., although Sunday's program is expected to run until dusk to mark the  festival's closing. There are some benches, but most seating will be on the  ground.  </P> <P> Music is presented every Sunday during the summer on the main lawn, but this is  the first time that artists will play at various spots. Simultaneous  performances raise the prospect of cacophony, but organizers said they expect  no problem. The park, a popular wedding site with a waterfall, is large enough  and the vegetation thick enough to keep the music from clashing, they said.  </P> <P> Traffic and parking are not expected to present problems, either. Mannatt said  that an annual garden festival attracts about as many people as are expected  this weekend and that "people get in and out just fine."  </P> <P> Festival organizers hope to draw 4,000 people each day. Descanso Gardens holds  2,000.  </P> <P> "If everyone came at the same time, we'd be in trouble," said Mannatt, "but  that's not going to happen. People will be coming and going all day."  </P> <P> Both Mannatt and Gail Boatwright, head of the Descanso Gardens Guild, a  nonprofit support group, said no community opposition has surfaced to the Los  Angeles Festival weekend. The guild sponsors all public events at the gardens.  </P> <P> "We approve of what they're doing and we're cooperating," Boatwright said,  adding that she does not fear damage by crowds to the garden's plants and  lawns.  </P> <P> "That's quite a lot of people for the area, but we're hoping they'll be spread  out throughout the day," she said. "There will be monitors to make sure that  groups of people don't get too big."  </P> <P> Ethnic food will be sold near the parking area and there are picnic tables  nearby. Eating is permitted on the main lawn area but not in the rest of the  park because it is a garden. Alcoholic beverages are prohibited.  </P> <P> Admission is $3 admission for adults, $1.50 for senior citizens and students,  and 75 cents for children 5 to 12. Children under 5 are free.  </P></p>

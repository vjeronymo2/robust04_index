			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE VEGETARIAN: CLAFOUTI MAKES WISE USE OF CHERRIES  </P> <P> Spring rains that helped revive many other Southland crops washed out most of  the cherries, just a week or so shy of harvest time. Consequently, a fruit that  is always too short in season will be notably scarce, and we'll have to make  judicious use of what we can get.  </P> <P> Clafouti is a wise investment -- a spongy cross between a pudding and a cake,  infused with vanilla and rich ripe cherries.  </P> <P> FRESH CHERRY CLAFOUTI  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups milk  </P> <P> 1/3 cup turbinado sugar  </P> <P> 3 eggs, lightly beaten  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1/3 cup unbleached flour  </P> <P> 1/3 cup whole-wheat pastry flour  </P> <P> 3 cups deep-red bing cherries, pitted  </P> <P> Powdered sugar  </P> <P> Combine milk, sugar, eggs, vanilla, unbleached flour and whole-wheat pastry  flour in blender or food processor. Process until smooth.  </P> <P> Lightly butter 9-inch pie plate. Spread cherries evenly over bottom of plate.  Pour batter on top, smoothing to cover fruit.  </P> <P> Bake at 350 degrees about 1 hour or until puffed and lightly browned and knife  inserted in center comes out clean. Serve warm, sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P> Note: Nonfat or low-fat milk may be used if desired. For individual servings,  lightly butter 6 custard cups or ramekins. Distribute cherries and batter  evenly among dishes and bake as above.  </P></p>

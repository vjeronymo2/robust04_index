			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Letter: Markets and community Sir, Mr Bryn Jones (Letters, April 15) states that, 'market and community activities are inherently contradictory', and seems to imply that they are somehow divorced from each other in their respective raisons d'etre, that they exist in spite of rather than because of each other. If, as he suggests, people in a community act on the basis of moral values, then crime presumably would cease to exist. Markets represent an activity of people in a community and exist to serve the community - if they did not, they would have ceased to exist long ago. Moreover, they reflect the moral values of the community. Laws prohibit monopolies and cartels, for example, in order to protect the community against unjust exploitation by a few. On the other hand, wealth generated by market processes is taxed and deployed by the government for the benefit of the community, as in its support of the National Health Service. But, just as the individual in John Major's vision should be free to aspire to the highest possible degree of personal fulfilment, so markets should be permitted to be sufficiently free to evolve and adapt to changing circumstances without undue government interference, otherwise they will cease to serve the community efficiently. There is no contradiction in Majorite Conservatism resting 'on a combination of markets and community'. The Labour party seems unable to grasp this reality and has paid the price in successive elections. Jeremy Willings, Woomer Croft, Griggs Green, Liphook, Hampshire GU30 7PB</p>

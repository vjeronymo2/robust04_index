			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Letter: Priority in former Yugoslavia is to impose sanctions on Croatia Sir, Much commentary on Bosnia-Hercegovina and the former Yugoslavia focuses on mistakes that may have been made in the past. There is little point in this. However, there is a lot of point in trying to avoid mistakes in the future. At present there are two priorities. The most immediate one should be the imposition of sanctions on Croatia. The behaviour of the single party Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) regime towards Bosnia-Hercegovina is, at the present juncture, notably worse than that of the Socialist Party Serbian regime, in that: (a) the aggression of the Herceg-Bosnian authorities towards the Moslems is directed by the local branch of the HDZ, which is organically linked to Zagreb; Mr Karadzic's Serbian Democratic Party is not so linked to the Serbian Socialist Party; (b) the Serbian regime is at least apparently making an effort to impose sanctions on the Bosnian Serbs. This is not to suggest that there is any room to let up on sanctions on Belgrade before it has genuinely isolated the Bosnian Serbs, but international policy must be consistent and even-handed if it is to earn respect. Moreover, most Moslems have already been ethnically cleansed from Serb occupied areas, while on the contrary the Croat controlled areas, and Croatia itself, include hundreds of thousands of Moslem refugees. Croatia's collusion in the aggression and the cynical misinterpretation of the Vance-Owen plan by the Croat Hercegovinans thus puts hundreds of thousands of lives at risk. The West may feel that it has to work with Croatia to help it cope with its refugees, but if they are not safe in Croatia, they will inevitably escape in ever larger numbers, however unwelcome they are made to feel. Even the most narrow and mean-minded western self interest would thus justify a tougher stance towards Croatia. Croatia is more susceptible than Serbia to being made an international pariah, because its catholicism makes it feel that it should be a part of western Europe. However, it is all too clear that the Croatian regime does not react to diplomatic pressure on its own, if not backed up by the kind of sanctions which would make it clear that Croat behaviour is unacceptable. If sanctions are not imposed now, Croatia may allow itself to be dragged too far into a deal to carve up Bosnia-Hercegovina with the Bosnian Serbs, ever to be able to extricate itself. The second priority is to reinforce existing UN forces in protecting safe havens, to extend them to Moslem populations in Herceg-Bosnia, and to make it clear that air attacks will be launched on any artillery endangering the civilians and UN troops in the safe havens.

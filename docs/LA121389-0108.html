			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEAR STEARNS SAYS IT PLANS TO RESUME PROGRAM TRADING  </P> <P> In a move that some industry executives called "shocking," Bear, Stearns &amp;  Co. said it will resume computer-driven program trading for its own account,  regardless of public and industry outcry denouncing the practice.  </P> <P> The New York-based investment firm was the first major Wall Street house to  return to the controversial trading strategy, which has been blamed as one  cause of dramatic swings in stock prices. Bear Stearns never stopped program  trading for its clients' accounts but briefly banned the trading for its own  behalf.  </P> <P> Program trading, the most common form of which is called index arbitrage,  generally is used to exploit minute price differences between stock index  futures and the underlying stocks. It is typically used by large institutions  that trade in volume. It has been a concern because it can cause huge blocks of  stock to be bought or sold at once, which, in turn, can cause wide swings in  stock prices.  </P> <P> Those wide swings -- graphically illustrated during the October, 1987, crash  and last October's 190-point downturn -- are widely blamed for scaring small  investors away from Wall Street.  </P> <P> After the 1987 market crash, several big brokerage houses -- including  Prudential-Bache, Paine Webber, Morgan Stanley and Shearson Lehman Hutton --  stopped program trading for their own accounts. And after last October's  downturn, several of these firms stopped program trading even on behalf of  their clients.  </P> <P> Bear Stearns Chief Executive Alan C. Greenberg said his company had returned to  the practice because "it is a necessary thing to do." Index arbitrage is not  likely to be banned, he noted, and it can be highly profitable.  </P> <P> Responding to the controversy surrounding program trading, Greenberg said: "I  have had 50 calls today, and all of them have been congratulatory. Institutions  think this is a fabulous thing to do."  </P> <P> However, several industry executives said they were horrified by Bear Stearns'  move.  </P> <P> "I find it appalling in light of the criticism that has been levied on the  practice, not only by investors and clients but also by the industry itself,  that Bear Stearns would do this," said Donald Crowell, managing partner of  Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co., a regional stock brokerage headquartered in Los  Angeles. "Program trading serves absolutely no purpose except to create profits  for a few large investors at the expense of individual investors. It should be  abolished."  </P> <P> But Bear Stearns said it will "self-impose" several standards aimed at reducing  volatility, including banning such trades if the Dow Jones industrial average  is down more than 50 points and strictly observing "circuit breakers," a  practice that halts trading once stock prices have dropped below a set level.  </P> <P> It said it will also use program trading to sell stocks only on price "upticks"  -- that is, when a stock trades at a higher price than the previous  transaction. A so-called uptick rule requiring program trades to be executed  only after an uptick has been proposed as a way to avoid market free falls.  </P> <P> Still, some don't believe these safeguards are enough.  </P> <P> "I am glad they did it this way rather than with no restraints at all, but I  don't want to rely on volunteerism to regulate the market," said Lawrence  Zicklin, managing partner with Neuberger &amp; Berman in New York.  </P> <P> And others said they were so vehemently opposed to program trading that they  would stop doing business with Bear Stearns, regardless of the restraints.  </P> <P> "I won't do any business with any money manager or any corporation that has  anything to do with program trading," said Charles Wohlstetter, chairman of  Atlanta-based Contel Corp. "I was always taught that the idea was not to take  the last nickel you can. It was take a little and leave a little. Play fair. I  am buried in letters from people who castigate this practice."  </P></p>

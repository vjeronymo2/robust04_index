			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Many mid-level government  officials questioned believe it is time politicians exert  stronger leadership to rein in Japan's central bureaucracy, but  fewer believe there will be major change over the next 10 years,  the National Personnel Authority said in a report released  Wednesday [22 June].    The Authority asked 102 division deputy director-class  officials at ministries and agencies to judge the relationship  between politicians and the administration. These young and  prospective officials have received the Authority's  administrative training from January to April.    Seventy-seven percent said "There are problems under the  present conditions" and urged a change in the relationship, 50  percent cited "weak political leadership over the  administration" as a problem, and 49 percent supported the  statement that "The administration interferes with matters which  should be handled by politicians." Eighteen percent said that  political pressure is "too high."    Multiple answers were allowed, so responses add up to more  than 100 percent.    But only 17 percent voiced optimism that the political world  will actually undergo major change during the next 10 years,  while just 6 percent said so for the administration.    "Certain changes" in politics are anticipated by 54 percent,  and in the administrative sphere by 45 percent. Almost a third  believe that nothing will change in politics, while 49 percent  fear that the administrative system will remain the same.    "The answers show that there is hope for a change of the  current conditions as well as the awareness that such change  will be difficult to realize," an authority official said in  analyzing the survey results.</p>

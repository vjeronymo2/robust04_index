			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Hasan Cemal: "As the Hizballah in Iraq Appears </F> on the Scene"]    [Excerpt] An Islamic organization has surfaced in northern  Iraq to carry out armed activities in that part of the country.  It has identified itself as the Islamic Movement in Kurdistan  [Kurdistan Islamci Hareketi, IMK]...    The IMK militants attacked the supporters of the Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan, which is headed by Jalal Talabani. The  attacks took place last Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday. The  militants also clashed with the supporters of Mas'ud Barzani,  leader of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan. The incidents were  in Raniyah, Kifri, and Kujah...    The Hizballah in Iraq has established itself in Kuldazah and  Raniyah, which are close to Iran's border. That organization is  not represented in the Federal Assembly of Kurdistan, which is  based in Irbil, because it only secured 5.1 percent of the votes  in the elections in 1992. Seven percent of the vote was needed  for representation.  <H5>  Iran's Support </H5>   The Hizballah organization in Iraq is mainly supported by  Tehran... It has received aid from Iran in the form of cash,  arms, and provisions, particularly since 1991. That is common  knowledge. According to Ahmad Bamarni, who is a close associate  of Jalal Talabani, the Hizballah organization is also supported  by Saudi Arabia and even by Afghanistan. That organization's  ideology is based on Imam Khomeyni's teachings. Naturally, that  provides for Tehran's support. Nevertheless, the Hizballah  members have not renounced their religious sect. They are the  followers of the Sunni sect. Of course, that accounts for Saudi  Arabia's support.    The recent weakening of the economy in northern Iraq has had  a significant bearing on the strengthening of the Hizballah  organization. The gradual worsening of poverty has disappointed  the people in the region. Consequently, that state of affairs  has nourished Islamic radicalism, as has been the case among the  Palestinian people and in Algeria. Obviously, Islamic  radicalism has strengthened as a result of poverty and the  central administration's failures.  <H5>  Beards and Islamic Dress </H5>   We met Ahmad Bamarni a few days ago. Referring to the  Hizballah organization, he said: "We have a university in  Irbil. It provides education for 5,000 students. We have  colleges for agricultural and medical studies in Dahuk. We also  have an institute for veterinary studies and a medical college  in al-Sulaymaniyah. Students from many families do not attend  them because they are poor. However, the IMK gives them an  opportunity to study, provided that the male students wear a  beard and female students wear Islamic dress. In fact, the  number of young people who join this organization is gradually  increasing."    Yes, the Hizballah organization employs several tactics to  strengthen itself. Meanwhile, it also helps many people to have  their own shops or establish their own businesses. I have  observed the poverty in northern Iraq. In view of that, I am  aware of what can be achieved even through small amounts of  material aid.  <H5>  What Does Tehran Fear? </H5>   What does Tehran, which supports the Hizballah organization,  wish to achieve in northern Iraq? Bamerni replied as follows:    The Hizballah organization is playing Iran's game. Tehran  wishes to create instability in northern Iraq. Iran's military  aircraft repeatedly bombed the northern Iraq border area some  time ago. That country closed its border about three weeks ago.  It closed down the border gates that give access to  al-Sulaymaniyah, Hajj 'Umran, and Irbil. What worries Tehran is  this: A democratic, pluralistic, and secular system is being  established in northern Iraq for the first time. Political  parties exist in Irbil and other large cities. There are  newspapers, magazines, and radio networks. The people are  expressing their opinion. The people also appear on television.  The modernization process has made Tehran feel very uneasy.  Iran's officials fear that the Kurds in Iran and the rest of  Iraq may decide to adopt a similar model. They believe that  that would be an unfavorable example for their country.

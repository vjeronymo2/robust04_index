			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Exposure to Latin America comes full circle: US bankers licked their wounds and looked south A decade after they began a retreat from the region, the New York banks are again marching into Latin America. This time, they insist, things will be different. The banks say they are out of the business of making medium-term dollar loans to Latin governments. If Latin America's economic renaissance goes wrong again, the New York banks will face disappointment but not disaster. A region-wide shift in economic policy has brought the banks back. Governments have opened economies to outside competition, brought budget deficits more in check and placed more reliance on the market. Lower inflation and a resumption of economic growth have followed in most countries. Debt burdens have eased following sharp falls in US interest rates and the Brady initiative launched by the US government in March 1989. The Brady debt reduction plan marked the psychological turning point for banks in Latin America. Until this point, says Mr David Berry, director of research at bank analysts Keefe Bruyette and Woods in New York, 'the correct approach was to continue to reduce exposure to Latin America'. After five years of almost unremitting decline, the secondary market price of the old debt began to rise. In the end, says Mr Berry, the banks probably took excessive write-downs on their old debt. Citicorp, the bank with biggest exposure, has moved Dollars 400m (Pounds 280m) out of its third world debt reserve into its commercial reserves in the last five quarters. For Citicorp, 'Latin America is the largest single contributor as a region to this bank's earnings', says vice-chairman Mr William Rhodes. Last year, pre-tax profits from Latin America reached Dollars 1.35bn, compared with Dollars 475m from Europe, Middle East and Africa, Dollars 605m from Asia-Pacific and a loss of Dollars 1.01bn for North America. This has vindicated, he says, the decision not to sell its Latin American loans into the secondary market. Instead, the bank sought to 'work out' the loans, for example, convert them into equity. Citicorp is unusual in having a large retail banking and local currency lending business in the region. In some countries, it is the only foreign bank with such a franchise. Only one other east coast bank - Bank of Boston  -has a traditional local currency business in the region, and that is much smaller. According to Citibank officials, its proximity to potential clients in the region gives the bank a competitive edge in other areas: corporate finance, capital market activities and project finance. The bank has, for example, a mandate to raise Dollars 1.8bn in project finance for British Petroleum's Cusiana development in Colombia. In delivering these services, the bank is hampered by a low debt rating: its A-minus senior debt rating from Standard &amp; Poor's compares with JP Morgan's AAA and Bankers Trust's AA. The ambitions of these two banks lie explicitly with 'investment banking', which means they have no interest in lending money from their own balance sheets. Morgan has about 100 professionals involved in corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions in Latin America, not including those working in trading and sales. Another 20 work on research. In the 1980s, 'we decided that the new business would not be to loan money but to help our government and private sector clients in other ways,' says one Morgan official. The strategy lays emphasis on industry specialisation of its bankers. Observers reckon it has been successful in cultivating contacts among investment institutions, which commercial banks traditionally lack. At Bankers Trust, Mr Neil Allen, managing director in charge of global emerging markets, outlines some similar objectives. 'Our focus is on capital markets, mergers and acquisitions, local trading, special situations and we'll also look at equity investment for our own account.' The bank is positioning itself for growth in domestic capital markets. It owns a brokerage house in Argentina and has plans to own one in Chile; it has already underwritten domestic equity issues. It is willing to make equity investments itself, in publicly-traded or private companies and it is offering risk management advisory services and mergers and acquisitions advice. However, bankers admit that offering advice is often labour-intensive and expensive; the real advantage it gives is often a privileged position in the underwriting of securities. The banks have moved into the underwriting business as a natural extension of the secondary-market trading activity in old bank loans. Chase Manhattan's renewed interest in Latin America has been based on a strong debt trading operation; Chemical, having taken over Manufacturers Hanover, is also a strong trading house. There have been questions over the longer-term sustainability of an approach that relies on trading and underwriting Latin bonds. Mr Stephen Dizard, managing director at Salomon Brothers, calculates that total underwriting fees on Dollars 20bn of new Latin bond issues a year amounts to Dollars 200m-Dollars 300m. With no house having more than a 10 per cent market share, this suggests gross underwriting revenues for the market leader of Dollars 25m. As a series of poorly-received Latin bond issues last year showed, underwriters can lose money as well as gain. Some believe the market is in transformation. Mr Larry Brainard, an economist at Goldman Sachs, says: 'The business is changing in a fairly fundamental way and it's moving away from trading and commercial bank structured finance deals and more to a market oriented towards institutional investors.' This would give Wall Street firms an advantage over the banks, most of which lack strong links with investment institutions. Others disagree. Ms Kathy Galbraith, a senior vice-president at Chase, believes debt trading will continue as an important source of income for banks: 'I don't see it as a market beginning to decline. Volume will continue to increase.' Ms Galbraith admits though that Chase, a prominent underwriter of Latin bonds, and others with no broad equity business face an uphill fight in underwriting share issues. Ms Diane Glossman, a bank analyst at Salomon Brothers, believes the balance of power lies for now with the commercial banks. 'Commercial banks have the relationships with issuers and relationships matters a lot, more perhaps than price. When issuers get more confident, companies can afford to be much pickier about price and then that picture could change.'</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Colony perceives increased offer as an astute move - The Battle for Midland HONGKONG AND Shanghai Bank's increased offer for Midland Bank was last night seen in Hong Kong as an astute move which will cost the suitor little and probably assure it possession of the UK clearer. Analysts believe that the injection of 65p cash a share will be enough to overcome UK investors' reservations about accepting Hongkong Bank debt - a key feature of its original offer. Mr John Grey, the bank's deputy chairman, acknowledged the importance of this yesterday when he admitted to UK investors dissatisfaction with the absence of cash in the initial bid. The higher offer, valuing Midland at 476p a share on Hongkong Bank's closing price of HKDollars 48.5 in the colony yesterday, together with the regulatory hurdles which Lloyds still has to jump, makes it difficult for UK investors to turn it down, analysts said. 'It is the sort of offer which means Midland shareholders are not giving it away,' said Mr Archie Hart, research director at Crosby Securi-ties. Hong Kong investors have not been thrilled by the prospect of the colony's biggest bank buying into Europe. Many have already defected, preferring to put their money into a 'pure' Hong Kong bank, such as Hang Seng Bank. Hongkong Bank's share price has underperformed its domestic market, while the latter has risen 20 per cent since mid-March, when Hongkong was in discussions with Midland. Hongkong Bank's share price has increased by about 8 per cent in the period, and most of that was in the past couple of weeks. 'This market has tended to prefer news that this bid would not happen,' said Mr John Mulcahy, research director of Peregrine Brokerage. 'But that has also been a short-term reaction; with the removal of uncertainty I expect the bank's share price to improve.' Hong Kong analysts are, however, warming to the bid. They see the rationale for the bank - an essentially British institution - moving back to the UK ahead of the 1997 transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China. Hongkong Bank is also buying a UK clearer, which it knows well is at the bottom of its earnings cycle. Although the higher offer gives Midland a 25 per cent higher value than Hongkong Bank's original bid, the 23.5 per cent rise in the bank's share price since it announced the terms of its first offer for Midland on April 14 is responsible for most of the uplift in the value of the bid. In reality, Hongkong Bank's bid is only 5 per cent better than its old offer, if investors had taken equity rather than debt. That offer yesterday would have valued each Midland share at 448p, while the new offer values the UK clearer at 476p a share. Few in Hong Kong expect the mainland Chinese press to endorse the higher offer, but they do not see the Chinese government attempting to frustrate it either. The bank has kept the Chinese authorities informed of its plans and while they may not like all aspects of the Midland deal the Chinese are, above all else, pragmatic people.</p>

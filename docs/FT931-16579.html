			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Prescott call adds to pressure on Smith PRESSURE on Mr John Smith to put a firm stamp on the Labour leadership mounted further yesterday as Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, called for the party to make a decisive shift back to conviction politics. The implicit criticism of Mr Smith's six-month tenure as opposition leader came in a recorded BBC television programme - due to be broadcast today - echoing widespread media criticism of Labour's post-election performance. Mr Prescott said the British people responded positively to 'politicians with convictions' who were committed to ideas. 'That is why Thatcher was quite popular with a lot of people,' he said. 'They knew where they stood with her. They don't know where they stand with Labour on some essential questions - you have to spell it out.' Mr Prescott's comments will anger many senior Labour figures who argue that, with an election probably some four years away, Mr Smith is right to take his time reforming the party and its policies. Even so, the comments reflect the anxiety of Labour supporters on all sides of the party, many of whom are demanding a swifter response to last April's fourth successive election defeat. Mr Prescott is viewed widely as a representative of traditional Labour supporters who oppose efforts by so-called modernisers to revamp the party's image. Some modernisers will nevertheless tacitly endorse his call for a more rigorous style of leadership. The revelation this week of further details of a confidential Labour opinion poll under-lining the extent of public disenchantment with the party has served only to emphasise the distance Labour must travel to win a real chance of office. A fresh effort to persuade a sceptical Labour leadership to adopt a policy of electoral reform for elections to the Commons will be launched tomorrow. But there are signs that the tide is turning against changing the first-past-the-post system. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary and a long-standing advocate of proportional representation, will tomorrow put the case for reform in an article in New Statesman and Society. Labour officials insisted last night that it was still far too early to predict the final conclusions of the Plant committee on electoral systems. Observers increasingly believe that widely diverging views across the party mean that in order to avert a damaging internal schism the status quo is unlikely to be changed.</p>

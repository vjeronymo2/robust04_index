			<p>BFN     [Text] The governor of the Central Bank of the Islamic  Republic of Iran said exchange rates fluctuations are only short  term. He said: By implementing monetary, foreign exchange, and  commercial policies the government intends to steer the foreign  exchange market toward stable exchange rates.    Our correspondent reports that Central Bank Governor 'Adeli  said: Goods importers are the main applicants for foreign  currency.    He referred to the shock prices on international oil markets  in recent months and its effect in creating an imbalance in the  country's balance of trade. He said: Using the two levers of  foreign exchange and foreign trade policies, particularly in the  import of goods, in the short term, to restore balance to  foreign payments is unavoidable.    He emphasised the beneficial effects of those policies in  the  long run to stabilize exchange rates. He said stabilizing the  exchange rate is the government's strongest action in protecting  domestic products.</p>

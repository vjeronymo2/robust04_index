			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- The activity of the Russian  police force's special Omon [special-purpose militia  detachments] units will be examined by the State Duma, it was  decided today. The chamber set up a special commission to  prepare the discussion.    The move came from a woman deputy from the city of Tver, who  complained that Omon policemen were "committing outrage" in her  city, although she adduced no specific facts to confirm the  statement.    The woman said that Omon units "ran riot" in the city last  October and that she saw no point in "appealing to Minister  Viktor Yerin" in this context.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON HELPS PROPEL GRANADA HILLS TO 21-0 WIN  </P> <P> A pack of Harley-Davidson motorcycles rolled into the stadium at Granada Hills  High on Friday night, part of the school's homecoming festivities.  </P> <P> There was leather everywhere on the noisy chopped hogs, and almost as much  chrome as there is in, say, the Highlander trophy case.  </P> <P> The bikes served as an escort of sorts for Granada Hills fullback Brett  Washington, who has thighs the size of saddle bags and a nose for the open  road. And once again, when the Highlanders squeezed the clutch, Washington hit  high gear as Granada Hills thundered past El Camino Real, 21-0, in a West  Valley League game.  </P> <P> The victory assured Granada Hills of the league's top seeding in the City  Section 4-A Division playoffs and clinched at least a share of the school's  fifth consecutive league title. It was the fourth shutout in six conference  games for the Highlanders, who limited El Camino Real to 67 yards.  </P> <P> After a scoreless first half, Granada Hills cashed in the game's first big  break. On third and 11 from the Granada Hills 38-yard line, Conquistadore  backup quarterback Terry Morrow flipped a bad pitch to running back Chris  Griggs. The ball was picked up on a bounce by defensive back Derrick Stewart,  who was tackled at the El Camino Real 44.  </P> <P> "That was the big play," said Washington, who gained 168 yards in 26 carries.  "It pumped Derrick up and it pumped the rest of us up."  </P> <P> The Highlanders (8-1, 6-0 in league play) pumped it inside to Washington -- who  carried on seven consecutive plays. Washington finished off the drive -- and in  effect, the Conquistadores -- when he scored on a 14-yard run inside with 5  minutes 2 seconds left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> "Nice play calling," quipped Highlander co-Coach Tom Harp, who handles the  offense.  </P> <P> Washington, who accounted for 65% of the team's offense (257 yards), was again  the man in the fourth quarter. Washington turned a third-and-four play into a  34-yard touchdown run with 6:55 left in the game and scored on a two-point  conversion for a 14-0 Highlander lead.  </P> <P> "That might be the best I've seen him run," Granada Hills co -- Coach Darryl  Stroh said.  </P> <P> Granada Hills put El Camino Real (6-2, 5-1) away on the Conquistadores' next  possession when Morrow, pressured out of the pocket by a blitzing Stewart,  tossed a pass that was intercepted by Alonzo Finney.  </P> <P> Finney raced 30 yards for a touchdown and a 21-0 lead, the same margin of  victory when the teams met in conference play last season.  </P> <P> El Camino Real was unable to establish anything offensively in the first half,  either, and piled up just 51 yards. The Conquistadores managed to cross the  50-yard line twice in the half and could penetrate no further than the  Highlander 38.  </P> <P> And the Highlanders were dishing out more than just statistical punishment. El  Camino Real quarterback Evan Howland was carried off the field with a possible  dislocation of the left hip after he was sacked by Chris Zane with 7:10 left in  the first half.  </P> <P> There were chances, but the Highlanders twice failed to convert fourth-down  plays inside the El Camino Real 30 in the second quarter. After driving to the  Conquistadore 26, a holding call backed up the Highlanders and quarterback  Bryan Martin's fourth-down bootleg was stopped for a four-yard loss.  </P> <P> The Highlanders moved to the El Camino Real 30 on their next possession, but  Martin was victimized by a pair of dropped passes. The drive stalled when  Martin's fourth-and-nine pass from the 30 fell incomplete with 2:05 left in the  half.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Senior Chinese leader  Wu Xueqian said here today that the five principles of peaceful  coexistence, which were promulgated 40 years ago by China, India  and Myanmar (Burma), marked a milestone in the history of modern  international relations.    Wu, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), told a CPPCC  forum marking the 40th anniversary of the five principles that  they "embody the ideas of sovereignty, equality, mutual benefit  and peace in the new era of international relations."    The five principles of peaceful coexistence, namely mutual  respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,  non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal  affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence,  were first formulated by China and later advocated by China and  its neighboring countries of India and Myanmar in 1954.    Wu noted that in the diversified world the five principles,  antagonistic to hegemonism and power politics, have received the  sincere support of most countries.    He pointed out that China is not only an advocate but also a  faithful follower of the principles. "China has never occupied  even an inch of any other country's territory, nor has it  interfered in any other country's internal affairs," he added.    Wu stressed that China will constitute no threat to any  state  or region, even after it becomes stronger economically.    He went on to say that the international situation remains  disorderly, and hegemonism and power politics still exist even  after the Cold War. As early as in 1974, Wu continued, Deng  Xiaoping proposed at a special UN conference that the political  and economic relations between countries should be set up on the  basis of the five principles.    In 1988, Wu said, Deng further proposed that a new type of  political and economic world order should be established in  accordance with the five principles. "These ideas are becoming  the common understanding of more and more countries," he added.    Among those attending the forum were Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme  and  Zhao Puchu, both vice-chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee.</p>

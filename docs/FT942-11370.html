			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Tory poll rout threatens PM: Conservatives sink to record 27% low as Lib Dems surge and Labour strengthens Mr John Major's government suffered an unprecedented electoral battering early this morning as a nationwide anti-Tory protest brought a surge in support for the Liberal Democrats and a strong performance by Labour in the local elections. In a poll that will fuel the doubts about Mr Major's leadership just weeks before the critical European elections on June 9, the Conservatives appeared set to end up in their weakest position in local government for 50 years. Amid growing speculation at Westminster about a challenge to the prime minister, Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, dismissed suggestions that Mr Major would be forced from office. 'I don't think there is any question about the position of John Major as the leader of the party and as prime minister,' he said. As results flooded in it appeared that despite a dismal performance when the same council seats were last contested at the height of the poll tax row in 1990, the Conservative vote had sunk even further to a record low of 27 per cent. The Liberal Democrats had about the same share, while Labour was comfortably above 40 per cent. Among damaging defeats, the Tories lost control of Basildon, the barometer Essex seat in successive general elections. They also lost Tunbridge Wells, Woking, Basingstoke, Hertsmere, North Hertfordshire, Epping Forest, Southend and Stratford upon Avon. The party failed to win its two target seats in the west Midlands - Labour-controlled Birmingham and the hung council at Wolverhampton. As expected, Labour held Rotherham in the Parliamentary by-election but with a reduced majority. In London, the crucial electoral battleground between the two biggest parties, the Conservatives suffered the damaging loss of Enfield, Harrow, Ealing, Bexley, Redbridge and Croydon, London's largest borough and Conservative-controlled for over 100 years. As expected, Kingston-upon-Thames fell to the Liberal Democrats. There was some comfort, however, with the retention by the Tories of their flagship Wandsworth council. In terms of seats, the Liberal Democrats, who fared badly four years ago, appeared to be the biggest winners of the night, with gains from both the other main parties. They took control of Congleton in Cheshire and a string of councils across southern England, including Bath, Colchester, Rochford, Mole Valley, Worthing, Winchester and St Albans. They held Brentwood, Cheltenham and Gosport. Foreshadowing the likely outcome of June's Eastleigh by-election, the Liberal Democrats won the council, which had previously been hung. Labour's chances of wresting the seat from the Conservatives in the by-election ebbed with the loss of two council wards to the Liberal Democrats. The London borough of Tower Hamlets provided a rare setback for the Liberal Democrats, with Labour taking control. The far-right British National party lost the single seat in the docklands Millwall ward won in a by-election in September. Despite losing some seats across the country, Labour took control of Wolverhampton, Barrow-in-Furness, West Lancashire and Welwyn and Hatfield. The party consolidated its grip on Amber Valley, tightened its hold on Derby and retained its position as largest party in Liverpool. Labour camp over the capture of leafy London suburbs such as Croydon and Enfield. The party also held metropolitan areas such as Sheffield and Newcastle upon Tyne, although in both the Liberal Democrats made gains at the expense of Labour. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, declared it had been a 'splendid' night for his party, adding: 'John Major and his government have been humiliated.' But Mr Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, insisted that with expected gains of more than 350 council seats his party was the 'clear winner'. North of the border, the Conservatives' share of the vote fell to 14 per cent, while the Scottish National party made gains. Labour held control of Lothian and Strathclyde, winning seats in the latter from both nationalists and Scottish Militant. In Wales, Labour held its dominant position, but lost three seats to Plaid Cymru in Rhondda.  ---------------------------------- Council seats: 3.30am  ----------------------------------             Net gains   Net losses  ---------------------------------- Con               -         319 Lab               -          15 L Dem           356           - Others            -          22  ----------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------- DAY OF DEFEATS FOR CONSERVATIVES  --------------------------------------------------- Tories suffer damaging losses in London Labour's share of vote tops 40 per cent Lib Dems take string of councils across south BNP loses seat in Tower Hamlets Labour retains Rotherham in by-election  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

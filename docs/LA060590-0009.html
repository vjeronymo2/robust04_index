			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ROBINSON BACK FROM SUSPENSION; ORIOLES WIN THEIR THIRD IN A ROW  </P> <P> Cal Ripken, in an eight-for-57 slump, hit a sacrifice fly in the sixth inning  that gave the Baltimore Orioles the go-ahead run in a 6-4 victory over the  Milwaukee Brewers Monday night at Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Baltimore's third consecutive victory came on a night when Manager Frank  Robinson returned from a three-game suspension he received for criticizing  umpire Drew Coble in Minneapolis last week.  </P> <P> The Orioles squandered a 4-1 lead but got the go-ahead run with the help of  Milwaukee's 58th error of the season.  </P> <P> With the score 4-4, Craig Worthington singled off reliever Bill Krueger (2-2).  Billy Ripken bunted and when third baseman Gary Sheffield threw high to first,  Ripken was safe. Phil Bradley singled to load the bases and after pinch-hitter  Brad Komminsk struck out, Ripken hit his sacrifice fly.  </P> <P> Boston 5, New York 3 -- Tom Brunansky drove in four runs with a homer, a  sacrifice fly and a tiebreaking double in the eighth inning as the Red Sox beat  Yankees at Boston.  </P> <P> In eight games at Fenway Park since being acquired from St. Louis in a trade  for Lee Smith May 4, Brunansky is 13 for 31 (.419).  </P></p>

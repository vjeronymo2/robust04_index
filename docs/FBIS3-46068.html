This was the first time its export volume  had exceeded that of Shanghai and it ranked first among the  large cities in the country.    Last year, Shenzhen's foreign trade enterprises were  troubled  by undesirable factors such as shortages of funds, drastic  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and difficulties in tax  reimbursement. Shenzhen City government judged the hour, sized  up the situation, did solid work for enterprises, pooled funds  through various channels, made use of foreign trade and export  regulation funds, and speeded up the checking of tax  reimbursements. Thanks to the effective measures, Shenzhen's  foreign trade enterprises were able to avoid a big slide in  exports under an extremely difficult situation.    While consolidating its markets in Hong Kong and Macao,  Shenzhen has made great efforts to develop its markets in the  Asia-Pacific region and to open up market in the CIS, Eastern  Europe, South America, and Africa. These are the main features  of Shenzhen's foreign trade and exports last year. According to  reports, Shenzhen's export volume to Africa last year was over  10 times that of the previous year and its exports to South  America, and to the CIS and Eastern Europe were respectively  891.72 and 429.39 percent that of the previous year. The  implementation of a pluralistic strategy in developing foreign  trade markets has laid a firm foundation for Shenzhen City to  increase its foreign trade and exports.    There were also reports on Shenzhen's success in earning  foreign exchange with agricultural products and fresh and live  products earned as much as HK$1 billion [Hong Kong dollars] in  foreign exchange last year.</p>

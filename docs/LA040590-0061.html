			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GROWER EXPANDS IN BIG WAY WITH OREGON ACQUISITION  </P> <P> Capitalizing on San Diego County's building boom, Springtime Growers' wholesale  nursery grew into prominence in the 1980s by selling trees and shrubs to  landscapers of commercial and residential developments. Later, Springtime  Growers built upon that foundation by stocking retail nurseries, too.  </P> <P> Last week, Springtime made its biggest expansion ever, paying $11 million to  acquire Oregon Garden Products of Hillsboro, Ore., the state's largest  wholesale grower and a major supplier of retail nurseries in the Midwest and  the East. Last year, Oregon Garden Products posted revenues in excess of $14  million.  </P> <P> Oregon Garden Products, with a 1,100-acre farm 20 miles west of Portland,  allows Springtime to expand its product line and to sell goods to customers in  colder climate, industry experts said.  </P> <P> "They'll have the Northwest material which they can now ship to the Eastern and  Midwestern markets," said Harold Young, editor of the Pacific Coast Nurseryman,  a trade publication circulated in Western and Sun Belt states. "From an  acquisition standpoint they increase their product base . . . conifers and  stuff that we don't even know about down here. They're in a position to go  great guns."  </P> <P> The combined revenues of Springtime Growers and Oregon Garden Products now  makes parent company Springtime Inc. of San Diego one of the nation's five  largest wholesale growers, with annual sales in excess of $32 million. There  are more than 33,000 U.S. wholesale growing nurseries competing for a share of  the $4.2-billion annual wholesale market.  </P> <P> Founded in 1980, Springtime grows more than 600 varieties of trees, shrubs and  vines on nearly 400 acres of farms in Del Mar, Miramar and Phoenix. Springtime  has been supplying retail and landscape nurseries in California, Nevada and  Arizona. Last year, Springtime posted revenues of $18.7 million, up from $18.4  million in 1988 and $14.2 million in 1987.  </P> <P> According to Tom Ewing, Springtime's president, the acquisition of Oregon  Garden Products enables the company to better supply the growing number of  regional and national chain stores that are buying plant products.  </P> <P> The emergence of large retailers -- such as Home Club, K mart, Builders Square,  Wal-Mart and Sun Belt Nurseries -- that demand substantial quantities and  varieties of plants has developed a need for multi-product, service-oriented  producers, according to industry experts.  </P> <P> "These regional or national retailers want to get their business taken care of  with one call," Ewing said. "But our industry is a fragmented one, with many  growers specializing in certain types of products. There are many large  distributors but very few large players on the supplier side of this business.  We plan to fulfill this need."  </P> <P> Establishing strong positions in both the retail and landscape business also  helps Springtime weather bad times.  </P> <P> "For example, the Phoenix developer market has been down lately and, as a  result, we've had a decline in landscape business, but our retail has been real  strong," Ewing said. "It helps us offset a low time in one area." Landscape  business accounted for 38% of Springtime's 1989 revenues. Retail contributed  62% of the company's sales.  </P> <P> Springtime now grows on 300 acres in Del Mar, 40 acres in Phoenix and 40 acres  in Miramar. Over the next five years, Springtime plans to moves its Del Mar  operations to an expanded Miramar site, where it leases the property from the  federal government.  </P> <P> According to Springtime spokesman Dennis Bahen, the company is moving its  operation because of "housing encroachment (in Del Mar) and a chance to reduce  operational costs. It's cheaper leasing land from the government."  </P> <P> After serving as president of Nurseryland Garden Centers, a successful lawn and  garden products chain, McKenzie Cook, 52, founded Springtime in October 1980.  During Cook's five-year tenure at Nurseryland, the chain expanded from four to  25 stores.  </P> <P> Cook, now Springtime's chief executive officer, left the successful chain  because he recognized a need for a major wholesale supplier in fast-growing San  Diego County, Ewing said.  </P> <P> "There were a couple of major wholesalers up north, but they had their hands  full supplying Orange County, which as you know had a boom of their own," said  Ewing, 40. "No one was really addressing the fast-growing market in San Diego."  </P> <P> With $3 million money raised from limited partners, McKenzie and Ewing launched  Springtime with 20 acres in Del Mar.  </P> <P> "We started supplying landscape contractors and rode on their backs until we  got the retail side going," Ewing said. "We certainly had no idea we would grow  this big."  </P></p>

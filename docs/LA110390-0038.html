			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA FREEWAY;  </P> <P> CONSTRUCTION ALERTS TO BE BROADCAST  </P> <P> Motorists seeking to avoid construction-related delays on the Ventura Freeway  between Reseda and North Hollywood can now turn to the air-waves.  </P> <P> The California Department of Transportation is broadcasting traffic advisories  on 1610-AM to warn motorists of lane, ramp and connector-road closures caused  by the Ventura Improvement Project, a $76-million road-widening project  scheduled for ongoing work until early 1992.  </P> <P> The broadcast will air during peak construction periods between Thursday and  Sunday nights, when post-midnight traffic in certain areas is reduced to a  single lane in each direction, Caltrans spokeswoman Nora Chopelas said.  Roadside signs have been erected to alert drivers when the messages are airing.  </P> <P> The information is being broadcast in both English and Spanish.  </P> <P> The project, begun last November, will add an additional lane in each direction  on a 15-mile stretch between Woodland Hills and Universal City.

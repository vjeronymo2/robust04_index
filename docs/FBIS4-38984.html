			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk met chiefs of  the leading Russian mass media, members of the Moscow club of  editors-in-chief, in Kiev on 2 June. A broad range of issues  was addressed, particularly those connected with Crimea and the  Black Sea Fleet. The following was underlined: Complete  alienation of Crimea from Ukraine is absurd because Crimea is  inseparable from and depends upon Ukraine. Of course, there are  issues that need to be solved jointly. One of these is dividing  the Black Sea Fleet and determining the basing sites for the  Russian Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's Naval Forces. However, at  this point one should display tolerance, common sense and mutual  respect.    The media chiefs asked the president of Ukraine: Is there  any  confidence that the use of force in Crimea can be avoided?    Leonid Kravchuk answered: Under no circumstances will we  resort to the use of force, and we call on the leadership of  Crimea to abide by the same principle.    The issue of a possible federal land structure of Ukraine  was  raised during the conversation. The president's reply was quite  clear-cut: One cannot just hold forth on it. It cannot be  considered at a domestic, unprofessional level.    The leaders of the Russian mass media were also concerned  about the Ukrainian president's attitude toward the work done in  Ukraine by the journalists of other states. Leonid Kravchuk  agreed to the proposal to discuss a common information space at  the level of the CIS heads and declared his readiness to  initiate the adoption of a relevant document.    They also asked the president of Ukraine about his personal  goals and desires. The Moscow journalists heard the following  reply: I would like progress to begin in the economic sphere in  Ukraine, and to see friendly relations take shape between  neighbors not formally but in practical terms, in particular,  between Russia and Ukraine, because there is no alternative  here. I would like Russians to regard Ukraine as an equal  partner.    Dwelling on mutual relations with the Supreme Council and  its  chairman, the president of Ukraine pointed out that they are  businesslike and that relations with Oleksandr Moroz are normal.    As for the upcoming presidential election, Leonid Kravchuk  said: The election will take place. The main struggle, in my  opinion, will get under way during the second round. Who will  enter it? I believe it will be Leonid Kuchma. I am almost  convinced of this. Who else? Possibly myself.    At the end of the conversation the president of Ukraine  again  turned to the issue of mutual relations between Ukraine and  Russia. He underlined that these relations should be built while  taking into account the fact that the two states should live in  peace and accord.</p>

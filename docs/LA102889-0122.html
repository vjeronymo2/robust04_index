			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HAAS' PLAYS KEEP EL TORO IN RIGHT SPOT  </P> <P> The timing of El Toro High School linebacker/tight end Brian Haas' first pass  reception and first interception of the season couldn't have been better.  </P> <P> Haas caught a seven-yard pass for the go-ahead touchdown and then intercepted a  pass with 57 seconds remaining to preserve the Chargers' 21-14 victory over  Mission Viejo Friday night in front of 6,200 fans.  </P> <P> The loss was the second straight for Mission Viejo (6-2, 1-2) following 11  consecutive victories in the South Coast League over the past three years and  was only the fifth loss for the Diablos in three years.  </P> <P> El Toro (8-0, 3-0) broke a 14-14 tie with 5:07 remaining when quarterback Steve  Stenstrom teamed with Haas on an eight-yard scoring play in the right corner of  the end zone. Stenstrom completed four consecutive passes in a 62-yard drive  that decided the game.  </P> <P> Haas ended any hopes of a Mission Viejo comeback when he stepped in front of a  receiver at midfield and intercepted quarterback Tim Snowden's pass. It was  Snowden's third intercepted pass of the night.  </P> <P> "I was just in the right place at the right time," said Haas, who also  recovered a fumble. "They put me in on goal-line offense, and I happened to get  open for the touchdown. Then, we went into a prevent defense, and the guy  throws the ball right to me."  </P> <P> Haas' only wrong move came in the waning moments, when he failed to return to  the field while answering a reporter's questions, forcing Stenstrom to call a  timeout. Bob Johnson, El Toro coach, credited his team's defense and  Stenstrom's passing as the difference in the well-played game.  </P> <P> "This was a league championship-type game between two great teams," Johnson  said. "Our defense was as much a factor in this game as it's been in any we've  played this year. Every time it looked like the game was going to turn around  in Mission Viejo's favor, we got an interception or a sack or a fumble  recovery."  </P> <P> Stenstrom, whom Johnson has billed as the county's best quarterback all season,  made his coach look good by completing 15 of 28 pass attempts for 241 yards and  two touchdowns. El Toro needed all his passing skills with its rushing game  limited to just 31 yards.  </P> <P> Jerome Oakman also was outstanding for El Toro. Oakman rushed for 31 yards in  nine carries and caught five passes for 95 yards, including a 21-yard screen  pass for a score.  </P> <P> Oakman got El Toro off to a quick start by returning the opening kickoff 44  yards to set up the Chargers' first score. Danny Maestas gave El Toro a 7-0  lead when he scored on a seven-yard run four plays after Oakman's kickoff  return.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo scored on its second possession of the second half, with tailback  Mark Gaw going 10 yards for a touchdown.  </P></p>

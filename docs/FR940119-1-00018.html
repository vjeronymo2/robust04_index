			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a)(1) would establish protection as the primary management objective for cultural resources in the HCNRA. It would additionally provide for public education and information opportunities about cultural resources as a management objective unless this would unreasonably interfere with protection efforts. This standard acknowledges the importance of cultural resource protection and education for the vast storehouse of information in the HCNRA but recognizes that educating the public about cultural resources must be secondary to protection and must occur only if the resources can be adequately protected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (a)(2) requires that the Ranger establish management priorities for cultural resources based, in part, on whether the appropriate State Historic Preservation Office has concurred with the Forest Service's determination that a cultural resource is ``significant.'' By establishing priorities, the Ranger will be able to allocate available moneys for protection, education, and enjoyment based on the historical or scientific importance of a cultural resource. The Ranger also may take into account the relative risk of damage or destruction to the resource and steps that could be taken to avoid or minimize that risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(3) would apply to cultural resources which meet the significance threshold. It would require that information from these resources be documented and favor on-site over off-site protection. The Ranger may select off-site protection under certain conditions. For instance, the Ranger may decide off-site protection is appropriate if the resource is located on NRA Wilderness Lands and protecting it on-site would significantly intrude on the wilderness resource. Another example of when off-site protection might be preferred is if the cost is less than on-site protection and significant cultural resources with identical or similar values have already been protected on-site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (a)(4) applies to all paleontological resources in the HCNRA and would establish protection for scientific study as the primary objective. Prior written authorization would be required before any individual could disturb or remove a paleontological resource in connection with scientific study activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(1) would incorporate the standards and guidelines for Other Lands and apply them to the Wilderness Lands. This would ensure consistency of Forest Service cultural and paleontological resource administration within the HCNRA and, more importantly, the protection of these resources into the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) would establish two additional standards for Wilderness Lands in recognition of the Agency's dual management objectives of protecting cultural resources and minimizing impacts on the wilderness. This would be accomplished by requiring that information and education activities related to cultural resources on Wilderness Lands be conducted outside of the wilderness and by precluding the development of new or relocated trails on Wilderness Lands which would be used primarily as a means of securing public access to cultural resources. This will enable visitors to experience cultural resources in their natural setting, unencumbered by the signs, guided tours, or other devices normally used to inform and educate the visitor about our past. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 292.44&blank;The Use of Motorized and Mechanical Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;292.44 would create five standards to guide Forest Service administration of motorized and mechanical equipment on National Forest System lands in the HCNRA. Proposed paragraphs (a)(1)&hyph;(4) set forth the standards and guidelines for motorized and mechanical equipment use in the Other Lands; proposed paragraph (b) would establish the standard for such use in the Wilderness Lands. For ease of reference, the term ``motorized and mechanical equipment'' in this rule has the same meaning as ``motorized equipment'' and ``mechanical transport'' which are defined in regulations promulgated under the Wilderness Act at 36 CFR part 293 except that it would not include motorized wheelchairs or other devices used solely to assist people with disabilities. Nor would it include motorized or nonmotorized rivercraft which are defined in and regulated under a separate provision of this rule. Though not explicitly referenced, the relevant provisions of the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. 1131  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and regulations at 36 CFR parts 212, 261, 293, and 295 would also apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(1) would authorize the use of motorized and mechanical equipment on any Forest Service roads or airfields within the HCNRA subject to terms and conditions necessary to ensure the safe use of these facilities. This provision applies to all Forest Service transportation development facilities as that term is currently defined in 36 CFR 212.1, except for Forest Service trails which are the subject of paragraph (a)(2). This provision also does not purport to regulate the use of motorized and mechanical equipment on public roads or highways which are under the jurisdiction of a state or local transportation authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(2) would authorize the use of motorized and mechanical equipment on Forest Service trails subject to terms and conditions necessary to ensure the safe use of these facilities and when compatible with the management objectives identified in section 7 of the Act. As envisioned in the proposed rule, motorized and mechanical equipment could only be used on Forest Service trails in the non-wilderness portions of the HCNRA pursuant to a finding that such use was compatible with, among other things, the protection of free-flowing rivers, the conservation of wilderness and other values, the maintenance of fish and wildlife habitat, and/or the protection of historic, archeologic, and paleontologic sites. If a particular proposed use was compatible with some of the management objectives but not with others, the Ranger would have to decide whether, on balance, the compatibility outweighed the incompatibility and the use could proceed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(3) would authorize the use of mechanical equipment off National Forest airstrips, roads, or trails only if such use is compatible with the management objectives of section 7 of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(4) would prohibit the use of motorized equipment off Forest Service airstrips, roads, and trails except in those cases where it is reasonably necessary to attain one or more of the management objectives set out in section 7. Under this standard, use of an off-road vehicle (ORV) might only be permitted if it were necessary to protect fish and wildlife habitat or preserve historic resources. ORV use also might be allowable if it were necessary to conduct the types of timber harvesting, mining, and grazing that are provided for in the proposed rule. It will be the responsibility of the proponent of such use to demonstrate its necessity related to the management objectives in section 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

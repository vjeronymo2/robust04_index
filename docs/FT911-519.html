			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Markets: A taxing time but Trafalgar battles on - The Bottom Line HOW WOULD Trafalgar House shareholders react if the final dividend was skipped later this year? As far as the directors are concerned the scenario is not worth thinking about. Yet passing the dividend would be the simplest solution to what is proving to be an intractable problem: the tax bill. Taxation for the shipping-to-property group has risen to 33 per cent - a good 10 per cent higher than normal. The group's UK profits are not big enough to offset tax paid on the dividend against advanced corporation tax (ACT). But there is no reason for shareholders to panic. If Sir Eric Parker, chief executive, was prepared to raid reserves last year to pay a dividend he is unlikely to pass it on in September. A less painful way out is to buy a few British companies with a healthy balance sheet. But that could require Trafalgar taking on more debt. Not an impossible feat for a group with gearing at 54 per cent, but by no means ideal. The group's favoured solution is to issue convertible loan stock. The interest paid on the stock would be tax deductable. However, as far as shareholders are concerned the simplest solution is for Trafalgar to earn more profits in the UK. In the short term that looks like a tall order. The results this week could have been worse, but not much. For the six months to March Trafalgar's pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 116.9m to Pounds 51.5m. True, there were unusual circumstances. Its not every year that one of your world cruise liners has to be re-routed to avoid a war in the Gulf. A recession does not help either. Yet the simple point about a conglomerate is that if one sector goes into the red another should remain in the black. In Trafalgar's case just about everything went red. The exception being construction. Thanks to a record Pounds 2.9bn order book the sector's operating profits rose by 40 per cent to Pounds 38.3m (Pounds 27.4m). (It was so good some analysts questioned the figures at a meeting with the company. But the order book looks real enough.) What potential investors want to know is what chance is there of the red spots turning black? Sir Eric is cautiously confident that property and investment, down from Pounds 64.9m to Pounds 19m, is set to recover. So too is just about every analyst. The only argument is when? Sir Eric has detected a revival in UK housing. But not many analysts have seen simular signs. Yet even if he is given the benefit of doubt it still does not help investors know whether the sector is on the road to recovery. The key is commercial property - a big earner in the past  - where the decision to reclassify about Pounds 200m of investment properties as fixed assets should be read as a warning sign: there is still worse to come. When the properties are revalued in September there will be the inevitable write-down. But the reclassification means that any devaluation will go straight into reserves instead of showing up in the profit and loss account. Nonetheless, even the pessimist will concede that the outlook for commercial property will improve. The group is building three big developments. The Brooklands business park should be on stream within five years when the sector is expected to be making record profits. A business park in Chiswick, west London, and office development in Paddington, central London, should be completed by the end of the decade. On the shipping front, the company can be forgiven for feeling a little sorry for itself. It was more heavily exposed to the impact of the Gulf War and the recession than its rivals. This was because Cunard, Trafalgar House's cruise shipping operation, places a higher proportion of its vessels outside the US market. When there is a war US citizens, who count for around 80 per cent of Cunard's market, tend not to venture too far from home. The fall in profits, from Pounds 30.1m to Pounds 7.6m, would have been worse but for the fact that the Cunard Princess was chartered out for recreation during the Gulf War. That said, the worst is behind Trafalgar. The group is reporting signs of recovery in the cruise market. While it may not be soon enough to affect this year's end results, it should make an impact by 1992. In the long-term there is more reason to feel bullish about the company. The group's 9.1 per cent yield, the second highest in the Footsie, is expected to fall as its shares rise. Its net asset value of Pounds 165m includes out of date valuations of the QE2 and other five star vessels. Analysts believe the true asset figure is closer to Pounds 350m. While Sir Eric has ruled out throwing any immediate sops to shareholders by demerging he has reason to expect significantly bigger profits, particularly from commercial property, within the next three to four years. By that time he should even be able to reduce the tax bill.</p>

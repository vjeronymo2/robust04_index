			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections  scheduled for 8 May.    Presidential Candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares, of the  Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, met with workers of the  diplomatic corps and students on 13 April. He said: "The  Foreign Ministry must start recovering our authority, our true  dignity, our image of a free, independent, and sovereign country  in the eyes of all the world's nations, beginning 1 September."  He added the ministry will have the important task of upholding  the Panama Canal Treaty and "promoting our geographic position  and our potential as a nation." In doing so, "we will attract  the foreign investment we need to create jobs." (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 13 Apr 94)    Presidential Candidate Ruben Dario Carles, of the  Nationalist  Liberal Republican Movement (Molirena)-Change '94 Alliance,  attended the Cade (Annual Conference of Business Executives) 94  conference hosted by Apede (Panamaian Association of Business  Executives) on 9 April. He strongly criticized the Endara  administration for "being incapable of solving the country's  social problems." He said as comptroller general he contributed  to development "through strict fiscal control." Early  polarization among ruling parties has resulted in "paralyzation  of the government's development plans." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA  DE PANAMA in Spanish 10 Apr 94 p 48)    Carles toured the public market, accompanied by his running  mates and Panama City mayoral candidate Omayra Correa on 13  April. Carles chatted with vendors and told them he, as  president, will improve conditions at the market. (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 13 Apr 94)    Ruben Blades, Papa Egoro Movement, MPE, presidential  candidate, spoke to the Jewish charity association B'Nai B'Rith  on 7 April. He said hunger and poverty and not ideological  positions are the real enemies of personal wealth. He said "the  comfort we enjoy today does not free us from responsibility,  because that comfort could suddenly disappear if the current  precepts and poor examples of private and government corruption  continue to prevail." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in  Spanish 8 Apr 94 p 2A)    Blades took his campaign to Chepo, a rural area east of  Panama City, on 11 April. He walked with the people and went  for a bicycle ride. Citing recent poll results and his campaign  expenditures, Blades said: "That is an example of what good  administration can do. We have spent only $50,000, and we are  in second place." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in  Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Apr 94)    The National Popular Party, PNP, announced on 12 April it  will endorse the MPE and the Blades ticket for the 8 May  presidential elections. Party President Jorge Flores said  Blades "is responsible and honest and will do a good job."  (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 12 Apr  94)    Presidential candidate Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, of the  ruling Arnulfist Party, PA, while campaigning in Arraijan  District on 9 April, affirmed the PRD and the PA will polarize  the final race for the presidency. She said "there will be two  options -- a government for all Panamanians or a return to the  past." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 10 Apr 94  p 1A)    In Colon, Gruber outlined her plans for the recovery of the  province's economy. "There is much work to be done in Colon,  but, as I have said before, I have more than enough energy and  courage," Gruber said during a rally in downtown Colon. (Panama  City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Apr 94)    Presidential Candidate Eduardo Vallarino, of the Christian  Democratic Party, PDC, told reporters on 7 April Panama's image  abroad is poor, but the U.S. State Department report on drug  trafficking and money laundering has worsened it. He called on  all candidates "to file a detailed declaration of our assets"  and, what he considered more important, "an explanation of from  where the millions of dollars being spent on advertising  campaigns" is coming. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 8 Apr 94  p 1)    Presidential candidates Perez and Carles have addressed a  meeting of the Panama Canal chapter of the AFL-CIO. Perez  suggested creation of a "full time presidential commission to  reinforce the efforts of canal operations." He said he will  "prevent expertise from leaving the country, exclude U.S. laws  from the Panama Canal, and fulfill the Torrijos Carter Treaty."  Meanwhile, Carles said that finally, "after 17 years, the canal  will be ours, and the future belongs to all Panamanians."  (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 8 Apr 94 p 2A)    Presidential candidates Perez, Carles, Vallarino, and Munoz  were present for a special forum hosted by the Single National  Union of Construction and Related Workers on 7 April. They  agreed on the need for reforms to the labor code. Vallarino  said he "would not change anything which the unions did not  propose." Perez said "there is no way we can ask the workers to  sacrifice what they have earned." Carles said, however, any  changes "will depend on what would work and how it would work.  We must speak to the workers first." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA  DE PANAMA in Spanish 8 Apr 94 p 4A)    Vice presidential candidates Guillermo Quijano and Tomas  Herrera of the Molirena-Change '94 Alliance; Tomas Altamirano  Duque of the PRD; Raul Ossa of the PDC; Raul Bernal of the PPD;  and Fernando Manfredo and Ricardo Bermudez of the MPE  participated in the Apede and Cade annual conference on 8 April.  All candidates agreed there is a "moral crisis" in Panama.  Quijano said the solution lies in giving the people "real  alternatives, instead of false promises." Altamirano blamed the  crisis on the "unemployment rate, extreme poverty, and unequal  distribution of wealth." Ossa called for a "national concerted"  effort to face the problem. Manfredo and Bermudez outlined  their party's government plan for facing the issue, stating the  MPE is the "only party to have presented a serious plan."  (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 9 Apr 94 p 1A)    On April 6 the Federico Guerra Corporation released the  results of its latest poll, taken between 29 March and 3 April.

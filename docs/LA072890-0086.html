			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOUBT GOES EARLY IN LANGSTON LOSS  </P> <P> The Angels hoped they had signed a 20-game winner when they agreed to pay Mark  Langston $16 million over five years last winter. Instead, they could have a  20-game loser.  </P> <P> Admittedly excited about his second visit to the Kingdome to face his former  Seattle Mariner teammates, Langston was as prepared as he had ever been for a  game. But he wasn't ready for his dismal performance Friday night, as he gave  up six runs in 2 2/3 innings as the Mariners rocked him and rolled past the  Angels, 8-1.  </P> <P> "I had better stuff tonight than the last time I pitched here," he said,  referring to a 2-1 loss July 11. "I had better stuff than I had my last couple  starts. I was very pumped up for this game. I was ready to turn it around  tonight and it didn't work out."  </P> <P> Instead, the Mariners collected seven hits off Langston in sending him to his  eighthconsecutive defeat and the Angels' fifth in their last six games. Erik  Hanson (11-8) and Gene Harris held the Angels to four hits as the club's record  fell to 1-4 halfway through its 10-game, three-city trip.  </P> <P> "We were flat and got off to a bad start and it was compounded. That's it,"  second baseman Johnny Ray said.  </P> <P> Continuing a flurry of transactions, the Angels announced after the game they  had optioned third baseman Jack Howell to Edmonton and recalled infielder Kent  Anderson. Howell had five hits in his last 35 at-bats to reduce his batting  average to .208. Anderson, who was sent to Edmonton on June 30, hit .271 in 18  games with the Trappers and had seven RBIs. That's six more RBIs than he  produced for the Angels in 30 games before he was sent out.  </P> <P> They also recalled center fielder Devon White, sending out relief pitcher Scott  Bailes.  </P> <P> Winless in 10 starts and eight decisions, since a 6-4 victory at Kansas City on  June 5, Langston's 4-13 record puts him on track for the Angel record of 19  losses, set in 1973 by Clyde Wright and matched a year later by Frank Tanana.  Perhaps most disheartening for the 29-year-old left-hander is that each of his  past two starts has lasted a mere 2 2/3 innings and has been marked by  surrendering six runs. In his last six starts, he has given up 29 earned runs  over 35 innings, an earned-run average of 7.46.  </P> <P> Seattle, which Langston no-hit for seven innings on April 11 for his first  Angel victory, batted around and scored four times in the first, an inning  highlighted by Jeffrey Leonard's two-run double. Edgar Martinez added a home  run in the third, and Omar Vizquel drove in the final run off Langston with a  double to right, sending him to the dugout to the accompaniment of a chorus of  boos and derisive cheers.  </P> <P> "I've never heard them like that," Langston said of the fans.  </P> <P> Then again, he's never pitched like this. "It's a gut-check," he said of his  streak. "I've never experienced anything like this, and it's very, very  frustrating. I want to help this team, and I felt I would be able to help this  team when I came here. . . .  </P> <P> "I didn't work ahead very well, and for me to be effective and my pitches to  work, I have to work ahead in the count. Then I can be aggressive. If I'm ahead  two strikes, then I have some room to mess around. I threw some very good  sliders tonight, but they laid off. They were going to make me throw strikes."  </P> <P> He didn't throw many. "If you get behind, location becomes everything," catcher  Lance Parrish said. "He's certainly not fooling people at this point, so he has  to concentrate on his location. He's got good stuff. Most of the time a guy  with stuff like that can get by with it."  </P> <P> Bad as his ordeal has been -- and on Friday he acknowledged how he has tossed  and turned and replayed losses in his mind -- Langston is determined not to be  beaten mentally. "I don't thinkmechanically there's too much more I can do," he  said. "I made one adjustment (in hisdelivery) that was a good adjustment. I  just somehow have to break through. I will never givein. I will not give in."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> After outfielder Devon White was recalled from triple-A Edmonton late Thursday,  he was in Friday's original lineup but scratched because of stiffness in his  lower back.  </P> <P> "I did a little soul-searching," White said of his 14-game Edmonton stint,  which began when he was optioned on July 6. "I went down there and I did what I  had to do. . . . I took a lot of extra batting practice and before I left,  (Dave) Winfield gave me some pointers." White hit .364 with four doubles, four  triples and six RBIs in Edmonton after hitting .213 for the Angels.  </P> <P> Bailes, who will make four or five starts for Edmonton, took the news well.  "Everyone knows I need to get in some innings, and the way it's been going I  wasn't going to get them in here," said the 27-year-old left-hander, whose  earned-run average had jumped to 6.37. "I was tense out there. When they told  me, it felt like 500 pounds had been taken off my shoulders."  </P> <P> The Angels hired Tony Seigle, former vice president of player personnel for the  Padres, to handle special assignments regarding scouting and player personnel.  Seigle has also worked for the Phillies, Brewers and Astros.  </P> <P> Reliever Mark Eichhorn, who has given up 16 earned runs in 9 1/3 innings in 10  appearances since June 21, attributed his woes to bad habits he fell into after  his successful start. "Because I'm not pitching as often as earlier, I got in a  couple of mechanical ruts," he said. "I've looked at tapes and hopefully I can  correct a few things." . . . Jim Abbott is featured as "One of baseball's most  eligible bachelors" in the August issue of Cosmopolitan magazine. The article,  entitled, "Baseball's most gorgeous hunks," describes Abbott as "tall,  bright-eyed, strong and brave." Abbott took considerable kidding about it from  his teammates. "It's a good thing they wrote about him because he needs all the  help he can get," Chuck Finley said.  </P></p>

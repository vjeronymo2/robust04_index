			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Second Korean minister set to go THE expected departure of a second minister from the 10-day-old cabinet of South Korean President Kim Young-sam highlights the issue of corruption that his new administration has promised to fight. Ms Park Yang-sil, minister of health and social affairs and one of three women in the cabinet, is expected to be dismissed today for allegedly engaging in illegal property speculation. At the weekend, Mr Park Hee-tae, justice minister, resigned for allegedly taking advantage of a foreign-citizen loophole to get his US-born daughter admitted to Seoul's highly-competitive Ehwa Woman's University. The newly-appointed mayor of Seoul, a presidential appointee, was sacked last week for allegedly illegally developing land in a 'green zone' surrounding the city. Mr Kim has made clear he is determined to root out the corruption that is pervasive in Korean society. But the sackings are embarrassing, since the cabinet was billed as strongly reformist, consisting of political outsiders who would challenge the status quo. The charges against the cabinet ministers are emotive ones in South Korea. There is public resentment against those who made fortunes from the property boom of the late 1980s. Ms Park is alleged to have avoided government curbs on property acquisitions by making the purchases using the name of her children. She denies wrong-doing.</p>

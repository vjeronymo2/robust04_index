			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Bank codes of practice criticised - News in Brief THE BANKING codes for personal and business customers announced by the banks in recent weeks were criticised as being inadequate by consumer and business groups at a Commons Treasury committee hearing yesterday, Charles Batchelor writes. The Consumers' Association described the personal code as 'lacking the features you would normally expect to see from progressive organisations in today's marketplace'. The Confederation of British Industry said the business codes were 'not the final word'. The British Bankers' Association last month announced details of a common code of practice for dealing with personal customers for the UK banks and building societies which will come into effect on March 16. Individual business banking codes have been introduced by the main UK banks in recent weeks in response to government pressure. ***** EDUCATION: Student indebtedness is increasing, with the lack of vacation jobs and the government's withdrawal of welfare benefits the main causes, the committee of vice-chancellors (CVCP) told the Commons education committee yesterday. The CVCP said there was no evidence of any increase in drop-out rates as a result. There has been a slight decrease - although not for long enough to signify a trend. Sir Gordon Higginson, vice-chancellor of Southampton University, told the committee: 'Some of our students are having a desperate time. We need a better system (of student financial support) and a safety net.' ***** HOUSING: Mortgage lenders are expected to announce within the next few weeks measures to counter home repossessions, Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, said. He told MPs he had spoken yesterday morning to Mr Mark Boleat, the director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, and expected the lending institutions to make announcements within the next two to three weeks. Recent discussions with building societies, banks and housing associations led to a commitment to measures aimed at aiding homeowners.</p>

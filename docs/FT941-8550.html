			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Tampella swings back to profit Tampella, the Finnish engineering group, has announced its first profit since 1989 after benefiting from extensive restructuring, productivity gains, and the weak markka. Profits after financial items for 1993 totalled FM11m (Dollars 2m), a FM560m swing from a year earlier loss of FM549m. The recovery was particularly marked in the final four months when the company achieved a FM76m profit. Net sales fell to FM4.08bn from FM6.54bn. This followed last May's sale of forest and packaging operations to Enso-Gutzeit, one of the key elements in a restructuring programme which has focused the company on mining and power operations. Tamrock, the group's mining unit, rebounded to a FM79m profit from a FM15m loss, despite depressed markets. But Tampella Power had a more difficult year, due to a heavily loss-making US unit. It swung to a FM43m loss after financial items from a FM34m profit in 1992. Tampella said markets in its main business areas were still 'strained,' but added that signs of recovery were increasing. The group was acquired by the Bank of Finland, the Finnish central bank, as part of a broader rescue of Skopbank in 1991. Last year the bank cut its holding in the group from 88 per cent to 23.6 per cent through share sales to domestic and international investors.</p>

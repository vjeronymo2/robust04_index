			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Personal View: How to flatten the cycle's ups and downs We are barely out of the last recession and already the economic brakes are being applied. Businesses and households across Britain have good reason to feel worried. But these concerns will go beyond the extra burden yesterday's rate rise will place on family and investment budgets on top of this year's tax increases. More fundamental still is what the increase reveals about the long-term weaknesses of the British economy. It is here that the real political debate will be joined, not over whether each rise is in itself justified. The fact is that the government has failed to create the conditions necessary for sustained growth without accelerating inflation. These conditions are a strong and dynamic economic base, with the industrial capacity and skilled workforce necessary to cope with rising demand. Without them, slow growth, rising insecurity at work, high unemployment and increased social decay will persist. Of course, it is a matter of acute economic judgment whether yesterday's increase was necessary now in order to choke off inflationary pressures or could have been postponed until later. Recent economic statistics tell conflicting stories - weaknesses in the housing market but rising retail sales; stable retail price inflation but accelerating producer prices. What is clear, however, is that the Treasury and Bank of England, on the basis of published statistics and privileged information available to them, believe that rising inflationary pressures justify action now to slow the recovery. But why is inflation threatening to derail economic growth at such an early stage of the recovery? When Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, raised US interest rates at the beginning of this year, the US economy had been growing for three years and output had risen by 10 per cent. UK rates, already higher than in the US, Japan and Germany, have been forced up only two years from the bottom of the recession with output up just 5 per cent. Part of the problem is credibility. It must be worrying for the government that it has made so little progress over the past two years in persuading the public and the financial markets that it can keep inflation under control. The implied City forecast in the index-linked bond market is an inflation rate of more than 5 per cent by the end of the decade, a long way from the government's pledge of 2.5 per cent by the end of the current parliament. But the reason for this lack of credibility goes to the heart of Labour's critique of the Conservatives' economic mismanagement over the past 15 years. For the reason why neither the financial markets nor the Bank of England believe that the government will meet its inflation objectives is not simply that it has failed before, but that it continues to treat inflation as the disease, not the symptom, of a deeper economic malaise in the British economy. In short, the government's lack of credibility is not simply a question of competence but of analysis and understanding. For the root cause of Britain's economic failures is that our economic base is too small and backward to deliver the employment opportunities and sustained, non-inflationary growth we need - too few successful firms, not enough skilled workers, too little research into the development and use of new technologies. Tackling inflation is not simply about prudent monetary policy, important though that is. Instead, economic policymakers in Britain need to tackle what CBI director-general Howard Davies recently identified as 'crucial structural weakness' in the British economy - the deficiencies which mean we have high unemployment alongside rising skill shortages, and a recovery starved of new investment. What Britain needs is a modern industrial policy to build up our economic base - to encourage more long-term investment in industry, support small businesses and encourage the use of private finance in public infrastructure projects. It needs a tax system which encourages investment rather than tax evasion and promotes employment rather than unfairness. And it needs to boost the education and skills of British workers. Only then will the UK economy be able to deliver rising living standards and employment growth without running into an inflationary mire. No government can avoid completely the ups and downs of the business cycle. Our aim must be to minimise them and provide the conditions for stability and growth which will make stop-go economics a thing of the past and remove the spectre which now haunts this recovery.

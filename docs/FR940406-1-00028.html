The proposed amendment would permit the indemnification of eligible items from the United States while on exhibition in this country in connection with an exhibition of eligible items from outside of the United States. The proposed amendment is not intended to bring about a major shift in emphasis of the current policy or practice of the indemnity program. Specifically, exhibitions consisting solely of domestic items would continue to be ineligible for indemnification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice invites comments that will assist the Federal Council in more fully understanding the issues involved in such a change. The Federal Council particularly invites comments from groups, individuals, and other governmental agencies involved in the international exhibition process, including museums, private insurers, and professional and scholarly organizations. The revised rules will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and will be included in guideline packages for prospective applicants and in Certificates of Indemnity.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Statutory Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1975, the United States Congress enacted the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act which established an indemnity program administered by the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities (the ``Federal Council''). 20 U.S.C. section 273(c). The Federal Council is composed of the heads of nineteen federal agencies and was established by Congress, among other things, to coordinate the policies and operations of the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum Services, including the joint support of activities. 20 U.S.C. 972(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the indemnification program, the United States Government guarantees to pay loss or damage claims, subject to certain limitations, arising out of exhibitions containing items determined by the Federal Council to be of educational, cultural, historical or scientific value the exhibition of which must be certified by the Director of the United States Information Agency as being in the national interest. In order to be eligible for indemnification, the objects must be on exhibition in the United States, or if outside this country preferably as part of an exchange of exhibitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Council is the agency charged by Congress with the responsibility to administer the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act. In practice, the Indemnity Program is administered for the Federal Council by the Museum Program of the National Endowment for the Arts under the ``Indemnities Under the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act'' regulations (the ``Regulations''), which are set forth at 45 CFR part 1160.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These Regulations have been promulgated, and amended from time to time, by the Federal Council pursuant to the express and implied rulemaking authorities granted by Congress to make and amend rules needed for the effective administration of the indemnity program. Among other things, Congress expressly granted the Federal Council the authorities to establish the terms and conditions of indemnity agreements; to set application procedures; and to establish claim adjustment procedures. 20 U.S.C. sections 971(a)(2), 973(a), 975(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a number of years, the Federal Council has considered the desirability of amending the Regulations to permit the indemnification of U.S.-owned loans on exhibition in the United States in connection with certified international exhibitions. As currently drafted, the Regulations do not cover domestic objects on loan to an international exhibition in the United States. The Regulations provide, in pertinent part:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An indemnity agreement made under these regulations shall cover: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Eligible items from outside the United States while on exhibition in the United States or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Eligible items from the United States while on exhibition outside this country, preferably when they are part of an exchange of exhibitions. 45 CFR section 1160.1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 25, 1993, during a lengthy discussion of the application of the National Gallery of Art for the indemnification of the exhibition ``Great French Paintings from the Barnes Foundation: Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and Early Modern,'' the Federal Council extensively considered the question of whether the eligibility criteria set forth in the Regulations were more narrowly drawn than required under the Act. On a preliminary basis, the Federal Council concluded that they were. While the Council approved the indemnification of the Barnes exhibition, a Certificate of Indemnity ultimately did not issue because of legal uncertainities related to the Council's action under its current Regulations. To clarify eligibility issues for future actions, the Federal Council also voted to ``move with dispatch to amend its regulations.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 16, 1993, the Federal Council reaffirmed its vote of February 25, 1993 to amend the Regulations to permit the coverage of domestic items in connection with international exhibitions in the United States. Specifically, the Federal Council approved a motion to promulgate regulations revising 45 CFR part 1160.1 (``Purpose and Scope'') by adding the following language immediately following section 1160.1(a)(2): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (3) eligible items from the United States while on exhibition in the United States if the exhibition includes other eligible items from outside the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Statement of Views of the Federal Council  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since 1975, the Federal Council has approved indemnification for more than 500 exhibitions which have been viewed by millions of Americans in towns, cities and college campuses across the nation. Indemnification has facilitated both major international exhibitions and shows of more limited scale. More than 175 American museums have participated in the program, saving the organizers of the exhibitions nearly $70 million in commercial premiums. To date, the costs to the Federal government have been limited to the administrative costs of the program and the payment of two loss or damage claims totalling $104,700.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

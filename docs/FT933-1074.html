			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hopkinsons falls to Pounds 722,000 IN SPITE of a substantial contraction in interest charges, pre-tax profits at Hopkinsons Holdings, the industrial abrasives, plastic products and gas control equipment group, showed another sharp decline over the six months to July 31. According to Mr Bill Goodall, chairman, the outcome, as anticipated, was equal to the second half of the previous year at Pounds 722,000 (Pounds 1.34m). Although Carborundum Abrasives returned to profit, Bryan Donkin Engineering, still hit by uncertainty over the capital spending plans of British Gas, its biggest customer, suffered a further decline in orders. Activities in Germany continued to be affected by recession and the strong D-Mark, which placed further pressure on sales and margins. Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 51.7m (Pounds 51.3m); Mr Goodall said that the comparison was flattered by exchange rate movements which disguised a real decline of 6.5 per cent. Borrowings were reduced by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 11.4m by end-July and by a further Pounds 2.5m since then; gearing currently stands at 28 per cent (41 per cent). After a nil tax charge, reflecting German losses and the release of tax provisions, earnings per share emerged at 0.91p (0.89p). The interim dividend is 0.5p (0.9p) but Mr Goodall said the intention was to maintain the total at last year's 1.3p.</p>

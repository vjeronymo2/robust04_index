			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLAYING CHARGES AGAINST DEPUTY DROPPED;  </P> <P> NEW TESTS FAIL TO LINK HIS GUN TO MURDERS OF 3 L.A. PROSTITUTES  </P> <P> Murder charges were dismissed Monday against Rickey Ross, a veteran Los Angeles  County sheriff's narcotics investigator who had been accused of slaying three  South-Central prostitutes with his service handgun.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said original ballistics tests linking Ross to the slayings had  been proven wrong.  </P> <P> The reversal appeared to be a major embarrassment for the Los Angeles Police  Department, which had arrested Ross after its forensics tests purportedly  linked Ross' handgun to three in a series of unsolved prostitute slayings.  Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and Sheriff Sherman Block had stood together at a  press conference in February to announce the startling arrest, which they  described as a "devastating" blow to the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Elva R. Soper, acting on a prosecution request, formally  dismissed the three first-degree murder counts against Ross. He faced the death  penalty if convicted. Prosecutors said Ross remains a "suspect."  </P> <P> "The people hereby move to dismiss the complaint against Rickey Ross," Deputy  Dist. Atty. William Hodgman told the judge. "We so move because the LAPD  forensics experts have re-examined the evidence and no longer can be certain"  that Ross' gun fired the shots.  </P> <P> Ross, 40, an 18-year veteran of the department, was not in court when the  charges were dismissed. He broke down sobbing and repeatedly said "Praise the  Lord!" and "Thank God!" when told of his impending release, according to Don  Ingwersen, Ross' court-appointed investigator.  </P> <P> "Obviously," Ingwersen said, "he was in a state of shock. He was just  emotionally drained."  </P> <P> Later in the afternoon, Ross was released from Los Angeles County Jail where he  had been held for 81 days. He said nothing to a throng of reporters as he left  the jail and was driven away in a private automobile to join his wife at an  undetermined location.  </P> <P> Since his arrest, Ross has been dismissed from the department. Sheriff's  officials would not respond Monday when asked whether Ross would be reinstated.  </P> <P> Ross, who had built a virtually unblemished record as an undercover narcotics  investigator and who was described by friends and colleagues as a highly  religious man, had protested his innocence since his arrest.  </P> <P> In the aftermath of his highly publicized arrest, Ross' acquaintances had been  at a loss to explain his seeming transformation from Bible study leader to  accused murderer. Some had focused on apparent behavioral changes -- dropping  out of his Bible class, for example, and breaking off contact with some old  friends -- as they groped to understand his arrest.  </P> <P> Ross had been stopped in South-Central Los Angeles in the early morning of Feb.  23 on what was described as a routine traffic check. The deputy was seated next  to a prostitute and he drove erratically away from the curb as officers  approached the car, police said then.  </P> <P> At the time of his arrest, Gates said there was evidence that Ross and the  woman were smoking cocaine. No drugs, however, were found in his system.  </P> <P> Hodgman explained Monday that Ross' fingerprints were found on a Pepsi can that  had been used as a crack pipe and was tossed out of one of the car's windows.  No drug charges will be filed against Ross, he said..  </P> <P> Police found Ross' 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol in the trunk of his  county-owned undercover car.  </P> <P> The first firearms tests of the gun were performed by four Los Angeles police  experts, all of whom said there was a match -- a "make" -- between the gun  confiscated from Ross' car trunk and the three slugs and a shell casing found  at the murder sites of Judith Simpson, 27; Cynthia Walker, 35, and Latanya  Johnson, 24.  </P> <P> After the arrest, a Los Angeles police officer expressed total confidence to  news reporters that Ross was their man. "We wouldn't put an active-duty  sheriff's deputy in jail for homicide on an 'iffy make,' " he said.  </P> <P> But Monday, Hodgman said: "I think we can in all honesty say that is not the  gun."  </P> <P> Cmdr. William Booth, the Police Department's spokesman, said the agency intends  to continue to investigate Ross as a possible murder suspect and will continue  ballistic testing of the weapon recovered from Ross' trunk. The LAPD alone was  equivocal on the accuracy of its ballistics tests.  </P> <P> "The gun has not been ruled in with 100% certainty," Booth said, "and it hasn't  been ruled out with any degree of certainty."  </P> <P> While he would not concede that the LAPD had erred, Booth acknowledged that  officials had launched an internal administrative review to determine why the  department's experts had linked Ross' gun to the murders when examinations by  other experts could not.  </P> <P> "We all agree, all of experts agree now . . . that the original conclusions  should have been inconclusive," Booth said.  </P> <P> Subsequent firearms tests by defense expert Charles Morton of Oakland had  concluded that the slugs were not fired by Ross' weapon. Morton had been  retained by Ross' counsel, a routine step in capital cases.  </P> <P> Even as Morton was testing, the prosecutor and co-defense counsel Guy O'Brien  agreed to a third firearms examination. They selected Al Biasotti of the  California Department of Justice and John Murdock of the Contra Costa County  Sheriff's Department who, in Hodgman's words, are "among the best in the West."  </P> <P> Biasotti and Murdock spent 2 1/2 days last week conducting new ballistics  tests. Their conclusion: The three slugs were all fired from the same gun --  but not the one found in Ross' trunk.  </P> <P> "It broke the tie," Hodgman said.  </P> <P> On Friday afternoon, a meeting was held between prosecutors and co-defense  counsel Jay Jaffe, Los Angeles police firearms experts and investigators, where  the facts were laid out. Over the weekend, LAPD firearms experts re-conducted  their tests and backed off.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Never Killed Anyone'  </P> <P> On Saturday, Ross issued his first public statement from his jail cell,  declaring: "I have never killed anyone. . . . The gun found in the trunk of the  car was a gun purchased by me, registered to me, and used in the performance of  my duty as a deputy sheriff for over 15 years. Is it logical that if I were  killing people, I would use a gun registered to me?"  </P> <P> Ross said he put the gun in the car trunk after he was issued a new weapon and,  after several months, it became water damaged and rusted.  </P> <P> "By LAPD's own admission," Ross said, "the gun had to be forced open to be  test-fired."  </P> <P> Ross said he was elsewhere when the killings occurred. "My whereabouts can be  documented and testified to by witnesses," he wrote, but gave no specifics. He  did not say what he was doing with the prostitute when stopped Feb. 23.  </P> <P> Explaining why her husband was arrested in the company of a prostitute, Ross'  wife, Sylvia, said Monday: "That's his job. He works with prostitutes. He works  with everybody."  </P> <P> On Monday, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and some of his top lieutenants met with Los  Angeles police and their ballistics experts. The decision to dismiss the  charges, according to one participant in the meeting, was not unanimous.  </P> <P> "But it was agreed that we have no choice," the participant added.  </P> <P> Hodgman told reporters that Ross was "still a suspect." After all, he said,  Ross was "found in a kill zone with a 'strawberry' under suspicious  circumstances.  </P> <P> "Even now he's the only one (suspect), but it now becomes an open  investigation."  </P> <P> He conceded that further investigation "may very well result that we can  dismiss him as a suspect."  </P> <P> But he denied that the arrest was made too hastily.  </P> <P> "No, the arrest was proper," Hodgman said. "I don't think everyone moved too  quickly at all."  </P> <P> But, referring to Los Angeles Police Department ballistics, he added, "I think  they're going to re-evaluate their practices."  </P> <P> Ross' attorney had stern words on what the dismissal of charges meant.  </P> <P> "I have said in the past that the appearance of guilt and the fact of guilt are  two very different things," Jaffe said, "and what this teaches us is that you  can't rush to judgment on a limited set of facts.  </P> <P> "It's a good thing that the dismissal is coming now, rather than a year or  years down the road. You can just imagine if the defendant is convicted on this  type of evidence, not to mention if he was executed. What remedy would he  have?"  </P> <P> Prosecutors said all along that the gun was the key evidence against Ross.  There was no blood, saliva, semen or other bodily fluids tests linking Ross to  any of the victims.  </P> <P> Ross' arrest came amid a series of unsolved slayings in the area of as many as  a dozen "strawberries" -- women who trade sex for drugs -- since 1985.  </P> <P> "This has been a very sad day for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department,"  a grim-faced Block said at the time, standing beside Gates as the arrest was  announced to media.  </P> <P> Block was out of town Monday and not available for comment.  </P> <P> Reaction from some members of the Sheriff's Department who worked with Ross was  one of shock that the LAPD could have made such a key mistake in a case that  was so sensitive in terms of interdepartmental relations.  </P> <P> "It's tough to believe that this has happened," one department official said.  "I said from the beginning that I hoped they had their (act) together on this.  It's obvious they didn't."  </P> <P> The sheriff's official added, however, that he sees no permanent damage to  relations between the two departments.  </P> <P> "It just points out that human beings are human beings and mistakes can be  made," he said. "If this was an error, I'm confident it was in good faith.  Realistically, as policemen, these things happen from time to time."  </P> <P> Another senior sheriff's official, who also requested anonymity, said that the  LAPD's handling of the Ross case from the beginning will make the Sheriff's  Department reluctant to put its full trust in the LAPD in any similar case in  the future.  </P> <P> "They should do some internal investigation on this," the official said. "I  think there are 4,000 unanswered questions here. We were led to believe there  wasn't a shadow of a doubt in the world that those ballistics matched.  </P> <P> "There will be a feeling that we take enough heat already and that it's  terrible this had to happen from another police department. This is one of our  family. Nobody's perfect, but if you see any of our people accused again, you  can bet we will want our own experts in there, too."  </P> <P> Even the district attorney's office said it will undertake a review to make  sure the same problem does not arise again. Sterling E. Norris, the prosecutor  in charge of special trials, said the district attorney's office needs to  consider having "our own experts or contracted experts" to perform firearms  tests in the future.  </P> <P> "We're going to have to have an independent way to verify (firearms) results,"  he said.  </P> <P> The ballistics test conducted by Los Angeles police in the Ross case, Norris  said, "was an aberration we want to ensure doesn't happen again."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Edwin Chen, William Overend and Patt Morrison contributed  to this report.  </P></p>

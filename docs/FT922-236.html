			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Letter: A formula to quantify risk Sir, Mr Incledon (Letters, June 22) is right. Capital, and an acceptable return on it, are Lloyd's most urgent needs. The Council is understood to be proposing that, from 1993 onwards, a Name's liability be limited to 80 per cent of his/her premium allocation over a four-year period. Presumably, one result of this will be for each Name to demonstrate acceptable liquidity equal to at least his/her chosen liability limit. This will go a long way to restoring confidence, and delight the rating agencies. The council's proposal will mean that for the first time Names will be able to quantify their risk capital and, also for the first time, will be able to calculate their actual pre-tax rate of return on that capital. But if Lloyd's is to attract fresh capital, there will have to be at least the prospect of a venture capital rate of return. R J Barton, 108 Randolph Avenue, London W9 1PQ</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Corruption dogs Menem reforms: Slush funds and payoffs are still part of political life in Argentina ARGENTINA may be changing for the better as it enters its 10th year of civilian rule and its economic reforms continue to bear fruit. But an old problem remains; corruption. Last month, President Carlos Menem suffered a personal and political reverse when he sacked Mr Miguel Angel Vicco, his private secretary. Mr Vicco is a close friend whom the president had defended against accusations that his dairy company sold putrid powdered milk to the government at inflated prices. In the end, the media outcry became too great and Mr Vicco had to go. Over the past year Mr Menem has sacked 20 other top officials - including half his cabinet - as seven big corruption scandals rocked the government. Each case was uncovered by an increasingly aggressive press; hardly a day goes by without one of Argentina's four main newspapers publishing a report on government corruption. It is impossible to tell if corruption is worse than it was under previous governments, but it is certainly discussed more openly than before. Argentines have lost their fear of the state, and the press, which faces few controls, has found that investigative reporting boosts circulation. Most allegations involve officials who had demanded bribes or awarded suspiciously generous government contracts to favoured companies. Recent scandals have been particularly damaging as they harm the poor - ostensibly Mr Menem's political base. The powdered milk allegedly sold by Mr Vicco was meant for poor children, while another senior official was dismissed following accusations of corruption at a government health scheme for pensioners. Corruption is the government's main political weakness; opinion polls regularly find that it is among the main concerns of the people. Mr Menem invariably worsens the problem by first defending compromised officials only to sack them shortly after, giving the impression that he is more interested in limiting political damage than punishing offenders. He has been accused of surrounded himself with cronies steeped in the politics of intrigue, intimidation and patronage. Slush funds and payoffs have always played an important role in the underworld of Argentine politics, but the government has done nothing to crack down on political 'foundations' used to channel illicit funds to politicians. To his credit, however, Mr Menem does acknowledge that corruption exists - his predecessors merely turned a blind eye to the problem - and is attacking its roots by privatising state companies, slashing red tape and cutting back the civil service. A year ago Mr Menem announced a 'crusade' to rid the government of corruption. But his proposals languish in Congress, while others have proved ineffective or stillborn. And instead of spurning purged officials, some remain close to the president. Mr Menem has always said corruption should be investigated by the judiciary. However, it is riddled with political appointees, beginning with the Supreme Court where Mr Menem added five new justices in 1990, guaranteeing a government majority. Other nominally independent control agencies are also headed by sympathetic appointees. It often seems the press is Argentina's only active and independent watchdog. Mr Menem remains surprisingly immune to scandal. This is largely because Mr Domingo Cavallo, his economy minister, has delivered low inflation and economic growth, which has buoyed the government's popularity. But corruption could yet undermine the government's political standing. Mr Menem is gearing up to reform the constitution to allow re-election when his term ends in 1995. Voters support economic reform despite misgivings about corruption. However, as one western diplomat warned: 'If Menem does not fix corruption, it is going to drag him down.'</p>

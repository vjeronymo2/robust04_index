			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, May 20 (XINHUA) -- China and Singapore  today reaffirmed their pledge to ensure the smooth progress of  the Suzhou industrial park project aiming to promote economic  cooperation in the city of Suzhou in southern part of China.    Visiting Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Singapore  Deputy  Prime Minister Lee Hsieng Loong made the reaffirmation at the  inaugural meeting of the Joint Steering Council (JSC) of the  project, which was the first since China and Singapore signed  the agreement on the Suzhou industrial park project in Beijing  in February this year.    Under the agreement, the Suzhou Municipal Government and  Singapore agencies would jointly develop a modern industrial  park of 70 square kilometers at Suzhou. Singapore also agreed  to make its public administration "software" available to the  Suzhou project.    At today's JSC meeting, the two countries reaffirmed their  commitment to giving their "fullest support" to the Suzhou  industrial park project, the Singapore Ministry of Trade and  Industry said in a statement at the end of the JSC meeting.    "Both sides will spare no efforts to ensure the smooth  progress of the project," it said.    In his speech at the opening of the JSC meeting, Li Lanqing  said the cooperation between China and Singapore in jointly  developing the Suzhou industrial park is a matter of great  importance in the history of bilateral economic cooperation.    He proposed that the principle of equality and mutual  benefit, and sincere cooperation be the guideline in undertaking  the construction work of the Suzhou industrial park.    While expressing his satisfaction with the progress made in  the project so far, the Chinese vice premier said that so long  as the two sides proceed in the spirit of this principle, all  the difficulties that might appear in the process of the project  can be overcome.    Lee Hsieng Loong said the Suzhou project "is a major  collaborative project of our two countries".    "Singapore is fully committed to the Suzhou project. We will  spare no effort to ensure the success of the software transfer,"  he stressed.    "Given the goodwill and commitment which both sides have  demonstrated in embarking on this project, I am confident that  Suzhou industrial township will overcome all obstacles, and  fulfill the hopes which we have invested in it," Lee said.    According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the JSC  will  meet every year after this inaugural meeting. The next meeting  will be held in Suzhou in May 1995, to coincide with the  completion of the first factory in the initial 10 hectare  industrial park.</p>

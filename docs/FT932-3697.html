			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Pru and Halifax launch mortgages - At a glance Long-term fixed rate mortgages were launched this week by Prudential, the life company. The rate of 9.69 per cent can be fixed for a period of 25 years (10.2 APR), 20 years (10.1 APR) or 15 years (9.9 APR). The fixed rates are portable and are available on repayment, endowment and pension mortgages. The arrangement fee is Pounds 250 but there is no compulsion to buy insurance-related products. There is an early redemption penalty of 12 months gross interest. Halifax has issued a range of new fixed rates available on all types of mortgages, including a fixed rate for under 10 years (until January 31 2003) at 9.35 per cent (9.5 APR). The arrangement fee is Pounds 300, and there are early redemption penalties. The mortgages are portable after February 1994 and first time buyers have to buy insurance-related products.</p>

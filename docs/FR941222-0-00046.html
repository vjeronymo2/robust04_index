			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Gross-up of Intangibles_As noted above, FAS 109 could lead to a large increase (i.e., gross-up) in the reported amount of certain intangible assets, such as core deposit intangibles, which are deducted for purposes of computing regulatory capital. Commenters stated that the increased value of an intangible posed no risk to institutions, because a reduction in the value of the asset would effectively extinguish the related deferred tax liability. The Board concurs with this position and, consequently, will permit, for capital adequacy purposes, netting of deferred tax liabilities arising from this gross-up effect against related intangible assets. To ensure this benefit is not double counted, a deferred tax liability netted in this manner could not also be netted against deferred tax assets when determining the amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income. Netting will not be permitted against purchased mortgage servicing rights (PMSRs) and purchased credit card relationships (PCCRs), since only the portion of these assets that exceed specified capital limits are deducted for capital adequacy purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Leveraged Leases_While not expected to significantly affect many banking organizations, one commenter stated that future net tax liabilities related to leveraged leases acquired in a purchase business combination are included in the valuation of the leveraged lease and are not shown on the balance sheet as deferred tax liabilities. This artificially increases the amount of deferred tax assets for those institutions that acquire a leveraged lease portfolio. Thus, this commenter continued, the future taxes payable included in the valuation of a leveraged lease portfolio in a purchase business combination should be treated as a taxable temporary difference whose reversal would support the recognition of deferred tax assets, if applicable. The Board agrees with this commenter and, therefore, banking organizations may use the deferred tax liabilities that are embedded in the carrying value of a leveraged lease to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets subject to the capital limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tax Jurisdictions_Unlike the proposal, the final rule does not require an institution to determine its limitation on deferred tax assets on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. While such an approach may theoretically be more accurate, the Board does not believe the greater precision that would be achieved in mandating such an approach outweighs the complexities involved and its inherent cost to institutions. Thus, banking organizations may make projections of their taxable income on an organization-wide basis and use a combined tax rate for purposes of calculating the one-year limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timing_Institutions may use the future taxable income projections for their current fiscal year (adjusted for any significant changes that have occurred or are expected to occur) when applying the capital limit at an interim report date rather than preparing a new projection each quarter. Several commenters requested this treatment because it reduces the frequency with which banking organizations are required to revise their estimate of future taxable income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Available for Sale Securities_Under FASB Statement No. 115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities'' (FAS 115), ``available-for-sale'' securities are reported in regulatory reports at market value, and unrealized gains and losses on such securities are included, net of tax effects, in a separate component of stockholders equity. These tax effects may increase or decrease the amount of deferred tax assets an institution reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board has recently decided to exclude from regulatory capital the amount of net unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities (except net unrealized losses of available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values) (59 FR 63241, December 8, 1994). Thus, excluding for capital adequacy purposes deferred tax effects arising from reporting unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities is consistent with the regulatory capital treatment for such gains and losses. On the other hand, requiring the exclusion of such deferred tax effects would add significant complexity to the capital guidelines and in most cases would not have a significant impact on regulatory capital ratios.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, when determining the capital limit for deferred tax assets, the Board has decided to permit, but not require, institutions to adjust the reported amount of deferred tax assets for any deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from marking-to-market available-for-sale debt securities for regulatory reporting purposes. This choice will reduce implementation burden for institutions not wanting to contend with the complexity arising from such adjustments, while permitting those institutions that want to achieve greater precision to make such adjustments. Institutions must follow a consistent approach with respect to such adjustments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Separate Entity Method_The proposed capital limit was to be determined on a separate entity basis for each state member bank. Use of a separate entity approach on income tax sharing agreements (including intercompany tax payments and current and deferred taxes) is generally required by the Board's 1978 Policy Statement on Intercorporate Income Tax Accounting Transactions of Bank Holding Companies and State Member Banks, and similar policies are followed by the other banking agencies. Thus, any change to the separate entity approach for deferred tax assets would also need to consider changes to this policy statement, which is outside the scope of this rulemaking. The Board notes that regulatory reports of banks are generally required to be filed using a separate entity approach and consistency between the reports would be reduced if the Board permitted institutions to use other methods for calculating deferred tax assets in addition to a separate entity approach. Thus, while a number of the commenters suggested that the Board consider permitting other approaches, the Board will generally require the separate entity approach. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> State member banks should project taxable income for the bank, generally on a consolidated basis including subsidiaries of the bank. Bank holding companies should project taxable income for the holding company, generally on a consolidated basis including bank and non-bank subsidiaries of the holding company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed, the final rule contains an exception to the separate entity approach when a state member bank's parent holding company does not have the financial capability to reimburse the bank for tax benefits derived from the bank's carryback of net operating losses or tax credits. In these cases, the amount of carryback potential the bank may consider in calculating the capital limit on deferred tax assets is limited to the lesser amount which it could reasonably expect to have refunded by its parent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grandfathering_The proposal would grandfather any deferred tax assets reported as of September 1992 in excess of the proposed limit, but would require that such excess amounts be phased out over a two year period ending in 1994. Since all grandfathered amounts are now fully amortized, the Board's final rule does not include any grandfathering provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board does not believe that the adoption of this final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities (in this case, small banking organizations), in accordance with the spirit and purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). In this regard, the vast majority of small banking organizations currently have very limited amounts of net deferred tax assets, which are the subject of this proposal, as a component of their capital structures. In addition, this final rule, in combination with the adoption by the Board of FAS 109 for regulatory reporting purposes, allows many organizations to increase the amount of deferred tax assets they include in regulatory capital. Moreover, because the risk-based and leverage capital guidelines generally do not apply to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $150 million, this proposal will not affect such companies. The Board did not receive any comment letters specifically addressing regulatory flexibility concerns, and therefore, no alternatives to the proposal were considered to address regulatory flexibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Paperwork Reduction Act and Regulatory Burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board has determined that this final rule will not increase the regulatory paperwork burden of banking organizations pursuant to the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 302 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;325, 108 Stat. 2160) provides that the federal banking agencies must consider the administrative burdens and benefits of any new regulation that impose additional requirements on insured depository institutions. Section 302 also requires such a rule to take effect on the first day of the calendar quarter following final publication of the rule, unless the agency, for good cause, determines an earlier effective date is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

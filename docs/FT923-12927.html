			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei stays ahead despite late fall in bonds WHILE A late fall in bond prices prompted afternoon selling, the Nikkei managed to stay ahead on foreign and institutional buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index gained a net 52.29 at 17,116.92. It opened at the day's low of 17,092.13, and registered a high of 17,274.49 in the afternoon on the back of a higher futures market. Volume rose to 240m shares from 208m. Gains led declines by 533 to 347, with 215 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of all first section shares put on 4.69 to 1,298.84. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.86 to 1,026.43. Most traders have been heartened by the Nikkei's reluctance to fall below 17,000. Mr Nick Cant at Baring Securities said: 'One feature of the market is that it does not feel as if it wants to go down.' He added that foreign demand for leading blue chips and buying orders by domestic institutions at lower levels was providing underlying support. However, in the next few months traders do fear a spate of downward revisions for earnings forecasts for the first six months of the fiscal year. Meiji Milk Products was the day's most active issue, climbing Y22 to Y995. KOA, in electronics, advanced Y9 to Y933 on hopes of a rise in demand on the back of a US recovery. Other electronic parts makers also gained ground on the US recovery theme, with TEAC adding Y30 at Y991 and Advantest Y110 at Y2,490. Horiba, the leading maker of automotive emission analysers, surged Y260 to Y2,300 on reports that the US government intended to implement tighter rules on car emissions. Horiba has a dominant share in auto emission analysers in Japan and the US. Nippon Credit Bank receded Y150 to Y5,230. The bank has remained under small-lot selling pressure due to concern about troubled loans at its financial affiliates. Nippon Credit Bank denied reports of huge outstanding debt, and said restructuring of the companies was progressing smoothly. In Osaka, the OSE average appreciated 79.54 to 19,611.35 in volume of 14.6m shares. Roundup FIRMER markets in the US and Japan made a limited impression in the Pacific Basin region. Bangkok was closed for a holiday. AUSTRALIA was depressed about prospects for its own economy, and although golds went up on the higher bullion price, and banks bounced after a weak morning, the All Ordinaries index ended 2.1 easier at 1,636.7 in turnover of ADollars 254.3m. Among banks, ANZ gained 3 cents to ADollars 3.75 after falling to ADollars 3.66 earlier. However, St George slipped 10 cents to ADollars 5.95 on talk of a rights issue. One stock affected by expectations of slower earnings growth was Coca-Cola Amatil, which closed 3 cents down at ADollars 6.97, moving below ADollars 7 for the first time since March 1991. SINGAPORE saw bank and marine issues fall on poor sentiment and the liquidation of positions. The only bright spot was the listing of property company Liang Court Holdings, which finished 10 cents above the offer price of 70 cents after brisk volume. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 2.63 to 1,481.15 in volume of 70.61m shares, including 30.75m of Liang Court. KUALA LUMPUR encountered profit-taking and the composite index fell 5.58 to 612.36. Malaysia Public Finance, which was listed yesterday, closed at MDollars 2.24 against the issue price of MDollars 2. It was the day's most active stock with 13m shares traded. SEOUL went into reverse again after Tuesday's gains, with rumours of another financial scandal persisting. The composite stock index weakened 12.89 to 514.19. Turnover amounted to Won146.37bn. HONG KONG advanced as funds and retail investors switched to selected second-liners. The Hang Seng index closed 28.27 up at 6,125.46. Turnover eased to HKDollars 3.41bn from HKDollars 3.74bn. China-owned Hai Hong Holdings, which made its debut, closed at HKDollars 4.23 compared with an issue price of HKDollars 1.50. TAIWAN saw a technical rebound and the index ended 44.82, or 1 per cent, higher at 4,352.51. Turnover remained thin at TDollars 19.35bn. BOMBAY brokers resumed trading, ending a month-long boycott in protest against the seizure of shares in connection with a securities scandal. Share prices fell broadly, the BSE index finishing 167.62, or 5.5 per cent, down at 2,912.92. ACC lost Rp100 to Rp4,800.</p>

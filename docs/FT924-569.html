			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Company News: HK office sold with a 'unique contract' AMOY Properties' HKDollars 900m (USDollars 116.4m) purchase of Standard Chartered's headquarters in Hong Kong utilised a unique form of contract for the colony and underlined the company's belief in the long-term future of the colony, analysts said yesterday. Moreover, the price paid for the property indicated that property prices for prime locations in the colony were still rising, in spite of the current political row between China and the UK about Hong Kong's political development. Mr Charles Wheatman, a senior executive with Jones Lang Wootton, who advised Standard Chartered, said the price per square foot paid was well in excess of what other similar properties were selling for. Amoy, which is 54 per cent owned by Hang Lung, has bought from Standard Chartered the title to the property, but its right to occupy it has been deferred for 20 years. Five years ago, the property was developed by Nishimatsu, the Japanese property company. It acquired the right to let the property from the bank for 25 years. Nishimatsu then leased about 83 per cent of the space to the bank on a fixed rent which allows for periodic rent increases. Amoy has taken over the bank's lease and rental commitment to Nishimatsu, and leased back the space the bank needs but at market rents. Amoy's only income from the property is the difference between the market rent and the long-term rental agreement it has acquired. In 20 years' time, the whole property reverts to Amoy. Analysts said that the transaction was akin to Amoy buying a property future, or a zero coupon bond. As the company has bought ownership but not used it, an estimate had to be made of the property's future value and the rental income foregone. That value was then discounted to take account of risk and loss of income.</p>

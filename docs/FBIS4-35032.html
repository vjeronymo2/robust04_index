			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Patricio Gomez Couchot] </F>   [Text] Concepcion -- Under Secretary of Foreign Relations  Jose Miguel Insulza said Chile has a greater preference for  joining NAFTA due to several favorable reasons but the  government has not made an official decision yet on this issue.    He said: "I would say there is some preference, based on  public opinion and comments made by President Eduardo Frei, for  studying Chile's incorporation into NAFTA in greater detail but  we are not excluding a free trade agreement with the United  States."    He explained, however, that the government has not made any  decision and hopes to make it in the next few days. He added:  "For the time being our main decision is to be flexible, but we  are willing to study other alternatives to choose what is best  for the country."    Insulza admitted there is a majority opinion favorable to  NAFTA because it is a known agreement, its benefits can be  immediate for Chile, and it is made up of three countries (the  United States, Mexico, and Canada) and not just one. He said:  "The way labor and environmental issues are dealt with in NAFTA  seem satisfactory to us. In other words, there are favorable  good reasons. But we cannot fail to recognize that a free trade  agreement with the United States has some advantages because it  is more direct, immediate, and adjusted to our own situation."    He pointed out that the main disadvantage of a bilateral  trade agreement is that a new agreement must be negotiated  subject to conditions and reasons that are not well-defined. He  added: "The government has not made a decision but from the  opinions given by the majority of government officials one can  deduce that there is a preference for NAFTA."    Insulza gave a lecture to Eighth Region exporters that was  organized by the Regional Institute of Business Administration,  IRADE, and Prochile entitled: "Strategy for Internationalizing  Chile and Diplomacy for Development."    He said Chile will try to form a trade association or free  trade with Mercosur [Common Market of the South], "to put it in  simple terms," because it will open the markets of four  countries (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay) for us to  increase our exports. He added: "Argentina and Brazil currently  are our third- and fourth-largest trade partners, respectively,  and there is no reason why they could not be the first and  second due to the size of their markets and their closeness to  us."    Insulza noted that for Chile, a country with an open economy  and clear foreign trade rules, the ideal would be to have a  multilateral system with clear rules. He indicated that although  that system has not been achieved despite the progress made in  the Uruguay Round, preferential agreements with different  countries, regions, or groups of countries should be created.    He said Latin America and especially South America have  received large quantities of Chilean exports in the last few  years. He said Chile has balanced trade with Argentina of about  $1 billion with a surplus of $7 million favorable to Chile. He  added: "There is a relative balance with Uruguay, a slight  deficit with Paraguay, and a big deficit of about $600 million  with Brazil."    Insulza said this situation changes if one studies the  balance of services, which generally is not included in the  statistics; "if it were, Chile would have a surplus with those  countries."</p>

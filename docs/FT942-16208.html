			<p>940412 FT  12 APR 94 / Early move promised on coal sell-off The government will invite 'expressions of interest' in the sale of British Coal in the very near future, Lord Strathclyde, trade and industry minister, told the Lords yesterday. Peers gave a second reading to the coal industry bill, the privatisation measure already approved by the Commons. Lord Strathclyde said that private-sector management would provide fresh ideas and there would be opportunities for British Coal employees to make proposals for taking over the running of the industry. Lord Morris of Castle Morris, from the Labour front bench, was joined by other opposition peers in advocating an expanded role for the proposed Coal Authority. They suggested it should have wider responsibilities for dealing with subsidence as well as for licensing coal mining operations and granting interests in coal. Lord Ezra, the Liberal Democrat peer and a former chairman of the National Coal Board, said there must be some doubt over the effect of the fragmentation of the industry under privatisation. Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, yesterday ruled out government help for Tower colliery, British Coal's last deep mine in south Wales. He made clear he had no plans to intervene to save the mine, which is due to shut at the end of the week with the loss of nearly 300 jobs.</p>

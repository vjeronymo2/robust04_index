			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUNK-DRIVING ARRESTS INCREASE  </P> <P> I've never been more motivated to respond to an article as I was after reading  your front-page report on drunk driving arrests in Los Angeles over the past  year (Dec. 3). Enough is enough.  </P> <P> I suppose prohibition is next, but personally, I hope I'm not around to see it.  </P> <P> Instead of mothers, students and everyone else against drunk driving  self-proclaiming what progress they've made to get almost 29,000 people off the  streets this year, why don't they put some of that energy into creating ways to  assist people who nonmaliciously want a few drinks to get home? As a Westside  resident for 10 years, let's face it, public transportation stinks. I do drink  and drive because I choose not to be a prisoner in my apartment.  </P> <P> To have organizations and government brag about the fact that they got that  "alcoholic" secretary, mailman or grocery checker, who maybe had a bad day and  just had a couple of drinks -- who might have not had a drink in months -- into  an AA program, jail and fines far beyond their means just makes me sick. What  rehabilitation are we talking about here?  </P> <P> I, too, lost a close friend this year over a drunk-driving accident. Why not  make part of drunk-driving punishment for first offenders 30 days of driving  legally intoxicated people home instead of attending classes that they don't  need, paying fines they can't afford and causing anger and hardship where it  didn't exist? It's the season to help -- will someone?  </P> <P> PAMELA JOHNSON, Los Angeles  </P></p>

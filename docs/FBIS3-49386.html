			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava Jan 7 (CTK) -- The Slovak-Hungarian  border, confirmed in Trianon in 1920 for Czechoslovakia, was no  bargain for Slovakia, Slovak Transport Minister Roman Hofbauer  tells today's pro-Meciar REPUBLIKA, published by the Slovak  state-owned news agency TA SR. He adds that "it left the Slovak  settlement, whose demise we are witnessing, at the mercy of  Magyarisation."    In connection with Slovakia's south border, Hofbauer recalls  that according to the original Trianon proposal, a part of the  Hungarian territory had to be ceded to Slovakia. This did not  happen because of a fierce resistance by Hungary and  indifference of Czech representatives to the fate of Slovaks  living in the currently Hungarian Matra mountains, or the "lower  parts of the Slovak counties Novohrad, Gemer, Hont and Zemplin."    "The Masaryk-Benes -- Czechoslovak President Tomas Garrigue  Masaryk and Foreign Minister Edvard Benes -- concept sacrificed  the region in return for the questionable gain of Subcarpathian  Ruthenia," Hofbauer claims. He adds that Hungary, too, has not  been able to come to terms with the Trianon Treaty which is  proved by Hungarian politicians' statements on representation of  interests of "all" the Hungarians. "It is not essential whether  it has been Tisza, Kun, Horthy, Kadar or the current Hungarian  Government," Hofbauer says.    It was difficult to establish a precise dividing line  between  the lower (Hungary) and upper (Slovakia) part of the Hungarian  kingdom due to the political development in the consequence of  which the "population was strongly mixed" during the Turkish  threat and anti- Habsburg rebellions, believes Hofbauer, and  adds that there was no one to represent Slovakia during the  talks of the joint border commissions in 1918.    He compares the current demands by Hungarian minority  representatives to those by the Germans in the First Republic  (Czechoslovakia between 1918 and 1938) for the cultural,  educational, territorial and political autonomy going as far as  the right to homeland. He says that the pre-Munich political  leaders needed to justify by these demands their attitude in  front of the international public.    The foreign politicians of the time did not try to verify  whether this "loud cry" concealed anything more than calls by  suffering and humiliated minorities, says Hofbauer, and  indicates a similarity between the "therapists and peace-makers  Lord Halifax and Lord Runciman, of that time and the current  international negotiators in Bosnia and Herzegovina Cyrus Vance  and Lord Owen."</p>

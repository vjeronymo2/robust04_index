			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Observer: Southward ho All clear] South Africa's many fans in the UK business community can come out of the closet. British Invisibles, as the City's committee on invisible exports calls itself these days, is making its first official sales trip to the Republic next week. If BI - which has the backing of the Bank of England and the foreign office  -thinks it politically safe to go, then other business leaders no longer need to feel so embarrassed about thinking up an excuse for a business trip to the sun. Rodney Galpin, an old Bank of England hand although now chairman of Standard Chartered, is heading a team which will try and convince the South Africans to use London as their international gateway. BI is fielding a middling City side for its first official tour. Morgan Grenfell's Martin Kingston, could prove useful as Oliver Tambo's son-in-law. And Commerzbank's Gottfried Bruder will be expected to continue to boast about why London is so superior as a financial centre to Frankfurt, another old favourite of South African financiers. One surprise omission, given Warburg's strong links with Anglo-American, is that none of its players has been selected. But hardy veterans like Robert Guy, Rothschild's gold guru, can always be relied on to turn out at short notice.</p>

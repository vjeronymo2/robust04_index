			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO CO.: A PROUD LEGACY MARRED BY DISCORD  </P> <P> Long before the red tile roofs of Mission Viejo sprawled across southern Orange  County's foothills, the community took shape on a mass of blueprints and  photographs prepared by the fledgling Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> In those days, the company consisted of three executives, a bookkeeper and a  secretary, and it grew up with warm community support. But today, that support  is being tested as Mission Viejo grows more independent from the company that  built it.  </P> <P> Over the years, the company, which now boasts more than 300 employees, nurtured  its proud creation, sponsoring and sustaining various civic organizations that  helped govern local affairs.  </P> <P> "There was a real sense of working together to build this community," recalls  City Councilman Norman P. Murray, regarded by many as Mission Viejo's senior  statesman. "People pitched in, and the company took great pride in its work."  </P> <P> Murray, one of many Mission Viejo residents who laud the Mission Viejo Co. for  its architecture and management style, remains among the company's most loyal  defenders in Mission Viejo, but that has become a more controversial  proposition.  </P> <P> "The Mission Viejo Co. has tried to run this place like a company town," said  Milton Gerloff, president of Citizens Against Lake Mandatory Membership. "They  do what they think is best for us, no matter what we think."  </P> <P> Melody Carruth, who, as a leader of Citizens to Save Laguna Hills, has butted  heads with the Mission Viejo Co. and its representatives, is equally vehement:  "Most people in this area view the Mission Viejo Co. as a bunch of thugs," she  said. "It'd be great if the company would just stick to what it does best,  which is build beautiful homes."  </P> <P> And City Councilman Robert A. Curtis, probably the company's harshest critic  and the subject of a recall effort that it backs, is especially blunt: "The  Mission Viejo Co.'s whole approach is: You agree with them or you will be  destroyed."  </P> <P> The community is partly to blame for the rift between residents and the  company, as politicians like Curtis make hay blasting the Mission Viejo Co. As  the city enters its municipal adolescence, strife with the parent company may  be a natural expression of independence, company and city officials agree.  </P> <P> But critics say the company also shoulders much responsibility for the  breakdown in trust. Since its 1972 acquisition by New York-based Philip Morris  Cos., and particularly in the two years since Mission Viejo became a city, the  Mission Viejo Co. has become increasingly obstinate and remote, they say.  </P> <P> "I find it very strange," said Mayor Christian W. Keena, who offers glowing  praise of the company's work but remains puzzled by some of its recent actions.  "They've built this wonderful community, but they've really hurt their own  public image. . . . They've just decided not to be open."  </P> <P> Many of the company's image problems can be traced to some of its forays into  the public arena. In 1988, it backed a recall election in Laguna Beach --  though at first it denied its participation -- and recently the company has  pumped thousands of dollars into a Mission Viejo annexation fight and recall  election.  </P> <P> It has cast large numbers of proxy ballots to influence homeowners' association  races, backed lawsuits and petition drives, and dispatched highly paid  political consultants to contest measures it dislikes. In 1983, it even waged a  campaign against a group of store owners for displaying American flags. The  company considered them a form of advertising.  </P> <P> But the Mission Viejo Co., in that as in most other disputes, insists that its  main responsibility to property owners is to protect and complete the  community's master plan, devised in the early 1960s and only changed slightly  in the years since.  </P> <P> "We've made promises to this community that we would complete this community  according to the plan," said David A. Celestin, the company's vice president  for planning and governmental relations. "We have objected to efforts to change  that plan, and we will continue to."  </P> <P> But Celestin, in a wide-ranging interview last month, agreed that the past few  years have not always been smooth ones, at least in terms of the company's  relations with the local government.  </P> <P> "You're going to have people complaining anywhere, and, yes, we have some  here," he said. "We have the 'Nimbys' (Not in My Back Yard), and we have what I  call 'IGMs,' the 'I Got Mine's.' "  </P> <P> Much of the recent controversy dates from Curtis' efforts to annex a pie-shaped  piece of property on Mission Viejo's western border. That area, known as Aegean  Hills, is so closely affiliated with Mission Viejo that residents' addresses  say Mission Viejo and even the freeway exit fails to distinguish between the  communities.  </P> <P> In 1988, the City Council voted 5 to 0 to proceed with plans for annexing the  neighborhood, but company officials strongly objected, saying the annexation  would compromise the company's master plan.  </P> <P> The company helped support a petition drive opposing the annexation and urged  its employees to participate in the effort, a suggestion that stunned city  officials.  </P> <P> Eventually, the council reversed itself, voting 3 to 2 against the annexation.  Still, Curtis' persistence incurred the company's wrath, and it has spent more  than $57,000 to aid the recall campaign.  </P> <P> Curtis claims that the company backs his recall, which will be decided by a  Feb. 27 election, because he has supported slow-growth measures, but the  company denies that, saying it grows solely out of the annexation dispute.  </P> <P> For whichever reason, the company's actions strike some residents as heavy  paternalism and overkill.  </P> <P> "It's just ridiculous that they've reacted like this," said Virginia Lavan,  chairwoman of a group called Citizens Against Coercion by the Mission Viejo Co.  "All just because of a disagreement about annexation? They're trying to silence  someone who opposes them."  </P> <P> Celestin disagreed.  </P> <P> "We are not challenging the council's right to run its city," he said. "But we  think people have a right to be listened to, and as long as they exercise that  right, we'll be there to support them."  </P> <P> According to some observers, what has hurt the company's image more than its  recent political adventures, however, is its mechanism for dealing with the  public. James G. Gilleran, the company's president and chief executive officer,  rarely makes public comments, and local leaders complain that he is  unresponsive and difficult.  </P> <P> Gilleran is not the only company official who is elusive; normally, all press  and public questions are referred to Wendy Wetzel, the company's spokeswoman.  When Celestin agreed to be interviewed last month, Wetzel was openly surprised,  saying it was the first interview request in years that she could remember  having been approved.  </P> <P> "That's really a matter of corporate and personal style," Celestin said. "Jim  Gilleran wants to make sure that any information that is provided is accurate  and correct, so he wants to check all of it before it goes out."  </P> <P> But the reluctance of top company officials to deal openly with city leaders  and members of the public has taken a toll on the company's public image. It  shows up in contrast to the generally positive reputation enjoyed by the Santa  Margarita Co.  </P> <P> "The Mission Viejo Co.'s style is somewhat different from the Santa Margarita  Co., which tends to be very open and very pro-information," Keena said. "That  makes a big difference in the way they are perceived."  </P> <P> At Santa Margarita, President and Chief Executive Officer Anthony R. Moiso  often speaks publicly, dedicating local projects, answering press questions and  meeting with local leaders.  </P> <P> Moiso, a former executive vice president of the Mission Viejo Co., was  reluctant to comment on the differences between the two organizations.  </P> <P> Still, Moiso and other observers suggest that public image may matter less to  the Mission Viejo Co. now that its time in the city is drawing to a close.  </P> <P> "We're going to be here forever," Moiso said, pointing to a set of wall maps  that outline his company's development plans for South County. "They're just  winding down."  </P> <P> As critics bridle at the Mission Viejo Co., many blame its problems on Philip  Morris, a Fortune 500 company best known as a cigarette maker. Under Philip  Morris, the Mission Viejo Co. has lost its local identity, critics say.  </P> <P> That has become a rallying cry of Councilman Curtis' anti-recall campaign.  Curtis almost never refers to the Mission Viejo Co. by that name, instead  directing his barbs higher up the corporate ladder, at Philip Morris. It is a  technique that sets Curtis up as the David against a New York-based Goliath,  and it appears to resonate in a community that prides itself on its insularity.  </P> <P> The recall, Curtis said, as he does frequently, "is an attempt by Philip Morris  to dictate the affairs of this city."  </P> <P> Repeated calls to the Philip Morris Cos.' New York headquarters were not  returned or were referred to the Mission Viejo Co. Although two Philip Morris  officials, as well as two former officials, agreed to discuss the company's  relationship with the Mission Viejo Co., they would not allow their names to be  used.  </P> <P> Those officials and others, however, said that Philip Morris probably exercises  little direct control over the Mission Viejo Co.'s operations. Moiso, who  worked closely with Philip Morris during its takeover of the Mission Viejo Co.,  said he doubts that Philip Morris would meddle deeply in local affairs.  </P> <P> "They're very decentralized and very well-managed," one former Philip Morris  executive said of the New York company. "If anything, I would attribute the  problems in Mission Viejo to their getting too little direction from New York,  not too much. It sounds to me like a case of the extremities getting further  and further from the heart."  </P> <P> In addition, some local leaders, including Keena and Curtis, believe that  Philip Morris is divesting itself of its real estate operations. In the  process, Curtis and others say, the company may be rushing to make quick  profits at the expense of the community.  </P> <P> Wetzel and Celestin would not respond directly to questions about whether the  company is quitting the real estate business other than to say that such  questions are "always under review."  </P> <P> What is clear, however, is that the company's run inside Mission Viejo is just  about over. By the mid-1990s, Mission Viejo's last home will have been built  and sold, and the company that built the town will have turned over its  management to the council that now governs it.  </P> <P> For the company, then, the recent travails come just as officials would like to  bow out of Mission Viejo gracefully. And despite more than two decades of  closely parenting Mission Viejo, they threaten to mar the company's legacy with  discord.  </P> <P> Even so, Celestin gives no hint that recent events have unduly alarmed company  leaders.  </P> <P> "We're proud of this community," he said. "It's a place. You can see it, you  can feel it, you can smell it. We plan to leave it the way we set out to. We're  going to complete the plan."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A BRIEF HISTORY OF MISSION VIEJO  </P> <P> Key dates in the history of Mission Viejo and the Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> November, 1963 -- Mission Viejo Co. formed to initiate residential development  on 10,000 acres of South Orange County.  </P> <P> November, 1965 -- First homes in Mission Viejo are offered for sale.

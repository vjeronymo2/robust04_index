			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Enrique Maza] </F>   [Text] The year was 1972. In Chilon, a Tzeltal area, the  Morales Elizalde brothers, Mardonio and Ignacio, were  enthusiastically translating the Bible into Tzeltal. They wanted  to translate Exodus before any other book. Ignacio would say: It  talks about the escape from Egypt, the move from servitude to  freedom, the rebellion of the slaves, and their emancipation. It  talks about the quest for the promised land. And they translated  the Book of the Jewish Exodus.    In 1987, in the heart of the Lacandon Forest, Tzeltales,  Tzotziles, Choles, Tojolabales, and mestizos from 117 ejidos and  24 small villages gathered together in a multiethnic  organization with its own unique identity. It was the exodus of  the Mayas in search of the promised land, a new land, and a new  life.    Las Canadas is a portion of the jungle in which the Union of  Unions established itself in the late 1980's. It was formed by  some 6,000 families living on ejidos and in small villages in  the ravines, valleys, and plateaus of the eastern mountain range  in the state of Chiapas. Ninety percent of its members had been  peons on the corn, cane, ranching, and coffee estates in the  municipality of Ocosingo. The other 10 percent are Indians from  the north and Highlands of Chiapas.    The permanently resident rural estate peons left the estates  and headed for the Desierto de la Soledad. It was the start of  the exodus in the 1930's, a steady march that intensified in the  1960's and lasted into the 1980's. They populated the jungle and  organized in it.    Researcher Xochitl Leyva Solano has studied this exodus and  its causes in a book the first version of which was presented as  a paper at the Second International Mayanist Congress, which the  Center for Mayan Studies and the Yucatan Institute of Culture  organized in Merida in August 1992. A later version is  summarized here.    The sense of community among the Indians is born mainly of  two social practices: one that is pastoral and the other that is  political and ideological. Pastoral activities were promoted in  the jungle, drawing their inspiration from the major Church  events of the 1960's, particularly the Second Vatican Council in  the early part and the Medellin Bishops Conference towards its  end, as well as liberation theology.    The political and ideological action was conducted by  political factions and groups that emerged after the 1968  student movement, which went beyond partisan and electoral  political activity with the idea of going to the people and  helping them. Many of their members were from the urban middle  class. They were social workers who joined the social struggles,  spurred the rise of independent peasant movements, or  established themselves in the guerrilla movements in Guerrero,  Chihuahua, and Sonora. In the cities of Monterrey, Durango,  Torreon, and Chihuahua they helped organize the working-class  colonias and urban social movements. They were groups like Union  of the People (UP), Popular Line (PP), and the Guiding  Ideological Organization (OID).  <H5>  The Religious Community </H5>   Pastoral action stemmed from the urgent need to create an  identity and a sense of community, of belonging. First among the  larger group, the poor, and then among a more specific group,  "those of us who constitute a community," the collection of men  and women who live in the same colonia and share an activism, a  creed, a system of office-holding, a territory, a history, roots.    Liberation theology led them to analyze the real world, as a  starting point, and to discover that "man has been crushed and  dispossessed," and to demand that he be liberated from such  oppression in today's world, in accordance with the Gospel of  Saint Luke: "The Lord has sent me to announce the good news to  the captive and to liberate all the oppressed." Hence the  commitment to transform today's world, in which the poor are  victims "of structural domination," in the words of Bishop  Samuel Ruiz: "If we follow the option of the Gospel, we have to  dismantle the structures that foster domination."    The permanently resident rural estate peons and the peons  who  emigrated into the jungle echoed this assertion and emphasized  the social and ethnic distinction between them and their bosses.  They were also able to identify with other Chiapas Indians with  whom they had common problems: the Choles, Tzeltales, Tzotziles,  and Tojolabales, as was made evident at the Indian Congress of  1974 in San Cristobal de las Casas, where four shared problems  were identified: land, trade, health care, and education. The  congress had been a government initiative, but it wound up as a  place where the Indians of Chiapas came together.    Liberation theology was the escape hatch from a past of  "oppression and misery" on the estates. In the new colonias in  the jungle they had to break drastically with the past and opt  for a liberating alternative. They saw their days on the estates  as an era of serfdom and poverty, toil and cruel masters. Hence  the peasant war and liberation. In the pastoral action of the  diocese they found the language and inspiration they needed to  struggle against this past and rebuild their identity.    Liberation theology was complemented by the text of the  Bible, especially the Book of Exodus: "The communities in the  jungle were living their exodus." This is the book that tells of  the rebellion of the Jewish slaves in Egypt and their exodus  through the desert until they found a land on which they could  settle and live, "the promised land." God ordered them to leave.  From 1972 to 1974 the Book of Exodus was translated into  Tzeltal, and there were discussions in the communities about  freedom, faith, hope, and love. At first the missionaries  summarized the material. Later, Indian catechizers did the  writing. The lessons were then compiled in a catechism entitled  "We Are Seeking Liberty" in the Tzeltal language. It draws an  analogy between the migration into the jungle and the Jewish  exodus. The sense of "we" thus emerged.    The catechism: "The Lord said to the Israelites when they  were living as slaves: `I have seen the miserable state of my  people. And now the cry of the sons of Israel has come to me. I  mean to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians and bring  them up out of that land to a land rich and broad where milk and  honey flow.' God wants us to depart for freedom like the Jewish  people of old, who lived in the lands of another people, called  Egypt. The land did not belong to them; they worked as slaves  and suffered much hardship. Then God spoke to the heart of one  of the leaders: `I have seen the miserable state of my people, I  have heard their appeal to be free of their slave-drivers. I  have come to free you from your suffering and I am going to  bring you to a better land.' And God said to Moses: `I order you  to bring my people out of Egypt.'"    "God wants us to leave everything that crushes us. The word  of God tells us that as a community we must leave to seek  freedom. If we seek betterment and freedom, God will be with us.  When the Israelites lived as slaves, they had to leave and fight  for their freedom. When our forebears lived as servants, they  too had to struggle together to win their lands. They were men  of great faith. True freedom has not come yet. We must gather  strength in our hearts and struggle and suffer much yet. We must  fight against poverty, hunger, and injustice" (Exodus 3:7-12;  Catechism 28, 51, 78, 106).    Expectations of a "new life" in the "promised land" in the  jungle had been created. Saint Paul, in his letter to the  Ephesians, speaks of the "new man." The Tzeltal catechism echoes  him: "The new man is not a man alone, but rather a community  man, united with all his brothers by the Spirit. Together we  have a single thought, a single job, a single heart with one and  the same Hope (Catechism 114)."    A reaffirmation of life in the community was needed in the  search for an identity and new methods of organization. These  reflections focused on issues such as the land and food, God's  law and man's law, a given way of life (culture), the need for  collective work, and shared decision-making. "Thought" is an  individual's greatest strength and leads to action, "praxis."  Indian culture was reaffirmed.    The residents of a colonia, meeting in a plenary session,  issued regulations governing all spheres of life in society.  "Through all that we do as a community we form a single heart in  Christ. The work and love of the community is what brings us to  freedom. The community is something that we must build day by  day" (Catechism 30, 83, 101).    It was revolutionary to assert that social power was to be  found in the thoughts of pioneer Indians. The catechizing  process was a threat to the status quo. All were encouraged to  become involved. What was needed was to express one's thoughts,  to speak out, to read the word of God, to sing, to debate at the  assemblies, to come out for or against resolutions, to erase the  differences between ethnic and linguistic groups, to share a  utopia: building the kingdom of God on earth, which guided work  and life every day. Pastoral activities were eminently political  because they threatened the dominant power structure.  <H5>  The Political Community </H5>   After the 1968 movement, a group of professors, students,  and  workers began waging a different struggle, whose watchword was  "Let the people decide for themselves." They had "to integrate  into the struggles of the working people, place themselves in  service to the people, and help them organize and become more  aware, so that they could carry forward their struggles." Live  with the masses, stand by them in their daily struggle, and give  them resources that will help them confront the "bourgeois,  exploitative" enemy.    Activists from the Union of the People began arriving in the  jungle in 1976 to work with the Catholics, pioneers, and colonia  residents for whom the religious groups no longer sufficed to  meet their demands for land, services, and infrastructure. Two  years later the "northerners," activists from Popular Line,  arrived. UP and PP were absorbed by a larger group, the OID. The  organization that had called the Indian Congress reached its  limit in 1977 and gave way to new political groups: PP, CNPA  [National Coordinating Board for the Ayala Plan], CIOAC  [Independent Federation of Agricultural Workers and Peasants],  OCEZ [Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization], PST [Socialist  Workers Party], and others, which offered viable alternatives in  the face of the new realities.    Proletarian Line (LP) arrived in Chiapas in 1978. In the  Lacandon Forest it worked with Quiptic (the union of ejidos),  with Land and Liberty, and with Peasant Struggle; in Simojovel,  Tila, Sabanilla, Huitiupan, and El Bosque, with the ejidos and  peons from the regional organization; in La Fraylesca, with the  ejidos that had made up the 10 April Peasant Alliance; in  Venustiano Carranza and Villas las Rosas, with the Indian  community members. It teamed up with students, colonia  residents, and workers. In 1979 it joined the struggle of  Chiapas teachers. Some authors and analysts blame the LP for the  destruction of the regional processes and the disintegration of  influential peasant cadres.    Proletarian Line and Mass Line (LM), which were the  ideological lifeblood of many political advisers swarming about  the jungle, emerged as the result of a split with Popular Line  over theoretical and tactical disagreements, mainly with regard  to the relations that ought to exist between the rank and file  and the leadership. There were also "fundamental disagreements"  in the OID.    The political structure superimposed itself on the religious  structure, and in spite of serious differences Line reinforced  and invigorated the sense of community and the broader methods  of organization, such as the unions of ejidos. Line started from  the "deeply felt needs of the working people" and defended the  idea of joining with the working class, of having the workers,  peasants, colonia residents, students, small businessmen, shop  clerks, and professionals march together. The Indians living in  the jungle were being brought into a movement that went beyond  the local level.    A 1979 Line Document says: "We must take part in and lead  the  struggles of the peasants for land, credit, etc., the struggles  of the workers for higher wages, better benefits, against  corrupt union bosses, etc., the struggles of the students for  better teachers, to democratize education, for school buildings,  for scholarships, etc., and the struggles of all social groups  and the people in general for better living conditions."    The slogan "of the masses, by the masses, for the masses"  meant the involvement of all, the expression of ideas,  decision-making, promoting organization. "The people as a whole  must take part in decision-making. Such participation means  discussing several ideas. A pure struggle of ideas does not help  the people; it is an exercise for bourgeois intellectuals. After  discussions, decisions must be made. Resolutions and decisions  chart the course. Making decisions is a political practice that  unites comrades. We must have the broadest democracy, which  means the wide-ranging input of ideas and opinions. Based on the  people's most deeply felt demands, mass organizations must be  formed." It also had its own utopia: a society free of  exploiters and exploited.    The two movements, political and religious, ran parallel.  The  political groups came later, entrenching themselves in the  religious movement and giving it a political bent. They both  promoted community life and involvement; they established  regulations, systems of office-holding, and commissions; they  called for radical change spurred by the poor, and shared a  utopia: the struggle here and now for a just, egalitarian  society.    They had their differences, though. As far as the political  leaders were concerned, the process was "guided." To the  theologians, the process was "accompanied." The key point to the  theologians was to revitalize Indian culture. As far as the  political leaders were concerned, the revolutionary subjects  were the proletariat, dispossessed peasants, and the working  class. The mutual accusations were ongoing and obvious. Their  differences of opinion reached the point that the Indians in the  jungle expelled the northerners in the late 1970's.  <H5>  The Agrarian Conflict </H5>   Various timber companies had developed the Lacandon Forest  last century. Later, the lands there were sold off, subdivided,  or designated as national property. Some years into this  century, great forest estates coexisted with great cattle  estates, which the Indians called "fincas." As they moved into  the jungle, the Indians of the exodus harmed powerful interests,  including those of the government.    It was Luis Echeverria who decreed that communal assets be  returned. Some 60 Lacandon families and some 30 colonias of  Mayan Indians, comprising about 4,000 families in all, the  Indians of the exodus, lived in the jungle. In a presidential  decree Echeverria "returned" the entire Lacandon Forest, 614,321  hectares, to the Lacandon Indians, ignoring the Mayas. The  president spoke of restitution to the "rightful owners."  Historians have proven that there is no continuous link between  the Lacandons of history and today's Lacandons. The Tzeltales,  Tzotziles, and Choles were excluded and legally expelled in 1972.    Hiding behind the presidential decree were business and  timber interests, especially the National Finance Company  (Nafinsa), which through the Lacandon Forestry Company, S.A.  (Cofolasa) wanted to haul off the mahogany and cedar. No sooner  had the jungle been deeded over to the Lacandons than Cofolasa  signed a contract with them for some 35,000 cubic meters a year  of timber (around 10,000 trees a year) over a 10-year period  without a set price.    The government said that the Mayas had to be relocated in  order "to preserve the forest." Some 20 colonias agreed to a  relocation, thanks to the president's promise that they would  have secure land tenure, utilities, and infrastructure; he never  kept his promise.    Echeverria's decree was published in 1972. There was a  pressing need to crowd them together again. Moves against the  Mayas were not long in coming. The Indian assemblies, the  discussions, and the decision-making then followed. They decided  to reject relocation. This was the rallying point around which  Quiptic, the Union of Ejidos, and the Union of Unions were  formed and took action. The entire organizational structure that  had been tried out day after day for such a long time was taking  action and it grew strong in defense of the new land, which  represented a new life, both of which had been shattered by  presidential decree.    A new identity had been born. The Indians' experience of  religion and politics charted the course for the agrarian  struggle that was waged in the 1970's and 1980's. The Indian  Congress had set the process in motion in October 1974, and it  culminated in January 1994 with the armed uprising.</p>

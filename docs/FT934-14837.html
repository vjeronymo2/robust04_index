			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ciba sales rise 8.3% to SFr5.2bn in third term CIBA, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, reported an 8.3 per cent upturn in sales in the third quarter to SFr5.2bn (Dollars 3.7bn), and reiterated its forecast of an increase in net income for the full year. Sales in all three divisions grew in the third quarter, in contrast to the generally flat and lower trends in the first half. Part of the gains came from the appreciation of foreign currencies, especially the US dollar, against the Swiss franc. The healthcare division, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of group turnover, reported a 13.9 per cent rise in sales in the quarter, to SFr6.7bn. Sales in the relatively small diagnostics and vision businesses were ahead by 44 per cent and and 26 per cent respectively. The core pharmaceutical business lifted sales 8.6 per cent to SFr1.6bn as the effects of the US introduction last year of the Habitrol patch to help people stop smoking waned. Sales in the agricultural chemical division advanced 10.1 per cent to SFr839m, fulfilling the group's expectations of a stronger second half in the US and in the southern hemisphere. The industrial businesses - mainly dyes, additives, pigments and polymers - also recovered, with sales up 2 per cent in the quarter to SFr2.1bn. For the nine months, group sales were flat at SFr17.1bn.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: CORN SYRUP AS A HONEY SUBSTITUTE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I was getting ready to bake a dessert when I realized I didn't  have the honey that the recipe called for. It happened that a friend was  visiting and she told me I could substitute corn syrup for honey or granulated  sugar. I didn't argue with her but it didn't seem right. Can you actually make  this substitution?  </P> <P>  -- CONFUSED BAKER, Casper, Wyo.  </P> <P> DEAR CONFUSED: Generally, corn syrup can be substituted for honey in most  recipes. When using corn syrup, remember that it isn't as sweet as the honey  and that the dessert in turn will not be as sweet.  </P> <P> When substitutions are made, the texture and flavor of recipes will be slightly  altered.  </P> <P> You cannot substitute corn syrup for granulated sugar. With one being a liquid  and the other a dry ingredient, it's difficult to adjust the ingredients in the  recipe so that it would come out correctly.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I love popcorn and pop it in the evenings to take to work the  next day to snack on. I put it in a large resealable plastic bag. I cut a small  hole in the corner of the bag, give the bag a good shake and all the unpopped  kernels come out of the hole.  </P> <P> Now when I grab a handful of popcorn I don't worry about the loose kernels  breaking one of my teeth.  </P> <P>  -- OLIVIA, Red Bank, N.J.  </P> <P> DEAR READERS: I have received many requests for the ingredients I use in my  coffee ole, so I thought I would pass it along.  </P> <P> Make a regular cup of coffee, add a little extra skim milk and a tablespoon of  powdered skim milk. Add sugar (I use artificial sweetener) to taste. Put this  mixture in the blender and blend until it is foamy.  </P> <P> Make sure that the coffee mug is microwaveable and place it in the microwave on  Warm for just a couple of seconds. This gives the coffee a wonderful new taste.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: At one time I read a hint that said you could ripen avocados in  the microwave. Is this possible?  </P> <P>  -- EVELYN, Cedar Rapids, Iowa  </P> <P> DEAR EVELYN: The hint that we printed said to poke several holes in an avocado  and place it in the microwave on MEDIUM heat (50%) for about two minutes.  </P> <P> However, after further testing of this hint, we found it didn't work every  time. It did help some of the avocados, while others were soft but still tasted  unripe. You might want to give it a try to see how your avocado comes out.  </P> <P> You can also put an unripe avocado in a brown paper bag and fold over the top  to close and put in a warm place. (The top of the refrigerator is good.) It  should be ripe in two to three days.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: During hectic mornings, everything used to stop while my husband  and I searched for the correct change for our child's lunch, bus or milk money.  </P> <P> Now we keep a bowl by the door. When we have change we drop it in the bowl.  This way the children have change for whatever reason and mornings are a little  bit easier.  </P> <P>  -- KATHY, Bangor, Me.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Is there a substitute for powdered sugar? It seems that whenever  I need some I never have it. I hate going to the grocery store for only one  item.  </P> <P>  -- JENNIE, El Paso, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR JENNIE: After speaking with our local home economist, the following is the  substitution we found to work best.  </P> <P> You will need one cup of granulated sugar and one tablespoon of cornstarch.  Place this in a blender on high speed for several minutes. It will be powdery  and ready for use.  </P> <P> As with most substitutes, the consistency and texture of the dish may be  altered slightly.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have seen several pet peeves in your column and thought I would  share mine with you: when merchants affix difficult-to-remove price stickers  directly to the merchandise or directly over the instructions on the  merchandise.  </P> <P> I spend hours trying to get these off, and it really burns me up.  </P> <P>  -- READER, Chicago  </P> <P> DEAR READER: This is one of my peeves too. I have this problem when I am  looking at a package and want to read the ingredients or the calorie count and  the sticker is covering it.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P>  Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio,  Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints  received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.  </P> <P> </P></p>

It made comprehensive arrangements for the  province's 1994 propaganda and ideological work. After this  conference, all comrades should arrange next year's propaganda  and ideological work well in line with the guidelines of this  conference and the specific conditions of all localities and  departments.    The propaganda and ideological fronts have always been very  important because a very important advantage of our party is its  ability to mobilize and organize the masses through propaganda  and press work. Without this work, our party will have no  advantage, and neither will our political work. This was true  in the revolutionary period and will still be true when the  party's work focus is shifted to economic construction. At no  times should we neglect the party's propaganda and press work.  Propaganda and press work is needed in our efforts to arm the  entire party and the masses with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong  Thought, especially with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Propaganda and  press work should also be in the lead in our endeavor to  implement the party's line, principles, and policies.  Conditions are continuously changing in the socialist  undertakings we are developing, and we are always faced with the  issue of how to correctly understand the changes. This also  requires that we use propaganda and press work to guide the  masses to correctly understand the objective things and unify  their thinking. In short, we should have correct ideology as  the guide and do a good job in propaganda and press work if we  are to make all our work successful. Therefore, propaganda and  press work and ideological and political work are very important  at all times. It represents the party's trust and is very  glorious for you, comrades, to engage in the work. Our province  has done a very good and effective job in propaganda and  ideological work. It has provided the entire country with many  good experiences in deepening reform, opening wider to the  outside world, and developing economic construction. This has  been done through propaganda and ideological work and,  therefore, embodies the painstaking efforts of our propaganda  and ideological workers. On behalf of the provincial party  committee, I will extend thanks to comrades on the propaganda  and ideological fronts.    Now, I will speak on some views on how to make Liaoning's  propaganda and ideological work even better.    First, to make propaganda and press work successful, a very  important issue is the need to always adhere to the party's  basic line to promote economic construction and other work.  Currently, an important task for us is to comprehensively  publicize and implement the guidelines of the third plenary  session of the 14th party Central Committee. In particular, we  should give priority to key areas according to Liaoning's  reality. The ninth plenary session of the seventh provincial  party committee approved the "opinions" on implementing the  guidelines of the third plenary session. The "opinions" concern  the general demand on Liaoning's implementation of the  guidelines of the third plenary session, the guiding thoughts we  should adhere to, and other work, especially the work closely  related to the market economy, such as how to enter the market  economy by deepening reform and opening wider to the outside  world. Therefore, we should successfully implement the  guidelines of the ninth plenary session of the seventh  provincial party committee, with the focus on the "decision" of  the third plenary session.    Second, to make propaganda and press work successful, we  should have the ability to give priority to key aspects. What  are Liaoning's key aspects? The ninth plenary session of the  seventh provincial party committee held that priority should be  given to the following three aspects: 1) The modern enterprise  system should be popularized in state-owned large and  medium-sized enterprises. The modern enterprise system  represents the direction of the in-depth enterprise reform and  the basic way to invigorate state-owned enterprises. Whether  state-owned enterprises can be invigorated and enhance their  strength as soon as possible is an issue determining whether the  mainstay of the socialist market economy can be strengthened.  When large and medium-sized enterprises lack strength, the  mainstay of the market economy cannot take shape, and it will be  difficult to establish the socialist market economy system.  Therefore, we should have a sense of urgency and never take a  wait and see attitude toward invigorating large and medium-sized  enterprises. Comrade Xiaoping said that we should have the  courage to experiment and blaze new trails for endeavors whose  worth we are certain. Many years of reform and past experience  show that the modern enterprise system should be popularized if  state- owned large and medium-sized enterprises are to be  invigorated. State-owned enterprises will have been truly pushed  to the market when the modern enterprise system is popularized.  Therefore, an issue we should study with great effort is how to  implement to the letter the modern enterprise system in line  with the reality of enterprises. Enterprises are currently  faced with problems and difficulties in many areas. It should  be easier to popularize the modern enterprise system in good and  fairly good enterprises, and this will also provide very good  experiences to difficult and fairly difficult enterprises. 2)  We should deepen the rural reform and, on the premise that the  responsibility system that has the household- based and  output-related contract as the major form and the dual-  management system that combines unified management with the  persistent institution of independent management, actively  develop high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficiency  agriculture. We should properly facilitate intensive management  and management of scale, greatly develop township enterprises,  establish rural socialized service system more rapidly, and  speed up construction of small cities and towns. Aiming at  increasing peasants' income, we should accelerate the  development of various rural undertakings so that rural  commodities can all enter the market. Township enterprise  development, in particular, plays a leading role in increasing  the rural per capita income, shifting the rural surplus labor  forces, promoting intensive management and management of scale,  and effecting a change in the outlook of the entire rural area.  Therefore, we should give priority to great development of  township enterprises when carrying out rural work. 3) We should  speed up establishment of the market system. Judging from the  current conditions in establishing the market system, the  markets for means of subsistence, consumer goods, and tangible  materials have been built more rapidly, the markets for means of  production, essential elements of production, and intangible  materials have been built slowly, and futures markets have been  built even more slowly. Therefore, we should give priority to  the markets for the essential elements of production and speed  up their construction. The provincial party committee holds  that priority should be given to the above-mentioned three key  aspects to promote other work. They represent not only the key  aspects of economic work but also the key aspects of propaganda  and ideological work.    Third, propaganda and press work must play a leading and  encouraging role, and prevalence of erroneous public opinion on  the propaganda front should be prevented. We should always use  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics  and the party's line, principles, and policies to guide the vast  number of cadres and the masses and continuously boost their  morale. In this way, we will be able to make the good situation  still better, overcome unfavorable factors, and turn negative  factors into positive ones. To achieve this, we should  summarize and disseminate some good typical examples, methods,  and experiences. This is very important. We may also criticize  and expose problems, but they should be followed by results.  This should still play an encouraging role because it is yet  another method to mobilize cadres and the masses to overcome  their deficiencies, solve existing problems, and promote work.  These two aspects of work supplement each other, but guidance  with positive examples should be the major method. Everybody  has both strong points and weak points. Pointing out their weak  points may not result in overcoming their weak points. We need  to work on affirming and commending their strong points so that  they can use their strong points to overcome their weak points  and use their correct ideas to overcome incorrect ideas. Taking  advantage of people's characteristic of having a strong sense of  self-respect, which in itself is motivating, we should do a good  job in giving guidance through positive examples. When the  masses' enthusiasm is boosted, many difficulties will be  conquered. This is also the case with improvement of leading  bodies. It might not work if we only criticize a person's  defects. After overall appraisal, if we affirm the major  achievements of a cadre and then point out his defects, it will  be easier for the cadre to admit his deficiencies and overcome  them rapidly. Therefore, propaganda and press work should have  the ability to lead and encourage the people and to guide them  to carry forward fine traditions, good work styles, and good  experiences.    Fourth, propaganda and press work should conform to the  ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from  facts. This is an important guarantee to win the trust of the  masses and achieve good results in propaganda. Adherence to the  ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from  facts is an issue concerning work attitude, realistic spirit,  and correct understanding of objective things. In doing  propaganda and press work, we should make it conform to the  reality of the period as much as possible, master the trend in  the changes of things, and also guide things to advance in a  correct direction. To achieve this, we should explore the  necessary work procedure in addition to being conscientious and  responsible in doing work.    In each period of great change when central authorities  transmit important guidelines, we all face the issue of how to  correctly understand and implement them. Under such  circumstances, it is very important what public opinion will  prevail in propaganda and press front. In publicizing central  guidelines, we should not only follow them closely, but we  should also refrain from overstepping the boundary, which will  lead to problems. Therefore, in doing propaganda and press  work, we should not only have sharp-witted ideas, the ability to  discover new things, and the courage to publicize them, but we  should also have a good command of principles, strictly abide by  propaganda discipline, and avoid the misleading role of  propaganda. It is often not easy for most people to accept new  things and new experiences at the beginning. It is the  propaganda and press units that should be the harbingers. How  can new things and new experiences be accepted by most people if  we do not vigorously create public opinion? If the propaganda  and press front lacks sensitivity and still persists as though  in a planned economy, we have no hope. Comrade Xiaoping's  inclusion of emancipating the mind in our party's ideological  line indeed represents significant developments in Marxism. It  is metaphysics to view things as stagnant and static.  Dialectical materialism views things in a continuous flux. To  see the law governing the changes in the development of things,  we should emancipate our minds and remain keen toward fresh  things. Meanwhile, we also require that propaganda and press  work be carried out in line with principles and in unity with  the central authorities. We should never be vague on this.  Maintaining unity with the central authorities is not  contradictory to the effort in creation and development based on  one's specific conditions and in being good at summarizing new  experiences.    Fifth, to make propaganda and press work successful, we  must often investigate and study life's realities. Our party  has always emphasized the need to persist in the work style of  going deep into the reality of life to conduct investigation and  study and the need to respect the creative spirit of the masses.  We should often go deep into the reality of life to conduct  investigation and study if we are to make propaganda and press  work vivid, lively, and capable of coping with problems. Only  when we turn to the masses and the reality of life can we  summarize good experiences and good ideas to replenish our minds  and acquire a more comprehensive and complete understanding of  all things.    Investigation and study should focus on our central work.  In- depth investigations are currently needed on the following  aspects: 1) what problems do all fronts encounter in in-depth  reform, that hinder the development of productive forces and the  promotion of work; 2) how does the unitary planned economy  primarily influence and manifest itself in all layers, and what  are the problems that need solution; 3) regarding the endeavor  to open wider to the outside world, what fields need further  opening, to whom should we open to, and what advantages do our  development zones have; 4) concerning the product mix and  industrial structure, what products and industries cannot be  replaced by others, what products and industries are at the same  level as other provinces, and how can we surpass this level  through development, and 5) undertakings that have inherent  relations. For example, how can some large enterprises that are  in a slump and some township enterprises that urgently need  development, coordinate the advantages of large enterprises in  personnel, equipment, management, and funds with the needs of  township enterprises, and have large and medium-sized  enterprises learn from the mechanisms of township enterprises?  We should conduct systematic investigations on the  above-mentioned questions and study measures to resolve them.  Conducting investigation and study is an issue concerning  whether the propaganda and other fronts can implement the  central guidelines to the letter in line with Liaoning's reality  and whether they can effectively guide Liaoning's undertakings  to advance.    In short, the propaganda and press front is very important  in  the new situation in which reform is deepened and opening up is  expanded. The work of this front has a bearing on whether our  party has strong leadership and can truly guide cadres and the  masses to avoid detours and deviation in building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and whether the healthy trends in  society can be developed and some ugly and unhealthy trends can  be checked quickly. Therefore, it is hoped that party committees  at all levels, especially their top leaders, will attach  importance to the work of this front and make it successful. It  is also hoped that all localities will conscientiously implement  the guidelines of this conference of propaganda directors and  truly take economic construction as the central task and  development as an essential criterion.</p>

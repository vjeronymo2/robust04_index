			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: No way to make people think Sir, Nigel Spivey's defence of terrorist activities by animal rights fanatics ('Such woolly ideas', July 30/31) is extraordinarily naive. He informs us that 'one has to feel grateful for the occasional arson attack . . . They rightly make us think'. Extreme animal rights groups do not seek to make people think. They use bombs to maim human beings and arson attacks to coerce organisations to follow their views. People who conduct medical research on animals, or those who responsibly run zoos, are not thoughtless or evil; they believe their work to be morally justified. Unfortunately their views are rarely heard amid the deluge of fashionable animal rights propaganda. Should we also be grateful to the IRA for 'making us think'?

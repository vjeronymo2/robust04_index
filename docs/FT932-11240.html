			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Silentnight's Pounds 12m pleases City CONTINUING pressure on margins because of recession reduced profits at Silentnight Holdings, Europe's biggest manufacturer of beds, by 3 per cent to Pounds 12m pre-tax for the year to end-January. Sales increased 12 per cent to Pounds 153.9m (Pounds 137.6m). The Lancashire-based group said, however, that margins had improved in the second half and that it had increased market share in the UK. Mr Bill Davies, executive chairman, said: 'I believe the coming year will continue to be difficult as margins in the UK, our main market, remain under pressure. However, there are encouraging signs within the UK and the US of an upturn which is long overdue.' The UK beds businesses increased sales 5 per cent to Pounds 99m, but found margins extremely difficult to maintain. Mr Davies said: 'Bed volumes have been less affected by the recession than many other consumer products. However, the pressure on disposable income has meant that price is an increasingly important factor in the achievement of sales. 'Nonetheless we believe our bed companies increased their market share, and have been successful in improving margins during the second half despite the impact of devaluation on raw material costs. This continues to be a soundly profitable area of our business.' The US beds operation incurred losses in a much more volatile market, with sales down 11 per cent to Pounds 8.45m. Mr Davies said: 'We do now see an upturn in its fortunes as we concentrate on higher-margin sales and we anticipate internal improvement aided by the economic recovery which is now starting.' The UK cabinets businesses encountered mixed fortunes in spite of a 16 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 37m. The group said Homeworthy, its largest cabinet business, increased profits by more than 20 per cent. However, the result from Silentnight Cabinets was significantly below expectations, with disrupted production because of a factory extension leading to higher costs. Westminster Pine also continued to find it difficult to increase turnover profitably. Houben, a German bed and mattress manufacturer bought last May, made an eight-month profit contribution of Pounds 879,000. Earnings fell 4 per cent to 17.14p (17.84p). An unchanged final dividend of 5.75p maintains the total at 8p. COMMENT Silentnight's shares rose 7p to 302p as these results were ahead of expectations. The group struck a cautious note on its trading outlook, but seems well poised to benefit from any sustained upturn in consumer confidence. Pressure on prices has been intense, but new models and higher orders from recent trade shows suggest some scope for rebuilding margins. The group gives no divisional split of profits, but the problems in cabinets seems limited to the US and one-off factory extension at Silentnight Cabinets. Analysts believe earnings could advance 20 per cent in the current year, putting the shares on a prospective multiple of under 15, a slight discount to the market. Despite having risen by nearly 60 per cent since September, the shares could have further bounce left in them.</p>

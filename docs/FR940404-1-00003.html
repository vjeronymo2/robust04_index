			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are about 65 avocado handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering avocados grown in Florida, and about 95 avocado producers in South Florida. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of the Florida avocado handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Avocado Administrative Committee (committee) works with the Department in administering the order, and it meets prior to and during each season to consider recommendations for modification, suspension, or termination of the regulatory requirements for Florida avocados.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The committee met December 8, 1993, and unanimously recommended that the shipping schedules for avocados be revised and that certain reporting requirements be temporarily suspended. Committee meetings are open to the public and interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations, information submitted by the committee and other information, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the regulatory requirements would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maturity requirements for avocados grown in Florida, based on minimum weights, diameters, and skin color, are specified in &sect;915.322 (7 CFR 915.322), and are in effect on a continuous basis. These maturity requirements specify minimum weights and diameters for specific shipping periods for some 60 varieties of avocados, and color specifications for those varieties which turn red or purple when mature. The maturity requirements for the various varieties of avocados are different, because each variety has different characteristics. The maturity requirements for each avocado variety are based on maturity test results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These maturity requirements are designed to prevent shipments of immature avocados to the fresh market, especially during the early part of the harvest season for each variety. Providing fresh markets with mature fruit is an important aspect of creating consumer satisfaction and is in the interest of both producers and consumers. Fresh shipments of Florida avocados usually begin with light shipments of early varieties in May, and they continue until the following March or April, with heaviest shipments occurring from July through December.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would revise the shipping schedules for the avocado varieties specified in Table I of paragraph (a)(2) of &sect;915.322 (7 CFR 915.322) to synchronize those schedules with any calendar year. The previous schedules needed to be adjusted to each new year to ensure that dates and weekdays conformed to each new year. The schedules in Table I are similar to previous calendars, except that the maturity schedules have fixed dates, which become effective on the Monday nearest the date specified in Table I. The new schedules are expected to conform more closely to the needs of the industry. This proposed rule also would exempt from maturity requirements, the Hass, Fuerte, Zutano, and Edranol varieties of avocados, since these varieties of avocados are not commercially grown in the production area in Florida.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The maturity requirements, based on minimum weights, diameters, and skin color, specified in &sect;944.31 (7 CFR 944.31) for imported avocados were indefinitely suspended by a final rule issued May 15, 1991 (56 FR 23009, May 20, 1991). Therefore, this action will not impact imported avocados until the suspension is lifted. However a proposed rule will be published separately to reinstate the temporarily suspended maturity requirements for avocados imported into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A minimum grade requirement of U.S. No. 2 currently in effect on a continuous basis for avocados grown in Florida under &sect;915.306 (7 CFR 915.306), and for avocados imported into the United States under &sect;944.28 (7 CFR 944.28) remains in effect unchanged by this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida avocado handlers may ship, exempt from the minimum grade, size, and maturity requirements effective under the order, up to 55 pounds of avocados during any one day under a minimum quantity provision, and up to 20 pounds of avocados as gift packs in individually addressed containers. Also, avocados grown in Florida utilized for commercial processing are not subject to the grade, size, and maturity requirements under the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Efim deal takes shape THE EC Commission has reached preliminary agreement with Italy that paves the way for the Italian government to begin disbursing L7,000bn (Pounds 2.9bn) of funds earmarked for creditors of Efim, the state industrial holding. The agreement came too close to the summer recess for the full details to be worked out. This means the Italian government is unlikely to be able to begin consider disbursements to banks and suppliers before late September. The deal has been struck at a 'political' level by Mr Beniamino Andreatta, the Italian foreign minister, with Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC commissioner in charge of competition. Although neither side will admit as much, the agreement is part of a trade-off in Italy's acrimonious dispute with Brussels over state subsidies - and particularly those for Ilva, the loss-making state steel group. On Tuesday, Mr Andreatta softened Italy's stance over Ilva and agreed to withdraw plans to write off Ecu4bn (Pounds 3bn) incurred by the steel group. The Italians have made no secret of their view that Brussels has been blocking an Efim agreement to exert pressure in the Ilva affair. Italy now has until August 14 to present fresh proposals for Ilva's future, which will be studied in late September. Until the EC is satisfied with the Ilva plan, it could go slow on formalising an agreement on Efim. Efim was placed in liquidation last July with L18,000bn worth of debts split roughly equally between banks and suppliers. Foreign banks are owed over L3,500bn. The Italian parliament approved disbursement of L9,000bn over three months to Efim creditors; but since then Brussels has only given the go-ahead for L2,000bn to the defence side of the state holding. Mr Van Miert blocked the funds on the grounds that repayment of Efim's accumulated debts represented a form of subsidy. The Italian government argued that it was legally bound to honour Efim debts which amounted to sovereign debt. The outline agreement envisages the Italian government being able to honour Efim debt accumulated at the time of liquidation, plus subsequent interest and refinancing arrangements. The government will be placing some L4,000bn in the 1994 budget to cover the further cost of the liquidation which could eventually reach a total of L17,000bn. In return, Italy has undertaken to provide a clear timetable of privatisation plans and the precise levels of the debt of state companies. The latter's debt at the end of December 1993 will be considered their maximum ceiling. Thereafter the Italian government must be seen to be reducing the levels of debt.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> STUDY TIES CHOLESTEROL TO ANGER  </P> <P> Hostile teen-agers are likely to grow up to be adults who have high  cholesterol, according to a study that finds new links between anger and heart  trouble. For years, many experts assumed that hard-driving, impatient people  with classic Type A personalities were at high risk of heart attacks.  </P> <P> But many of the researchers have grown skeptical of this theory, and some now  believe that the truly lethal personality trait is hostility and anger.  </P> <P> "People with high hostility at age 19 tend to have high cholesterol levels at  40," Dr. Redford B. Williams of Duke University said last week at a Dallas  meeting of the American Heart Assn.  </P> <P> Williams' study was among several presented at the association's annual meeting  to suggest that hostile people are more prone to heart trouble -- both because  of the effects of adrenaline and other hormones on their bodies and their  tendency to have unhealthful living habits.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETICS' PHILLIPS MAKES MOST OF RARE CHANCE;  </P> <P> NO. 6 BATTER'S TWO-RUN HOMER IN SIXTH INNING HELPS DO IN WITT AND ANGELS  </P> <P> With Mark McGwire and Dave Parker clearing the bases ahead of him most of the  season, Oakland second baseman Tony Phillips hasn't had much opportunity to  drive in runs.  </P> <P> But he did Friday night.  </P> <P> Phillips hit only his fourth home run of the season, but he made it count.  </P> <P> His two-run blast in the sixth inning boosted the A's to a 5-0 victory and sole  possession of the American League West before a crowd of 61,696 at Anaheim  Stadium.  </P> <P> "I haven't had a home run in a long time, so this was really nice," Phillips  said. "I think we're starting to be more aggressive. This is definitely a good  sign."  </P> <P> Parker, who has 15 home runs, and McGwire, who has 20, bat ahead of Phillips'  No. 6 position in the Oakland lineup. Parker and McGwire each had 66 runs  batted in going into Friday night's game.  </P> <P> Oakland Manager Tony La Russa has used Phillips in several spots throughout the  lineup.  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter if it's first or fourth," Phillips said. "I'm only one type  of hitter -- one who gets on base."  </P> <P> Which means, of course, that Phillips usually comes to the plate with no one on  base.  </P> <P> And when there were baserunners, Phillips wasn't driving them in. He was  hitting only .192 with runners in scoring position and had 29 RBIs.  </P> <P> But after Parker hit a fly ball to left field for the A's second out and  McGwire singled to center in the sixth, Phillips saw his chance.  </P> <P> Phillips smashed Mike Witt's 1-and-0 pitch over the right-field fence, giving  the A's a 3-0 lead.  </P> <P> "Phillips put a good swing on the ball," La Russa said. "This was a good win.  We had defense, pitching and timely hitting. That's a hell of a formula."  </P> <P> Third baseman Carney Lansford tagged Witt in the eighth inning for a solo home  run, his second homer of the season. Dave Henderson walked and scored on a  double to right field by Parker.  </P> <P> The A's needed Lansford's and Phillips' unexpected power.  </P> <P> Outfielder Jose Canseco has been sidelined with a strained muscle in his right  thigh since Monday. Parker had only three hits in his last 17 at-bats before  Friday, and McGwire had 10 hits and only one homer in his previous 61 at-bats.  </P> <P> Until Friday night, Phillips hadn't fared much better.  </P> <P> Phillips' homer, his fourth against the Angels in his career, was a bright spot  in an otherwise gloomy stretch. He had only 11 hits in his last 62 at-bats  (.177) entering Friday night's game, pulling his season average down to .245.  </P> <P> Although struggling at the plate, Phillips has been one of the A's most  versatile players in the field.  </P> <P> He has played first, second, shortstop and third base this year as well as  right and left field.  </P> <P> Last year, he was one of only two American League players to start at six  different positions, and he played more than one position in a game 30 times.  </P></p>

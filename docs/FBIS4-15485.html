			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Denis Perkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- "Russia backs the recent  steps of the South African Government to enforce law and order.  But these measures may prove insufficient without a long-term  political agreement," a representative of the Russian Foreign  Ministry stated at the ministry's press centre here today.    The developments in the Republic of South Africa are now in  the focus of world public opinion: less than three weeks are  left before the first universal parliamentary elections in the  country. "All the world regards this event as a turning point in  the history of South Africa, as a landmark after which the  country will become a full- fledged member of the community of  democratic states," the representative noted.    "In the meantime, the election campaign has brought the  situation to a head in several parts of South Africa," the  diplomat stated. "The political forces that are unable to win  popularity among the electorate are becoming increasingly  aggressive. They intend to boycott the elections and to prevent  normal voting on the territories under their control," he added.  The diplomat believes that "such a tactic actually leads to a  break-up of the Republic of South Africa and threatens the  society by an open armed confrontation frought with  unpredictible consequences for the country an the entire region".    The representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry expressed  the hope that the meeting among leaders of the conflicting  sides, scheduled for saturday, would be constructive. The  Russian Foreign Ministry expects "the meeting to adopt a firm  commitment of all its participants to contribute by every means  at their disposal to the free expression of the will of the  South African electors on the entire territory of the country".</p>

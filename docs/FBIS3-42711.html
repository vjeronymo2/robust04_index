Third Call"] </F>   [Text] Moscow--Disturbing news: The oil workers of the  Republic of Komi are once again threatening to shut off the  valves. They really do have more than enough reason to strike:  wages in Usinsk, Ukhta, and the majority of other  administrations of the Komineft Stock Company have not been paid  since last November.    Today the situation is exacerbated in the extreme: the  Presidium of the Russian Council of the Union of Workers of the  Oil and Gas Sectors of Industry and Construction  (Neftegazstroyprofsoyuz) has sent an appeal to all oil-producing  associations for support for the "ultimatum" of the oil workers  of Usinsk. It is demanded that the Governments of the Russian  Federation and Komi make good the wage arrears before 1 February  and settle accounts in full for the oil that has been supplied  to the consumers.    As Valeriy Bendyuzhik, deputy chairman of the Komi Republic  Neftegazstroyprofsoyuz Committee, announced, in the event of  this warning going unheeded by the authorities, the union will  be forced to adopt, in accordance with the law, a decision on  the date of commencement of a strike.</p>

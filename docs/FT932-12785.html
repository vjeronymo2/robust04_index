			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Publicity offensive to back testing THE government yesterday launched a publicity campaign to win support among parents for the controversial national curriculum tests for schools in England and Wales, John Willman writes. Launching the Pounds 700,000 campaign, Mr John Patten, education secretary, said it would be a tragedy if this year's tests did not go ahead. The government's campaign includes Pounds 250,000 of press advertising to explain the rationale behind the tests. Advertisements will be placed in national newspapers. Some 3m leaflets have been printed giving details of the tests, which will be available through schools and libraries. People collecting child benefit from post offices will also be given a copy during the weeks immediately before the tests for 14-year-olds in June. Mr Peter Smith of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers said that differences over testing could not be solved by a public relations campaign. The six unions representing school teachers in England and Wales yesterday united to urge Mr Patten to suspend the controversial national curriculum tests for 1993. The unions called in a letter for the suspension of the tests pending a review, but Mr Patten dismissed the appeal as 'an extraordinary suggestion'.</p>

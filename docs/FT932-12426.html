			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: R. J. Reynolds enters cigarette price war in US R. J. REYNOLDS, the domestic US tobacco arm of the R. J. R. Nabisco food and cigarettes group, is to match the large price cuts in full-priced cigarette brands that Philip Morris, its big rival, announced this month. Reynolds said it would slash the price of its Winston brand by Dollars 4 a carton, or 40 cents a packet. It would also increase promotion of its Camel brand, although it declined to be more specific. 'Frankly, we'd like to stay light on our feet,' Reynolds said. The Reynolds cuts will apply to June only, and no other brands will participate. The company said it would reassess the position in late June. Winston is one of Reynolds's flagship brands and the one which competes most closely with Philip Morris's Marlboro. Camel is also a non-menthol, full-priced brand, although its total US market share, at about 4.1 per cent last year, was smaller than Winston's, taking close to 7 per cent. Philip Morris's decision to reduce the price of Marlboro, the best-selling US cigarette brand, by 40 cents a packet (from about Dollars 2.10-Dollars 2.20 to Dollars 1.70-Dollars 1.80), sent the cigarette market into turmoil earlier this month. Reynolds, which has almost 29 per cent of the US cigarette market, against Philip Morris's 43 per cent, said it intended to remain competitive, but had not previously detailed its response.</p>

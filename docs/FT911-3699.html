			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru cuts taxes and declares mining emergency PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori has declared a state of emergency in the Peruvian mining industry and announced tax concessions to give the beleaguered sector a breathing space. From July, small and medium-sized mines will be exempted from the current 5 per cent emergency tax on copper export. Output from mines in this category is worth Dollars 750m (Pounds 441m) a year, or over a third of Peru's earnings from mining. Peru's important silver mining sector will also benefit from new 'drawback' measures which allow it to reclaim income and business equity taxes. Although the measures were welcomed by Mr Luis Rodriguez Mariategui, head of the National Mining Society, (SNM), it is not clear whether they are in time to save about 14 medium-sized mines under threat of closure. For example Huaron, a leading silver, zinc and lead producer has been losing Dollars 800,000 a month since January and is now said to have debts of almost Dollars 13m. While plummeting international silver prices mean that silver producers have been worst hit, the entire sector is in poor shape. Preliminary figures for 1990 indicate that direct losses may be around Dollars 130m, close to those registered in 1986, the worst year in the last decade. State-owned giant Centromin lost Dollars 50m last year and is contemplating drastic personnel cuts. Only five mining companies reported profits last year, according to preliminary data - Southern Peru Copper, Orcopampa, Milpo, Simsa and Arcata. Copper output fell 13 per cent in 1990 from 1989, while silver and iron production declined 15 and 20 per cent respectively. Spare parts and maintenance problems at HierroPeru, the country's sole iron producer, meant a fall in iron output from 2.9m tons in 1989 to 2.1m last year. High international metals prices partially masked the crisis - but this year is likely to be worse, according to industry sources. Speaking at the close of the national Mining Engineers' Convention in Lima, President Fujimori acknowledged the importance of the mining industry. It generates over half of all foreign exchange earnings and employs one in five of the population. The solution to the sector's problems, he recognised, lay in a more realistic exchange rate and lower interest rates. The dollar-inti exchange rate has scarcely moved since December. The inti is over-valued by a factor of three, according to the mining industry. Mr David Ballon, president of the Mining Engineers' Institute says the sector has lost Dollars 1.62bn in the last two years alone through exchange rate lag. This has meant low levels of reinvestment and failure to spend on exploration. Many mines' proven reserves are now perilously low. Short-term debts also plague the sector. Mines have been forced to borrow heavily to pay taxes levied on total sales, rather than profits and run between 20 and 30 per cent of turnover. Interest rates exceed 20 per cent a month, in spite of a gradual fall in inflation, down to 7.7 per cent last month. Mining companies' debt positions have been exacerbated by Centromin's failure for the past several months to pay suppliers. Participants from abroad at the convention emphasised the need for Peru to stabilise tax policies and standardise contracts along Chilean lines. Their call appeared to have been heard by President Fujimori. He promised to promote mining investment under extraordinary facilities recently granted by parliament. This, he said, would make laws 'more flexible,' attract risk capital and favour joint ventures. If the main problem for Peruvian miners continues to be the exchange rate, there is another to which there is no solution yet in sight - terrorism. The SNM counts 304 terrorist actions directed at mining companies during the last decade, mainly with the object of stealing explosives and other supplies. Attacks have left 62 dead, it calculates, with a disturbing recent rise - 14 mining employees were killed in remote mountain camps in December last year alone.</p>

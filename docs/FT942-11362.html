			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Massive electoral fraud alleged in Russia The December 12 referendum which approved the Russian constitution was invalid because the required 50 per cent of voters did not take part, according to a report by a team of experts working for the presidential administration. The report, whose main author yesterday insisted on its accuracy, alleges massive corruption at every level of vote counting. The potential importance of the findings - if shown to be correct and if acted upon - is great. The report's author, Mr Alexander Sobyanin, claims that only 49m voters out of 106.2m took part in the referendum on the constitution - a percentage of only 46.1, well short of the 50 per cent minimum and even further down on the 54.8 per cent claimed by the Central Election Commission very soon after the voting ended. The findings could tear the heart out of the efforts by President Boris Yeltsin to place the constitution as the foundation stone of Russian democracy. He has persuaded most of the Russian party leaders to sign a 'treaty on civil accord' which pledges that no efforts will be made to amend the constitution for two years. The treaty was signed yesterday by 141 representatives of Russian enterprise unions and associations. The report, excerpts of which have been printed in the daily newspaper, Izvestiya, also said that extensive stuffing of ballot boxes and rewriting of results at the regional voting headquarters resulted in huge distortions. It alleged that the Liberal Democratic party (LDP), the ultra-nationalist group led by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, whose victory in that part of the parliament chosen from party lists was the main shock of the elections, received 6m unwarranted votes - with the Russian Communist party gaining 1.8m, the pro-communist Agrarians receiving 1.7m and the Women of Russia - also pro-Communist - 1m. The main loser among the parties, said the report, was Choice of Russia, which suffered a shortfall of 2m votes. However, the present signs are that the report will not be allowed to receive much attention. Both Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief-of-staff and Mr Nikolai Ryabov, the head of the electoral commission, rejected the report's findings. Mr Filatov is reported by Russian journalists to have deprived Mr Sobyanin's group of its working dacha on the outskirts of Moscow, and to have had it sealed. Mr Ryabov told Izvestiya: 'I cannot say that nothing of this sort took place . . . (but) to talk of massive falsifications and breaches of the rules in this way has no grounds in reality.' However, Mr Sobyanin, in an interview from his Kremlin office, stood by the report: 'I am certain the facts are right because many of the breaches were so obvious. It was quite obvious that in some regions the results were way out of line.' Mr Sobyanin said that he had not discussed the report with Mr Filatov, but had with other officials and 'there is some concern'. Following publication of parts of his report, Mr Sobyanin said his contract with the government had not been renewed. A separate report on expenditure of the parties during the election alleges that Choice of Russia spent almost 30 times more on the campaign per deputy elected than the LDP - Rbs47.9m per deputy against Rbs1.7m. The former won 40 seats, the latter 59.</p>

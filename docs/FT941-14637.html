			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: S&amp;P lowers debt rating on Japanese brokers Standard and Poor's yesterday lowered ratings on Japan's 'big four' brokers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Senior debt rating at Nomura Securities was lowered to double-A from double-A plus. Daiwa Securities' short-term debt rating was lowered to A-1 from A-1 plus. Nikko Securities' long-term debt has been reduced to A from A-plus, while short-term debt at Nikko Europe was cut to A-1 from A-1 plus. The A-1 short-term rating of Nikko Bank (UK) is under review. Senior debt at Yamaichi Securities was lowered to A1 from A. The US credit agency cited the negative impact of low stock market turnover and limited new equity offerings. It also pointed to continuing financial liberalisation and the consequent lowering of barriers between the banking and securities industries. This will increase competition and squeeze the brokers' profit margins, S&amp;P said.</p>

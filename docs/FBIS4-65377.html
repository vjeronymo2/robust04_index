			<p>BFN     [Text] The government spokesman said the process of  proximity talks on the confidence-building measures has been  terminated. Asked if the Cypriot Government considers that the  process to find a Cyprus solution in general through the method  of talks has also been terminated, Government Spokesman Ioannis  Kasoulidhis said the methods followed to date have proven that  there cannot be progress, due to the lack of political will by  the Turkish side.    Kasoulidhis added that what should be done now is for the  Security Council members to consider alternative ways to promote  a Cyprus solution. He added: After the UN secretary general's  report is submitted, the Security Council might give some time  for consultations to be held among its members in order to agree  on the alternative methods to be promoted. He also noted that  these consultations might include the guarantor powers in Cyprus.</p>

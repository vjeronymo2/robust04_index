			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Channel 7 News" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] This weekend Acisclo Valladares Molina was again  sworn in as attorney general and Ramses Cuestas Gomez as chief  of the Public Prosecutor's Office and prosecutor general.    [Begin Guatemalan President De Leon Carpio recording] As  president of the Republic, as the ombudsman for Human Rights, as  a Guatemalan citizen committed solely and exclusively to his  country and its people, I once again express my deepest  conviction that Guatemala must change. Each step we take to  strengthen democracy, reaffirm human rights, fight impunity and  corruption, reestablish lost moral values, and regain the  credibility of our institutions will allow us to advance in the  right direction -- toward our common well-being and  comprehensive, complete human dignity.    This is one of those steps that will allow us to walk  serenely on the road to a comprehensive peace; peace not only as  the absence of war, nor as the end of the internal armed  conflict which, thank God, is about to end; but peace as an  achievement that includes justice and social stability. [end  recording]    Valladares Molina will have advisory and consultative  functions in various government activities. He will also  conduct a special project involving tax evasion, and will have  to deal with the eradication of corruption in the Customs  Department. Cuestas Gomez will be responsible for judicial  investigations in order to facilitate the fair administration of  justice. [passage omitted]</p>

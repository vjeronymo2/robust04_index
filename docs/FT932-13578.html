			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CBoT drops Comex merger plan CONSOLIDATION OF the US futures industry has been set back by the collapse of the Chicago Board of Trade's attempt to acquire New York's Commodity Exchange. Although the two exchanges negotiated a preliminary affiliation agreement in January, the CBoT announced late on Tuesday that it was withdrawing its offer to take over Comex because it expected Comex traders to reject its bid. Mr Patrick Arbor, chairman of CBoT, said: 'After weeks of negotiations, we have concluded that we could not modify our original business proposal to satisfactorily address Comex's demand for extended access to our products'. Comex traders were ready to reject the deal primarily because, under the agreement, CBoT would not have allowed them enough access to CBoT's lucrative interest-rate and agricultural futures contracts. The collapse of the deal is a blow to Comex, the largest metals exchange in the US. Comex has suffered from declining trading volume in recent years, especially in the important gold and silver futures contracts. Although volume has picked up this year, Comex leaders are still shopping around for possible merger partners. The failure of CBoT and Comex to agree on an affiliation will disappoint those in the futures industry who believe that consolidation through mergers and acquisitions is essential if the established exchanges are to compete effectively with the rapidly growing over-the-counter market in futures, options and other derivative contracts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F> "U.S. Human Rights Diplomacy Runs Into Snags in Beijing"]    [Text] When he was in Australia and Japan, U.S. Secretary  of State Christopher, who is regarded in the United States as a  hardliner toward China, kept telling people that the purpose of  his visit to China was to "discuss the human rights issue." He  probably thought that with the threat to rescind China's  most-favored nation [MFN] trade status, China would make  concessions to his human rights diplomacy, and thus he would be  able to announce to the world that it was effective to use the  human rights issue to engage in blackmail. He did not expect  that his practice would never be effective with the Chinese  people. Yesterday, the Chinese leaders bluntly told him that  China would never accept the U.S. concept of human rights. The  U.S. human rights diplomacy really has run into snags in China,  a country with a population of 1.2 billion people.    The Chinese leaders pointed out that China and the United  States have no common ideology and values, so it is natural that  they hold different points of view on human rights. China is a  developing country, and the population of the developing  countries in the world accounts for four-fifths of the world's  total population. It is unfair to impose the human rights  concept of the developed nations on the developing countries.  Moreover, the U.S. accusations concerning China's human rights  problem were aimed merely at encouraging a very small number of  criminal offenders, and it is a matter of certainty that China  could not accept them. In fact, apart from the human rights  issue, there remain differences between China and the United  States in many aspects. It is ridiculous to require China to  accept the U.S. position on every issue. There are indeed  differences between the two countries, and this can be solved  only through consultations on an equal footing and in a spirit  of mutual respect, through efforts to seeking common ground  while reserving differences. At the same time, China is willing  to maintain and develop relations with the United States. It  holds that to do so is in the common interests of both countries  and is beneficial to both nations.    However, while pursuing its human rights diplomacy, the  United States went so far to unreasonably link bilateral trade  with the human rights issue in an attempt to force China to  accept its human rights position. It threatened to rescind  China's MFN trading status if China refused to do this. Indeed,  they regard this as an effective "weapon," and have been  wielding it again and again over the past few years. Some  Americans wrongly thought that the MFN status was a great  "favor" they gave to other nations. This practice of theirs was  opposed, even by some of their allies. On 12 March, the head of  the EU delegation in China reiterated: "The European Union does  not agree with the practice of linking the human rights issue  with trade." This time, the Chinese side frankly expressed its  position to Christopher, and also put all its cards on the  table. If the United States indeed rescinds China's MFN status,  then it will only ruin the prospects for Sino-U.S. economic and  trade relations. Thus, China will not be the only one to suffer  losses, and the United States will suffer losses no less than  those suffered by China. China's development will depend mainly  on its domestic market, and China has strong capability for  self-reliance. The United States, however, will lose a huge  market. China has expressed its position very clearly, and it  is the U.S. Government that should make the choice. It is  believed that the Chinese Government has made good preparations  against various possibilities and will not hold any unrealistic  illusions. China has learned a good lesson from last year's  "Yinhe" accident and the disgusting performance of some U.S.  congressmen in opposing China's bid to host the Olympic Games.    At last year's Seattle meeting, U.S. President Clinton  repeatedly said that the United States supports a strong,  stable, and prosperous China. Facts show that the words and  deeds of many U.S. officials went against this promise. They  just tried by every possible means to create trouble between the  two countries, and their purpose was simply to obstruct the  appearance of a strong, stable, and prosperous China. It is a  pity that this is only their fond dream.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Ford more than doubles to record Dollars 1.7bn for quarter Ford of the US, the world's second largest vehicle maker, exceeded market forecasts and more than doubled its net profit in the second quarter to a record Dollars 1.71bn (Pounds 1.1bn) from Dollars 775m a year ago. The profits of the big three US carmakers are rising sharply, helped by the continuing strength of the US market and the start of recovery in Europe. Chrysler recently announced record quarterly earnings of Dollars 956m for the second quarter, and General Motors is expected to report a big jump in profits today. Ford's group net profit in the first six months virtually doubled to Dollars 2.62bn from Dollars 1.35bn, while turnover rose 14.2 per cent to Dollars 64.2bn. The net profits of its worldwide automotive operations quadrupled in the first six months to Dollars 2.14bn (Dollars 571m). In the second quarter Ford's automotive operations tripled net profits to Dollars 1.18bn from Dollars 395m. The after-tax return on automotive sales jumped to 4.2 per cent from 1.7 per cent. Net income from Ford's US automotive operations rose in the second quarter to Dollars 907m from Dollars 367m. Automotive earnings outside the US increased to Dollars 276m from only Dollars 28m, helped by a return to profit in Europe. Ford's financial services group, one of the most profitable financial services companies in the world, earned a record Dollars 528m (Dollars 380m) in the second quarter. Group turnover worldwide in the second quarter rose 15 per cent to Dollars 33.8bn (Dollars 29.4bn), while Ford vehicle sales increased by 8.1 per cent to 1.8m. Mr Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We feel good about these improvements, but we are by no means satisfied.' The group, which has launched a far-reaching reorganisation aimed at merging its North American and European automotive operations into one unit by the end of the year, had to remain focused on improving its return on automotive sales, he said. The sharp rise in profits at Ford, following big losses in 1991 and 1992, is being supported by increasing demand for new vehicles in the US, where overall sales of cars and light trucks jumped 11 per cent in the first half of the year to 7.76m. Ford forecast that total US car and truck sales in 1994 would rise by about 9 per cent to 15.5m. Its share of the US market declined slightly in the first half to 24.9 per cent from 25.4 per cent a year ago. The profitability of Ford's US automotive operations has been helped by falling marketing costs with its retail incentives reduced to Dollars 550 per vehicle in the second quarter from Dollars 755 a year ago. Ford has reduced the share of vehicles it sells to fleets to 25 per cent of its total sales in the second quarter from 28 per cent a year ago, and the mix of its sales is improving with a rising share of sales of more profitable light trucks.</p>

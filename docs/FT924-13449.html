			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (11): High-powered ideas - Motorola's Iridium system will span the globe COMMUNICATION satellites do not respect national boundaries. Consequently, they have a vital part to play in international communi-cations. However, while those in use orbit the globe at a height of 22,000 miles, Motorola and a number of the other leading telecommunications companies such as Alcatel and TRW have proposed networks of satellites in low earth orbit (Leo) that would enable subscribers to use small hand-held telephones when even in the remotest parts of the globe. This technology will complement existing terrestrial cellular and wired systems and could meet the need of remote areas where it is too expensive to provide communications. However, even in the long term it will not be a low-cost option. Because the cost will run into billions of dollars, a limited, experimental system will be launched initially. In the longer term, the potential market is huge. Motorola, which is taking this market very seriously, hopes to find 2m customers by 2002. While most will be voice, Motorola expects that this figure will include about 700,000 paging users. In addition, there will be users who transmit data but, as this will be over a normal voice channel to or from a laptop PC it will be impossible to quantify these numbers. In the US, Motorola Satellite Communications Inc has been awarded an experimental licence to construct and launch five satellites to demonstrate the feasibility of its Iridium system. The name Iridium was chosen for Motorola's global, digital, wireless communi-cations network because the original concept required 77 satellites to span the globe - and 77 is the atomic number of the element Iridium. The Iridium system intends to offer high-quality, global voice, paging, facsimile, data and radio determination satellite services to its subscribers. The Iridium telephone will be a dual-mode portable instrument designed to work in conjunction with existing cellular systems. This function will provide flexibility for the travelling subscriber by allowing the user to choose among network alternatives according to cost and availa-bility. The phone will be designed with a data connec-tion for transmitting fax and computer files. Furthermore, the dual-mode approach will enable Iridium to enter partnership agreements with the existing cellular networks, avoid head-on competition, and sidestep much of the large outlay of setting up its own sales infrastructure. By the time Iridium is in place, the GSM pan-European digital cellular network will have rolled out to encompass a good proportion of Europe and will also have been adopted in other parts of the globe. Hence, a businessman who feels that his work may take him out of the reach of GSM, could well consider that Iridium is of significant benefit. Iridium satellites will be small, lightweight, and interconnected to provide continuous line-of-sight coverage between all points on the globe and within an altitude of 100 miles. Each satellite will project cell patterns on to the earth's surface, and the constellation of satellites will provide global coverage. The 77 satellites called for in the original concept have been reduced to 66 by further development of the concept. As well as reducing overall costs it should allow system capacity to be re-allocated to respond to regional market demand so as to concentrate channels over densely populated regions. In operation, the telephone, having checked that it cannot get a channel on the local terrestrial network on which it is registered, will interface with the satellites overhead and, in turn, with the public switched telephone network via terrestrial gateways. These gateways will store customer billing information, keep track of user locations, and interconnect with the terrestrial carriers. Service will be available on a country-by-country switched basis as negotiated with individual governments, telecommunications author-ties and service providers. One of the critical issues will be the attitudes of the various national authorities. Countries may see Iridium as a threat in that it could cream off revenue from network to remote areas which are inher-ently expensive to service, frequently inadequate, and generally unprofitable because of the cost of having to install vast amounts of cabling to support just a few subscribers who probably make little use of phones anyway. Where these countries take a fresh look, they will see that Iridium will be able to provide the infrastructure to meet the communications needs of their remote communities cost-effectively, by taking advantage of the economy of scale that results by serving users from the developed countries.</p>

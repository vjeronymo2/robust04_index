Over the past few days the media manipulated by  Eduardo dos Santos alleged that the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola had attacked Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola-Labor Party positions in Cambambe. This  has been categorically denied by the military command of the  Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola in Cuanza Norte. FALA  forces stationed in that province have been strictly adhering to  the cease-fire declared on 20 September 1993 by Army General Dr.  Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, their supreme commander.

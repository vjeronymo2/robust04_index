			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bert Steingoetter: "Austrians as `Stasi' Agents: </F> List of Suspects Growing!"]    [Excerpt] Whether Austrian Radio and Television (ORF)  correspondent Fritz Wendl and another two Austrians, on whom  investigations are currently being carried out in connection  with suspected spying activities, have indeed supplied  information to the former GDR is still uncertain. Yet, what is  certain is that they will not be the last ones who -- whether  guilty or not -- will be put on the "list."    A list in the Interior Ministry that is getting longer and  longer. The German Federal Office for the Protection of the  Constitution [BfV] is sending an officer to Vienna once every  two to three months. In his luggage, this man has the most  recent names or, in some cases, only bits and pieces of  information of people suspected of having served the Stasi as  informers in Austria.    This is where the Austrian State Protection officers come  in.  They have to clarify whether the suspects deliberately supplied  an foreign power with information, maybe even in return for  cash. Or, whether they were simply tricked by a professional  agent, made friends with him, and unwittingly passed on  information in a friendly conversation in a bar or restaurant.    Yet, a high-ranking State Protection officer has said that  things might be even worse: "We know of cases of unsuspecting  citizens who were even put on the Stasi payroll. This could  happen when agents who are under pressure to provide results  simply embellished their reports to headquarters about their  private meeting with people in bars and restaurants -- and put  the rewards for the alleged hot `source' in their own pocket."

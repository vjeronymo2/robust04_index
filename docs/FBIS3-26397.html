There was no doubt about NATO's capability of launching air  strikes and within an hour after the order was issued, he told a  conference on European security in Munich.    But he was also cautious about the military action in the  former Yugoslav republic which has been embroiled in civil war  for the past 22 months.    "I can tell you unequivocally at this stage that we will not  take any military action without considering seriously the  effect on the situation in Bosnia, and we will not invoke air  strikes unilaterally, not with 28,000 troops of our allies on  the ground in Bosnia," he said.    The United States and several other NATO countries currently  have military attack jets based in Italy awaiting any decision  by UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to launch air  strikes in Bosnia.    Perry, who was sworn in as secretary of defense only two  days  ago to replace Les Aspin, said the U.S. had been in close  contact with Western Europe and the United Nations following a  mortar attack on a market place in the Bosnian capital of  Sarajevo on Saturday which killed 68 people and wounded about  200.    The bloody incident has prompted even more calls for outside  intervention. France urged international action, including the  use of air power, to lift the siege of Sarajevo. The Russian  Foreign Ministry has also expressed its anger over the atrocity.    After attending the security conference, Perry flew back to  Washington to consult with President Bill Clinton over the  latest killings in Bosnia and their moves to check further  massacres in the war-torn territory.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GUIDE, GOSSIP, A GLIMPSE OF GLORY;  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA: A SPECIAL BOOKS EDITION;  </P> <P> RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).;  </P> <P>  "12 DAYS ON THE ROAD: THE SEX PISTOLS AND AMERICA" BY NOEL E. MONK AND JIMMY  GUTERMAN WILLIAM MORROW &amp; CO. ($19.95)  </P> <P> Sex, drugs and anti-rock 'n' roll: Here are the sights, the sounds and the  smells of a rock tour more disastrous than even Spinal Tap's. The story of the  Pistols' sole, brief 1977 American trip, as told by tour manager Monk and rock  journalist Guterman, revolves mostly around Sid Vicious' inevitable spiral  toward self-destruction.  </P> <P> To a lesser extent we get Johnny Rotten (sneering, nose-picking), manager  Malcolm McLaren (manipulative but spineless), Pistols Steve Jones and Paul Cook  (childish) and a host of colorful punks, punk wanna-bes and other ugly  Americans.  </P> <P> Opening with a vivid account of a Pistols concert, capturing all the  exhiliration, release and violence of punk at its most intense, the book then  mirrors the punk era itself as the rush wears off, returning only  intermittently. Still, the story -- already familiar to those who saw the movie  "Sid &amp; Nancy" -- is well told with equal amounts of perverse fascination  and weary revulsion, and offers considerable insight into both youth alienation  and the music business.  </P> <P> Monk (curiously referred to in the third person, despite the journal-like  format of the book) is the disgusted baby-sitter who thought he'd seen it all,  but learned quickly that he was quite mistaken. Also mistaken were those  associated with the jaunt who thought it would forever change the face of  popular culture. The inescapable conclusion is that for all its celebrated  importance, the most lasting aspect of the Pistols' moment of anarchic glory  was its futility. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

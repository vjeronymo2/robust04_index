			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRICE GIVES $1.8 MILLION FOR PUBLIC INTEREST CHAIR AT USD  </P> <P> San Diego financier and retailer Sol Price announced Wednesday a $1.8-million  gift to the University of San Diego to support a permanent professorial chair  in public interest law intended to make state government regulatory agencies  more accountable to the public.  </P> <P> The funds will pay for a full-time faculty member at the USD Center of Public  Interest Law to train students to advocate the interests of under-represented  Californians in state courts, in the Legislature and in dealings with the more  than 60 state agencies that regulate business, the environment, law, medicine  and trade.  </P> <P> The USD center was established in 1980 by USD law professor Robert Fellmeth, an  original member of public watchdog Ralph Nader's "Nader's Raiders." The center  has sponsored legislation, initiated lawsuits and carried out detailed studies  on a variety of consumer-interest issues.  </P> <P> The work has included studies of the state's system of disciplining doctors and  lawyers, of the way that the Lottery Commission used its money for advertising,  and of the way state policies address child abuse and child welfare.  </P> <P> "I strongly feel that, as government gets more complex, you need enthusiastic  students to keep throwing light on the process," Price said in announcing his  gift. The USD center, with 13 staff members, oversees 50 student interns who  first study regulatory agencies and the law, and then carry out advocacy  projects. Center graduates now include city attorneys specializing in consumer  fraud in Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Diego, as well as the staff counsels  to state legislative judiciary committees and the director of a consumer-based  network monitoring utilities.  </P> <P> "It's important that someone challenge the system," Price said. "State agencies  start out protecting the public, but soon industry ends up owning the board or  commission."  </P> <P> Price, an attorney by training and longtime Democratic Party activist, founded  the Price Club wholesale warehouse chain in 1976, which last year had revenues  of more than $5 billion. Based on revenue, Price Club is the largest San  Diego-based business and more than twice the size of San Diego Gas &amp;  Electric Co., the second largest.  </P> <P> Price and his wife, Helen, established the Price Family Charitable Trust, which  contributed $1 million to the San Diego Hospice in honor of grandson Aaron  Price. He also gave $2 million to UCSD for its student center named after his  family.  </P></p>

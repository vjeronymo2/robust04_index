			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Garfinckel's Owner Files for Bankruptcy: The owner of the upscale District of  Columbia department store chain Garfinckel's said it has filed for Chapter 11  bankruptcy protection and will liquidate the inventories at its nine stores.  </P> <P> Garfinckels Holding Co. also said it has laid off 200 of its 850 employees.  Investors rescued the company from a financial crisis in 1988 by recruiting new  management and providing funding. The retailer attributed part of its woes to  the fact that it had changed hands five times since the early 1980s, resulting  in different marketing strategies that "significantly impaired" its image among  customers.  </P></p>

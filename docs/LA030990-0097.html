			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: CHAYA IN VENICE FEATURES A DIFFERENT LOOK AND MENU  </P> <P> "And thank you for your continuous support," reads the last line.  </P> <P> No, it's not another new line of alcoholic pop. It is the elegant announcement  of the equally elegant Chaya Venice, 110 Navy St., Venice, (213) 396-1179,  which opened last week near the corner of Main and Rose streets.  </P> <P> This spacious new Chaya looks different than its siblings, trendy Chaya  Brasserie (meeting place of agents and actors) and tiny Chaya Diner (where the  hip pinch pennies). It's got a different menu too: You'll find Chaya's  signature cross-cultural mix  </P> <P> with its elements of Italy, Japan and California, but here the emphasis is on  fish.  </P> <P> I tried a seaweed salad sprinkled with tiny fried fish and a rather wonderful  concoction consisting of shrimp-stuffed jalapenos that were deep-fried and  served with guacamole. My favorite entree was crispy catfish in mustard sauce;  my least favorite was a sort of sweet soup called "fish chili."  </P> <P> The wine list here, as at Chaya Brasserie, is innovative, well-priced and  doesn't contain a single alcoholic pop.

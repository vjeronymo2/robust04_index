			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Zubov, Krasnoyarsk Kray </F> administration head, by Viktor Yukechev, under rubric "In  Today's Issue: On the Eve of the Event," and subrubric  "Evaluations and Forecasts": "What Does the Head Think About  After It Gets into Parliament?: (Correct answers: `about its  region' -- one point, `about Siberia' -- two points, `about  Russian regional policy' --three points.)"]    [Text] On 10 January, on the eve of the first session  of the new Federal Assembly, the Council of the Siberskoye  Soglasheniye [Siberian Agreement] Interregional Association will  convene in Moscow. In order to elect a new chairman and work out  the tactics for interaction (confrontation?) with the  parliament, since 14 of the 19 territories that make up the  Association are represented in the Federation Council by their  heads.    Our correspondent met with Valeriy Zubov, governor of  Krasnoyarsk Kray, who, in Sibirskoye Soglasheniuye, heads the  Coordination Council on Finance and Investments. The meeting  occurred shortly before Zubov's departure to Moscow.    [Yukechev] Valeriy Mikhaylovich, how do you evaluate the  fact  that almost all the governors who ran for election have been  elected to the upper house of the new parliament? And how are  you planning to handle this victory?    [Zubov] Well, I wouldn't call it a victory, since I do not  see anyone who has been defeated. The population supported not  so much the personalities, as I understand the situation, as  they did the leaders of their regions. Since, whereas the State  Duma has to be oriented on the resolution of Russia-wide  problems, the Federation Council has to carry out expert  deliberations concerning the draft versions of laws with the  object of taking the interests of the regions into  consideration. That idea has reached the population, and it  voted for its rights.    How will our "faction" behave in the Federation Council? I  think that, rather quickly, we shall become coordinated and  begin working on the formulation of a regional policy.    [Yukechev] A regional policy, in its turn, consists of  several policies. One of them is finance and credit policy.  Wherein can the participation of Sibirskoye Soglasheniye and  specifically your participation in its formulation be expressed?    [Zubov] First, in influence on the Russia-wide financial  situation. There is truly a misalignment of the interests here.  We are exporting regions. Our welfare depends directly upon how  Russia-wide export is carried out. Suffice it to state that  Krasnoyarsk Kray exports more than Moscow, Moscow Oblast, St.  Petersburg, and Leningrad Oblast. In addition, there are Tyumen  and Irkutsk Oblast. If one looks at history, those regions were  assimilated largely in order to produce output for export. But  today the finance and credit policy does not promote the  development of export as a whole, or, consequently, those  regions. It is an absurd situation when three of the world's  largest aluminum plants are in a critical state.    We are putting our country's energy system in a critical  situation, because the basic systems with a surplus of energy  are here in Siberia. Our cheapest coal is here, but it is  unprofitable to export it. As for our basic timber resources,  once again we cannot export them. What do we want to get as a  result? A short-term effect, when the ruble is stable and it is  used to support branches that are operating exclusively on  imported raw materials and equipment? Or do we want to develop  our own production, which is capable not only of satisfying the  country's needs, but also of producing output for export? Those  are the key reasons why the Siberian regions occupy a special  position.    [Yukechev] Are you talking about an incorrect choice of  priorities?    [Zubov] Yes.    [Yukechev] In that instance, how do you propose carrying out  a re-evaluation of priorities? It is possible, with the same  people, to sit down next to one another and try to understand  one another better. It is also possible to exert an influence on  federal policy by other methods: by lobbying, by promoting one's  own people... Which methods seem to you to be the most  acceptable?    [Zubov] The most acceptable path, which, properly speaking,  is the one that Sibirskoye Soglasheniye proceeded along until  today, is negotiations. For example, when our council on  foreign-economic activity began operating, we attempted there,  together with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and MID  [Ministry of Foreign Affairs], to find those points where things  were advantageous both for Russia and for Siberia. So far as I  know, that kind of conversation with the northwest region did  not occur. Or if we are convinced that, in this short period of  time, the so-called Russia-wide interests must predominate, then  we shall agree with that, or it will be necessary to agree with  us: we cannot place three-fourths of Russia in a very serious  situation for the sake of abstract stabilization on the rest of  the territory.    If all the financial resources are pulled into Moscow and  St.  Petersburg, what then about Siberia, "the territory of  progress," to use Chernomyrdin's expression? Therefore we shall  undertake efforts, as we have done up until now, to concentrate  the financial means here -- in order to resolve regional  problems. Putting it more succinctly, our task is to influence  Russia-wide policy so that it will be advantageous for the  regions.    [Yukechev] What effect can the increase in the  transportation  rates have in the Siberian territories?    [Zubov] A bad one, of course. It is necessary to weigh  carefully which is more beneficial -- either to guarantee the  profitability of the branches and regions situated on the  Transsib [Trans-Siberian Railroad] by subsidizing the mainline,  or to subsidize individual branches and individual regions.    Nonferrous metallurgy (50 percent of the total industrial  production), and the timber and coal industries, constitute the  basis of the kray's economy. Two of these three branches depend  entirely on the Transsib. So let's figure out which is more  advantageous.    [Yukechev] But what if, as has happened in the past, no one  listens to the voice of the regions?    [Zubov] When the negotiations fail, lobbying begins, by  urging along people who understand, who share our views. There's  nothing new about this.    [Yukechev] You know, better than I do, that the rate of  budgetary support in the various Siberian regions differs. The  difference sometimes is too great. Is that normal?    [Zubov] Krasnoyarsk Kray is among the five largest taxpayers  into the Russian budget. It has developed that, for many decades  the state, in a concentrated manner, invested funds into certain  regions. Therefore they also proved to be in a preferential  position. Of course, Krasnoyarsk Kray was developed by the  entire country, like the Togliatti Automobile Plant. But it is  necessary to help the other "weak" regions not at the expense of  the collapse of the strong ones, which are obliged to be  economically more supported at the expense of the taxes  collected from themselves.    A single standard for deductions to be paid into the budget  is possible in the event that part of the budget will be  redistributed in a purposeful manner to those regions that have  previously been declared to be depressed or undeveloped, for  which certain terms are created: over a period of, for example,  ten years of state support they will reach the level of  self-support. In this part, I must say, the federal government  is proceeding correctly today -- this is approximately the way  that the 1994 budget is being formed.    [Yukechev] But is it possible to return to the idea of a  consolidated budget within the framework of Sibirskoye  Soglasheniye?    [Zubov] No, it's impossible. This is a completely  unnecessary  idea. Today we must not reconsider the borders, or introduce new  territorial or national formations. It is possible only to unite  the budgets, according to the wishes of the territories, to  resolve completely local tasks. But one cannot speak about a  single budget, otherwise this problem will change over to the  political plane...    [Yukechev] Can you give examples of these specific programs?    [Zubov] Yes. For example, Agrosib. A quota for the timber in  Krasnoyarsk Kray was allocated to that program, with the  assumption that the proceeds from that will go into developing  the processing of agricultural output in the Siberian regions.    [Yukechev] For Russia as a whole, the reprocessing of waste  products is a vitally important problems. In addition to those  waste products of our own that we have enough of, the European  countries are ready to sell us more... At the same time, there  have been proposals from abroad: to give us modern technological  systems and even investments, if only we build reprocessing  enterprises in our country. What is your attitude to this?    [Zubov] I want to talk only about the reprocessing of waste  products from nuclear electric-power stations. They are being  stored today. There exists a definite period of time during  which they can simply lie around. But if we do not build  enterprises to reprocess them within the next 16 years, we shall  finding waiting for us an ecological catastrophe that is more  terrible than the Chernobyl disaster. There are two methods for  resolving this problem: either find budgetary money to build  those enterprises, or earn money from having those waste  products brought to us. For us, only the second path is  economically possible: we do not enough of a budget today. The  cost of one such modern plant is approximately equal to the  kray's budget (but in dollars). It is necessary to provide the  opportunity to a nuclear enterprise (Krasnoyarsk, Tomsk,  Chelyabinskny situation) to earn money for building a processing  plant. France acts this way, for example, and there's no problem  -- it's normal. And our technological systems do not yield to  the French ones.    [Yukechev] Does that mean, then, that you are ready to  consider specific investment proposals?    [Zubov] We are already considering them.    [Yukechev] That sounds optimistic.    [Zubov] No, it sounds pessimistic. Because all it will take  is to have five energetic people come and stir up the entire  population, and everything will go to rack and ruin... You  cannot make decisions like this at rallies. And if you do make  them, then there should be mention of your name in the  newspapers: so that your descendants will know who made that  decision. Just as, incidentally, they should know who made the  decision to build the plant, who signed the contracts. In any  instance the person's name should be known.    [Yukechev] I have heard that Krasnoyarsk has announced its  candidacy for conducting the 2002 Goodwill Games. Do you hope  that this question will be resolved to our advantage?    [Zubov] Yes. Most of the sports federations have already  supported this idea. I must say that when, in 1982, the winter  sports days were held in Krasnoyarsk for the first time, and the  next ones were also set up here, we were convinced that we can  do things normally.    [Yukechev] Well, then, we also wish you luck in this matter.    [Zubov] Well, I think that all Siberians should give us  moral  support too.</p>

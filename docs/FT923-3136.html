			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Greece will not waver on austerity MR Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, has said the government's commitment to its new economic adjustment programme will not be weakened, however fierce the opposition from the trade unions, writes Kerin Hope from Athens. Mr Mitsotakis told businessmen attending a conference in Salonica at the weekend: 'We're not going to abandon the battle for a healthy, modern economy. There can be no going back.' Earlier, electricity, bank and transport workers announced they would continue a strike protesting against reform of the state pension system, now in its third week. Mr Mitsotakis said that efforts to trim the public sector deficit would start yielding results this year, with government borrowing reduced to 10 per cent of gross domestic product, and a budget surplus of Dr200bn (Pounds 573m). He predicted that inflation, currently 15.1 per cent, would drop below 10 per cent next year, enabling the drachma to join the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS within 1993. Greece is the only EC member still outside the ERM. Growth this year would be around 1.5 per cent, he said.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Merger activity highest for two years Mergers and acquisitions among UK companies have increased for the first time in two years, according to figures published yesterday that bolster government attempts to focus on economic recovery. In the last quarter of 1993, companies spent a total of Pounds 2.7bn on domestic takeovers compared with Pounds 1.2bn in the third quarter, the Central Statistical Office said. The increase pushed the annual value of mergers and acquisitions up to Pounds 6.8bn, a 17 per cent rise over 1992. Welcoming the signs of higher corporate activity, the Confederation of British Industry said: 'This is a reflection of the growing confidence in the recovery.' The CSO said 160 deals were completed in the quarter. That figure was 51 per cent ahead of the same period in 1992, reversing the downward trend for the first time since the spring of 1991. Mr Robert Hay, the CSO statistician who compiled the figures, added: 'Companies have got a bit more money to spend. Independent companies, in particular, have proved very attractive for acquisitions.' Relief at the figures was tempered, however, by the CSO's admission that just three deals accounted for 62 per cent of the total spending on takeovers in the last quarter. Most of the increase resulted from the Pounds 800m acquisition of the Pillar industrial businesses of RTZ, the mining company, by MB-Caradon, the building products and security printing group. Scottish and Newcastle, the brewing group, also made a substantial contribution to the total after agreeing to pay Grand Metropolitan Pounds 622m for its Chef and Brewer pubs subsidiary. Whitbread, meanwhile, paid Pounds 260m for a 51 per cent stake in Whitbread Investment Company, an associate group set up to protect regional brewers from takeover. However, deals worth less than Pounds 1m accounted for most of the transactions that took place. More than 200 small companies were either bought outright or merged into larger operations last year, of which 69 changed hands in the last quarter - the highest turnover for three years. The CSO said acquisitive companies funded such deals mostly from existing reserves, though they resorted to rights issues in 13 per cent of the takeovers.

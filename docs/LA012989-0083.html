			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> '89 NAHB HOMEWORK;  </P> <P> NEW PRESIDENT NAMES PANEL ON AFFORDABILITY  </P> <P> Affordability will be the major issue facing the nation's builders this year,  according to Shirley McVay Wiseman, the new president of the National Assn. of  Home Builders and the first woman to head the 157,000-member trade group.  </P> <P> Wiseman, a home builder from Lexington, Ky., and Lake Wales, Fla., who worked  in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development from 1983 to 1985, said  the NAHB has adopted as its theme this year: "Where Will Our Children Live?"  The theme was borrowed -- with permission -- from Merrill Butler, the Irvine,  Calif., builder who served as NAHB president in 1980.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appointed Task Force  </P> <P> "Moderate- and middle-income families, the best-housed people on Earth, are  discovering that, for their children, the dream of owning a home is now turning  into a nightmare," Wiseman said. "Of the nearly 59 million Americans who are  in, or who will be entering, their prime home buying ages during the next four  years, fewer than half can expect to become homeowners."  </P> <P> To address the affordability problem, Wiseman, who succeeded Dale Stuard of  Newport Beach, Calif., has appointed a task force that will come up with short-  and long-term ways to solve the problem. She emphasized that she doesn't want  another report or white paper that will gather dust on shelves, but a concise  list of ways and means to solve the nation's affordability crisis.  </P> <P> In response to a question, Wiseman said the threat to the mortgage-interest  deduction is real, not a ploy to trade for something else down the line when  Congress begins tinkering with the tax laws.  </P> <P> Stuard had said at his final press conference during the 45th annual NAHB  convention at the Georgia World Congress Center here that threats to the  mortgage-interest deduction are real in the wake of recent tax bills that have  limited the deduction and have phased out the consumer interest deductions.  There are many groups that want to eliminate the mortgage interest deduction,  Stuard said. The deduction costs the U.S. treasury about $35 billion a year,  Stuard said, making it a tempting target for Congress.  </P> <P> He said he has received a pledge from President George Bush to protect the  deduction. The first limit on the deduction was enacted in the 1986 tax bill,  when it was limited to the interest on up to $1 million of combined first-and  second-home debt.  </P> <P> At another session of the four-day convention, the largest in the association's  history, Rep. Raymond J. McGrath (R-N.Y.), a member of the House Ways and Means  Committee, said the threat to the deduction is real. He suggested that the  association should mount a strong campaign to defend the deduction.  </P> <P> Rising land costs, increases in mortgage-interest rates and the affordability  issue are among the problems that builders, polled during the convention,  expect to affect the housing industry in 1989.  </P> <P> In general, builders expect housing activity in 1989 to be slightly below 1988  levels, when 1,487,200 housing units were produced. The official NAHB  prediction is for a 7.2% decline this year, to 1,380,000 starts, with 1,010,000  single-family houses, down 6.5% from 1988, and 370,000 multifamily units, down  9.1% from 1988.  </P> <P> The poll of the 705 persons during the convention was heavily weighted toward  the South, with 39%, and the Midwest, with 34%, with only 9% from the West,  according to Kent Colton, NAHB executive vice president.  </P> <P> More than half of those surveyed said they expected mortgage-interest rates to  increase somewhat during 1989. The association has projected that rates could  reach as high as 12% by midyear, possibly drifting downward toward the end of  the year. More than three-fourths of those polled expected housing starts to be  about the same or somewhat less than in 1988.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Housing Industry Problems  </P> <P> Of the many problems facing the nation's economy, 54% of those polled ranked  the federal deficit as the major problem, followed by 25% who thought interest  rate increases were the top problem.  </P> <P> Of the problems facing the housing industry, builders were most concerned about  the cost of land (34%), followed by interest rates (29%) and government  regulations (16%). Builders reported that housing affordability has become a  very serious (47%) or somewhat serious (40] problem for first-time buyers.  </P> <P> Remodeling, once the poor relative of the building industry, has become a major  factor in recent conventions, with this convention showing the most attention  paid to this $100-billion-a-year industry, Colton said. Of those polled during  the convention, 71% said that remodeling activity would be "fair or good to  excellent" in 1989. Colton said that remodeling activity is expected to reach  $105 billion to $110 billion this year, up sharply from $70 billion in 1984.  </P> <P> Today's affluent homeowners are willing to travel farther to work to get the  larger, more elaborate houses they want when they move up from their current  ones, according to yet another survey released at the convention. This one is  based on 1,776 homeowners who have purchased houses insured by the Home Owners  Warranty (HOW) program since 1980.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dream Seems Attainable  </P> <P> These affluent baby-boomers plan to buy a house with about 2,360 square feet --  about 30% larger than their current homes -- with a median price of $125,000.  About 16% plan to spend $200,000 or more for that move-up dream home. With a  median household income of $53,412 -- 20% of the respondents made $75,000 or  more -- the dream of moving up seems attainable.  </P> <P> Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, cited and praised the  stability of the past six years in the economy in general and the housing  industry in particular in a speech to the association's board of directors on  the final day of the convention.  </P> <P> Greenspan said the past six years have seen single-family starts at or slightly  above the 1 million per year mark, consistent with demographic trends, such as  household formations, which are averaging 1.5 million a year.  </P> <P> Most of Greenspan's half-hour address was positive, but he also cited the  nation's declining home ownership rate -- this decade is the first to see the  ownership rate decline (currently about 64% contrasted with the peak of 65.4%  in 1981) -- and the sharp division between the generally affluent homeowners  and all too often poor renters.  </P> <P> Renters typically earn less than 60% of what homeowners make and the gap is  widening, he said. Builders must address the problems of affordability,  including constructing more affordable rental units in the face of tax laws  that discourage such construction, but Greenspan promised that the Federal  Reserve Board will do its best to ensure continued financial stability.  </P> <P> The Fed chairman said that major growth areas of the building industry in the  next few years will be remodeling and construction of move-up houses, along  with a growing market share (currently about 5%) in the second-home market.  </P></p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: Locked-up value keeps investors keen - The long-term prospects for Mannesmann's telecoms business Half-year results at Mannesmann, one of the largest industrial companies in Germany, were dire even by the standards of the country's struggling engineering sector. The shares, however, have continued to display a remarkable degree of relative stock market strength. The group made a six-month loss of DM467m (Dollars 291.9m) on unchanged sales of DM12.8bn. This compared with a net profit of DM15m in the first half of last year, and was worse than analysts' gloomy expectations. Since the figures were announced - on August 19 - Mannesmann's shares have dropped from DM333.20 to DM325 last week, a decline of 2.4 per cent. This compares with a 1 per cent fall in the DAX index of 30 leading German shares over the period. In fact, Mannesmann shares remain close to the year's high of DM340, which shows the company remains a favourite with investors, especially US institutional investors whose buying has driven the strong rise in the German equity market in recent months. The shares are 36 per cent higher than they were at the beginning of the year. Since the start of June, they have outperformed the DAX by around 16 per cent. The attractions of Mannesmann for investors are not obvious: like other German engineering groups, it has been hit hard by the worldwide fall in demand for capital goods, recession in Germany, the impact of a strong D-Mark on its exports, and by the costs of implementing rationalisation measures. As a result, not a single one of its six operating divisions - spanning a range of engineering activities from steel pipe manufacturing to plant construction and automotive components - made a profit in the first half. And the group suggested there was little room for improvement in its core businesses during the second half of the year. In part, what is true for Mannesmann holds true for the German market as a whole: investors are willing to ignore the bleak earnings outlook for the current year and look ahead to next year and beyond for economic recovery and a revival in profitability. Engineering companies, the so-called 'cyclical stocks' - in theory poised to make the most of recovery in 1994-95  -have been at the centre of investors' buying interests. In the case of Mannesmann, investors' optimism is pinned less on generalised expectations of recovery, than on specific hopes for the D2 mobile telecommunications network operated by Mannesmann's Mobilfunk subsidiary. Mannesmann has been developing this business since 1989, when it won one of two digital cellular radio licences awarded in Germany. The move into mobile telecommunications was part of a strategy of reducing the group's dependence on the capital goods sector, and on its traditional pipes activities. It went hand in hand with a series of acquisitions in the automotive components sector: since 1987-88 the group has spent an estimated DM4bn buying companies such as Fichtel &amp; Sachs and Boge - which both specialise in suspension systems - and VDO, which makes instrumentation panels. Turnover in this area was DM6.5bn. The strategic sense of making a commitment to the components sector just ahead of a significant downturn in the European car industry is open to doubt. Like all other parts of the group's business, automotive technology is lossmaking. By contrast, the move into mobile telecommunications is seen as a masterstroke on the part of chief executive Mr Werner Dieter. Up until now, Mobilfunk has been a heavy drain on the group's resources. According to Alan Coats, an analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London, D2 is likely to cost Mannesmann and its minority partners on the project DM3bn before it breaks even at the operational level next year. The future prospects, however, are deemed to be exceedingly bright. Mannesmann is estimated to have around 60 per cent of the German market for wireless communications. This market has enormous growth prospects, as the so-called 'cellular penetration rate' - the number of subscribers as a percentage of the population - is far behind US and UK levels. In 1992, that rate was 1.1 per cent in Germany compared with 4 per cent in the US, 2.5 per cent in the UK, and 8 per cent in Sweden. After technical problems led to a year's delay in introducing the D2 network, the number of Mannesmann's subscribers went from zero to 117,000 last year. Last week, the group said there were more than 200,000 subscribers at the half-way stage, better than expectations. Mannesmann's exposure to the sector is likely to mean a strong and growing contribution to profits from late 1994 onwards. As if to underscore the value inherent in Mannesmann's D2 business, AT &amp; T's Dollars 12.4bn acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications was announced just days before Mannesmann unveiled its disastrous interim figures. Like Mannesmann Mobilfunk, McCaw is a lossmaking company with enormous potential - potential which convinced AT &amp; T to make one of the largest takeovers in US corporate history. The big US company has concentrated investors' minds on the potential value locked up in Mannesmann Mobilfunk.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (3): Floor them with your poise - The advantages of staying in executive territory The intriguing question about executive floors is why anyone chooses to stay in any other part of a five-star hotel. It is not just that the services offered on executive floors are superior to those elsewhere in the hotel - though they are. It is that executive or business floors make sense financially: they usually cost Dollars 20 to Dollars 40 more a night than rooms in other parts of the hotel. But that includes a free breakfast and complimentary snacks and drinks. Stay on an ordinary floor and you will pay for breakfast, as well as for snacks and drinks from the minibar in your room. Breakfast on its own could cost you Dollars 20 or more. You could well end up paying no more for your executive floor room than for accommodation elsewhere in the hotel. Tell Mr Geoffrey Breeze, corporate vice president for marketing at Hilton International, that you do not understand why his guests stay anywhere other than on an executive floor and he replies: 'We don't understand it either.' Mr Breeze says there might be some kind of psychological barrier which inhibits guests from staying on executive floors. It is more likely that hotel guests think that booking a room on an executive floor will not go down well with the cost-cutting managements in their companies. Even though executive floors might not end up costing more, they do not provide the impression of austerity that many companies are seeking to enforce through their corporate travel policies. Hilton International, which is owned by Ladbroke, the UK leisure and gaming group, has had executive floors since the 1970s. However, the idea of having separate floors for higher-paying guests really took off in Asia during the 1980s. The idea was to cater for business travellers who were looking for that added bit of comfort and convenience. In most of the international hotel chains with executive floors, guests who use them do not check in or out at the reception desk in the lobby. Instead, they go straight up to the business floor and check in at a dedicated check-in desk. They usually eat their free breakfast in a dining room on the executive floor, separate from that used by other guests in the hotel. Most executive floors have meeting rooms which guests can use free of any additional charge. There are facsimile machines, often in the rooms themselves. Many of the executive floors have libraries, with business books and trade directories. Most business floors offer newspapers and business magazines. The rooms on the executive floors are furnished to a higher standard than in other parts of the hotel. Executive floors have become so popular in Asia that the Inter-Continental resort hotel in Bali, Indonesia, has an entire executive wing, complete with its own swimming pool. Executive floors have now spread to other parts of the world, too. Inter-Continental this year inaugurated its first executive floors in Europe; they can now be found in the Inter-Continental in Frankfurt and at the Churchill Inter-Continental in London. In the Middle East, the chain has business floors in several locations, including Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Executive floors are common in North America. And Inter-Continental now has business floors under construction in Latin America. Of Hilton International's 132 hotels, 64 now have business floors. About 10 per cent of the chain's total room stock is located on executive floors. The idea of the business floor, Mr Breeze says, is 'to provide the atmosphere and attention to detail you might get in a private club but with the full support of an international hotel behind it.' Mr Breeze says Hilton International's customer surveys have indicated that different nationalities appear to have different reasons for wanting to stay on an executive floor. 'British respondents to the survey see the executive floor more as a place to relax than respondents from some other countries, who see it as a place to get work done. Germans are interested in using executive floors to entertain their guests, to have meetings and to do business.' Ms Melanie Baker, of Inter-Continental, offers another attraction of executive floors, based on her own experience. 'For a woman, it provides an extra feeling of security,' she says. In some of Inter-Continental's hotels  -in San Francisco, for example - access to the executive floor can only be gained through the use of a special key in the lift. While the desire for security and freedom from attack or harassment is a universal phenomenon, Mr Breeze says other aspects of executive floors have to be adapted for different markets. In more libertarian countries, executive floors might offer free alcoholic drinks throughout the day. In countries where drinking is frowned on, alcohol might be available only in the evening. In cities with a wide range of restaurants, Hilton International has found that most of the executive floor guests go out for dinner, but then expect to be offered late night drinks and coffee. In countries where the anti-tobacco lobby is particularly powerful, non-smoking executive floors are provided. Whatever claims international hotel chains make for executive floors, they have undeniably introduced a class system into five-star establishments. Some guests get better treatment than others. Unlike the economy class airline passengers who are forced to walk through first and business class on their way to their cramped, inferior seats, ordinary hotel guests do not have the superior privileges of executive floor customers shoved in their faces. Nevertheless, if executive floor guests can have such additional services as complimentary breakfast and a library, why can these facilities not be extended to all guests staying in what is, after all, a top-class establishment? Hoteliers argue that all they are doing is responding to market demand: they have identified a proportion of their customers who want the additional facilities and services. If this number grows, the number of executive floors will be increased. What the hotel chains insist they will not do is follow the airlines, which routinely upgrade customers from economy to business class. Requests for an upgrade from a room without a view to one with one will be considered. But a transfer to the executive floor will be politely refused, such hotels say. If guests want to stay on an executive floor, they will have to pay for it.</p>

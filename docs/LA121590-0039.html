			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> IN A BIG TWIST, POLY TURNS TO ITS PASSING AND DEFENSE  </P> <P> Who would have guessed?  </P> <P> All season long, Poly High had relied on its bone-jarring rushing attack to  succeed, yet when push came to shove in Friday night's City Section 3-A  Division championship game against Lincoln at East Los Angeles College, it was  the Parrots' passing game and defense that made the critical plays in a 28-8  victory.  </P> <P> Sure, Jonathan Campbell rushed for 182 yards in 31 carries. And sure, Poly  amassed 273 rushing yards and 386 yards in offense.  </P> <P> But big pass plays and big defensive plays -- by wide receiver-defensive back  Mike Vreeland and tight end-linebacker Gerardo Munoz in particular -- proved  decisive in the Parrots' first true City football title.  </P> <P> Poly (11-3) had won five previous titles -- the most recent in 1928 -- before  the implementation of a playoff format in 1934. Before that, the champion was  either the City League titlist or was determined by a consensus vote of City  officials.  </P> <P> Poly, the East Valley League runner-up to Sylmar, established dominance on the  offensive line on its first drive, marching 75 yards in 14 plays for a 7-0  lead.  </P> <P> Thirteen of Poly's plays were runs, except for Vreeland's 15-yard reception of  a Lance Garcia pass on a third-and-nine play from the Lincoln 18-yard line.  Garcia, who completed four of four passes for 113 yards, scored on a two-yard  run two plays later.  </P> <P> "We saw it open all night," Vreeland, a junior, said of the pass play. "We were  just waiting for (Coach Fred Cuccia) to give us the call and he did. It was  man-to-man coverage and we knew we could take them man to man."  </P> <P> After Lincoln (9-4-1) had taken an 8-7 lead on a 21-yard touchdown pass from  quarterback Gaspar Ortega to his brother Marcelo, a wide receiver, Munoz got  into the act.  </P> <P> On Poly's ensuing possession, the Parrots were faced with a third and 11 from  their own 28. Garcia and Munoz then hooked up for a 40-yard pass that gave the  Parrots a first and 10 at the Lincoln 32. A personal foul on the Tigers moved  the ball to the 17. Five plays later, Campbell scored on a three-yard run that  gave Poly a 13-8 lead.  </P> <P> After punts by each team, Lincoln drove to the Poly 26, but Vreeland  intercepted an Ortega pass at the 15 and returned it to the Parrots' 40.  </P> <P> "I just happened to be in the right spot," Vreeland said of his first  interception of the season. "The ball was there and I took it back the best I  could."  </P> <P> Poly then marched 60 yards in eight plays -- capped by Garcia's two-yard run --  to take a 19-8 lead with 32 seconds left in the half.  </P> <P> Seven of the plays were runs, but Garcia's 44-yard hookup with Vreeland on a  third and 10 from the Poly 40 keyed the drive.  </P> <P> With Poly leading, 22-8, late in the third quarter, Lincoln drove to the  Parrots' 39-yard line, but defensive lineman Pedro Medina recovered Fernie  Delgadillo's fumble, and Poly reeled off a 13-play, 61-yard march.  </P> <P> On Lincoln's next series, the Tigers marched to the Poly one but couldn't  score.  </P> <P> On a third and goal from the one, Poly defensive back Danny Martinez knocked  down an Ortega pass in the left corner of the end zone. After an  illegal-procedure penalty on Lincoln, Munoz deflected a pass intended for  Marcelo Ortega in the right corner of the end zone.  </P> <P> "Coach told me I had to cover my man," Munoz said, "and I just followed him and  did the best I could."  </P></p>

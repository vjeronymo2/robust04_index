			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Universal suffrage Lord Rothschild's psychic powers were at full stretch this week as St James's Place Capital added to its holding of GUS voting shares just before the vast majority of shares were enfranchised. While the terms of compensation to the voting shares were perhaps a little disappointing, and the share price response relatively muted, Lord Rothschild's main reward has come in the outperformance of GUS's voting shares against non-voting equity since the turn of the year. Indeed, that rise may be one reason why the Wolfson Foundation finally acted on a suggestion which has been floating around for a generation. The Foundation may also have felt more able to let go of its security blanket because the threat of a bid is now remote. The equalised voting and non-voting shares seem to have settled out at around Pounds 19 in the market, while the net worth is only Pounds 13.35 a share. With bids at a 25-year low, that is hardly likely to attract a predator. Yet the dilution in Foundation votes from outright control to less than 2.5 per cent of the equity certainly exposes the board to more institutional pressure. Companies with substantial cash and strong cash flows get plenty of encouragement to put the money to work. True, GUS's earnings and dividend record is enviable, but the current yield is hardly generous, and piling the company's money into gilts will hardly provide long-term growth. Perhaps the spark will come from one of the new non-executive board appointments. Lord Wolfson of Marylebone, the current chairman, may possibly be considering retirement. Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale has done a sterling job at Next, and is a possible replacement. Since these changes seem designed to release value for shareholders, he may now consider disposal of high value brands such as Burberry. Perhaps other parts such as mail order will be floated off. The extra cash which property or financial services do not need may even find its way back into shareholders' pockets.</p>

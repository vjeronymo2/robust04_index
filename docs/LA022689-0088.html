			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS MOVED TO SHELTERS  </P> <P> New York City has implemented a new policy to transfer psychiatric patients  from city hospitals directly to homeless shelters to relieve overcrowding in  psychiatric wards, officials said. "We are going to try it on a small scale,"  said First Deputy Mayor Stanley Brezenoff. "If it doesn't work, we won't  continue it." Dr. Luis Marcos, vice president for mental hygiene at the city's  Health and Hospitals Corp., said work has started to provide 46 beds at two  shelters in Manhattan and Brooklyn with mental health services. Critics of the  new plan, however, said all it does is shift patients from one city agency to  another without solving any problems. Experts have traced the city's current  homeless problem to a longstanding decision by the state to release tens of  thousands of psychiatric patients without any medical supervision.  </P></p>

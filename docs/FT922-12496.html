			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / N-station stays shut NUCLEAR Electric, the state-owned nuclear power utility, will have to carry out more safety work on its Trawsfynydd station in north Wales before the safety authorities will allow it to restart. The station has been shut down for 15 months because of concern about embrittlement in its ageing Magnox reactors. The utility said on Thursday that the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate had not accepted the case for returning the reactor to service for six months.</p>

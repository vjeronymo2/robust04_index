			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Collecting: NY art moves uptown / Explore a thriving area of the Manhattan market WHILE MORE and more galleries in SoHo, Manhattan's centre of the avant-garde, seem to be putting up the 'Gone Away' signs, any impression that the New York art market has totally collapsed is quickly dispelled by a visit to the Uptown, Gagosian Gallery on Madison Avenue at 76th Street. It is a hive of activity and in the beautiful penthouse space there is a feeling that, like Larry Gogosian himself, the artists he exhibits, and the collectors who buy from him, one has arrived. Gagosian, who specialises in Contemporary Art, has been here just two and a half years. He has irritated a lot of people: 'A few short years ago he was selling posters out of a shopfront in Los Angeles,' said Time Magazine. He has mounted a number of well-received, museum-type shows that focus on an 'historic' aspect of Modern art: Jackson Pollock's 'Black Enamel' paintings of 1981; Cy Twombley's 'Bolsona Series' of 1969 and Warhol's 'Shadow Paintings' of 1979 are just some of these. A show made up of Sam Francis's 'Blue Ball' pictures of 1963 opens at the gallery, on May 15. All of these artists had their careers nurtured in the traditional way by being 'signed on' with a particular gallery which had exclusive rights to their work. Now Gagosian is selling it - resale art it is called - and some people are cross. When an artist is dead there is not much anyone can do about it but when Gagosian exhibits - as he has done recently - 'hot' contemporary artists such as David Salle and Brice Marden who have always shown with the prestigious Mary Soone Gallery fur tends to fly. Gagosian also owns (with Leo Castelli) a gallery in SoHo called 65 Thompson Street and London dealer Kate Ganz has, with New York's Jamie C Lee, mounted an exceptional exhibition of drawings from Titian to Jasper Johns at this venue until May 11. Gagosian (Uptown) is a good starting point for a tour of the best New York has to offer. The Ariadne Galleries on Madison Avenue at 76th Street, specialise in Classical Antiquities. This is a friendly place with intimate museum-type displays on three floors. Engraved gems that might date from the 3rd millennium BC, attic black-figure vases, votive terracottas, bronzes, and marble sculptures are all featured. Prices range from about Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,117) for a small terracotta to Dollars 2m. The galleries occasionally host special exhibitions: Celtic pieces are being assembled for a 'European Art of the Migration Period' show. Down the road Antiquarium also sells classical antiques with a focus on ancient glass and jewellery ranging from Dollars 500 to Dollars 100,000. If you are furnishing a Roman villa or perhaps starting a museum, The Merrin Gallery (on Fifth Avenue at 57th Street) is where you will find ancient art. On the side streets off Madison in the 60s are several galleries which specialise in paintings - Wildenstein, Richard York - as well as Old Master dealers, Colnaghi, Piero Corsini and Newhouse. Old Master drawings dealers Hermine Chivian-Cobb, Bob Haboldt, Mark Brady and Mia Wiener (all by appointment) and private paintings-dealer, Otto Naumann, are in the 70s. Colnaghi and Newhouse both feature special exhibitions with good catalogues from time to time: a pair of beautiful paintings by Guardi, a 17th century still-life by Willem Glaesz Heda, a large landscape by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, and a charming 18th century 'Flowerpiece' by a lesser-known Flemish painter, Pieter Faes were highlights of a recent Newhouse exhibition. Bob Haboldt, who has recently set up in Paris, specialises in Old Master paintings and drawings. He has some fine Dutch drawings including a busy black chalk 'Scene on the ice' signed and dated 1672, by Jan Van Goyen; a pen and brown wash drawing of 'A dancing lesson' that is preparatory for an engraving of 1620 by Crispin van de Passe; and a red chalk study of a classical statue by the Utrecht painter, Cornelis van Poelenburch. This sheet has the most beautiful wash drawing of a rocky terrain on the back. Haboldt also has several attractive 18th century watercolour views of Amsterdam and a typical Frans Keisermann watercolour of an Italian hilltown. At Dollars 17,000 this is one of the dealer's more modest items. For fine furniture, the top places in this district are Florian Papp, Israel Sack, Stair &amp; Co, Vernay &amp; Jussell, and French &amp; Co. For the most sumptuous assemblies of furniture, paintings and the decorative arts with an emphasis on French 18th century, Didier Aaron (on 67th Street) and Rosenberg &amp; Stiebel (57th) are the main emporiums. Rosenberg &amp; Stiebel has recently expanded into a second floor and is branching out into contemporary realist art; but their main focus will remain 18th century France. Their newly refurbished premises has a main gallery with smaller 'treasuries' leading off it and highlighting their current display is a truly exquisite neo-classical chimneypiece from Madame du Barry's Pavilion at Louveciennes. The piece, in marble with gilt bronze embellishments, was designed by Claude-Nicolas Ladoux and the metalwork is by the most famous bronze-gilder of the period, Pierre Gouthiere. Other rarities include a gorgeous Louis XIV gilded wood carved table and an early 18th century bronze statue of Aeneas and Anchises derived from the marble in the Tuileries Gardens by Pierre Lepautre. For antique rugs, Doris Leslie Blau on 57th Street is a must and for silver there is Shrubsole's further along the same street; Ralph M Chait has the best in Chinese porcelain; and Frank Caro, E &amp; J Frankel and Bob Ellsworth are among several dealers who specialise in Indian and Asian art. In a city where a principal topic of conversation at the moment is the collapse of the art market, these are just a few of the more specialised art dealers. None of them show any sign of putting up the 'Gone Away' notices. On the contrary, they seem to be every bit as active as the irritatingly successful Gagosian.</p>

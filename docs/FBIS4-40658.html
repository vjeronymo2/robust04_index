			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by KAZTAG correspondent Yesenkul Bekbulatova for </F> TASS]    [Text] Almaty 17 June TASS -- A rally of the Kazakh Attan  popular movement protested today in front of the Chinese Embassy  in Almaty against the Chinese nuclear test held at the Lob Nor  nuclear testing grounds 300 kilometers away from the  Kazakh-Chinese borders.    The rally supported a statement of the Kazakh Foreign  Ministry, which lamented over another nuclear test in Lob Nor  fraught with grave consequences for the regional ecology.  Kazakh residents, which have lived through the 40 years work of  the Semipalatinsk testing grounds, are especially concerned over  the fate of future generations, as well as the neighbouring  areas of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan which also have borders with  China.    "Our demand to stop tests in Lob Nor is not an interference  in Chinese internal affairs," leader of the Attan Anti-Nuclear  Movement Amantai Asylbekov told the rally. "It is concern over  the health of millions of citizens of many regional states. It  is alarming that the test was held by China while other nuclear  powers observe the nuclear test moratorium."    The peace march that began today near the Chinese Embassy  will finish on 29 August in New York City near the United  Nations headquarters. The Attan members together with U.S.  anti-nuclear activists want to attract the public attention and  pull efforts to achieve closure of all the nuclear testing  grounds throughout the world.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Eberswalde (DDP/ADN) -- After 49 years on German  soil, the Russian military officially left the town of  Eberswalde [near the Polish border] in Barnim district today.  Apart from a rearguard contingent of just under 200 men, this  means that between 25,000 and 30,000 Russian military and  civilian staff from the 20th Guards Unit have now withdrawn.  The last few are to follow in approximatelty a month.    Some 200 local residents turned up at the Russian memorial  in  good spring weather to recall those killed during the liberation  of the town in 1945. Major General Miron Pavlishin spoke at a  meeting of "good relations" between the military and the local  people and of a time in Germany that would not be forgotten. He  expressed hope that friendships would be maintained. [passage  omitted]</p>

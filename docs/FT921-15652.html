			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Letter: Fisons states its position on small and large commercial issues Sir, I was surprised to read Mr R C Johnston's letter (January 6). Considerable time has been spent by senior members of this company with him and the board of the South Yorkshire Pension Fund on the subject of the extraction of peat. His letter sought to criticise our investor relations by confusing an environmental issue of small commercial significance with a large commercial one. The extraction of peat represents only a very small part of Fisons' business and, while it is a high-profile public subject, it is not one which is of sufficient financial impact to be a matter for extended investor relations activity. We are seeking actively a solution which will be acceptable to all responsible parties and, despite vociferous opposition to peat extraction by a small minority of shareholders, Fisons' management continues to enjoy the overwhelming support of most of its private and institutional shareholders on this operational issue. By contrast, the withdrawal from sale in the US of our products Opticrom and Imferon is a matter which is of real interest and concern to all our shareholders, and so we made a statement to the Stock Exchange on the implications for the company's profitability of the problems associated with the US regulatory authority's approval for these two products. We have expended a considerable amount of time in keeping our shareholders fully informed of developments on these important issues and, within the rules laid down by the Stock Exchange, will continue to do so. I trust your readers, who include a great many of our shareholders, will not fall into the trap laid by Mr Johnston and will understand the very different nature of these two issues, and the ways in which we have sought to deal with them. Fisons recognises its responsibilities to all shareholders to maintain an open dialogue on matters of commercial management and business practice, and will continue to act in a responsible manner in the best interests of all our shareholders. D R Peters, director, Fisons, Fison House, Princes Street, Ipswich, Suffolk</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Text] Interior Minister Enrique Krauss has referred to the  individuals carrying out terrorist actions in the capital as  cowards and stupid. The minister said those actions are due to  the transfer of terrorist criminals to the so-called new model  prison. The minister minimized the importance of the 23 February  attacks. Asked if security will be increased at political  parties' offices, Enrique Krauss said:    "All appropriate measures were in place at the time of the  attacks. That is why police were able to act promptly, avoiding  possible damage to the premises or victims."    But do the latest incidents mean that terrorists are active  again?    "They have a minimal capacity for action. When they resort  to  these types of actions, which are small, despicable, and  cowardly, as usual, it means they do not have a large  capability. It is the typical action of cowards, the kind of  persons.... [changes thought] They do not have the capacity;  they are not courageous people. This is the typical action of  cowards."    Regarding the measures to be taken by police, the minister  said:    "The Carabineros and Investigative Police are investigating.  The appropriate preventive measures are in place. I want to call  the attention of the country to the fact that we are not facing  increasing terrorist activities. We are suffering from the  stupid, despicable, cowardly action of small, insignificant  groups. We have some concrete leads that we expect will lead to  the arrest of those responsible."    Krauss said no terrorist group has claimed responsibility  for  the attacks. There are people in jail because when you act in  democracy and according to the law there is a clear awareness on  how to face these incidents. Regarding (ODEP), the so-called  organization of political prisoners' relatives and friends,  Krauss said it was a group dedicated to protecting and promoting  terrorism.</p>

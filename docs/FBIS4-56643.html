			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Uruguay monitored through 5  May.    The construction industry continued to enjoy a boom during  the first quarter of the year, as shown by increased sales of  Portland cement for public and private construction, which grew  by 80 and 11 percent respectively. Sales of gas oil and fuel oil  dropped by 24 and 56 percent respectively in the first quarter.  This is an indication of the recession that has been affecting  the Uruguayan industry for over a year. A 4.3 percent drop in  the volume of milk processed at pasteurizing plants was also  registered in the said quarter. There has been an upturn in  livestock activities during this quarter, as wool exports grew  by 27 percent and the number of cattle slaughtered increased by  13.4 percent. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR in Spanish 21 Apr 94 p 9)    The executive branch decreed an average 9 percent increase  in  gasoline prices. The measure entered into effect at 0000 on 27  April. (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 27 Apr 94 p 1)    According to Uruguay's Merchant Products Chamber, the  country  exported 32.5 percent more wool during the period October  1993-March 1994 than during a similar period last year. The  country exported a total of 64,139 tonnes of wool, expressed in  terms of dirty wool. Of this total the equivalent of 10,863  tonnes was washed wool while 39,482 tonnes was industrialized  wool. The main importers of dirty wool were the United Kingdom,  the PRC, the Netherlands, Colombia, and the United States. The  main purchasers of washed wool were Germany, Italy, the PRC, and  the United States, and the main purchasers of industrialized  wool were the PRC, Italy, Germany, and Hong Kong. (Montevideo EL  PAIS 26 Apr 94 p 1)    There are two indicators of the good liquidity in the  financial system at present. One is the considerable amount of  overnight money deposited at the Central Bank on 25  April--337.5479 million pesos, at an annual rate of 29 percent.  The second is the great influx of money in the biddings for  Treasury bills in pesos with a 63-day maturity, which exceeds  100 million pesos every week. Interbank call money rates have  also suffered the consequences of good liquidity, dropping to 31  percent annually. (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 26 Apr 94  Market Indicators Section p 1)    The National Statistics Institute has reported that the  unemployment rate in Montevideo dropped by nearly 1 percent in  the first quarter of the year as compared with the corresponding  period last year. It stood at 8.1 percent. This figure, however,  does not represent a decrease in the number of people  unemployed, but rather a decline in the working population. The  retail sector is the most severely hit by unemployment, with 7.8  percent, followed by industry with a 7.5 percent unemployment  rate. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 27 Apr 94 p  7)    Construction costs were up by 7.1 percent in March, thus  registering a 9.5 percent increase so far this year. Over the  last 12 months costs have edged up by 51.6 percent. (Montevideo  EL PAIS in Spanish 27 Apr 94 Market Indicators Section p 1)</p>

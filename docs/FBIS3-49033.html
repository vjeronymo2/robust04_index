			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on news conference held on 15 December </F> by Jozsef Kasza, mayor of Subotica: "To Weather the Misery"]    [Text] At a news conference held yesterday, Mayor Jozsef  Kasza reacted to charges leveled by the SPS [Socialist Party of  Serbia] Szabadka [Subotica] organization at Tuesday's news  conference. As reported in detail by this newspaper, the grave  charges related primarily to the social policy of the local  government; the soup kitchen opened last Monday was viewed as  humiliating from the standpoint of citizens, and as a political  move whose timing coincides with the elections.    "Despite the difficult situation and the grave shortage of  money, the local government is taking every possible action to  provide for the poorest stratum of the city's residents, to  enable these people to weather the cold and the misery. The  fundamental void in the charges leveled by the gentlemen from  the SPS is that they forget to mention the fact that they were  the ones who brought this situation upon the citizens, the same  people who are now in power in the republic, and whose policies  cast the country into total isolation, and its citizens into  total misery," Jozsef Kasza said relative to the charges that  "exceed anything we have heard so far." "I agree with the  assertion that a soup kitchen is degrading, particularly in this  part of Vojvodina, one of the richest agricultural areas of  Serbia, where extremely diligent people live, people who could  earn a livelihood as a result of their work. But inappropriate  policies have brought these people to a point where they cannot  afford to buy a loaf of bread, or a single warm meal per day.  The SPS does not support our humanitarian action program,  despite the fact that they have been hauling food away from here  to other parts of the country for years. We are aware of the  identity of those who carried relief supply shipments to every  part of the former Yugoslavia; they took aid collected in  Szabadka to the battle fields, or the shipments ended up on the  black market. At this point it is the local government's  function to rescue citizens lingering below the subsistence  level. By using funds from our tight budget, and from  humanitarian aid received, we are trying to help these people  irrespective of their nationality, religion, or political  belonging. At this point, those who plundered the northern  Bacska region have tried to undermine the launching of a soup  kitchen program. They cannot succeed in this effort, however,  because the people of Szabadka are prepared to cook on hot  plates to save their fellow citizens from hunger," according to  the Szabadka mayor. The mayor expressed regrets over the fact  that the SPS, while increasingly losing ground, creates  political issues out of social welfare concerns, and in the  course of this, it uses the customary method of telling lies.  Jozsef Kasza denied that the SPS members of the municipal  committee in charge of organizing supplies for the populace were  not invited to participate in the committee's work. Compliance  with the most recent government decree is delayed because the  ministry having jurisdiction has failed to dispatch all the the  vouchers, despite repeated interventions. Citizens did not  receive their laundry detergent for September because the local  government had neither funds nor fuel to transport the detergent  from Krusevac to Szabadka. Transportation charges for bringing  the per capita rations to Szabadka frequently exceeded the worth  of goods to be transported.    Jozsef Kasza expressed regrets over the fact that a noted  professional, Dr. Rodoljub Duric, the director of the Szabadka  hospital, also joined the SPS's campaign, which is filled with  lies and is aimed at discrediting the local government. Managing  the hospital would be his primary function, but "he should, at  least, be honest as long as he entered into political  discourse," because the local government supports the hospital  by using municipal reserve funds. The mayor of Szabadka says  that it is not true that Dusan Stipanovic successfully lobbied  for the opening of a border crossing point at Bajmok-Bacsalmas;  the truth is that Stipanovic raised obstacles in the path of  opening the crossing point. Similarly, the truth is that Jozsef  Kasza negotiated with Foreign Minister Jovanovic and with the  appropriate Hungarian organizations regarding extended work  hours. Construction of facilities at the border crossing point  is also impeded by people from Bajmok encouraged by the SPS;  construction could begin upon release of the disputed area. On  the other hand, contrary to to experience of residents of other  municipalities, Szabadka residents are unable to obtain  passports for months. This could not occur if Interior Ministry  organs performed their functions and provided passports  continuously. Every citizen has a right to receive passports.    "The Szabadka local government wants peace, and tries to  conduct its affairs despite the difficult circumstances that it  experiences by no fault of its own," Mayor Jozsef Kasza said in  conclusion of yesterday's news conference.</p>

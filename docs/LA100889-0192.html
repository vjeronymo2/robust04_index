			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VYING FOR THE WORLD'S TOP CONDUCTING POST;  </P> <P> MEMBERS OF BERLIN PHILHARMONIC BEGIN VOTING TODAY TO CHOOSE A SUCCESSOR TO THE  LATE HERBERT VON KARAJAN  </P> <P> Sometime today, the 120 members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra will  gather in their meeting room in the Philharmonie, Berlin's largest concert  hall, to begin the final selection of a replacement for music director Herbert  von Karajan, who resigned his lifetime position in April, three months before  his death at the age of 81.  </P> <P> Speculation on who will be chosen by the Berlin's colleagues, as they refer to  one another, has been intense. Last spring, the musicians were besieged after a  rumor spread that they were meeting to select Karajan's replacement.  </P> <P> "There was an army of TV people, cameras, lights," said Fergus McWilliam, a  Canadian who is one of the orchestra's horn players. "You couldn't even get  through them and the more you'd protest, the more they'd disbelieve you."  </P> <P> Newspapers, meanwhile, have offered lists of possible candidates. Lorin Maazel  was described as a leading candidate by the New York Times. A Wall Street  Journal article said Maazel "heads the short list, which also includes Bernard  Haitink and Riccardo Muti."  </P> <P> All of which has not been lost on the musicians, an organized and powerful  group. "One local paper wrote a cogent article that the orchestra shouldn't  feel pressure from the international press," McWilliam said. "We're used to  pressure and being in the limelight and have a pretty good success rate at  keeping our traps shut."  </P> <P> Whatever the speculation, it is the musicians who will select the Berlin  Philharmonic's next music director, which many -- certainly the Berliners --  see as the world's top conducting job. The Berlin Cultural Senate has a  theoretical veto, but there is small chance that it might object to the  orchestra's selection.  </P> <P> Although having orchestra members choose their conductor is unheard of in the  United States, it has a long German tradition. In America, a music director is  usually chosen by a search committee, which consists of the orchestra's  management, several board members and perhaps a musician selected as the  orchestra's representative.  </P> <P> In fact, Maazel would not have been chosen as music director of the Cleveland  Orchestra in 1971 had it been up to the musicians, who awarded him only two  votes in an informal poll In contrast, most German orchestras have the right to  select not only the music director, but the other musicians as well.  </P> <P> The colleagues form two orchestras, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, which  receives a $10-million annual subsidy from the Berlin Cultural Senate and plays  110 concerts in Berlin, and the Berlin Philharmonic, which plays tours, makes  recordings and broadcasts.  </P> <P> Tradition is the central concern. In fact, the players call the Berlin  Philharmonic Orchestra a living tradition, with only Arthur Nikisch, Wilhelm  Furtwangler and Karajan as its music directors in this century. Musicians speak  proudly of playing in the Berlin style, not only of sound, but of tempo and  expression. Most conductors -- although not all -- would rather work with the  orchestra than face a battle they will probably lose over trying to make  radical changes in the Berlin style.  </P> <P> "We're very set in our ways," said Robert Platt, a trumpet player who is one of  two Americans in the orchestra. "Our repertoire is repeated over and over. So  when a conductor comes in, we know the piece and are set in our ways. There's  not too much he can change."  </P> <P> Selecting a conductor -- although certainly among their most important acts --  is not the only choice that the colleagues make. The entire orchestra is  required to attend the auditions of prospective members, who perform in full  view of the orchestra, unlike their U.S. counterparts, who usually play their  audition behind a screen.  </P> <P> After a probationary period that may last up to two years, the orchestra votes  on whether to accept the musician -- for life. While colleagues may  theoretically be fired, it is more likely that they will be moved to a less  demanding post.  </P> <P> "Life with the orchestra doesn't get dull," said Stefan Jezierski, an American  in the orchestra's horn section. "It's one urgent meeting after another, like  trying to put 120 individualists together and having them form an orchestra."  </P> <P> Of course, the orchestra's authority grants certain provisions. Karajan had the  right to veto the selection of a player he deemed unsuitable and the colleagues  have the same right, which they exercised in the widely publicized case of  clarinetist Sabine Meyer.  </P> <P> Karajan wanted to accept Meyer, and several players, though acknowledging her  technical ability, said the orchestra rejected her because her tone did not fit  with the Berlin sound, not because she was a woman, despite news accounts to  the contrary.  </P> <P> The orchestra has three women players and in fact, McWilliam said, at the time  of the Meyer incident the orchestra had already accepted its first female  colleague, Madeleine Carruzzo, a violinist who joined several years before.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the result was a bitter, divisive conflict which, along with a  dispute between Karajan and the orchestra's management, finally resulted in the  ailing conductor's resignation.  </P> <P> Make no mistake about it, this is a powerful orchestra. When a performance of  Mahler's Ninth Symphony with Claudio Abbado was scheduled in London this summer  a few days before the beginning of the orchestra's traditional vacation, the  colleagues refused, saying: "This is ridiculous," Jezierski said.  </P> <P> The selection process also reflects the musicians' viewpoint: In June, they  were told to compile a "wish list," in which every player submitted the names  of three prospective candidates -- any three candidates. For example, just  because Muti has signed a lifetime contract with the Philadelphia Orchestra and  told a press conference in May that he didn't want the Berlin job doesn't mean  he isn't in the running.  </P> <P> "There were no constraints -- anyone," Jezierski said.  </P> <P> Once the colleagues have made their choice, they plan to simply ask him if he  wants to be their conductor, secure in the knowledge that they will be nearly  impossible to turn down.  </P> <P> But despite all of this, one shouldn't imagine that the process is ticking away  with well-oiled efficiency. For if the musicians have the right to select a  conductor, it's something they haven't done often.  </P> <P> "We're really doing it for the first time," said McWilliam, who began playing  full time with the orchestra in 1985. "The 1955 election was pretty black and  white. The orchestra's choice was a confirmation, asking all those who were  against Karajan, who was the obvious candidate."  </P> <P> As a result, the "wish list" included some candidates who had only a  theoretical presence. Conductors at this level have long careers and often make  guest appearances; all of the candidates are well known to the orchestra. As  McWilliam said, the colleagues might not wish to offend someone they will have  to work with by excluding him even though they feel he would not be  appropriate.  </P> <P> "One of the arguments by those who wanted an early decision was that we know  them all," McWilliam said. "But others are more inclined to say, like climbing  a mountain, that you reach a resting spot before you begin the next leg of the  journey."  </P> <P> In general terms, the list was to be narrowed to eight "favorites" and  ultimately to two or three candidates from which the final selection would be  made. But this is not necessarily being done, depending on the source.  </P> <P> "How it is going to work is very hard to say," said Platt. "The plan has  already changed two or three times."  </P> <P> Although there is an emphasis on keeping the orchestra mostly German as far as  players' nationalities are concerned, the conductor's nationality is not so  important. Karajan was Austrian and only one possible candidate, Carlos  Kleiber, is German. At least one candidate, Muti, does not speak German, but  although this poses some difficulties, it is manageable.  </P> <P> "It doesn't really matter what they're saying if the message is clear,"  McWilliam said. "Some work in Italian, some in French; it can be a mishmash of  four languages in one sentence. It's not a big issue."  </P> <P> There is certainly no unanimity as to the first choice among the players.  Although no one was willing to name the eight favorites directly, Jezierski,  saying "Anything is really guessing," listed the those who might have received  the most votes -- in no special order -- as Kleiber, James Levine, Muti,  Haitink, Zubin Mehta, Maazel, Abbado, Leonard Bernstein and Daniel Barenboim.  "It could be any combination of those," he said, "Maybe Seiji Ozawa."  </P> <P> In keeping with the Berlin philosophy, Jezierski offered insights on some of  the candidates, but in positive terms:  </P> <P> * "Maazel has a lot of support. He's a genius, but I don't know if he's willing  to make the commitment. It would be hard to find someone better. But he doesn't  have the position at this time."  </P> <P> * "Muti and Levine have done some good concerts. Muti might prefer to be king  in Philadelphia because the music director in the United States calls the  shots. But no one knows if he wants to come to Berlin."  </P> <P> * "Bernstein hasn't expressed an interest, but if he'd want to make a  commitment it would be very interesting. A lot of people in the orchestra would  like it."  </P> <P> * "Mehta is also a possibility. He might get some votes."  </P> <P> * "Ozawa will probably also get some votes. Everyone respects him a lot, but  it's hard to say."  </P> <P> The musicians are expecting another media onslaught once the choice has been  made. "All the details will be under strict secrecy," McWilliam said. "There's  an image of being in a locked room with no phones, unable to talk to our wives.  We'll probably face that army of TV people again."  </P> <P> And whomever the colleagues choose, it will be someone who wants to work with  the orchestra as it is.  </P> <P> "Tradition is vital to the orchestra's identity, to it's self-image," McWilliam  said. "It's a responsibility handed down to us, a heritage we must preserve. We  must find an appropriate guardian for tradition and also someone who can chart  new paths, take the orchestra into the next century without a terrible break  with the past."  </P> <P> He added: "It's a breathtaking opportunity to be there when the choice is  made."  </P></p>

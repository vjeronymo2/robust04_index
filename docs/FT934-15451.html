			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Training targets 'may not be met' MORE PEOPLE need to take part in education and training if national targets are to be met, the Institute of Manpower Studies has warned. The targets, some of which stretch into the next century, were set by the Confederation of British Industry and endorsed by the government. Low levels of technical attainment have contributed to the UK declining to 13th place in the ranking of world competitiveness. The targets are criticised in a report prepared by the institute for the Department of Employment. It says the targets are not incorporated in a coherent national strategy and have a poor public profile. The report also says that the deliverers of the targets, including Training and Education Councils and the education sector, are not working in close partnership.

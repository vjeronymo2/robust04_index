			<p>CSO     [Text] These days at every congress, seminar, conference,  academic or nonacademic gathering, or law making or executive  gathering in our country, and even in private and nonofficial  public gatherings, the subject of "development" is a  controversial and ready topic.    The slogan "development" can be heard on the lips of every  real person and legal entity at every social level and class.  Although the descriptions are not that similar between the  various economic, social and cultural levels as discussed by  various people, but all the speakers and theorists acknowledge  the point that specialist manpower plays a basic and fateful  role in designing and advancing development programs.    There is no doubt that the first step in the training of  specialist manpower is recognizing the existing gaps and the  nation's specialist needs, and then guiding the educational  system to meet these needs. Thus, there is also the need to send  students outside the country to study and gain skills and  academic knowledge at higher levels that are compatible and  appropriate for the nation's specialist needs. Otherwise,  spending significant amounts of foreign exchange to send  students abroad will have no result other than to waste the  nation's capital.    On the other hand, in fairness, a student who has passed the  difficult stages of admission, testing, and selection and goes  abroad to study will face many problems, despite having special  resources not available to his peers.    The headaches facing the Iranian student abroad include lack  of familiarity with the system for registration and teaching at  foreign universities, the difference between his own culture and  that of the foreign culture, separation from family and friends,  the timely arrival of foreign exchange stipends, problems with  housing and settlement, unpleasant treatment by some professors  at foreign universities, obstacles to spouse employment and  problems educating children. Add to these things the requirement  that scholarship students not work abroad, not being aware of  events in the country, especially the academic and technical  issues, and the weak connections Iran's educational and research  centers have with those things, which are a problem because the  Iranian student usually wants to write his graduate dissertation  on a subject needed by his country. However, when his repeated  letters to the domestic organizations to gain familiarity with  Iran's research priorities go unanswered, it is not clear what  will happen to his motivation to serve his country.    In this report, KEYHAN-E HAVA'I will raise the questions and  discuss the problems of Iranian students abroad, who make up a  significant portion of its readership, and give answers from the  relevant officials. Along with that, it will present the views  of the experts on how to prepare a statement of procedures for  sending students abroad.    In preparing this report, we have sought to understand the  problems of students and to discuss them with officials.    Because the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education and the  Ministry of Health Care, Treatment and Medical Education are in  charge of sending Iranian students abroad, we will begin with  them.    The Ministry of Culture and Higher Education accepted our  invitation with some hesitation and reluctance. However,  KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's insistence on the need to study and discuss  the problems of students abroad ultimately led to a conversation  with Dr. 'Abdollah Afshar, general manager of scholarships and  students abroad. He said the reason for this delay was the huge  volume of current activity. In any case, however, during the  interview with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's correspondent he willingly  listened to an account of the study and living problems of  students and finding a logical solution for them, and this  spirit is praiseworthy in its own right.    However, with regard to the Ministry of Health Care,  Treatment and Medical Education, which is in charge of sending  students abroad who study in the medical sciences, none of the  interview formats proposed was accepted, whether in writing, in  person or orally, and repeated telephone contacts to pursue  these things got nowhere. Ultimately KEYHAN-E HAVA'I was unable  to persuade this ministry's relevant officials that answering  questions from the students under their mantle is a  responsibility of theirs and a requirement for the successful  performance of their duties.    In the hallways of the second floor of the building of the  Office of Scholarships and Students, you see a number of  applicants with papers and documents who are either going from  one room to another or waiting outside closed doors. This story  is repeated here every day. It is a tale of minds filled with  questions, hearts trembling with anxiety and eyes filled with  hope and expectation. Sometimes an individual becomes offended  with the repeated fruitless coming and going, forgets about  being patient, and fills the hallways with his cries for all to  hear.    In the office of Ms. 'A., an angry man with a disturbed face  addresses her sitting behind her desk. She repeats her daily  experience--being silent and giving clients an opportunity to  express their anger. He says: Madam! What is my brother to do,  empty-handed in a foreign country? You sent him, you must also  pay his expenses. Must I abandon my work and my life for several  days and go up and down the stairways in this building to get  someone to listen to me, to get an official to take the trouble  to listen to me and believe me?    When this man's rage gradually subsides, who is concerned  about the fate of his brother living far outside the country,  the experienced staff worker explains: Your brother changed his  major without getting authorization, and according to  regulations, the result of doing this is a cut-off of the  regular foreign exchange stipend.    The man, now speaking in a milder and humbler tone, answers:  Dr. ...is familiar with the situation. In the university where  he was accepted, this major is not taught. The foreign professor  did not cooperate with my brother. He was forced...    Before he finishes, Ms. 'A. interrupts him imperiously: In  any case, your problem concerns Mr. S.    In Dr. A's office, an agitated woman frantically tries to  persuade Dr. A's secretary to permit her to see him for just two  minutes.    The secretary lady explains to her that client meetings with  the doctor are absolutely impossible without a written  recommendation from one of his assistants. Apart from this, your  husband's file must be studied in the council.    The answer is this: Dear lady, the file is in the council.  Our problem will be solved with just one signature. My husband  has been waiting for the council's answer in Canada for two  months now. He calls me every day wanting to know what has  happened. For the last 15 days I have been wasting my time  morning and afternoon in this office. I do not even have that  much time to submit my own final master's degree letter.    We ask her, what is your problem?    She says: My husband was accepted in the examination to be  sent for the doctoral program in chemistry in Canada, but  because of a delay sending him, the deadline passed for  registration at the intended university, and if he is to wait  until the next registration period, he will be delayed until  next September (Shahrivar [23 August-22 September]). After two  months, however, the relevant council still has not issued  authorization for him to change universities.    Then she immediately asks: Aren't higher education officials  concerned about the budget money that will have to be spent  through next September to support my husband in Canada for no  reason?    Here, one person is complaining about receiving foreign  exchange without studying, another is complaining because he has  no money to study!  <H5>  Failure of Foreign Exchange Stipends To Arrive on Time; </H5> Student Worries    Dr 'Abdollah Afshar, the Ministry of Culture and Higher  Education's general manager of scholarships for students outside  the country, was asked about the fact that the failure of  foreign exchange stipends to arrive on time sometimes brings  students to the brink of expulsion from the university, and how  long this problem will continue to plague the students. He said:  We know that students are under pressure because of this, and  perhaps 80 percent of the worries of students living outside the  country have to do with the fact that their study expenses do  not arrive on time. However, due to the complex mechanism and  the crippling bureaucracy in higher education, there is not that  much room to maneuver to change the existing situation, even  though 20 percent of the time this problem may arise for  students due to malfunctions in this ministry.    Most of the problems, however, have to do with other  organizations such as the Central Bank, the Plan and Budget  Organization, the postal system, the foreign banks, and other  organizations. For example, at the beginning of the year 1373  [21 March 1994] we were supposed to send a six-month foreign  exchange stipend to the students, but it takes about three  months for the budget guidelines for doing this to reach us and  the Central Bank, and until these guidelines are given to the  Central Bank, the banks will not be authorized to pay the  foreign exchange.    Dr. Afshar discussed the solution adopted to make up for  this  three-month delay procuring the needed foreign exchange. He  said: We have selected a definite solution to the students'  problem. We have allocated $1 million in emergency funds to the  six student supervisory offices outside the country (Australia,  England, Russia, France, Canada, and India). We have told the  supervisory offices that they may solve the students' financial  problems temporarily by paying them funds until the foreign  exchange stipends are procured, and these funds will be  deposited in the account of the supervisory offices to replenish  the emergency fund. In practice, however, this insignificant  emergency fund will not solve the problem of 2,900 scholarship  students and 800 students receiving foreign exchange.

He  said: A study report approved by the relevant supervisory office  is examined by the ministry's academic consultants, and if the  academic level is acceptable and if the documents are complete,  a foreign exchange letter is issued and sent to the ministry's  financial affairs office. Despite maximum effort by the  departments involved in the ministry to issue the foreign  exchange letter for the students in the shortest time possible,  continuation of the task is the responsibility of other  government organizations.    The general manager of scholarships and students discussed  the foreign exchange letter's movement through the  administrative pipeline in organizations outside the Ministry of  Culture and Higher Education. He said: One of our biggest  problems is the slowness of student foreign exchange procurement  in the banking system and the fate of many foreign exchange  letters is tied to the volume of the work and the accumulation  of current work in the draft-issuing branch of the bank.    He said the delay of foreign exchange drafts in foreign  banks  is another factor in the foreign exchange reaching students  late. He added: In many cases significant amounts of foreign  exchange written as drafts for Iranian students remain in  foreign banks for two to three months and reach the students  after significant delays.  <H5>  One Student Living Abroad--20 Students Inside the Country </H5>   With a thumbnail count and an accounting of the wages of  professors and current expenses in Iran's universities, we come  to the conclusion that the educational expenses of each doctoral  student inside the country is one-twentieth that of a student  abroad at this level. That is, with the budget that the  government spends for the education of a doctoral scholarship  student outside the country, one could cover 20 students inside  the country. Based on the same calculations one can say that the  living expenses of a student with spouse and children added to  the university tuition, airline ticket, and other educational  expenses of a student in a country such as America, Canada, or  England at the doctoral level averages more than 20 million  tumans. If this sum were put into the bank as a fixed deposit,  its profits would permit the hiring of three university  professors with monthly salaries of 80,000 tumans.    In the interview with Dr. Afshar we also estimated the  doctoral expenses at universities abroad and compared that with  domestic costs. We reached the same conclusion, that the cost of  going through a doctoral program outside the country is about 20  million tumans, and the same program inside the country is 1  million tumans.    Concerning the enormous cost to the government of study  abroad, Dr. Afshar said: We pay the tuition at foreign  universities separately. In addition to that, in many cases we  also assume the cost for the equipment and laboratory supplies  the Iranian students use in the university laboratory, as well  as student research expenses.    Also on the expense row for students studying abroad is the  annual payment of about $200 to $300 to buy books, as well as  some money for student insurance.    Due to the requirement of marriage, the foreign exchange  stipend for a student includes the student's living expenses in  addition to 60 percent additional for a spouse and 30 percent  more for each child (up to three children), and all of these  expenditures will be paid as of the beginning of the year 1373  [21 March 1994] based on 1,750 rials [R] per dollar. This sudden  leap in the foreign exchange rate from R70 to R1,750 has brought  great pressure on the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education.    For example, a student residing in london, having three  children, will receive a monthly stipend of 350 pounds, based on  each pound being equal to 2,640 rials, will receive R2.310  million per month in stipends alone (or 231,000 tumans), and  this is only part of the expenses of students living abroad. The  expenses also include tuition, research, laboratory supplies,  book budget, student insurance and round trip transportation.    If we multiply these expenses by 2,900 scholarship students  and 800 students receiving foreign exchange, we arrive at  astronomical figures, which bear no relationship to the amounts  committed and submitted as security deposits by the scholarship  students. For this reason, under Note 40 of the current year's  Budget Law, we must transfer some of them to the nation's  domestic universities and for the others whose studies are about  to be completed, we must convert their deposits and commitments.    Note 40 of the 1373 Budget Law says: Authorization is given  to the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education and the Ministry  of Health Care, Treatment and Medical Education to transfer  students receiving foreign exchange to domestic universities and  institutions of higher education and to take the rial  equivalents of the foreign exchange funds allocated each year to  each student for tuition. The equivalent of the foreign exchange  mentioned in this paragraph at R1,750 will be given to the  relevant universities and institutions of higher learning.  <H5>  Sending Abroad Only for Doctoral Programs </H5>   With a look at the statistical tables on the distribution of  those admitted in masters and professional and specialist  doctoral programs in universities inside the country, it becomes  evident that admissions of students at the graduate levels have  increased in recent years.    Based on statistics provided by the Statistics Center of the  Higher Education Research and Planning Institute, in the  1363-1364 [1984-1985] academic year, a total of 3,356 people was  admitted in the masters and professional and specialist doctoral  programs in the country's domestic universities and centers of  higher education.    Admissions of students for final studies in the 1370-1371  [1991-1992] academic year rose to 8,137 people in the six  academic groups of medicine, humanities, basic sciences,  technical and engineering, agriculture and animal husbandry and  art and architecture, and this figure shows growth of about 110  percent.    In view of the daily, increasing capabilities of the  nation's  domestic educational system, the basic question is, is the need  to send students abroad still felt with the same with depth and  intensity as in the past, or has this feeling begun to subside?    Based on all the studies we have obtained in the course of  preparing this report, the nation's experts and executive  officials are leaning towards reducing the number of students  sent abroad. This inclination becomes stronger each day for  three major reasons:    1 - The heavy financial burden and the enormous budget  required to send students abroad in the wake of the unification  of the foreign exchange rate.    2 - Improved quality and increased capacity of the system of  higher education inside the country.    3 - The undesirable consequences of the outrageous cultural  difference between Iran and the host countries, especially in  view of the fact that the requirement of marriage for sending a  student abroad has caused the young children of Iranian students  to be exposed to the bad effects of this cultural difference.    Mohammad 'Ali Ramin has a masters degree in general  mechanics. He recently completed his studies in Germany and  returned to the country. He hesitantly evaluates the success of  sending students outside the country. He says: Western culture,  in proportion to the moral and behavioral capacity and assets of  students, has negative moral effects on them. Therefore, in  selecting scholarship students the greatest care and careful  observation must be employed so that people will go abroad to  continue their studies who have sufficient awareness and ability  to face the cultural dangers.    He advises students being sent abroad to take a  comprehensive  approach to studying abroad, to try to benefit from all the  academic and research dimensions of the universities, and to  avoid taking a one-sided, one-dimensional and limited view of  things.    He said it is undesirable for the student to get into a rut  without being aware of the various aspects of an issue, and that  the doing so is merely a quest for credentials, rather than  knowledge. He added: In Iran the whole goal of sending students  abroad can be summarized in one idea, and that is to procure  faculty for universities. Some of Iran's students put all their  effort and energy abroad into getting credentials, because they  know beforehand that when they return there is a professor's  chair waiting for them and that they will have to teach, rather  than do research and experiments.    Explaining his views, he said: If higher education is not  related to the nation's various sectors, which are involved in  work and applications, especially the industrial ministries, and  if the student is not made to understand that he is being sent  abroad to solve the problems of industry and to find the missing  links in the production chain, the student will not benefit from  his efforts or enjoy the fruits of the privations of exile, nor  will the country benefit from his knowledge. Consequently, the  costs and energy expended for this purpose will be wasted.    We discussed this idea with Dr. Afshar. He said: In the  goals  for sending students abroad, priority goes to completing the  faculties at universities. The universities under the mantle of  the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education convey their  academic needs to the ministry (the deputy minister for  education) and the Student Evaluation Organization conducts the  examination for sending students abroad with the country's needs  in mind.    We asked Dr. Afshar how the need for specialist and skilled  manpower is met in the industrial and agricultural sectors,  although we knew that the responsibility for answering this  question is not with the General Office of Student Scholarships.  However, we found it useful to ask this of Dr. Afshar because of  his university teaching background and his executive  responsibility's connection with the subject.    He answered: Unfortunately there is the problem that there  is  no one body responsible for planning to meet the entire nation's  specialist needs. The current procedure is that each  organization and ministry estimates its needs, which may be  exactly the same as the needs of another organization, and this  estimate becomes the criterion for the work of the Evaluation  Organization in selecting students. Sometimes some bodies and  offices illegally send a scholarship student abroad directly  after choosing people from among their employees, although the  Law on Sending Students Abroad requires all ministries and  bodies to do this only through the channel of the Ministry of  Culture and Higher Education.    Dr. Afshar discussed the negative consequences of the lack  of  a central committee or council to plan for sending students  abroad and make decisions about all the nation's academic needs.  He said: The consequence of the lack of centralization in  identifying needs and existing gaps in the country is that we  send so many students in some fields that we become saturated  and have no labor market for them. On the other hand, we forget  about some essential fields. In some cases we also send students  abroad (based on the announced needs of the ministries) when  there is sufficient ability and resources inside the country for  their education in that field.    The general manager of scholarships and students abroad  presented statistics on students sent abroad in the year 1372  [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] based on the various educational  groups. He said: Of the 600 people we sent abroad last year, 271  were admitted in the technical and engineering sciences, 131 in  the basic sciences, 73 in agriculture, and 125 in the  humanities, arts and architecture.    He added: According to the plan, last year we were to have  sent 900 people abroad. However, after the establishment of  higher level programs inside the country in many university  fields, we transferred 300 of the ones admitted to domestic  universities, and they also welcomed this decision.    He mentioned Canada, England, Australia, Russia, France, the  Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, India, Germany, New Zealand, and  Belgium as countries admitting students sent abroad in 1372 to  their universities.    Dr. Afshar discussed the procedure for selecting the country  and the college and making the final designation of the field of  study, academic concentration and the facilities created in this  regard to send students abroad. He said: After the admitted  students take language examinations and achieve the minimum  scores, the students are sent to the Academic Consulting Center.    He discussed the history of the formation and the  responsibilities of the Academic Consulting Center. He said: The  members of this center, who began their work about two years  ago, are chosen from university professors and graduates in  various fields from various countries in the world, so that in  addition to having sufficient specialist knowledge to identify  the specialist tendencies in the academic fields, they will have  sufficient familiarity with foreign universities and their  academic level so they can give all the needed information to  the student.    Dr. Afshar discussed the criteria used to select foreign  universities from which to obtain admission. He said: The  academic consultants have two criteria for selecting a  university: First is the academic level and the quality of  teaching, and the second is the extent of concentration of  Iranian students at the university.    Based on Dr. Afshar's comments, attention to the extent of  concentration of Iranian students at the target university is  important because a concentration of students of one nationality  in a class creates an unbalanced atmosphere in the class and it  is highly likely that side issues such as political matters will  have a negative effect on the mastery of the subject by students  of the majority nationality.  <H5>  Change of University, Major, or Academic Concentration </H5> Prohibited    Opposite the Office of Guidance Experts Asian Department, we  spoke with a woman who was waiting for authorization for a  40-percent airline ticket discount for her brother's permanent  return from India.    She discussed her brother's study situation. She said: He  went to India to continue his studies after receiving his high  school diploma in 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985] (before the  enactment of the Law on Sending Students Abroad). After the  enactment of the Law on Sending Students Abroad, he submitted  commitments to the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education and  sent his academic performance report and was grouped with the  students receiving foreign exchange. After receiving his  bachelor's degree in chemistry, he changed his major and took up  the study of pharmacology. When he completed his bachelor's  degree in pharmacology, he decided to return to the country  after living in India for 10 years, due to the fact that his  foreign exchange ration was cut off.    When I said good-bye to that lady I wished her brother  success in using his academic knowledge to serve the country,  but I asked myself if it would not have been possible to obtain  bachelor's degrees in chemistry and pharmacology inside the  country, instead of this dear compatriot spending 10 years of  his life away from his family and his motherland, spending  enormous amounts of foreign exchange during that time. Here I  did not think it was that fair of the woman to complain that her  brother's study foreign exchange was cut off after he completed  his bachelor's degree in pharmacology and he was forced to  abandon his studies, because in Iran every year hundreds of  participants in the national university admissions examinations  are (continuously) admitted at various levels in the field of  chemistry and in pharmacology doctoral programs.    On the other hand, changing one's major from chemistry to  pharmacology raises the question, wouldn't it be better if the  students being sent abroad made a final decision before going  about their future employment and study?    Perhaps in answer to this very question, the Ministry of  Culture and Higher Education set strict regulations prohibiting  scholarship students from changing their university or major. It  will no doubt be useful and enlightening to mention some of  these regulations for Iranian students living outside the  country:    Permission to change the previously chosen university  outside  the country will not be given except in exceptional  circumstances.    The Ministry of Culture and Higher Education absolutely will  not agree to changes in majors or academic concentration,  because the country is in need of that same designated major and  concentration.    The scholarship student may not change his host country  under  any circumstances.    The maximum period designated for the student's residence  outside the country may not be extended except in special  circumstances, with the agreement of the relevant supervisor and  the approval of the Foreign Exchange Council.    The subject of the thesis of students in the humanities must  be chosen from among issues specifically pertaining to Iran.  <H5>  Theses: Solutions to Problems, or Useless? </H5>   Now that the subject of regulations on theses in the  humanities has been raised, it is not a bad idea for us to seek  the views of a number of graduates of foreign universities.    Dr. Hoseyn Gharibi, chief of the National Center for  Documents and Academic Credentials, who studied in England,  recommended a kind of balance and two-sided policy. He said: The  view that the subjects of all graduation theses of students  studying abroad must be determined from within the country and  there should be no freedom for students living outside the  country is of questionable benefit to the country, because on  the one hand we need the new techniques and on the other hand we  want new technology to determine the country's needs.    Continuing, Dr. Gharibi discussed some of the consequences  of  requiring students to choose their subjects domestically. He  said: One of the things a student living outside the country  needs to do research on domestic subjects is statistics and  information from Iran. In view of the fact that the student is  working under the supervision of a foreign professor, sometimes  it is not in our interest to send information about the country  without controls. According to Dr. Gharibi, great care and  delicacy must be exercised in sending out information for  research to be done outside the country and using the views of a  foreign professor concerning domestic subjects.    In this regard Dr. Afshar explained that up until six months  ago, the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education had no  restrictions on theses. He said: After studying the theses of  students living outside the country we concluded that much of  the research, especially in the humanities, not only has no  benefit of any kind for Iran, but also the situation is such  that the theses are prepared with Iran's financial support and  information and then, because they have nothing to do with the  nation's domestic issues, are presented to the foreigners on a  silver platter. While Dr. Afshar was talking about submitting  Iranian student theses to foreigners, I remembered a friend's  account of his memories of studying in a foreign country. He  said: An Iranian student in my class studying library science  wrote his thesis on how foreign students can better make use of  the library's academic resources...in that country.    However scientific, useful and new they may be, the results  of this research will help only those who go to that library in  that same country, and such research does not solve any of the  problems of the thousands of book lovers and seekers of  knowledge inside the country.  <H5>  Reciprocal Expectations </H5>   Just as the officials expect, Iranian students take their  country's priorities into account when choosing the areas of  their research. Graduate students outside the country also  expect not to have problems getting their academic credentials  accepted inside the country.    One of those reporting to the Office of Student Scholarships  said that he took the examination to be sent abroad for the year  1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990], with a bachelor's degree in  physics from the Tehran Teacher Training College, and passed it  successfully. He said: I began studying for a master's degree  outside the country in the field the Ministry of Culture and  Higher Education selected, and after that I went through the  doctoral program with the academic concentration chosen by the  Ministry of Culture and Higher Education's consultants. Now,  however, after returning, this ministry's Office of Graduates  refuses to accept my academic credentials.    He asked unhappily: Why is there no coordination among the  offices affiliated with a single ministry? Why are they saying  the credentials in the field they themselves chose for me are  not accredited?    We asked Dr. Afshar the reason for this lack of  coordination.    He confirmed the existence of this malfunction and said the  reason is the adoption of separate and individual policies by  two general offices affiliated with the ministry. He gave the  good news, however, that with the formation of the Scholarships  and Foreign Exchange Council, which has decisionmakers from both  offices as its members, this lack of coordination will go away.    He added: The members of the Scholarships and Foreign  Exchange Council identify and designate accredited and  acceptable universities, and on this basis students are sent  only to countries where the academic credentials of their  universities are accredited with the Office of Graduates.    The formation of the Scholarships and Foreign Exchange  Council to coordinate the designation of fields of study and the  evaluation of academic credentials is praiseworthy, but it  appears quite necessary that a council be formed to coordinate  the sending of students with the missing links in the chain of  production aimed at self-sufficiency. This is an important and  fateful step upon which Dr. Afshar insisted in his interview  with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I. It is a step that could take us to a place  where in the nation's Five-Year Plan we could design a model  organization made up of the needed experts, and we could send  students abroad to fill the empty slots in this model  organization.</p>

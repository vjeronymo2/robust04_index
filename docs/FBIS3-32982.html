That year, during the consumption boom caused by the  Cruzado Plan freeze, Brazilian industry grew by 10.5 percent.  The projection was made by the Brazilian Institute of Geography  and Statistics (IBGE) on the basis of results obtained for the  month of November, when production climbed by 2.4 percent.    That percentage, which was higher than expected by IBGE's  experts in the Department of Industry (Deind), means there has  been a 4.3 percent growth in only two months. To Silvio Sales de  Oliveira, manager of Deind's Data Analysis Group, the  explanation may lie in the uncertainty generated by the  acceleration in the inflation rate, which caused retailers to  postpone their purchasing decisions until the end of the year.  It is for the same reason, in his opinion, that December  production will probably attain at least this same level.    What is more complicated to understand is how, in a year  when  the inflation rate exceeded 2,500 percent, production rose  almost as much as under the Cruzado Plan. Here is where two  important actors come in. The leading role was played by the  far-reaching adjustment made by industry, which achieved  significant gains in productivity. Playing a secondary role was  the surge in demand that started in September 1992, initially  motivated by uncertainty regarding the behavior of inflation,  and later by the change in wage policy, which gave workers some  measure of real gains that were of special benefit to the  consumer durables industry.    From January to November, production of those goods--notably  automobiles and home appliances), grew by 40 percent, followed  by capital goods for agriculture (tractors and other inputs), at  37.4 percent.    There are questions about the early months of 1994. Silvio  Sales believes production may hold up for two months, but with  some tendency to decelerate. The projection made by the 11  economists who participate in the qualified information system  set up by the Regional Council of Economics (Corecon) is that  January production will be 3.4 percent above that of January  1993. This would be a modest growth, compared with what happened  last year. But it all depends, largely, on what happens to  inflation, and Corecon's projections are that the rate will be  39.5 percent this month and 39.6 percent in February.

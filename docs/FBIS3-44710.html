			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondent Wang Yunfeng (3769 0061 1496): "A </F> Rare Case of Exceptionally Huge Explosion"]    [Text]  <H6>  I </H6>   On 26 November 1993, an exceptionally huge explosion rarely  seen in China occurred at the Nanling Chemical Factory, which is  situated at the foot of Yangming Shan in Shuangpai County, Hunan  Province.    At 1605, following a deafening explosion at the emulsion  explosive plant, a black mushroom-like cloud, mixed with blood,  flesh, machine parts, and rubble, soared hundreds of meters into  the sky. The powerful blast pushed workers and staff members in  factories some two km away to the ground and shattered the glass  of many windows in the Shuangpai County seat five km away. Even  people in Yongzhou City 30 km away heard the blast, and their  doors and windows shook. After the huge blast, the survivors  witnessed a pitiful sight: A workshop of several hundred square  meters had been leveled. The factory building, flowers, and  trees were all gone; so were the workers and staff members, who  had just been working intensely and in an orderly fashion. Four  cadres from the Lanzhou Military Region, who had come to  Shuangpai County to fetch soldiers, as well as the wife of a  company commander, were unfortunately killed in the accident  after visiting the plant for less than five minutes. At another  workshop some 100 meters away from the explosion point, the  workers were "pushed" down to the second and third floors by the  blast. As a result, 22 people were hurt, three of whom died  despite being given emergency treatment.    After the accident, leaders and experts from Shuangpai  County, Lingling Prefecture, and Hunan Province, as well as the  Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of National Defense,  and the Guangzhou Military Region, rushed to the explosion site.  The aftermath of the accident was carried out in a tense and  orderly manner.    According to an initial estimate, the accident caused over  2.5 million yuan in direct economic losses. With the death toll  currently standing at 61, this is the deadliest accident in the  history of Hunan Province.    Emulsion explosives are widely used in national defense,  economic, and other fields. Its explosive force is the same as  high-explosive TNT, but it cannot be detonated by shooting at or  burning it unless with a detonator. In the course of  production, only when several kinds of material are mixed and  stirred does it pose a danger, and the finished product cannot  be detonated without a detonator. To ensure production safety,  the factory manually operates all processes relating to the  setting and packing of finished products to avoid collisions  with machinery. To prevent sparks caused by friction in the  nails of shoe soles, all workers are required to wear special  shoes when going to work. To show considerations for smokers, a  smoking area was set up some 50 meters from the factory gate.  Professional safety personnel constantly shuttled back and  forth in the workshop to inspect safety conditions. However,  unexpectedly, the incident still occurred and took place in the  setting and packing workshop for the finished product. As for  the mixing workshop, only half of its building was destroyed in  the explosion.  <H6>  II </H6>   Was the case of the exceptionally large explosion at the  Nanling Chemical Factory an accident due to a safety lapse or a  criminal case of artificial sabotage?    The Ministry of Public Security conducted a lot of  meticulous  work on this core issue in an attempt to find clues.    After talking with the factory director, workshop chiefs,  and  some workers, the public security personnel found an important  clue. At 1800 on 26 November, accompanied by his father, a young  worker named Liu from the No. 1 workshop told the workshop chief  that the accident was probably caused by a young worker, Tan  Zhixin, from the same workshop. Two days earlier, Liu, another  young worker named Wang, and Tan took some detonators and fuses  from a young worker named Su at the Hunan Equipment Factory.  The workshop chief also said that Tan repeatedly spread word  that he wanted to blow up the No. 1 workshop. After comparing  and analyzing the circumstances, public security personnel  concluded that Tan was an important suspect because he had both  the motive and the tools to commit the crime.    To make the origin of the detonators and fuses absolutely  clear, four public security policemen were ordered to rush to  the Hunan Equipment Factory, which is over 100 km away, in the  small hours of the morning to investigate. Su admitted  supplying Tan with detonators and fuses. Facts proved that Tan  was the principal culprit in the fatal incident. The criminal  was a careless and casual worker. He was punished by the  factory and the public security management department for  causing an accident while driving a motorcycle and for  participating in gambling. Later, he was refused a transfer  from the packing workshop to become a factory driver. As a  result, he harbored a grievance. In early November, he told a  coworker that since the No. 1 workshop had treated him badly, he  wanted to blow it up. On 24 November, taking advantage of a  workshop holiday, Tan, Liu, and Wang went to the Hunan Equipment  Factory to obtain 17 detonators and two fuses. They returned to  the factory the following day. While drinking wine at coworker  Zhang's home that evening, Tan again grumbled: I don't want to  work at the No. 1 workshop any longer. I want to be transferred  to the factory car transport department. If they agree, that's  fine. If they don't, I'll blow up the No. 1 workshop. Saying  this, he pulled out some detonators from a brown paper envelop  stuck in his belt and displayed it. After eating, he  deliberately took two detonators to a single-persons' dormitory  to try them out.    At noon on 26 November, while eating lunch at the food stall  of a self-employed person in the factory, he revealed to workers  sitting at the same table with him the idea that a person should  eat his fill and eat well before he dies. He again threatened  to blow up the No. 1 workshop. At 1600, when arriving at the  No. 1 workshop, Tan first greeted a female worker and then,  catching sight of Wang, asked repeatedly: "Why are you still  here?" Catching his meaning, Wang immediately left the  workshop. On eventually seeing Liu, Tan asked: Why are you  still here? Liu said: I haven't finished packing the  explosives. Tan gave him a hint by showing him the detonators  in his trouser pocket, and the latter immediately left the  workshop. A few minutes later, Tan unscrupulously committed the  horrifying deed. He also ended his criminal life in the  explosion.</p>

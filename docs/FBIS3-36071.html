The  meeting came to the conclusion, Ivan Plyushch said, that the  president and government should find sources for financing "a  sensible number" of the armed forces of Ukraine. In connection  with this a number of measures have been elaborated which will  allow the number of personnel to be reduced by almost 100,000  persons and it is planned to conduct a substantial inventory of  military property. After this the president and government will  present proposals to parliament regarding the financing of  defense expenditure. This point was included in the Supreme  Council resolution on implementation of the law on the state  budget for 1994.    Despite many protests by people's deputies against the tax  which, in accordance with Article 23 of the state budget, will  be imposed on corporate and physical entities for each page of  written appeals to bodies of executive and legislative  authority, the article was not withdrawn from the adopted  document. In accordance with a proposal by Andriy Pecherov,  chairman of the commission for issues of planning, budget,  finances, and prices, Article 23 will be put into practice by a  separate legislative act.    The calls by some deputies not to grant subventions to the  Republic of Crimea until the legislation of that autonomous  region is brought into line with the laws of Ukraine were not  supported. Following the adoption of the Supreme Council  resolution on implementation of the law on the state budget for  1994, which envisions it being reconfirmed every quarter, the  question of submitting to a Ukraine-wide referendum the  fundamental constitutional provisions on the organization of  state authority and [local] self-government in Ukraine was  presented for discussion.    The latest version of the document was subjected to harsh  criticism. After an hour's discussion not a single decision was  made. The Supreme Council will continue its work 2 February.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Last-minute row hits Gaza pact run-up A last-minute row over details of an historic accord to withdraw Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho yesterday soured final preparations for today's scheduled signing of the agreement, locking both sides into a further and recriminatory round of negotiations. Israeli officials insisted the signing would go ahead as planned, even if the outstanding disputes were not settled. 'Time has its limits and tomorrow at 11 o'clock we shall sign,' Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said in Cairo. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, were due to meet last night in a final effort to resolve the differences under the pressure of expectation and potential embarrassment created by the arrival of 2,500 dignitaries and a host of foreign ministers to witness today's planned event. The last-minute disagreement occurred when PLO officials claimed Israel had 'reneged' on more than 20 detailed points of the agreement. Mr Arafat accused Israel of 'manoeuvres to obstruct the signing', prompting Israeli officials to blame the disagreements on 'a last attempt' by the PLO 'to get a bit more'. The points of disagreement included whether the Palestinians could issue their own postage stamps and have their own phone codes for Gaza and Jericho, and a dispute over the length of validity of proposed Palestinian travel documents. Israel had balked at the inclusion of Mr Faisal Husseini, a Palestinian leader from Jerusalem, on the proposed list of 25 Palestinians to constitute the Palestinian authority which will administer limited self-rule until elections due in October. Israel says no Jerusalem-based Palestinians must serve on the body. PLO and Israeli negotiators had left Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat to resolve two final points of disagreement: whether a uniformed Palestinian guard would be allowed on the Allenby Bridge linking Israel and Jordan, and the delineation of the area around Jericho to be ceded to Palestinian control. The PLO had been seeking more than twice the 54 sq km offered by Israel. Mr Rabin's spokesman, Mr Ben Ari, said it was unclear whether the two leaders would announce any agreement on this and other outstanding issues before this morning. The 200-page document, entitled Agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho Area, would give the Palestinians their first limited degree of political and economic autonomy since the Israeli state was created in 1948, committing Israel to withdraw troops from land claimed by the Palestinians and occupied by Israeli forces during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The agreement is already 20 weeks behind the schedule under which Israel should have completed its military withdrawal by April 13. Once signed, the deal would prompt the immediate conclusion of Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Under a draft text, Israel will complete the withdrawal within three weeks of signing.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE DONORS CONTRIBUTE TO GROVE  </P> <P> The financially troubled Grove Shakespeare Festival raised a total of $5,895 in  private contributions over the weekend, a theater spokesperson said Monday.  Donations of $3,200 arrived in the mail "mostly in small checks of $10 to $25."  </P> <P> The rest was been raised through curtain pleas at "Othello," the current Grove  production.  </P> <P> However, the fund-raising campaign being conducted by a group of 14 Garden  Grove civic and volunteer organizations, to raise as much as $15,000, had yet  to produce any revenue by Monday, according to Barbara G. Hammerman, Grove's  managing director. Hammerman claimed last week that goal would be met within a  few days.  </P> <P> The Grove is caught in a cash-flow crisis and was expected to press the City  Council Monday evening for a continuing infusion of emergency funds.JAN HERMAN  </P></p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: PolyGram ahead 21% despite shortage of hits PolyGram, the recorded music company, yesterday announced net income for 1993 up 21 per cent to Fl 614m (Dollars 320m), despite a paucity of new hits. The company, 75 per cent owned by Philips of the Netherlands, said strong performances in the Far East and North America compensated for a relatively weak showing in Europe, its largest market. European operating income rose 7 per cent to Fl 605m. North American operating income doubled to Fl 104m and the Far East and Japan enjoyed a 22 per cent increase to Fl 197m. Net sales were up 12 per cent to Fl 7.4bn. The total gross dividend for the year is Fl 0.75, up 15 per cent. Pop music sales grew by 13 per cent. Classical sales, however, were at a similar level to 1992. Mr Alain Levy, chief executive, said budget labels were pushing classical music prices down. He conceded there was a danger that classical recordings might come to be viewed as commodity items. He said PolyGram hoped to resist the trend with classical releases from well-known artists such as Anne Sophie Mutter and Kiri Te Kanawa. PolyGram's film interests accounted for 9 per cent of total revenues. The company released 13 films last year and intends to release 15 this year. Mr Levy said PolyGram's film interests had so far produced only 'average results' but said the company had learned more about the industry and was on track to producing better results. Mr Levy said he did not believe that multi-media and interactive entertainment would take hold as quickly as some analysts and industry insiders thought. He said that while the technology would appear in homes, those who believed its widespread introduction was imminent failed to take account of consumers' desire for passive entertainment.

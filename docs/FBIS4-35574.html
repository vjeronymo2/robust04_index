			<p>BFN     [Text] The Labor Central Committee approved by a decisive  majority the appointment of Knesset Member [MK] Efrayim Sne as  health minister. Prime Minister Rabin said that in view of the  difficult situation, Israel needs a full-time health minister.  There is nobody to talk to in the Histadrut Labor Federation and  its Kupat Holim health fund is bankrupt. Mr. Rabin said the two  other ministerial portfolios are being saved for SHAS [Torah  Observing Sephardim]. Our correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports  that a minister without portfolio, either Yosi Beilin or MK  Avraham Burg, is also expected to be appointed.    MK Sne thanked the Central Committee for its support and  called on Kupat Holim Director General Avigdor Kaplan to remain  in his post and participate in the efforts to rehabilitate the  fund.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Cautious note may temper the bull run - London The first trading week of the new year will bring more than the usual crop of doubt, optimism and wild surmise on the London stock market. The beginning of January has often been a highly productive time for investors - even if this did not always last for the rest of the month. Until the very end of the old year, it looked as though nothing could prevent a happy new year from following a very merry Christmas. There is no shortage of bullish forecasts for 1994. Mr Nick Knight, the super bull at Nomura, is predicting a further rise of more than 8 per cent on the Footsie by the end of January, and while not many would be in such a rush, there is plenty of optimism in the City. Nor is this confined to the big institutions and their rated advisers. A survey by ShareLink, the Birmingham execution-only stockbroker, indicates that UK private investors, of whose business ShareLink claims the lion's share, are 'clearly taking a bullish view of prospects'. But a note of caution has been heard in stockbroker trading rooms since details have emerged of the reasons behind the huge upsurge in stock index futures during December, which itself lay behind the rise in the Footsie Index. The futures buying, it appears, was related to expiry of a Pounds 4bn over-the-counter share option programme by a very large UK institution. The programme, put in place just ahead of the November budget, went badly wrong and the hapless fund manager had to run for cover to the Footsie futures market. The expiry of this deal withdrew support from futures and thus hit the stock market, probably robbing Mr Knight of fulfilment of his Footsie 3,500 target for 1993. OTCs are a fairly new and highly specialised animal on the stock market, encased in mystery because they are private deals between one, usually very large securities house, and one, also very large, client. Whatever may be the benefits and perils of OTCs, they can have a significant effect, via futures, on share prices. Traders are convinced that there are more OTC deals very close to expiry and wary of seeing the futures market turn round and bite the stock market in return. The other area where market views are shifting is on the timing of the next cut in base rates. Once again, there is general agreement that a base rate cut there will be; perhaps the Bundesbank will lead the way, or perhaps the low inflation scenario in the UK will be enough to guarantee further falls in rates. However, some analysts now warn that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, may choose to keep rate cuts in reserve for next spring when the UK economy, and the voters, will be taking the strain of the Budget tax increases. The same factors could also be putting the stock market under pressure by then. What the stock market would like to see this week is a base rate cut and no OTC expiries. But what if these heartening images are transposed? No rate cut and a OTC expiry might be another story.</p>

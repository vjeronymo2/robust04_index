			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- The Diet will pass the  long- overdue state budget for fiscal 1994, which started April  1, next Wednesday [22 June] at the earliest, Diet sources said  Wednesday.    A leading member of the House of Councillors Budget  Committee, Masakuni Murakami of the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP), proposed in talks with Juro Saito, head  of LDP upper house members, Tuesday night that the upper house  pass the budget next Wednesday "for the sake of the people," the  sources said.    But Saito reportedly said he considered June 27 an  "appropriate" date to pass the delayed budget.    According to the sources, LDP chief Yohei Kono, Secretary  General Yoshiro Mori, Saito, Murakami and other members of the  party's upper house executives will meet Thursday to decide  their budget strategy.    On June 8 the House of Representatives approved the 73.08  trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994. The current Diet session  ends June 29.</p>

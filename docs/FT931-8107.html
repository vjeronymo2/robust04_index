			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Private investors prepare to jump on the bondwagon / A look at the renewed appeal of fixed-interest securities BONDS ARE back in favour. A gradual shift towards fixed-interest securities by British institutions before the UK left the European exchange rate mechanism has now turned into a flood of marketing directed at private investors. The trend shown in the graph might make this seem strange. The effect of Black Wednesday was to force down yields on gilts - bonds issued by the UK government - across the board. But the 'yield curve,' one of the investment world's more Byzantine constructions, has shifted in ways which allow small investors some opportunities - along with more risks. Long-term bonds now offer higher yields than short-term cash deposits. This, together with the 'certainty' they offer - most pay a fixed rate of interest and have a set repayment value - explains their appeal to the small investor. This return does not come without dangers, though - bond prices could fall, leading to a loss of investors' capital in nominal terms - or inflation could rise again, which would mean a capital loss in real terms. In some cases, holding bonds until they are redeemed guarantees a capital loss. Private investors can buy bonds directly, but many may find the task of selecting the right issue too daunting. That is where the financial services industry steps in, with a range of funds designed to take the hassle out of bond investing. GILT UNIT TRUSTS These were among the fund management industry's star performers of 1992. UK gilt and fixed-interest unit trusts logged net sales of Pounds 128.2m. The industry's own marketing has a lot to do with this, but more important is a pervading sentiment that inflation will be low throughout this decade. The advantages of buying into a large, professionally-managed portfolio were displayed by the convulsions of Black Wednesday. As Will Hay, the head of fixed interest at Standard Life, explains, some issues maturing in 2002 are priced at 112p and will be redeemed at 100p - so buying the issue for its attractive yield means buying into a capital loss. Unit trusts can aim to deliver a high yield while selling in time to avoid capital losses. Bond funds can, however, have different aims. Traditionally, gilts are used for income, and present yields justify this. By buying three unit trusts which pay out quarterly, it is possible to arrange for monthly income, providing each pays its income in different months. The table shows figures for all the gilt unit trusts with a track record of at least five years which pay out quarterly. Some funds have exceptionally high yields, which is a sign that they are turning capital into income. This could appeal to some investors, but only if they are sure they can afford to lose some capital. But some funds may aim for a total return (judged in terms of income and capital gains combined). The figures for growth, which assume that income has been re-invested, show that gilts have not delivered this reliably. A further crafty device, pioneered by Mercury, is to hold enough overseas bonds to qualify for the capital gains tax indexation allowance. The fund aims for income, and makes a loss in capital terms after indexation. This loss can be offset for CGT purposes against gains elsewhere in the portfolio. Rather more tax-planning opportunities are available offshore. Advice from an accountant is needed before attempting to take advantage of them. 'Roll-up' funds do not distribute income; instead, this is allowed to accumulate tax-free within the fund. Tax is payable only after the investment is redeemed. Distributor funds pay out income gross - very attractive at present yields - and tax does not need to be paid until later. Guinness Flight stresses that going offshore only defers tax. If you are aiming for income, then the present yield is what you will get. What are the chances for total return? According to Hay, a decision on whether to buy bonds hinges on your prediction for inflation. 'If you believe inflation has been squeezed out of the UK system, we will see a good performance on the gilts market. You may see the total return performance deteriorate over three to five years if inflation picks up.' He considers gilts a very attractive investment in the short-term, but he is less confident over a medium term of three to five years because of the risk of accelerating inflation. Hay is also anxious about the possibility that gilts will be in over-supply. Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Midland Montagu, is more confident than most about inflation. He forecasts that roughly 1 percentage point will be shaved off all gilt yields by the end of this year, and adds: 'We would be looking for the longest-dated gilts to yield 7.75 per cent by the end of this year, and they are now on 8.6 per cent. That would give a healthy return.' Midland Montagu is backing gilts to outperform equities this year, with inflation staying between 2 and 4 per cent for the next three years - making 8.6 per cent look good. INTERNATIONAL BOND UNIT TRUSTS The best way to buy international bonds is via a fund. The minimum units in which they are traded, and the costs of transactions in foreign markets, make frequent trading in international bonds impracticable for a small investor. International bond funds are also in favour, with net sales last year of Pounds 191.9m. Mercury's international bond fund, launched two years ago, now has Pounds 217.3m. People who bought at the beginning of last year have done well so far. The funds come with an added currency risk, which delivered very strong performance for them last year as sterling devalued - average total return for the sector over the half-year to the beginning of this month was 17.75 per cent, according to Micropal. European bonds, in which Barclays Unicorn launched a specialist fund last month, are attracting particular interest from analysts because base rates are still high, in line with the German Bundesbank's high interest rate policy. Once they fall, European bond markets should rally, delivering a capital gain. Peter Oppenheimer of Hambros, which manages the offshore EMMA umbrella fund, says: 'We see European bonds as offering more value than gilts because the potential for base rates to come down is greater. French rates, in particular, are unsustainable.' Again, the table shows only those funds with a track record of at least five years which pay income quarterly. Yields arelower and managers, particularly in funds specialising in European bonds, tend to aim for a total return - income and capital gain combined - rather than income alone. CHARGES Initial and annual charges are more variable than they are for most of the industry. Some funds impose an initial charge of 5 per cent and an annual charge of 1.5 per cent, but annual charges nearer 0.75 per cent, and initial charges of between 3 and 4 per cent are common. Gilts are cheaper to manage than equities and several companies have cut charges in the past year. They include Abtrust, which has two unit trusts with no front-end charge at all, Fidelity, Guinness Flight and INVESCO MIM. Now that companies are competing on price, look around for the cheapest option.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  INTERNATIONAL FIXED INTEREST TRUSTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Income               Growth                                  Yield      paid      3 year     5 year  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey Worldwide Bond             4.59%      March      41.90      60.82 Fidelity International Bond      4.85%     February    29.03      46.59 Gartmore Intl FI                 5.33%     January     40.01      52.34 Waverley Global Bond             7.27%     January     27.06      46.24  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Micropal.

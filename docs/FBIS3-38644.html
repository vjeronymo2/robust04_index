The time for talk was running out, as was  people's patience and civilized humanity, Waigel said in an  interview with AUGSBURGER ALLGEMEINE (Monday [7 February]  edition). The warring parties' last chance was "to draw the  necessary conclusions and at least make the murderers see  sense." If this opportunity was not taken, then "specific action  has to be taken with the utmost rigor," Waigel said. Asked what  this rigor might look like, the CSU leader said the United  States had left "no doubt" on this issue.</p>

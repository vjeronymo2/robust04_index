			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Council spending statement may be delayed until autumn A PROBABLE DELAY in the announcement about next year's overall local government spending is set to cause difficulties in the negotiations over arrangements for the first year of the council tax. The government usually announces in July the maximum amount it believes local government should spend in the following financial year (total standard spending) and the total amount of external support through government grant and the business rate. However, the Department of the Environment believes that this year the statement may have to wait until October. The likely delay is already being interpreted as a sign of how tight the coming public spending round will be. Environment ministers believe it is vital to secure a reasonable revenue support grant settlement for next year to ensure that the first year of the council tax does not produce the sharp rises in bills that bedevilled the first year of the poll tax. One problem is that ministers still do not have detailed information about the tax base for the council tax, under which bills will be based largely on the value of the property in one of eight bands. The valuation exercise is not expected to be completed until the end of next month at the earliest, and until its results are available it is difficult for ministers to know the scale of the transitional relief scheme they will want to put in place. 'I don't see how we can say anything sensible until the autumn,' one official commented. A further complication is that the extra money to go to local authorities to take account of their new duties in providing community care has yet to be sorted out. The government is still considering whether the grant should be 'ring-fenced' to ensure that councils cannot spend it on other services. The department's difficulties have been increased by the plan for the House of Commons to disband for the summer recess in mid-July, slightly earlier than usual. The news emerged as Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, announced in the Commons that the government intended to limit the spending of 10 English local authorities that had breached the criteria for 'capping' which had been set out in advance. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, warned that the Department of the Environment and the Treasury were 'locked in a battle which will leave local government the loser. This is a bad start for Mr Howard's tenure at the department.' Ten authorities capped, Page 11 Council contracts-out tax collecting, Page 9</p>

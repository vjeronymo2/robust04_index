			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDLINING BY AUTO INSURERS  </P> <P> The current mess in auto insurance in California has taken years to get into  and may well take years to get out of -- if ever. I would like to suggest a  simple and easy way to clear the decks.  </P> <P> 1. Let the state establish a state-operated insurance carrier, operated solely  on insurance premiums with no tax revenue to be used to subsidize it.  </P> <P> 2. Abolish all rate regulations on private insurance carriers. They will be  constrained by competition with each other, and with the state insurance  carrier to offer fair and competitive rates.  </P> <P> 3. Abolish the current requirement that all drivers carry auto insurance. The  history of this law, both here and elsewhere, is uniformly horrid.  </P> <P> I don't promise that this will make insurance rates affordable (one more reason  for No. 3), but if it doesn't at least it will then be obvious that the problem  is with the court system and excessive awards, not the insurance industry.  </P> <P> MICHAEL D.

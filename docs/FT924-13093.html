			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Nigerian leader cracks down on political parties NIGERIA'S transition to civilian rule suffered a serious setback yesterday when the military government nullified the results of last month's presidential primaries and dissolved the executives of the country's two political parties. The decision, prompted by widespread electoral fraud, seems likely to disrupt the transition timetable which envisaged presidential elections in December, and a formal handover by President Ibrahim Babangida in early January. General Babangida, who seized power in a 1985 coup, took the decision after a meeting of the Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) had reviewed a report of the National Electoral Commission. After an AFRC meeting in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, Gen Babangida said that caretaker committees would take over administration of the Social Democratic party (SDP) and the National Republican Convention (NRC), while the electoral commission would draw up new guidelines for the selection of party candidates. The AFRC was 'firmly committed to bringing about a viable democracy at all levels of government in accordance with electoral laws,' Gen Babangida said. Although most observers agree that electoral fraud discredited the primaries, the transition process was fundamentally flawed from the start. In 1987, in the early stages of the programme, thousands of former politicians and government officials were banned from politics in an ineffectual attempt to create a 'new breed' of leaders. Two years later the government presided over the creation of the SDP and the NRC, whose near-identical manifestos were drawn up by civil servants. The credibility of the process suffered a further blow when the government insisted the only way to prevent electoral fraud was to use the open-ballot system, under which voters line up for counting in front of a poster of their favoured candidate. But faced with a choice between taking part in a flawed transition to democracy or resigning themselves to military rule, many Nigerians reluctantly opted for the former. Should Gen Babangida delay the handover there is likely to be widespread resentment among a civilian population increasingly critical of the military's mismanagement and government corruption.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER prices surrendered some of their recent gains at the LME yesterday, with the cash quotation closing Pounds 13.75 down at Pounds 1,382.50 a tonne. Dealers said the downturn followed a failed attempt in the morning to break resistance at the equivalent of Dollars 2,280 for three months metal. ZINC also eased back in the afternoon, the cash position ending at Dollars 1,112 a tonne, down Dollars 6 from Wednesday's close. But the sharpest turnround was in ALUMINIUM. Upside momentum generated by VAW's production cut announcement (see story above) soon disappeared, dealers said, after the three months price's brief excursion above Dollars 1,200 a tonne attracted substantial selling. The price closed Dollars 7 lower on balance at Dollars 1,187.50 a tonne. At the London Futures and Options Exchange robusta coffee prices edged up to fresh 8-month highs before meeting resistance. The January futures position reached Dollars 899 a tonne before profit-taking overwhelmed the upward momentum. The price closed at Dollars 891 a tonne, up Dollars 6 on the day and Dollars 35 on the week so far. Compiled from Reuters</p>

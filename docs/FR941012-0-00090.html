			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (c) Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In paragraph (c), OSHA is adopting a number of definitions to clarify the meaning, intent and purpose of certain terms contained in this standard. Several definitions contained in the pulpwood logging rule were deleted from the proposed rule because the terms were no longer used in the regulatory text. In addition, 17 new definitions were added to the proposal. In the final rule OSHA has added and changed several definitions to better reflect the intent of the Agency and to aid interested persons in understanding the requirements of this standard. In addition, in the final rule OSHA has deleted several proposed definitions. Many of these terms involved cable yarding and road construction activities, that are not covered by this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Cable yarding'' is defined in this final rule as the movement of felled trees or logs from the area where they are felled to a landing by attaching them to a suspended cable system. The supports for the cable that carries or supports the trees or logs are called head and tail spars. Spars may be fashioned from standing trees or from metal towers (commonly called metal spars). There may be additional intermediate spars if the cable run is of sufficient length to require intermediate support. OSHA has specifically defined ``cable yarding'' in the final rule to aid persons in understanding the scope of the exclusion from the standard for this particular type of logging operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Danger tree'' is defined in the final rule as any standing tree that presents a hazard to an employee due to conditions such as, but not limited to, deterioration or physical damage to the root system, trunk, stem or limbs, and the direction and lean of the tree. The tree may be dead or alive. This term was not contained in the proposed standard. Instead, the related term ``snag'' was included and defined as any dead tree or portion thereof remaining standing. Also, the term ``widow maker'' was included in the proposed rule and defined as an overhanging limb or section of tree that could become dislodged and drop to the ground. Several commenters said this term should replace the use of ``snag'' in the proposed rule because the definition of snag implies that all dead trees are dangerous (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;50, 5&hyph;64, 17). Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, from the State of Washington, said that not all snags were dangerous to employees and many were essential to the health of the wildlife community (Ex. 17). In this final rule, OSHA has decided to use the term ``danger tree,'' a term that is used in the State of Washington logging standard that is more inclusive of the various conditions that could cause a tree to be dangerous (Ex. 2&hyph;22).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Designated person'' is defined in the final rule as an employee who has the requisite knowledge, training and experience to perform specific duties. This definition is a close parallel to the definition of the term used in consensus standards dealing with material handling equipment, such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME B30.5&hyph;1989 with Addenda, ``Safety Standard for Mobile Cranes'' (Ex. 38DD and EE). In the ASME standard, a designated person is defined as an employee who is selected or assigned by the employer as being competent to perform specific duties. In this final rule, the Agency has amended that definition to indicate that the employee needs to have the knowledge, training and experience to perform that job or duty for which he/she is designated. The possession of those attributes is not a discretionary decision on the part of the employer but a mandatory prerequisite that the employee must possess. Knowledge and competency are normally achieved through training or experience or a combination of those activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this final rule a signal person, an explosive handler and user, a machine operator, a trainer, and a supervisor of new and newly-trained employees must be designated persons. In these cases, the Agency recognizes that each of those individuals must have knowledge, experience, and training to competently perform those tasks. For example, a signal person needs to know the various signals to use when indicating that a particular operation or movement is to be made. The signal person also must know and understand how the task is to be performed and the role of his signals in completing the task safely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

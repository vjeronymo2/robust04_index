			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Semi-Tech shows rise of 210% in first half SEMI-Tech (Global), the Hong Kong owner of the Singer sewing machine group, announced net profits of HKDollars 704m (USDollars 91m) for the six months ended July 1992, a 210 per cent increase on the comparable period of last year. Earnings were boosted by the HKDollars 526m exceptional profit from the sale of 8m shares in New York-listed Singer. On a recurring and comparable basis  -assuming the same percentage contribution from Singer - profits would have risen 17 per cent. Turnover increased to HKDollars 4.7bn from HKDollars 4.5bn. Its 51 per cent-owned subsidiary, Singer, has successfully expanded its product range from sewing machines into consumer durables, resulting in sales growth in the majority of its markets. Semi-Tech is starting to focus on mainland China for expansion. Singer has formed a joint venture in Shanghai to manufacture sewing machines for the local market, while its parent is setting up a retail network to distribute its products in the world's largest consumer market. The directors recommended an interim dividend of HKDollars 0.23, up from HKDollars 0.20 in 1991.</p>

Traces  of blood and much destruction was found upon arrival at the  municipal palace. The same holds true in the case of the local  radio station and two hotels where the attackers were holed up.  The bodies of nine aggressors were found in a sewer at the  municipal market. The aggressors had tried to take away the  bodies through the sewer system, which served as their escape  route. The aggressors had resisted the Army for more than 48  hours from this point.    It should be noted that some groups of attackers still  remain  in hiding in Ocosingo and occupy certain buildings, especially  privately owned homes, where occupants are being held hostage.  Army troops continue patrolling the area to capture or dislodge  them.    To the south-east, villagers in Independencia and Las  Margaritas are now under military protection. One of the  aggressors was captured in San Juan Chamula. On the road that  links the city of Comitan to Las Margartias, a four more  guerrillas were arrested, including a Guatemalan citizen. Near  the military installation in Rancho Nuevo another attacker was  detained. Lastly, in Ocosingo, 20 of them were captured. All  of the detainees will be turned over to the appropriate  authorities, who will carry out investigations.    Military personnel evacuated from Ocosingo 84 adults and 125  children who expressed a wish to leave the area. This group was  given lodging in the DIP [expansion unknown] installations in  the city of Palenque. Likewise, five policemen belonging to the  Chiapas State Public Security Directorate and two Judicial State  Police officers were evacuated after they were wounded by the  attackers. The policemen were transferred to the city of Villa  Hermosa where they are receiving medical attention at the area  military hospital. The number of dead rebels has increased to 65  while 34 remain under arrest.</p>

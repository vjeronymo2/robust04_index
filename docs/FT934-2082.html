			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: OECD report praises Hungary's low farm subsidies A report on Hungarian agriculture by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suggests that the sector is among the best placed to benefit from a liberalisation in world trade that would follow a successful conclusion of the negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The study, the first such focused OECD report, finds that the level of agricultural subsidy in Hungary is lower than in any of the 24 developed states except New Zealand. Hungary has a 'producer subsidy equivalent' of just 8 per cent compared with an OECD average of 44 per cent, according to the latest 1992 figures. Budapest's agriculture ministry said that the low level of support put Hungary's farm sector in a strong position in the event of a Gatt breakthrough that freed up world trade. While most countries would have to cut subsidies, Hungary would be allowed to maintain the current level of support and competitiveness would therefore improve, the ministry said. A Gatt agreement would ease access to western European markets and, more importantly for Hungary, curtail dumping by European Union countries in third markets. Hungary blames subsidised western European competition in part for the decline in its food exports to the former Soviet Union and last week drew attention to undercutting by German pork producers. While praising Hungary for reducing agricultural subsidies, the OECD warned that state support for farmers had bounced back in 1993 and that Hungary risked following western Europe's bad example. The release of the OECD report clashed with Hungary's announcement that imports of dairy, sugar and pasta products would require licences next year. The move reverses a long process of liberalisation that had freed up all but 10 per cent of Hungarian imports. In 1994, 12 per cent of imports will require official permission.</p>

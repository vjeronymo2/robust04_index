			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Media Futures: In brief Singapore unveiled its high-tech 'court of the future' last Friday and a judge said the use of computers and video conferencing could halve the time it takes to hear a case. The scheme could also save taxpayers money and child witnesses the trauma of appearing in open court. The Subordinate Courts unveiled the project, known as Court Vision 21. A district judge presided over a mock trial which used dial-up video-conferencing, voice-recognition transcription systems, pen-based computing and other multimedia applications. 'The legal aspects will have to be looked into,' said district judge Adrian Soon. For instance, delivery of testimony via video is not now admissible. However, he believed courts of the future could hear twice as many cases a day if fully automated. Wee Teck Hin, head of information systems at the Singapore National Computer Board, said the demonstration aimed to satisfy the three main objectives of the court of the future: paperless systems, instant transcription of evidence and the giving of testimony by video transmission. The trial used 'litigation support software', allowing evidence and exhibits produced in court to be called up almost instantaneously on the judge's personal computer in his chambers. Another piece of software, 'SING' (Sentencing Information Guide System), allows instant storage and retrieval of documents in text, video, image and voice. The project is being conducted by the Subordinate Courts, the computer board and several suppliers. NEC Corp., the Japanese computer group which holds more than 50 per cent of the country's personal computer market, said last Friday that it plans to market in Japan a video-on-demand system, in which users can call up videos through their computers. The system, to be available early next year, will employ technology acquired from Starlight Network Inc., a small US software concern based in California. Even with modifications by NEC, the Starlight Network technology enables video transmission to only 200 users, so NEC plans to target business customers to start. In video-on-demand, users can call up, via their computer terminals, any video that is offered by the system. Branch offices of a company, for example, could gain immediate access to a company news video produced at headquarters. In the future, the technology could enable people to watch the latest video release at home without having to go out to their local video hire store. NEC also said it believed the system would generate demand as a teaching aid in schools.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Waste Recycling in Pounds 5m placing plan The waste sector welcomed an addition to its ranks yesterday with the announcement that Waste Recycling Group was seeking a quote through a Pounds 5m placing. Waste Recycling, which reclaims and recycles non-hazardous waste, is issuing 10m ordinary shares at 50p, valuing the enlarged group at Pounds 8.1m. Mr Paul Rackham, managing director and founder, will be some Pounds 6.5m richer as a result. Under the deal, he will receive 7.1m shares, which will be placed with institutions. Mr Rackham will retain 6.2m shares through his private investment vehicle and original owner of the business, Paul Rackham Ltd. This represents 38 per cent of the enlarged group. The remaining 2.9m shares in the placing will raise about Pounds 1.2m, which will be used to pay inter-company loans owed to Mr Rackham. Waste Recycling said a listing would help it to finance acquisitions through the issue of shares if circumstances were appropriate. There were further opportunities to expand in East Anglia and it had established links with 23 councils in the area. The group reported an increase in pre-tax profits over the three years from Pounds 431,000 in 1991 to Pounds 1.02m for the year to December 31 1993. Sales rose by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 2.61m in the same period. Last year dividends totalling Pounds 1.75m were paid to Paul Rackham Ltd. Waste Recycling has two non-executive directors appointed since February - Mr David Williams, non-executive chairman of waste recycling and chairman of Mosaic Investments, and Mr Sam Wauchope, managing director of Acorn Computers. There are three full-time directors, including the founder's son Mr Paul Rackham junior, who has worked for the group since 1984. Waste Recycling is being sponsored by London stockbroker Marshall Securities.</p>

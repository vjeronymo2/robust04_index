The number of SL and MRTA terrorists arrested between June  1992 and December 1993 amounts to 6,300, which shows the  effectiveness of the anti-terrorist strategy implemented by the  government because in only 18 months the security forces  arrested more terrorists than during the previous 12 years:  Between 1980 and 1991 a total of 5,403 terrorists were arrested.    So far this year, during January and February, the number of  arrested SL and MRTA terrorists amounts to 1,367.    Moreover, according to statistics from the Special  Prosecutor  for Terrorist Crimes, 4,099 terrorists have benefited from the  repentance law (Decree Law No. 25499), promulgated in May 1992.    The new anti-terrorist law, which has been in force for more  than 18 months, has allowed the trial of 1,104 terrorists, a  significant number compared to the 1981-1992 period during which  576 rulings for terrorist crimes were passed down.    The military court has sentenced 451 terrorists for treason,  of which 288 were sentenced to life imprisonment. Civil courts  sentenced 653 individuals for terrorist actions, 19 of whom were  sentenced to life imprisonment.    The Armed Forces Joint Command disclosed that during the  past  14 years 26,000 Peruvians died as a result of terrorist actions.  Of this total, 2,075 were members of the Armed Forces and PNP.    The number of terrorist actions dropped noticeably in 1993.  Only 1,306 terrorist actions were registered last year while  2,049 were registered in 1992.    According to official reports, the harsh blows struck by the  security forces against the Shining Path have caused it to  reduce its activities throughout the country.    In view of the effectiveness of the military and police  operations, the terrorist groups' morale is quite affected and  this has brought confusion and uncertainty to their actions.  This has resulted in many desertions as well as a considerable  number of terrorists who have repented.    Currently there is a leadership struggle in the SL, and its  committees lack coordination, which has prompted many SL members  to perpetrate common crimes and get involved in drug trafficking.    The crisis affecting the SL is worsened by the arrest of its  central committee members as well as the neutralization of its  propaganda apparatus abroad.    The MRTA's situation is similar. Eighty percent of its  leadership is being held under arrest in high-security prisons  while 85 percent of the so-called Popular Revolutionary Army has  been fully dismantled.    The MRTA also has serious organization and leadership  problems as well as logistic and economic difficulties that have  prompted an incredible number of its members to defect. Many of  its members have deserted and are now stealing, carrying out  holdups, or are involved with drug traffickers.    Currently, MRTA's actions are only sporadic and isolated  because of the lack of coordination between its regional  committees. MRTA's morale is also very low and its members  benefit greatly from the repentance law.</p>

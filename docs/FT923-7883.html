			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Sluggish retailing in US REPORTS of weak growth of US retail sales and almost flat consumer prices yesterday provided further evidence of sluggish economic conditions. In a separate report, the Congressional Budget Office said the economy had yet to enter a 'self-sustaining recovery' but appeared to be on the verge of one. It forecast growth of 1.9 per cent this year, rising to 3.1 per cent next year. Like most other forecasters, the CBO, an independent advisory body for Congress, has consistently over-estimated economic growth in the past couple of years. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.5 per cent in July, after seasonal adjustment, slightly more than expected in financial markets. But its estimate for June was revised sharply down to show a contraction of 0.3 per cent instead of a 0.5 per cent gain. Retail sales have made no significant headway since February.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley bullish on Ireland Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, has stolen a march on its competitors with the publication of a bullish report on the Irish economy and stock market only days after the IRA announced its ceasefire. With the exception of Luxembourg, the Irish economy is the smallest in the European Union and is only equivalent to one-thirtieth of the size of the west German economy and one-twentieth of the size of the UK's. Nevertheless, its dynamism has prompted Morgan Stanley to nickname it the 'Celtic Tiger', a variation of the label given to the fast-growing economies in south-east Asia. It notes that Ireland has the most rapidly-growing economy in the European Union, with Gross Domestic Product growth averaging 5 per cent over the five years to 1993. This growth rate may be exceeded in both 1994 and 1995, the broker forecasts. At the same time, inflation risks are muted by strong productivity trends, a large balance of payments surplus and a firm exchange rate. Mr Richard Davidson, Morgan Stanley's European equity strategist, said that the IRA's ceasefire further improved the country's prospects because of the likely easing of border restrictions and the freer movement of goods. 'There will be more investment in either part of Ireland which have positive benefits for both economies,' he said. Ireland's entry into the widely-used MSCI Europe index has prompted institutional investors to include Irish stocks in their portfolios. The country has a benchmark weighting of 0.6 per cent in the index but Morgan Stanley recommends a portfolio allocation of 1.3 per cent. 'We expect that the market can rise by 15 per cent over the next 12 months,' said Mr Davidson. He noted that while international investor interest has increased over the last decade, the market remains undervalued, particularly the banking sector. However, like the economy, the Irish stock market is also one of the smallest in Europe with a total market capitalisation of Dollars 17bn. Average daily volume in Dublin in July was IPounds 26m (Dollars 17m), of which the top 10 stocks made up 83 per cent. The low level of liquidity outside the top 10 stocks poses considerable problems for institutions wanting to deal in large amounts. 'Investors still view the market as illiquid and dominated by locals but there is good profit growth and valuations are cheap,' said Mr Davidson. The Irish government's intention to sell off its remaining 15 per cent stake in Irish Life and the potential privatisations of Telecom Eireann and the Aer Lingus group should greatly improve market liquidity. In addition, the flotation next month of the building society Irish Permanent should raise between IPounds 30m and IPounds 50m.</p>

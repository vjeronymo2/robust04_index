			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (5): Punch-ups in political arena - The government regards democracy as bothersome One year into the new multi-party era, politics in Kenya is about punch-ups. In parliament, at opposition conventions, inside Nairobi city hall, the willingness of elected representatives to come to blows is symptomatic of a broader malaise: the lack of political dialogue in Kenya. The government, from the president down, makes no secret of the fact it regards democracy as a bothersome foreign imposition with dangerous social repercussions. Its relations with the opposition are non-existent. 'Multi-party elections were forced upon us by the donor community,' says John Joseph Kamotho, education minister and secretary-general of the Kenya African National Union (Kanu) party. 'Given the choice, we would have proceeded more slowly.' Having ruled since independence, and won the December 1992 elections, Kanu has had little cause to change its ways. It has continued to jail critics, deny permits for opposition political rallies, ban independent trade unions and stifle the media as in the days of one-party rule. Kanu makes no distinction between the party and the state. It therefore regards all criticism as a treasonable offence. Twenty-one parliamentarians - almost a quarter of the opposition force  - were jailed during 1993. The arrest and harassment of opposition leaders has intensified during 1994. The time spent in court fighting charges, not to mention time spent in jail, has been a significant drain on the opposition's energy and resources. Journalists have been detained and charged with sedition or subversion for reporting on matters which the government considers inflammatory. Books and magazines are occasionally banned. At the state universities, lecturers have been on strike for five months to demand the legalisation of their professional union. Mr Kamotho, the education minister, says the union will not be recognised. 'The elections legitimised a regime that does not believe in democracy,' says Mr Paul Muite, an opposition member of parliament. And yet, the election results came as a rude shock to Kanu leaders. President Daniel arap Moi, standing for re-election, mustered only 36 per cent of the vote. Kanu also failed to win a single parliamentary seat in Kikuyu or Luo land - home of two of the country's largest ethnic groups - undermining Kanu's claim to be the only true national party in Kenya. The election results crystallised what a one-party state could conceal: that President Moi, a member of the Kalenjin clan, leads a government of minority tribes which has deliberately marginalised the larger ethnic groups. President Moi's coalition, in power since 1978, fears the arithmetic of majority rule because it would bring back Kikuyu political domination. Happily for President Moi, the opposition is in disarray. Divided by personal rivalries in the run-up to the elections, the defeated opposition has continued to fragment on tribal lines. The Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford), which campaigned so effectively for the legalisation of opposition parties, split into two camps after failing to agree on a single presidential candidate. The late Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, who died in January, took his Luo community into Ford-Kenya. Kenneth Matiba, a prominent Kikuyu leader, founded Ford-Asili with Martin Shikuku, whose Luhya community forms the country's second largest ethnic group. Now Mr Matiba is being challenged by Mr Shikuku for the leadership of the Ford-Asili. The two men have exchanged ugly words in public. Their supporters have exchanged blows. Ford-Kenya was in disarray even before Mr Odinga's death. Several parliamentarians have all but resigned from the party. A third opposition force, the Kikuyu-led Democratic Party, has failed to make any impact in or outside parliament. Having failed to dislodge President Moi from power, some opposition leaders have lost faith in a political game which they say is stacked against them. Mr Matiba, the runner-up in the presidential contest, has refused to take up his parliamentary seat in protest at an election which he believes was rigged. Mwai Kibaki, the DP leader, appears to be absent in mind and spirit. With so much political in-fighting, the opposition has failed to make its mark on the two burning issues of post-election Kenya: the corruption scandals linking 'political banks' to senior members of the Kanu leadership, and ethnic conflict in the Rift Valley. A spirited anti-corruption campaign led by Mr Muite of Ford-Kenya fizzled into thin air when his leader, Mr Odinga, admitted to receiving donations from the owner of one of the scandal-tainted banks. Tribal clashes between the president's Kalenjin tribe and Kikuyu farmers have caused 1,500 deaths and displaced more than 300,000 people since 1991, according to church and human right groups. Although the turmoil in the Rift Valley pales in comparison to the recent killings in Rwanda, church organisations say the clashes represent Kenya's most serious crisis since independence. They are frightened by the underlying threat of chaos and social disintegration in a country with more than 40 ethnic groups and an acute shortage of farmland. Three independent reports, including one written by a parliamentary committee when Kenya was still a one-party state, pointed to government complicity or involvement in the violence. Government officials and close associates of President Moi were named as the principal instigators of the Rift Valley clashes. The government denies any involvement in a conflict which recently began to take the form of ethnic cleansing - the removal of all ethnic groups except the Kalenjin, Maasai, Turkana and Samburu from the Rift Valley. The clashes have brought church-state relations to an all-time low in Kenya. 'We have buried the victims of tribal clashes. We understand the impact of financial scandals on our dwindling incomes. We are with the poor every Sunday, not just for election rallies. How do you expect the church not to take a political stance?' says the Rev Mutava Musyimi, general secretary of the National Council of the Churches of Kenya. Church groups have also thrown their weight behind opposition calls for a national convention to redraft Kenya's constitution. For while the advent of a multi-party system has brought the tribal factor into greater relief, Kenya's existing institutions, including an all-powerful presidency, have been unable to accommodate the aspirations of the country's disparate ethnic groups. 'The culture of violence that is taking root has made real the alarming possibility of civil war in Kenya,' the human rights group Africa Watch warned late last year. Perhaps this very real danger might make an intransigent government and a fractious opposition come to their senses.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]  today denounced serious distortions in the fulfillment of the  peace agreements, and expressed the fear that a failure to  fulfill pending agreements may cause social instability. The  FMLN appealed to the UN secretary general for "a stronger  reaction" to force the government to fulfill the agreements.    FMLN leader Leonel Gonzalez pointed out that the distortion  of the peace agreements is part of the government's plan to  merge the National Police [PN], which is to be dismantled, with  the National Civilian Police [PNC] and the government's  presentation of a new plan to step up the transfer of lands that  would overlook over 20,000 former FMLN and Armed Forces fighters.    Regarding the government's failure to fulfill the  agreements,  Gonzalez pointed out that the constitutional reforms to  modernize the administration of justice are pending, and he  expressed the fear that on 1 May the new Legislative Assembly  will be installed without the previous assembly having approved  the reforms.    According to procedure, constitutional reforms must be  approved and confirmed by two legislative assemblies and if they  are not approved by the current assembly, changes in the  judicial system will remain on hold until 2000. "The judicial  system is obsolete, and it allows impunity to succeed," Gonzalez  said, adding: "these are factors that could destabilize the  country's transition process."    Another issue denounced by Gonzalez is that the government  "has disregarded ONUSAL [UN Observers for El Salvador], and it  has been unable to confirm how many soldiers are in the PNC or  to assess how much they earn." Expanding on the dismantling of  the PN, Gonzalez said: "There is an agreement to dissolve the  PN. A reduction in force program has already been presented,  and 3,000 policemen were to be demobilized this month, but the  government suspended the demobilization process, and we are  aware of its plan to merge the PN and PNC in October." The  possible merger of the PN and PNC and the incorporation into the  PNC of the Narcotics Executive Unit and Commission for the  Investigation of Crimes, means to Gonzalez that "by 1995 the  seed of a new repressive body will exist."    To make the government fulfill the peace agreements,  Gonzalez  has proposed that the United Nations and Group of Friends  (Mexico, Spain, Venezuela, and Colombia) exert pressure on the  government with a mandate from the Security Council. He added  that the UN "must take firmer action."    UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said yesterday that  still pending are the reintegrations into society through the  land transfers and constitutional reforms recommended by the  Truth Commission. Ghali also pointed out the persistence of  significant signs of reluctance to establish the PNC, which was  a fundamental goal of the peace agreements between the  government and FMLN. He added that there seems to be a desire  to distance the formation of the PNC from the dismantling of the  PN.</p>

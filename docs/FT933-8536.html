			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Fashion: The closet life of a well-dressed doctor - Liz Walker meets a doctor who enjoys clothing his partner DAVID BARLOW is a consultant in genito-urinary medicine at St. Thomas's Hospital in London and a member of Instant Sunshine, a band of singing doctors taking part in the Edinburgh Festival at the Pleasance Theatre. His wife Angela teaches the Alexander Technique, a method of adjusting the posture aimed at reducing stress, improving breathing and promoting a general sense of well-being, in Dulwich and central London and David loves buying clothes for her, though he is careful to explain that he certainly does not buy all her clothes. 'I sometimes feel a bit guilty and wonder if I am trying to create the sort of Barbie doll I would like to be married to. But on the whole I think that my motivation is otherish rather than selfish,' he says. 'The first item I ever bought her was a pair of knickers with attached suspenders, slightly naughty as we were not yet engaged. Tights had yet to be invented. I was a penniless student so technically she might have paid for them. I do get funny looks in certain shop departments but it does not bother me very much as I face potentially embarrassing situations in the hospital every day. 'The first important piece of clothing that I got for Angela was her going-away outfit, a rather unusual garment. We were going skiing so I chose a beautiful maroon corduroy plus-four suit from Simpsons in Piccadilly - the shop has been sending me brochures ever since and I sometimes shop there. I am not in charge of Angela's clothes. If I was she would never have a skirt or a bra or any of the real essentials. I buy things rather on an ad hoc basis, usually when I am away at a conference or something.' Angela remembers a time 'about 15 years ago when the children were very small and David went out to do the weekend shop - meat, two veg., that sort of thing. Hours later he came back with dozens of Harrod's bags filled with co-ordinating skirts, blouses, the first culottes . . . an entire wardrobe. It was wonderful.' David says that whenever he goes abroad 'the standard present that I buy for Angela when I am on business is a silver bracelet; come to think of it my mother has got a lovely Jensen silver bracelet, and my father often went shopping with my mother to choose clothes with her and she is also very elegant. ' He admits that he thinks he has made the occasional mistake. 'But I think Angela is too polite to mention them. One disaster I remember was a sort of 1920s dress with silver lurex threads running through it. I don't read Harpers or Vogue but did feel very ahead of things when I bought a dress and jacket with shoulder pads in Macy's. It must have been about the time that the television soap Dallas was showing, and some lady, who thought I was trying to pick her up, tried it on for size. My daughter is three inches taller than my wife and I don't always get things right for her - she won't even let me cut her hair, although I cut her mother's' Angela rarely buys clothes for her husband as he is 'always on the verge of losing some weight.' She feels that she never gets ties quite right, but she is the arbiter of taste when it comes to the house and particularly furniture. 'Wine is my thing,' adds David, 'and I do feel that there are different sorts of money: funny money that you buy a house with, silly money, and goodie money for clothes and things . . . but that is crucial, too.'</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities firm after the Budget speech THE BUDGET speech from the UK chancellor of the exchequer confirmed a firmer trend established in the stock market early in yesterday's session. After showing some uncertainty at first, share prices moved higher after mid-session as equities responded to a firmer trend in sterling and at the 4.30pm close, just before the chancellor finished speaking, the market was 24.1 points up 2,574.8, the best level of the day. However, equity market confidence was dimmed in late trading when the stock index futures sector lost ground. The cyclical stocks, including building materials and stores, led the market advance in early trading, as sterling's firmness renewed expectations that base rates will be cut very soon. The Budget measures were seen as broadly favourable for brewery and similar consumer stocks, with the motor industry issues benefiting from the cuts in motor tax and car scale charges. Trading volume appeared relatively good for a session in which the leading institutions were unwilling to take decisive investment decisions. But the Seaq-reported volume level of 431.7m shares took in a high proportion of intra market business as marketmakers struggled to pass stock on to the next dealer rather than allow share positions to rise. While there was some nervousness over the estimated Pounds 28bn Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for next year, the stock market brushed off, for the time being, the downturn in the UK government bond sector. The absence yesterday of any cut in base rates left traders concerned that it might now be difficult to cut rates before the announcement of the UK election. Announcement of the election date, widely predicted as April 9, is expected before the end of the week. On the wider implications of the budget strategy, the City of London appeared satisfied that its forecasts on economic growth and measures on personal taxation would enhance the chances of an election victory for the governing Conservative party. The market made a difficult start after a bomb explosion in London brought a widespread security alert which delayed commuter travelling and caused two leading securities firms to evacuate their premises, albeit briefly. Share prices were easier in early trading, but rallied when the stock index futures again opened firmly. Shares made good progress as traders continued to show confidence ahead of the Budget speech, timed to take place in the final hours of trading. But it was sterling's improvement, mirrored by a softening in London money rates, which turned the equity market higher. The Footsie was 22 points up when the chancellor began to speak and, after some brief hesitation, edged ahead again as he ended his speech. But the more significant response may have come from the stock index futures, where the March contract turned steadily downwards as Mr Lamont's speech progressed. This, together with the similarly negative response from sterling on the foreign exchange markets, may set the trend for this morning's opening trades in equities. However, a brighter spot on the market's horizon last night was the early gain on Wall Street which was 20 Dow points ahead in UK trading hours.</p>

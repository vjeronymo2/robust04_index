			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh -- National Bank of Cambodia [NBC]  reports a favourable trend in the money supply's rate of  expansion, which has been slowing down steadily in recent months.    Broad money, which includes currency in circulation, demand  deposits, time and savings deposits and foreign currency  deposits, expanded at a rate of 13 per cent in December 1993,  but eased off to 8.5 per cent in January of this year and  further decelerated to 7.5 per cent in February.    The NBC Economic and Monetary Statistics Review for February  1994, made available recently to The Cambodia Times, comments  that this trend "augurs well for containing inflation".    Indeed, it records that the trend in the rate of inflation  itself continues to be encouraging, noting that consumer prices  marked only a marginal rise of 0.88 per cent in February.    The report reveals that February's rise would have been  lower  if not for the jump in energy prices. It cautions that "such a  subdued trend in prices has to be sustained over the months, if  inflation for the year 1994 as a whole, is to be contained  within the 10 per cent level".    That, in turn, would require maintaining a disciplined  monetary policy. The financial operations of the public sector  and the lending operations of the banking system as well as the  kingdom's balance of payments status and the parcelling out of  significant aid pledges would affect such policy.    Currently, the NBC notes that "the share of currency in  circulation in broad money has declined significantly from over  58 per cent in December 1993 to about 45 per cent in February  1994".    It further records that "such expansion in broad money as  has  taken place is wholly attributable to growth in quasi-money,  mainly foreign currency deposits with banks". Quasi-money  refers to time, savings and foreign currency deposits.    However, the public sector's financial operations have yet  to  determine a contractionary impact on money supply, with  government deposits at 47.5 billion riels for February 1994  while the banking system has net claims of 170.5 billion riels  during the same period.</p>

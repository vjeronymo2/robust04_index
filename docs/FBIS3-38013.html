			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrey Baturin and Sergey Gryzunov of RIA NOVOSTI </F> specially for IZVESTIYA: "Meeting Between Serbian General and  Russian Colonel Ends According to Orthodox Custom"]    [Text] Belgrade--Sarajevo is returning to normal life after  700 days of blockade. Following the withdrawal of 260 Serb and  47 Muslim artillery pieces and their transfer to the control of  the UN peacekeeping forces, the citizens -- Muslims, Serbs, and  Croats -- can wake up without fearing for their lives.    Our paratroopers are installed in the building of a former  police school. Their commander, Colonel Viktor Vorobyev, has  held a working meeting with General Stanislav Galic, commander  of the Sarajevo-Romanija corps, which is keeping its sights on  the capital of Bosnia. The discussion concerned the stationing  of guys from Ryazan and Pskov on the demarcation line between  the Muslim and Serb infantry within the precincts of the city.    As Serb sources reported, the meeting between the Serb  general and the Russian colonel ended with "a toast according to  the old orthodox custom."    The presence of Vorobyev's men -- the weighty argument of  the  Russian diplomatic initiative -- has stabilized the situation  around Sarajevo. However, as one of the UN commanders expressed  himself, it will not be easy for the peacekeeping forces to  maintain an island of peace in a sea of war.    In this connection, it appears that the United Nations will  come up against specific difficulties in carrying out the  operation to open the airfield in Tuzla, which is scheduled for  7 March. Official sources have reported that air support from  NATO forces will be used during the operation if need be. The  Serbs are keeping the airfield in the sights of their artillery,  suspecting that it may be used not for the delivery of  humanitarian aid, but as a new channel for supplying the Muslims  with weapons.    Over 1 million civilian inhabitants, mainly Muslims, in  Central Bosnia, where Tuzla is located, are waiting desperately  for the opening of the airfield. They are disastrously short of  food and medicines, the UN Office of High Commissioner for  Refugees, has reported from its Sarajevo base.    Meanwhile, in downtown Belgrade, a street musician is  endlessly playing Russian tunes on the accordion, hooligans have  defaced the French memorial, drawing a swastika on it as revenge  for the NATO ultimatum, and Western diplomats and members of  their families are quietly getting ready to go back, while local  experts analyze the critical situation which has been favorably  resolved for all the sides.    The names of Boris Yeltsin and Andrey Kozyrev, to which a  number of local publications and activists had pinned labels of  the type "betrayers of the Slav peoples and orthodoxy," are  being praised to the skies. And those who yesterday were  conducting dialogue only with Khasbulatov and Zhirinovskiy,  counting on help from Cossacks and secret Russian weapons, are  today holding rallies of gratitude outside the Russian Embassy.</p>

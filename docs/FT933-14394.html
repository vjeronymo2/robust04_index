			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Speculators spark Dollars 77 fall in copper price COPPER'S PRICE collapsed yesterday as commodity funds pulled out of the market and speculative selling sent the metal down to Dollars 1,861 a tonne in after-hours dealing. Since early May copper has gained about Dollars 300 a tonne and touched Dollars 2,020, a three-month peak, on Friday. Then in the first two trading days this week it lost half about half those gains, dropping by Dollars 46 a tonne on Monday and another Dollars 77 yesterday. The collapse, like the rise, was caused by technical factors but it was so spectacular that it undermined sentiment in other metals markets. Aluminium and nickel prices were particularly badly affected. Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Company, part of the Deutsche Bank group, pointed out that copper's collapse originated late on Friday on the New York Commodity Exchange when there was a huge volume of selling. The market was surprised by a rise in the London Metal Exchange's copper stocks on Friday, when a reduction was expected. There was another rise reported yesterday, taking the total up by 11,000 tonnes to a fresh 15-year peak of 458,000 tonnes. Nevertheless, Mr Bielski argued that, while copper's prospects were poor for the next few months and the price might fall back below 80 cents a pound (Dollars 1763 a tonne), present bearish sentiment was probably overdone. For example, total copper stocks represented only 6 1/2 -7 weeks' consumption whereas in the previous recession they reached the 14-weeks level. Other analysts have been revising copper price forecasts they made in January and now predict much lower levels. Smith New Court, which predicted then that copper would average 110 cents a pound in 1993, now suggests 90 cents is more likely. Warburg is also predicting a 90-cents average, down from a January forecast of 105 cents, and Ord Minnett has reduced its forecast from 102 cents to 90 cents. Billiton-Enthoven Metals predicts a 90-cents average for 1993 but that was its January forecast.  ----------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------- Aluminium  +14,625 to 1,918,350 Copper      +3,500 to   458,000 Lead          +875 to   262,250 Nickel      +2,586 to    93,390 Zinc        +1,025 to   702,750 Tin            +25 to    20,440  -----------------------------------------</p>

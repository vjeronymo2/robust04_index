			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin's Laochengli, with a total area of 1.5  square kilometers, will be thoroughly rebuilt into a new area  characterized not only by a modern flavor but also the style of  folk custom, and with the combination of financial, commercial,  trade, and residential zones. The Nankai District Government  and Anxin Group (Hong Kong) Corporation held a ceremony on the  evening to 26 March to sign the contract on jointly rebuilding  the old city proper of Nankai District.    Attending the ceremony were municipal leaders Luo Yuanpeng,  Liu Wenfan, and Wang Dehui; veteran comrades Mao Changwu, Bai  Hualing, and Hu Xiaohuai; and Xie Guoxiang, deputy director of  the Tianjin Chinese Culture Promotion Association.    Wang Shukai, head of Nankai District, and Chen Xiaoqi,  president of the Anxin Group (Hong Kong) Corporation, signed the  contracts respectively.    Tianjin was formerly called "Laochengli." With a total area  of 1.5 square kilometers and a total population of 110,000, and  with east, south, west, and north roads around its borders,  Laochengli is an area embracing relatively more dangerous and  crude houses. After sensing the tremendous potentials and  prospects of this area through survey and analysis, Anxin Group  has decided to make investment in rebuilding this old city  proper into a new area influential in north China and even in  the whole country.    The pare-phase investment of Anxin Group is subject to  unified designing and planning and is devoted to developing 25  percent of the construction area covering 3.6 million square  meters. Upon the completion of this project, 30 bank buildings  will be set up in the northeast part (formally named Guanyinhao)  to form a banking area. The northwest part of this area will be  built into a commercial and trade zone, where the Tianjin  Municipal World Trade Center will be included. The southwest  part will be built into a hotel, commercial, and residential  zone, including a five-star hotel, a large shopping center, and  an indoor garden, the largest of its kind in China, filled with  fresh flowers in all seasons under a glass ceiling, and  furnished with a children's playground. The southeast part will  be into a residential zone embracing high-, middle-, and  low-class residences. In addition, an artificial lake and some  sports installations will be built. At the crossroads of the  old city proper, a drum-tower with the ancient Chinese  architectural style will be restored and rebuilt, and a  three-km-long internal ring road, with the old crossroads as its  center, will be built. The former crossroads will be changed to  the streets only for pedestrians, and along the streets, there  will be Chinese local and special products shops, typical local  dishes restaurants, theaters, shopping centers, and tourist  service centers.    Mr. Chen Xiaoqi, president of Anxin Group (Hong Kong)  Corporation, said: The rebuilding of this old city proper can  be likened to a bone, which our corporation is gnawing on. That  is, we will use our own mode to rebuild and build it, and the  success in this project will create a new path for the  rebuilding of Tianjin's old city proper and even the whole  country.    It is learned that it will take five to seven years to  complete the reconstruction.</p>

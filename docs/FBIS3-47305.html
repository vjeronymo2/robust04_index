			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The Lao-American Cooperation on </F> the Problem of Prisoners of War and Personnel Missing in Action  During Wartime"]    [Text] Respected listeners, on 2 January, the Voice of  America, which is known to all as a mouthpiece of the U.S. State  Department, carried a report slandering the Lao People's  Democratic Republic [LPDR] by saying that as many as 41 American  prisoners of war remain in the LPDR. The report added that the  U.S. Senate Investigative Committee should make Laos a priority  in its efforts.    The following are the facts about this issue that everyone  should know: After the end of the Indochinese war in 1975, the  Lao side returned to the U.S. side all nine American prisoners  of war. Since then, the U.S. side has admitted that there are  no more American prisoners of war in Laos. Nevertheless, for  humanitarian reasons and acting in response to requests from the  U.S. Government, the Lao Government has always cooperated with  the U.S. side in searching for and collecting information about  personnel missing in action in Laos. In 1985, 1986, and up to  the present time, Lao officials have respectfully cooperated  with American officials and done their best in conducting  surveys and excavating areas around plane crashes in 11  provinces, in accordance with all suggestions and plans from the  U.S. side. Between 1985 and November 1993, the two sides  jointly conducted surveys and excavations on 34 occasions in 11  provinces. So far, the remains of some 50 American pilots of  planes shot down in wartime have been discovered and retrieved.  The total number of American personnel missing in action in  Laos, in accordance with official U.S. figures, is 514.    In addition, to remove the doubt and suspicion of the U.S.  side, which has claimed that American prisoners of war remain  alive in Laos in accordance with information it has received  from certain exiled Lao refugees or deceivers who have taken  advantage of the situation to make money or profit from other  people's suffering, the Lao side has agreed to allow technical  teams from of both countries to jointly investigate all  suggestions of the U.S. side. Examples are the case of Captain  Borah, who was found after the investigation to be a Lao Theuang  tribesman, namely (a Lao), and the case of First Lieutenant  (Kha,) who was later found to be a German businessman running  his business in Thailand, namely (Gunbe). There were also  similar cases in Xieng Khouang and Hopua Phan Provinces. Another  recent one was the case of a person in Toumlan District, who was  later found to be a physician attached to (?a medical team  operating in a border area). All cases of live prisoners of war  turned out to be groundless after joint investigation. They are  all fabricated stories.    In view of the fact that the technical teams and officials  of  both sides have unanimously concluded that progress has been  achieved in cooperation in dealing with the problem of prisoners  of war and personnel missing in action, what are the hidden  purposes and intentions of the Voice of America in its  indiscriminate and irresponsible reports? The Lao people feel  very disappointed about this outdated trick. The Lao people  have now asked themselves why in the world does our country have  to sincerely cooperate with the U.S. side, despite the fact that  during the war, tens of thousands of their sons and nephews were  killed by U.S. bombs and they have not been paid any  compensation. If the Voice of America, which has served as the  mouthpiece officially conveying the views of the U.S.  Government, continues to carry such slanderous news, it will  only continue to increase doubt and suspicion between the  peoples of the two countries. The only result will be that the  cooperation in searching for the personnel missing in action  during the war will be affected.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Bekesi, economic expert of the </F> Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP, by Eszter Radai; place and date  not given: "Room for Maneuver and Economic Policy -- The MSZP's  Technocrat"]    [Text] After internal debates, he was put in the  third place on the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] national  list. The realistic nature of his program is seen as a  negotiating basis even by those people who would reject  coalition with the MSZP out of hand. He is often the topic of  conversations and many guesses can also be heard about him while  he does not give many interviews. What are his views on the  party's tasks in the near and distant future, and what are his  views on his own role? Eszter Radai interviewed Laszlo  Bekesi.    [Radai] The politicians of rival parties and even  independent political analysts claim that [MSZP Chairman] Gyula  Horn is using you to make the MSZP appear presentable and  suitable for coalition -- while there is a tough struggle  between the two of you. What are your views on this?    [Bekesi] If this was true, I would find it flattering that I  can make a whole party presentable or suitable for coalition.  Naturally, no one ever denied that there are a number of trends  in the MSZP. It is usually me who represents the technocratic  views that are based on rational facts, which place the economy  in the forefront, and push the ideological considerations into  the background.    [Radai] Assessing the coalition possibilities, leaders of  other parties have recently been stating that they would not  have any objections to the Socialists if you determined the  party's image and it could be guaranteed that your program would  be implemented. For example, [Federation of Young Democrats,  FIDESZ Chairman] Viktor Orban said that "Bekesi's program could  be a basis for negotiations."    [Bekesi] A party that has any self-esteem does not normally  accept conditions that are set for it by its rivals. The  program that is known as the Bekesi program was accepted by the  MSZP and this is our official program. Seeing this as a  negotiating basis means a potential partnership. However, it  lacks seriousness to tell us in a message whom we should replace  and where we should place people. As matter of fact, not much  later we learned from the FIDESZ's other statements that no  matter what kind of program the MSZP has, relations between  these two parties will not be formed on the basis of the  programs, rather, on the basis of the sentiments of the two  parties' leaders toward each other, on the basis of the past, on  prejudices, and I do not know what else....    [Radai] Is it certain that the Bekesi program will remain  the MSZP's program? In the past years, we have had plenty of  chances to see that it is possible to deviate from programs.  Will you be able to resist the pressure, especially if it is  exerted by the trade union leaders who are in the coalition?  Are you not afraid that you will be blackmailed regularly?    [Bekesi] The election alliance with the National Federation  of Trade Unions in Hungary [MSZOSZ] does not imply the dangers  that are often mentioned. For example, the dangers that, in the  government position, the MSZP's ability to act will be hampered  by the dominance of trade unions; the economic policy based on  modernization will be replaced by an economic policy based on  distribution; trade union demands can be asserted much better  from within than from outside; or that politics and interest  representation will be mixed up. These dangers do not  automatically follow from an election alliance.    [Radai] However, we are talking about a prominent place on  the MSZP's list; [MSZOSZ Chairman] Sandor Nagy is on the second  place, ahead of you.    [Bekesi] This certainly has a negative message, but I would  not like to discuss this just now. However, if the danger of  setting up a trade union type government was in the background  of the election alliance then I would be the first one to  protest most decisively. In fact, I would not even participate  in this. This would be just as bad for the country as the  confirmation of another conservative governmental cycle.    [Radai] Nevertheless, I do not understand why you exclude  the possibility of this.    [Bekesi] Because the MSZP accepted a modernization program  on which its whole political program and campaign is based, and  on the basis of which it decided its coalition principles and  laid them down in writing. Otherwise, the program would have  been modified, its modernization goals would have been softened,  and actual trade union demands would have been included in it  that -- if this is what the electors wish -- then could be  implemented as a government program. However, this did not  happen. On the other hand, we never denied -- in fact, I  usually emphasize this -- that, in the course of implementing  the program, a government that includes the MSZP will fight  tough battles with the interest lobbies, in spite of the  election alliance with the MSZOSZ. Therefore, we are not to  prepare for some kind of a peaceful coexistence based on  concessions, rather, the chance for the self-restriction of  trade unions will increase, and the basis for this will be  established precisely by the good relations between the MSZP and  the trade unions.    [Radai] In your view, are people who will vote for the  Socialists aware that they will also be voting for a very strict  economic program that is much more liberal than social  democratic?    [Bekesi] It only makes sense to describe an economic  program in economic philosophy terms if a government or country  has a choice. However, today in Hungary, the room for maneuver  is so narrow and the path is so determined that a realistic  economic policy necessarily has to have more liberal than  conservative or social democratic elements. Rather than meaning  that the MSZP is promoting a liberal economic policy, this means  that in this situation, being realists, the MSZP is also  accepting the goals that have a liberal content. In fact, I do  not even protest against being called a liberal economic policy  maker because I am convinced that for decades, this will be the  only realistic economic policy in Hungary.    [Radai] Has your move from the original eighth place to  third got anything to do with the fact that the Bekesi program  has become the official party program?    [Bekesi] The official explanation for the eighth place was  that the party leadership adhered to two basic principles when  it made up the party list, namely that it should reflect the  party hierarchy, and that it should ensure the agreed positions  of election allies. In this context, my eighth place was  justifiable because I do not participate in the work of the  party's leading bodies, I am only a simple parliamentary deputy.  However, the national list can, at the same time, be seen as a  kind of party message as to what programs and people it  considers important for itself. Therefore, my eighth place was  unacceptable for the party's majority and naturally for me, too.  The election committee that made the original proposal  obviously had not properly assessed the situation and the power  structure. It would have been a strange decision that would not  have strengthened respect for the party if a politician who  played a major role in drawing up the program had been pushed  into the background. The assessment of the power structure was  mistaken because it was based on the assumption that the  congress and the party's majority that is to make the decision  would accept this. It did not accept this, in fact, there was  an grassroots outcry.    [Radai] [Prime Minister] Peter Boross recently said that the  MSZP is deceiving its electors by not naming its prime  ministerial candidate. Why and for how long do you wish to keep  this issue pending?    [Bekesi] Until the elections, or even further. We will  decide this at an extraordinary congress after the elections but  before the coalition talks. Social-liberal, Christian-social,  or broad social-liberal-conservative coalitions require a  completely different prime ministers. A concrete person can even  prevent and exclude certain possibilities. As we do not wish to  limit ourselves and do not wish to prevent the establishment of  an efficient coalition, we are now waiting, and we do not  exclude the possibility of finding a suitable person, who enjoys  the confidence of the other possible coalition partners, from  outside the party.    [Radai] Is it also possible that the MSZP will win the  elections with a big majority, reaches very good results, and  still offers the prime ministerial chair to someone else?    [Bekesi] No, this is impossible. A party that plays a  determining role after the elections and generously offers its  prime ministerial function to someone else does not exist  anywhere in the world.    [Radai] An increasing number of people, including some  Socialist politicians, have been saying that they are afraid  that the MSZP will win too well, and it will find it difficult  or impossible to find coalition partners.    [Bekesi] It is undoubtedly true that a strong imbalance in  the power structure can make it difficult to form a coalition.  It is unlikely that we will reach more than 50 percent.  Therefore, it has to be a coalition. However, if the MSZP's  majority is so big that the partners would be in a subordinate  position, they might prefer to be in an opposition role. Of  course, this is only speculation. On the basis of various  assessments and my personal experience, I do not exclude the  possibility that we will win the elections. However, I am not  expecting a landslide victory. Should this nevertheless happen,  it will present a new situation.    [Radai] What are your views on [Alliance of Free Democrats,  SZDSZ campaign chief] Balint Magyar's recent statement according  to which the SZDSZ is only willing to enter into a coalition  with the MSZP if the liberals can be the leading force of the  coalition?    [Bekesi] This stance is a bit difficult for me to accept. I  am not saying that we cannot talk about this, but ultimatums  should not be made, because this is a very delicate and  complicated issue.    [Radai] Is it possible that you will be the prime minister?    [Bekesi] Hardly. This is very unlikely because the MSZP's  leadership has completely different ideas. I do not know what  most people in the party think about this issue because I have  never been assessed this way.    [Radai] Would you object to Gabor Kuncze being prime  minister?    [Bekesi] Not at all. Kuncze is a nice person, calm  politician, and I have a very good relationship with him. It is  a different matter what kind of political power structure,  election results, and coalition agreements are needed for  Kuncze's name to be put forward. It is certain that I could  work very well with him, I think he is an excellent person.    [Radai] What will the MSZP do if it wins the elections but  does not find any coalition partners?    [Bekesi] If it does not find any coalition partners because  all parties distance themselves from it then it will have to go  into opposition. This is the only case when a victorious party  has a political and moral basis to go into opposition. In  theory, it is also possible -- although I cannot imagine this --  that we accept governing in a minority. This would probably  only last a very short time. We would probably be turned out of  office on the first possible occasion. In that case, new  elections would have to be called.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Syria Does Not Care About  Disinformation Campaigns," AL-BA'TH says: As the Geneva summit  between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton approaches  with the beginning of the countdown for this important event, we  expect an escalation in disinformation campaigns against Syria  and its position on the peace process. Israel has indeed been  launching these campaigns since the announcement of the summit.  Israel will continue to escalate these campaigns in a bid to  besmirch Syria's position first and influence any possible  results at the summit.    AL-BA'TH adds: Israel's disinformation campaigns are not the  first, nor will they be the last. It is a familiar method which  gets tougher whenever Syria manages to defend all Arab rights.    The paper asserts that Syria's stands, which stem from  leader  al-Asad's view of the nature of the Arab-Zionist conflict, are  not likely to change. This is not meant as a hard-line  approach, but is in line with Syria's concern about reaching a  just and comprehensive peace in the region.    The paper says: It is a fact in politics that whenever the  enemy's attacks against you gets tougher, it is evidence of your  sound position. Syria is in no need of any such evidence. In  light of the historic leadership of President al-Asad, Syria  knows exactly what it wants and this has become a deep-rooted  approach that reflects the nation's conscience and aspirations.    AL-BA'TH concludes: At any rate, the upcoming summit between  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton will attract the  attention of the world which pins high hopes on the summit. No  matter how tough Israel's rabid campaigns against Syria get,  they will not affect Syria's stands and convictions, especially  since its policy does not know secrets and corridors.</p>

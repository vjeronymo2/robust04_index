			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Robert Porter, chief reporter: "MI6 Targeting </F> Iran as Main Threat to West"]    [Excerpt] Britain's public warning to Iran to sever its  links with the IRA stems from a policy decision that MI6 should  target the Iranians as the most potent threat to Western  security.    The decision was taken when the collapse of the Soviet Union  freed resources tied up since the Cold War began. Although  Russia still takes up a large chunk of MI6 resources, the  intelligence spotlight has increasingly shone on Iran.    The high quality of evidence behind the British warning  indicates intense intelligence activity over a long period.  Names, dates, places of meetings, details of financial and arms  proposals -- including ground-to-air missiles -- were all  collated before the British Government decided to act.    Relations between the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOI)  and Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA have been under intense  intelligence scrutiny, as have the Iranian front men heading the  operation.    Plans to arm and finance the IRA have been personally  supervised by Amir Eravani -- known in the West as Amir Hussein  Taghavi -- who is MOI chief for Western Europe and America.    The co-ordinator of links with the IRA is said to be an  Iranian diplomat based in The Hague. Other agents enjoy  diplomatic cover in European capitals including Bonn and Paris.    Although there is no evidence of arms having been sent to  the  IRA, it is likely that some financial aid has been given. The  MOI is believed to provide similar aid to other groups such as  the Basque ETA and Japan's Red Army Faction.    Britain's warning has worsened relations with Iran which  have  been at a low level since the late Ayatollah Khomeini called for  the death of Salman Rushdie in 1989. He claimed Rushdie's novel,  The Satanic Verses, blasphemed Islam.    The Tehran Times, the influential Tehran  English-language daily, yesterday accused London of sheltering  "anti-Iranian terrorists." [passage omitted]</p>

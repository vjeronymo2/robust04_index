			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOLF LEAVES RAIDERS FOR JETS' JOB  </P> <P> Ron Wolf, the Raiders' director of player personnel, has accepted a similar job  with the New York Jets.  </P> <P> "It was just a tremendous opportunity to go to work for a vibrant  organization," Wolf said.  </P> <P> "But leaving the Raiders after all these years was a tough decision."  </P> <P> Wolf, 51, a native of New Freedom, Pa., said being able to relocate to the East  was also a factor in his decision.  </P> <P> Wolf started with the Raiders as a talent scout in 1963 when Al Davis took over  as coach and general manager. When Davis became commissioner of the American  Football League in 1966, Wolf accompanied him to the league office as  coordinator of talent. But he soon returned to the Raiders as the director of  player personnel, and has held that job since, except for three years, 1975-78,  with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  </P></p>

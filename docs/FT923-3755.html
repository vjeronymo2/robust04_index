			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Provisions halve ABP to Pounds 15m - Severance pay costs Pounds 2m and property write-downs total Pounds 10m ASSOCIATED BRITISH Ports, the UK's largest ports group, yesterday announced interim profits down by a half after provisions of Pounds 10m for property developments and Pounds 2m in severance payments. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 31.7m to Pounds 15.1m in the six months to June 30. The dividend, however, is raised 5 per cent to 3.25p (3.1p). Sir Keith Stuart, chairman, said this reflected the group's underlying strength. Turnover fell to Pounds 108m (Pounds 197m) due to a dive to Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 94m) in the value of property development disposals. Trading profit for ports and transport fell to Pounds 35.6m (Pounds 39.3m), reflecting severance costs and lower margins caused by reduced volumes of vehicles and construction materials. Overall tonnage handled at the company's 22 ports increased by 3 per cent to 53m tonnes. The company said revenues from July and August suggested that the division's second-half results would be worse. Property investment, which includes 6,000 acres of land within ports, lifted trading profits from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 11.2m, helped by rising rentals. But property development recorded a loss of Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 4.8m profit). There were no significant sales during the period and development properties held for sale are only 31 per cent occupied. Development properties' book value within Grosvenor Square Properties, ABP's property arm, fell to Pounds 124m following the Pounds 10m provision. Sir Keith said it was too early to tell if further provisions were needed. No sizeable sale was expected 'in the next few months.' Interest charges declined to Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 27.6m) as average borrowings fell, although net borrowings at the period-end stood at Pounds 348m (Pounds 344m). Shareholders' funds increased to Pounds 617m (Pounds 609m). Gearing increased by 1 percentage point from the year-end figure to 56 per cent. Including off balance sheet borrowings of Pounds 14m (Pounds 26m), gearing was unchanged at 59 per cent. Earnings fell to 5.7p (12p), leaving the dividend covered 1.75 times (3.9 times). COMMENT Given its development property problems, ABP could have done without yesterday's gloomy comments on the second half for its port and transport arm. Although the division was never expected to be immune from recession, news that things are getting worse rather than holding even knocked the shares down 16p to 224p, against a high for the year of 440p. Although ABP's long-term quality is not in doubt, the company is in a holding situation. Neither its high borrowings nor interest costs can come down without significant property sales, which look unlikely in the current market. The company's reticence to discuss further property provisions or port volume details worries supporters in the City, who at present equate reticence with possibly bad news ahead. Full-year forecasts of Pounds 36m, assuming slightly lower second half provisions, put the shares on 17 times. Until some of these factors are resolved, the shares are likely to remain becalmed.</p>

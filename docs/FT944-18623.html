			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Arts: In defence of theatre - Director Richard Eyre warns that the creeping virus of opportunism has infected one of the great glories of British cultural life There are a lot of good reasons for not going to the theatre. For a start, you have to turn up on time and sit in the dark without talking for longish periods. I know many people who find this an insupportable restriction of their freedom. I once spoke to the financier James Goldsmith in the hope of luring him into sponsoring a play at the National Theatre. 'I never go to the theatre,' he said. 'My legs are too long.' And I have a friend, a film director, who hates going to the theatre because it is all in wide-shot. Many people prefer the cinema for its solitary, dreamlike disengagement. John Updike says: 'I've never much enjoyed going to plays. The unreality of painted people standing on a platform saying things they've said to each other for months is more than I can overlook.' For me this is missing the point; it is the re-creation that animates the art and makes it unique. Theatre will always be unfashionable because of its form, its need for order in narrative and in structure, and it will always lag behind a society that is conspicuous for its formlessness. The theatre's concern with the frailty of being human will always look defenceless when set against Mad Max III, The Exterminator, or the confident certainties of politics or journalism. What I like about the theatre is precisely what some people hate about it. I like being made to concentrate. I like the fallibility that goes hand in hand with its immediacy. I like the fact that it happens in the present tense, that it is vulnerable and it is changeable. I like its sense of occasion, the communal event: going in as an individual and emerging as part of a group. I like sharing time with strangers: a beginning and an end, a sense of birth and a sense of death. And I like the singular combination of magic and moral debate. There is no art that uses time, space, gesture, movement, speech, colour, costume, light and music in the way theatre does. It thrives on metaphor: things stand for things rather than being the thing itself, a room becomes a world, a group of characters a whole society. Theatre invokes the astonishment of the unreal and the strange, magnified proportions that occur naturally in childhood. The British are supposed to have the finest theatre in the world, perhaps because so many of the characteristics of the medium coincide with characteristics of the nation. The theatre exploits ritual, processions, ceremonies, hieratic behaviour and dressing up; it depends on adversarial conflict, the stuff of our parliamentary and legal system, and it is concerned with role-playing, which is second nature to a nation obsessed with the signs and manners of class distinction, and inured to the necessity, as a nation and as individuals, of pretending to be what you aren't. But today the theatre's ecology and economy have started to resemble those of the country as a whole; it has become infected by the virus of opportunism. A kind of impatience has grown: actors and directors who might previously have been content to do a year or two in a repertory theatre have begun to look anxiously for jobs in TV, in films, or the national companies, and the previous de facto form of apprenticeship for actors in smaller repertory theatres has started to disappear - as has the unspoken sense of shared experience between theatres in Newcastle, Nottingham, Exeter, Birmingham and London. A feeling has grown like a debilitating fungus that maybe these theatres aren't worth saving, and maybe this park serves no useful purpose, and maybe this hospital should be closed down, and maybe we can't justify these courses for adults, and maybe we don't need all these people who don't have jobs and take up all this space and all this money. I don't believe that it is possible to retrace the steps of the last few years, to perform a sort of social surgery that would change our hearts and minds. We are what we are, and it is we who have made our world as it is. The gift of the post-war era was the promise of freedom: political, and economic, and sexual. It was an illusion: we are prisoners of our own social and economic structures. But the fact we know it was an illusion shouldn't stop us from wanting a better world with our limited resources. We are not a poor country. The leading Romanian actor and director Ion Caramitru told me in shocked tones, expecting my sympathetic support, that he had only 2 per cent of the public spending budget of Romania to spend on culture. Ah, I said, if only we had that much. I always took Margaret Thatcher's dictum 'There's no such thing as society,' as a figure of speech. I didn't realise that she was so literal, so serious, and so determined to prove her proposition. Her legacy is a sort of political epidemic, a determination to subject every organisation, every institution, to ideological reform at best, abolition at worst, all driven by the Three Horsemen of the contemporary Apocalypse: money, management and marketing. I'm not playing naive if I say that I really don't understand why the government doesn't support the arts more fully, but then I'm no more able to understand why the government can't see that education is the key to our future, and that those who work in education might know as much about it as the politicians. We mustn't let scepticism, cynicism, or apathy lead us to be mute in the face of any attempts to dismantle those organisations and institutions which were set up in the spirit of optimism and belief that there is such a thing as society. *Abridged from Misdirections, to be published on October 27 in a revised edition of Utopia and Other Places by Richard Eyre (Vintage Pounds 6.99, 220 pages).</p>

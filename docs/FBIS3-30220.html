			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["AN Newspanorama"-attributed interview with Vladimir </F> Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party,  at Ferihegy Airport in Budapest on 30 January: "Rowdy Soldiers  in the Bar"]    [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Russian  Liberal Democratic Party, spent a short time in Budapest on his  way from Ljubljana to Belgrade. The correspondent of the AN  Newspanorama interviewed him at Ferihegy Airport.    [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Mr. Zhirinovskiy! You have been traveling  a lot lately. Are you also planning a visit to Hungary?    [Zhirinovskiy] I have an invitation here too, but I am  invited to so many European countries now that I cannot yet tell  when I can come here for a longer time.    [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Who invited you?    [Zhirinovskiy] Journalists, public figures, economists, and  public organizations. Besides, I have already been to Hungary  as a student in 1966.    [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Personally, with whom or with what  political parties do you have contacts?    [Zhirinovskiy] With Janos Kadar....    [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] That is the past; what about today?    [Zhirinovskiy] Actually, I have no contacts with anyone. I  met with the representative of your liberal party in Helsinki in  1990 and we exchanged a few letters after that meeting, but that  is all.... You know, the Hungarian liberals received a lot of  money from the German liberals before the elections of 1990 and  this helped them gain good positions at the elections, so they  thought they would not need anyone. However, things did not  turn out well for the Hungarians, because they have a lot of  problems now.    [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Why do you think so?    [Zhirinovskiy] No one wants your Ikarus buses; these buses  fill the air with smoke. These buses are not even required by  us any more, and the West does not want Hungarian goods either.    [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] In your opinion, what would be the correct  road?    [Zhirinovskiy] To build up an Eastern community by making  use of the former CEMA and Warsaw Pact contacts. Naturally, I  think exclusively of economic and cultural cooperation, without  communists and fascists. If we create our own Maastricht and  our own Strasbourg, we will be able to compete with the West.  No doubt, we will be better than the West with our economic  reserves and potential. Then, you Hungarians will also be  strong and free, not like now, when the old contacts have  disintegrated and the West does not show any haste in opening  the door for you. We should not throw out the good things. We  must modernize the contacts in the new situation.    [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Could Russian Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit have a positive effect on these  contacts?    [Zhirinovskiy] Absolutely. We must restart the system that  is advantageous for both sides. In my opinion, there is only  sense in a regional cooperation, like a Danube region  cooperation. There is no need to knock at the doors of the  West, on foreign doors, and ask to be accepted in order to clean  their boots and wash their cars. I hope you do not want NATO  units to replace the former Soviet troops in Hungary and start  feeding them now. Or do you want NATO soldiers massing it up in  bars and pestering the girls?</p>

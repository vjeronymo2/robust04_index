			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico shares surge after roller-coaster session Mexican shares closed sharply higher after a roller-coaster session driven by rumours that the annual anti-inflationary pact was about to be signed, traders said. The IPC index rose 29.01, or 1.03 per cent, at 2,857.52, just off the session high. 'After some profit-taking at midday that cut into the early gains, the index resumed its advance in late trading on investor expectations that the pact will be signed this weekend,' a trader said. Advancing shares led declines 72-22 in brisk trade of 111.4m shares. Brazil Shares in Sao Paulo closed higher as two new opinion polls showed Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso was likely to win Brazil's presidential elections in the first round. Investors like Cardoso's plans to liberalise the economy and privatise more government companies. The Bovespa index gained 580, or 1.1 per cent, to 54,532.</p>

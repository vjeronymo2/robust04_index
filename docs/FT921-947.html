			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Dewar's day - Ballot Box People in Scotland never saw Labour's contentious party political broadcast on the National Health Service on Tuesday. Instead they had what party officials refer irreverently to as 'Donald. The Movie', in which Donald Dewar, the shadow Scottish secretary, portrayed how Labour would heal the economic and social ills of Scotland. Curiously, the Labour party did not get much of a mention. Dewar talked mainly about the Scottish parliament, which Labour is committed to setting up within two years. Thus it assumed that Labour, which should win a little over 40 per cent of the Scottish vote on April 9, would control the parliament. This could suggest that Labour does not expect its ratio of seats to the share of the vote (presently highly favourable to it) to suffer much from the form of proportional representation it is proposing as the parliament's electoral system. Viewers might also have thought that Labour was offering Scotland independence. There was nothing about Westminster in it, and a lot of talk of better links with Europe - just like the Scottish National party.</p>

The MSA said the incident took place about 60 kilometers  northwest of Okinawa Prefecture's Iheya-Jima Island.    The 926-ton Nanshin Maru, a freezer cargo vessel, was  boarded  by the 15 men from another ship, MSA officials said.    One of the men said in Chinese that they were checking the  ship as part of measures to keep tabs on unlawful trade between  China and Taiwan, the officials said.    The man also told a Japanese crew member and others of the  Nanshin Maru that he was sorry for the trouble the surprise  check had caused, they said.    Japanese maritime authorities said that between March 1992  and December 1993 they logged 75 cases of warning shots,  quarantine inspections and tailings in the East China Sea.  China has acknowledged that its patrol ships were involved in  three cases.    Japanese officials said Japan will check the latest episode  with the Chinese Government.</p>

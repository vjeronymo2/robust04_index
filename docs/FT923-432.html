			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Assets and liabilities The collapse of Mr John Major's government has come six months too late, or four years too early, for Mr John Smith's Labour party. If the events of the past fortnight had taken place in March or early April, then even a Labour party led by Mr Neil Kinnock might have bettered the 35 per cent of the vote it attracted in the general election. As to the next contest, which need not be held until April 1997, Labour can expect to do exceedingly well - if the Conservatives are still at one another's throats, and if their leader still has all the authority of a deflated balloon. You only have to state those two big 'ifs' to see that the principal opposition party, which is afire with complacency this week, has work to do if it is not to risk the loss of a fifth general election. It cannot rely on the proposition that the Tory party will continue to govern with effortless incompetence. This is not to say that Labour will derive no long-term benefit from what has happened. It can never again be said that it is Labour alone that is the party of devaluation. It is no longer possible to see an early end to the Conservatives' civil war over Europe. Even when peace is restored the task of reconstruction will be arduous. The likable new prime minister who replaced Mrs Margaret Thatcher is an asset whose value has fallen as sharply as house prices in the south-east. Mr Major can no longer rely on the support of such pillars of Conservatism as the Daily and Sunday Telegraphs and the Daily Mail. He is the same chap we admired during the Gulf war, the Tory hero who surprised everyone by standing on his soap-box and winning in April, the negotiator who outfoxed the continentals at Maastricht. Yet he is now the subject of destructive analyses, whose sub-texts are: 'is he a man of straw?' and 'why did we not see this before?' You may picture such future triumphs as you will for the prime minister - including a victory drive up Whitehall in a chariot drawn by the half-naked figures of Messrs Kenneth Baker, Nicholas Budgen and Michael Spicer - and even in such a fantasy he is still not quite the man he was before he was obliged to flee the exchange rate mechanism. This vision of Conservative distress has given the Labour conference in Blackpool a lift that is unjustified by the party's long record of electoral failure. Mr Major may yet recover, if not completely then at least sufficiently to ride home again on an inflationary boom. Alternatively, if he tries and fails to put a son-of-Maastricht bill through the Commons, or if he shames himself and shies at that fence, he can be replaced. There is plenty of time. The danger for Labour is that it will waste the autumn on self-congratulation. This danger has been compounded by the recent achievements of its new leader, Mr John Smith. Headline success may merely lengthen the period during which the party fails to reform. Last week Mr Smith demonstrated his ability to command the House of Commons. Yesterday the conference endorsed his stately policy of sticking by Maastricht, and returning to managed exchange rates (for which read the ERM). It rejected the Labour Europhobes' calls for a referendum. It threw his defeated rival, Mr Bryan Gould, off the national executive committee within hours of the latter's resignation from the shadow cabinet. It is impossible not to compare Mr Smith's growing ascendancy over his party with Mr Major's loss of control over the Conservatives. None of this will help Labour if it does not find a way of convincing middle-class voters that its aspirations for social justice do not threaten the prosperity that, in spite of the recession, capitalism has brought to so many of them. The latest evidence comes in a Fabian pamphlet, Southern Discomfort, by Giles Radice. It is based on qualitative research among aspirant working-to-middle-class voters in five south-eastern marginal constituencies. As you might have guessed, Labour, while thought to be caring and fair, is seen as the party that is most likely to take things away, look after losers, and fail to reward or even understand the ambitions of the 'ordinary man'. Nothing that has been said at this conference so far suggests that Labour realises what it has to do about that fatal perception. I have a suggestion. If Mr Bill Clinton becomes president, visit the US to see how he did it. The Democratic candidate is running a campaign that does not merely seek to allay the fears of the American middle class. It promotes Mr Clinton as the friend of capitalism, the man who wants prosperous ordinary people to prosper. There are many differences between the US and British polities, but on this central question the Democrats are instructive. What they have to teach is more fundamental than talk of accommodation with the Liberal Democrats, electoral reform, green politics, or any of the other items in the party's grey 'agenda for change'.</p>

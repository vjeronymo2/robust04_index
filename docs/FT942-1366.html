			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Observer: Penalty shot Football and politics, a heady cocktail, particularly for Cameroonians. Cameroon's team is once more threatening to strike if it's not paid some bonuses before its next World Cup fixture. The team played similar tactics before its last qualifying match against Zimbabwe, in October 1993. Then, Cameroon needed a win to guarantee a berth in the final. Oddly enough, for such a football-obsessed nation, many fans actually hoped for a bad result. The reason? Opposition parties had called a general strike for the following day against the unpopular government of president Paul Biya. They dreaded the regime calling a public holiday if the Indomitable Lions won their match. Nevertheless, Cameroon qualified, a holiday was duly declared, the strike threat was defused - and Biya survived. Who knows what the outcome this time round might be - for soccer or politico stars.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Eternal problems of Church funding: The crisis forcing the General Synod to reform Anglican finances FEW PEOPLE attend their local church because they want to make it more financially efficient. Churches, like charities and voluntary organisations in general, draw support from those who are more likely to spend money on worthwhile causes than worry about cash flow and balanced budgets. Such values pose particular difficulties for the Church of England. Its status as established church, custodian of historic monuments and stage-manager of lavish state occasions can lead to it being viewed, even by its active members, like a public library or the National Health Service - something everyone takes for granted but feels no personal responsibility for having to finance. These ingrained attitudes collided with plain talking at the summer session of the Church's General Synod which ended in York on Tuesday. The Church of England is in financial trouble which, synod members were warned, is going to demand radical changes in the way it operates. By the end of the century it must be transformed from a largely centralised institution, heavily dependent on investment income from the Church Commissioners - who are responsible for the Church's main investments - to one where individual parishes pay their own way. For the Church Commissioners' assets are not what they once were. About half are in property, and the recent decline in the market was the main factor in the Church's income-producing assets losing more than Pounds 800m in value between 1989 and last year. The Lambeth Group, a committee set up last year following criticism of the commissioners' management of the Church's assets, is due to report soon. If it shares the view of Sir Michael Colman, chairman of Reckitt &amp; Colman and the first church estates commissioner, it will conclude that storing up so much treasure in property holdings in the 1980s left the commissioners seriously exposed. However critical the report proves to be, the reality is that the Church has regarded the commissioners as a perpetual taxpayer, on whose back improvements in clergy stipends, pensions and other well-intentioned developments have been built. The Rt Rev John Wayne, Bishop of Chelmsford and chairman of the Lambeth Group, says reliance on the commissioners' income has led to the assumption that 'an Anglican pound was always worth Pounds 3 or Pounds 4' compared with other denominations that have to raise more funds locally. Other churches have therefore been more successful at fund-raising. A typical Church of England worshipper gives between Pounds 2.50 and Pounds 3.00 a week - respectable by general charity fund-raising standards, but little more than half the 5 per cent of net income that the Church encourages. In the Chelmsford diocese itself, which covers Essex and parts of east London, one-third of the parishes subsidise the other two-thirds. A study is being undertaken to discover the characteristics of a financially successful parish but what is already clear is that the underperforming two-thirds include parishes in the more affluent parts of Essex. A deteriorating financial position will bring an increased emphasis on fund-raising to the Church of England, both by trying to persuade existing worshippers to give higher amounts, and encouraging more people to go to church. The Church has already made its first moves into corporate videos and television advertising, and fund-raising styles may become more modern. Mr Alan McLintock, chairman of the central board of finance, spoke approvingly at the synod of high quality events with personalised invitations and good food, compared with the more common existing method - an evening of discussion in the church hall 'to the accompaniment of fairly typical church refreshments which I can describe bleakly as sausage rolls and coffee'. Even if the Church surmounts the considerable hurdles of increasing its local-level income substantially, other problems will arise. One of the most fundamental of these concerns the radical change in relationship that would be likely to develop between financially independent parishes paying the stipends of their own clergy and the Church's national leadership.</p>

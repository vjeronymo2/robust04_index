			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Chile peso revalued to trim reserves CHILE'S central bank yesterday revalued the peso by 5 per cent against the dollar, in an effort to stem a build-up of foreign exchange reserves which was hampering both monetary management and the fight against double-digit annual inflation. The central bank had been resisting a revaluation to keep exports competitive, but a flood of dollars - from direct foreign investment and a record Dollars 8.9bn in exports last year - forced the bank to buy hundreds of millions of dollars to keep the exchange rate low. The frequent interventions became too costly for the central bank and international reserves shot up to Dollars 6.64bn, enough to cover 11 months of imports. They also endangered the bank's monetary targets. The authorities are resisting calls to free the exchange rate and will continue with their 'crawling peg' adjustment of the currency. But they will allow the peso/dollar rate to move 10 per cent either side of a central rate that, as before, will be adjusted daily in line with inflation. The allowed fluctuation used to be 5 per cent. The revaluation of the peso will make imports cheaper and help the central bank to lower inflation to a target of 15 per cent by the end of 1992, from 18.7 per cent last year. Also, Mr Alejandro Foxley, finance minister, announced measures intended to ease the dollar pressure on the economy and increase investment: Foreign investors will now be able to repatriate capital after one year instead of three. Chile's private pension funds, the country's largest institutional investors with almost Dollars 10bn in assets, will be allowed to invest 1.5 per cent of their portfolios abroad. The Chilean economy grew by 5.5 per cent in 1991 - its eighth consecutive year of growth. All forecasts agree the economy will repeat this strong performance in 1992.</p>

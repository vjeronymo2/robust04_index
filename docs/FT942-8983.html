			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / People: Hong Kong billionaire joins Standard Chartered's board Standard Chartered, the international banking group recovering after several years in the doldrums, has appointed Ronnie Chan, 43, one of Hong Kong's wealthiest property developers, as a non-executive director. Chan, a US citizen who lives in Hong Kong, is the first of two new non-executives who are being recruited from a part of the world which produces the bulk of the group's profits. Patrick Gillam, who took over as chairman a year ago, is keen to reshape his UK-orientated board and make it more representative of a region which should provide the group with its greatest growth over the next few years. Apart from recruiting another director from the Asia Pacific, the group plans to hold two board meetings in the region every year. Chan's appointment helps fill a gap on the board left by the recent retirement of several non-executive directors: Robin Baillie, Bill Brown, John Craig and Geoffrey Williams. Chan, a US citizen who has an MBA from the University of Southern California, is well known to Standard Chartered. He is chairman of the Hang Lung Development Company, the quoted parent of a group of property related businesses which include Amoy Properties and Grand Hotel Holdings. Standard Chartered sold its Hong Kong headquarters to part of Chan's property empire in 1992. Forbes magazine has estimated that he is worth over Dollars 1bn. In addition to his interests in several publicly quoted companies, he has substantial private business interests, which include the Morningside Group and Springfield &amp; Company. The latter is involved in financial trading and has offices in New York, Boston, Chicago, Hong Kong, Beijing and Taipei.</p>

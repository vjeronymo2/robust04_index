			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bryant pleases City with surge to Pounds 14.6m Profits of Bryant Group, the Midlands-based housebuilder, jumped 95 per cent to Pounds 14.6m pre-tax during the six months to end-November. The better than expected return prompted a 5p rise in the share price to 191p on a day when most other share prices were falling. Mr Andrew MacKenzie, chief executive, said the improvement was due mainly to a strong performance from housebuilding which increased operating profits by 55 per cent to Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 8.7m). The interim figures were also helped by a Pounds 300,000 return to profits from associated residential and commercial property operations. In the corresponding half year these had incurred a Pounds 1.9m deficit. Interest payments declined from Pounds 900,000 to Pounds 400,000. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.4p from earnings per share of 3.6p (1.9p). Group turnover increased from Pounds 138.4m to Pounds 178.2m. The number of homes sold increased from 1,290 to 1,480. Average prices rose from Pounds 81,000 to Pounds 94,000 as the group reduced production of one and two bedroom homes to concentrate on higher margin large homes. The mainspring of the profits improvement came in southern England where the group built some 600 homes and moved from a loss of about Pounds 2m to an operating profit of about the same amount. Mr MacKenzie said the group had used up most of the zero and low margin land it had acquired expensively in southern England during the late 1980s. The Midlands market, where the group also built about 600 homes, remained good, producing operating margins in excess of 15 per cent. The north of England generated reasonable profits after initial start-up costs. Bryant expects to sell more than 3,000 homes in the current year, compared with 2,815 in 1992-93. It anticipated that it would be building more than 4,000 homes a year by 1996. Construction profits improved from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 3.1m, helped by the timing of payments on successful claims rather than any general improvement in contracting. Commercial property activities fared less well with operating losses increasing from Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 1.9m after provisions of Pounds 2m against some commercial properties. COMMENT The market was rightly pleased with Bryant's first half performance. The switch to higher margin properties should continue to benefit while the geographical expansion is paying dividends. The high cost of the land bank - at an average Pounds 25,000 a plot (land acquired since the year end has cost Pounds 33,000 a plot) - may cause some eyebrows to rise but is justified, says Bryant, compared with an average selling price in 1994 expected to be at least Pounds 100,000 a home. Gearing currently is about 25 per cent, compared with 3 per cent at the half year, but the balance sheet can afford it. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 32m would put the company on a prospective p/e of more than 20. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 42m in 1994-95 would still leave the group on a multiple in the late teens. This rating may be justified but seems unlikely to rise much further with most of the good news already in the share price.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Foreigners and Haitians flee amid rumours of invasion THOUSANDS of foreigners living in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, gathered at its international airport yesterday in an effort to flee the country following the broadcast of a statement by supporters of the military government that all white foreigners should leave immediately. An attempt by the military government, through another broadcast yesterday, to retract the command appeared only to have added to the growing panic and tension. Meanwhile, Haitians are leaving the capital for the countryside in the wake of rumours that a foreign military invasion is imminent as part of international efforts to restore Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president. Clashes between factions supporting Mr Aristide and those backing the military government, which has refused to step down, claimed 16 lives over the weekend, and appeared likely to continue yesterday as Mr Aristide's supporters organised three days of mourning for Mr Guy Malary, the justice minister who was assassinated on Thursday. Diplomats said Haitians were convinced that foreign troops would land in a matter of days unless the military rulers left office and made way for Mr Aristide to return. The fears of an invasion heightened at the weekend as warships from the US and Canada took up positions off Haiti's coast to enforce an international economic embargo aimed at forcing Gen Raoul Cedras, the military leader, and other officers to step down in accordance with an agreement reached with Mr Aristide in early July. Gen Cedras and Lt Col Michel Francois, the police chief, have said they will not leave office. The effectiveness of earlier attempts at an embargo have been frustrated by hectic trading across the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which share the island of Hispaniola. The Dominican government has said it will reinforce military patrols at the border, but businessmen in Santo Domingo, the capital, said yesterday that this might not be enough to prevent some soldiers and other smugglers from selling petrol and other essentials to the Haitians. Supporters of Mr Aristide say factions in the military have plotted the murder of several prominent Haitians, including Aristide supporters and members of the civilian government, to frustrate further the return of Mr Aristide. The claim gained currency following the murder last month of Mr Antoine Izmery, a businessman and supporter of Mr Aristide, and that of Mr Malary last week. Likely targets of the campaign are reported to be Mr Robert Malval, the prime minister, and Mr Evans Paul, the mayor of Port-au-Prince and a supporter of Mr Aristide.</p>

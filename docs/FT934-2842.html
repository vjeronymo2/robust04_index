			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: DTI acts against City &amp; Westminster directors The Department of Trade and Industry is seeking to disqualify four former directors of City &amp; Westminster, the finance house which collapsed in 1991, from acting as directors. The department said yesterday that disqualification proceedings against Mr Aaron Gershfield, Mr Ivor Gershfield, Mr Andrew Greystoke, and Mr Ian Harries relating to their activities as directors of the finance house had been lodged with the High Court yesterday. The action was taken under under Section 6 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. This states that directors will be disqualified for unfit conduct or if they have been on the boards of insolvent companies. The penalty is disqualification for between two and 15 years. Each of the four have been directors of several liquidated or dissolved companies. Some of the active companies in which they are currently listed as directors are: the Householders Association, where Mr Ivor Gershfield was recently named as a general manager - Mr Aaron Gershfield and Mr Harries; Computerised Arts and Typesetting - Mr Aaron Gershfield and Mr Harries; Mineco Designs - Mr Ivor Gershfield. The DTI action arises from City &amp; Westminster. A court date has been set for February 7. City &amp; Westminster went into receivership on Friday December 13 1991 after a turbulent two years as a public company. Mr Greystoke brought City &amp; Westminster to the market through a reverse takeover in 1989. His City &amp; Westminster Financial, a minor corporate finance house, and some Gershfield family interests were injected in to AM Group, a quoted film and television services company. However, he soon resigned as chairman and chief executive, along with three other directors, and was replaced by Mr Ivor Gershfield and his son, Aaron. The following year, the DTI looked into the reverse takeover and a Pounds 5m capital raising. Questions had been raised over a shareholders circular which, it was alleged, had not revealed the full impact of a put option granted by CWF to an Isle of Man company. City &amp; Westminster also launched legal proceedings against some advisers to the reverse takeover claiming that full disclosure had not been made.</p>

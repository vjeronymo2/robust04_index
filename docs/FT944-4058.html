			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Belgian minister quits amid fraud claims Belgium's defence minister, Mr Leo Delcroix, resigned on Thursday following allegations of tax fraud in connection with a villa he owns in the south of France, Reuter reports from Brussels. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime minister, said he had accepted the resignation of the 45-year-old politician, who denied the allegations on Wednesday. The Flemish Christian Democrat Mr Karel Pinxten has been named as Mr Delcroix's successor. Mr Pinxten, 42, was a member of the European parliament from 1989 to 1991 when he was elected to the Belgian parliament. Mr Delcroix, who became defence minister in March 1992, was previously general secretary of a leading Belgian political party, the Christian Democrat CVP, Mr Dehaene's party. In his resignation letter he said: 'In my new situation I can defend myself better against the insinuations and accusations. . . . which I consider extremely unjust.' The Belgian magazine Humo alleged earlier this week that he had defrauded the tax authorities in connection with his French villa and had used 'black labour' to build it. Three Belgian socialist politicians, including deputy prime minister Guy Coeme, resigned from central and regional government posts last January over the so-called Agusta affair involving alleged bribery in an army helicopter contract. Earlier this year Mr Delcroix denied he owned a home in France but said on Wednesday he had been deliberately vague about it so as not to compromise his chances in European parliament elections. He did well in the poll but did not take up a seat. He told a news conference on Wednesday he owned a majority stake in a French company, Capricorne Sud, whose main asset is the villa and the land it is built on. He said he had acquired the stake for about BFr300,000 (Dollars 9,400). Political analysts said yesterday that a lot of questions remained after Mr Delcroix's explanation. One claimed that Mr Dehaene had apparently tried to limit the damage to his government by asking the minister to resign. The Humo report, headlined 'Chronology of a lie', quoted a tax expert as saying that many Belgians using black or undeclared money to buy a villa in southern France use the cover of a French company. 'Capricorne Sud fits entirely into this scheme,' Humo said. Mr Delcroix said the money for the villa came from 'my family, my wife and myself, from parents and parents-in-law. It is just a family project.' He estimated it was worth between BFr15m and BFr20m (Dollars 468,000 and Dollars 625,000), rebutting suggestions that it was worth BFr70m (Dollars 2.18m).</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Wm Morrison rises 34% to Pounds 36.2m - Slight reduction in margins confirms Tesco's view of recession hitting grocery sector WM Morrison Supermarkets, the Bradford-based grocery chain, continued its resilient run of results by posting a 34 per cent increase to Pounds 36.2m in interim pre-tax profits. The improvement from last time's Pounds 27m resulted from the contribution of three stores opened during the period and a Pounds 4.5m reversal in its interest position, from Pounds 2.7m payable to Pounds 1.8m receivable, following the cash inflow from last year's Pounds 97.6m rights issue. Sales in the 26 weeks to August 1 grew 17 per cent to Pounds 623.5m. However, net operating margin dropped a shade to 5.8 per cent as increases in staff costs and overheads outstripped the rate of sales growth, confirming the view given earlier in the week by Tesco that recession has finally caught up with the food retailing sector. Mr Ken Morrison, chairman, continued to adopt a cautious stance in view of the low level of food price inflation and the general state of the economy. 'I believe it is prudent to regard the present conditions as likely to be with us permanently and face up to the situation and manage our business accordingly,' he said. During the period Morrison opened superstores at Beverley, Walsall and Mansfield and will open another three in the second half. The company's existing 53 stores contributed 4.3 percentage points to the overall 17 per cent sales gain. Mr Martin Ackroyd, finance director, said staff costs as a percentage of sales had increased from 8.9 per cent to 9 per cent and overhead costs from 4.1 per cent to 4.3 per cent as the company strove to maintain its standards of service. 'We always work on the basis that however tough it is it is going to get a bit worse,' he said. Next year Morrison will continue its aggressive opening programme with seven superstores expected to come on stream with eight more in 1994. Morrison is adding new space as a percentage of its total selling area at a faster rate than a any of its bigger national rivals. The company's depreciation charge rose by 43 per cent as the company became the first food retailer to begin depreciating the value of its sites. Borrowings stood at Pounds 19.8m at the end of the period with gearing having fallen from 48.6 per cent to 5.7 per cent. Fully diluted earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 3.03p. The interim dividend is lifted 20 per cent to 0.16p. See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- "The Russian military budget  of 37 trillion roubles, approved by the State Duma for the  current year, does not guarantee the survival of the Russian  Army, ITAR-TASS was told by head of the Defence Ministry's chief  budget and finance board Colonel-General Vasiliy Vorobyov.    In the opinion of the Defence Ministry, all the articles of  the military budget are underfinanced. Particularly alarming is  the problem of cash allowances to servicemen. The Russian  Finance Ministry monthly issues funds for this purpose which are  not enough to pay allowances to one-third of the officers and  noncoms. Under the new budget 50 per cent of the personnel will  get their cash allowances with intervals, sometimes lasting from  two to three months. "The situation is also alarming as regards  allocations for armaments, military hardware, property, capital  repairs and maintenance, scientific and technological needs,"  Vorobyov stated.    Shortage of money for the minimum requirements of the Army,  the latter's insolvency has brought about a situation when some  regional authorities have begun to cut off electric power supply  to military installations, ensuring Russia's security. For  instance, power workers of Archangel region had cut off power  supply to a considerable part of the local strategic missile  forces testing ground. Notifications are being received  regularly by anti-aircraft defence units, including their  central command station. "It is clear to everybody, even to a  person poorly versed in national security problems, that such a  situation is frought with very dangerous consequences," the  general stressed.</p>

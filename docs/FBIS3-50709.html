I walked toward the main entrance of City Hall, which  was occupied by members of the self-styled Zapatista National  Liberation Army (EZLN). I asked to speak with Commander Marcos.  An Indian carrying a gun told me to go in. I climbed to the  second floor. Everything is destroyed; only the lamps hung  intact from the ceiling.    [Gutierrez] Commander, your troops, the EZLN, seem a bit too  weak to march into Mexico City and overthrow Salinas. Is your  attitude a bit naive?    [Commander Marcos] Look, if you are waiting for our arrival  in the capital, it will take some time. he chuckles  But seriously, I can tell you that what you see here in San  Cristobal is only a very small portion of our troops; many of  our men would never be recognized because they wear clothes from  the mountains, where there are many more Zapatistas than you or  the government can imagine. Beside, we do not expect to arrive  in the capital with our men alone but with many more who will  join us along the way.    [Gutierrez] Your weapons are much less powerful than the  Army's. Is that a great disadvantage?    [Commander Marcos] Our weapons are the people and we know  the  mountains better than anyone.    [Gutierrez] Where were you born?    [Commander Marcos] I can tell you I am a Mexican, like all  the struggling members of the Zapatista Army. I am not from  Chiapas, however.    [Gutierrez] Where did you receive your military training?    [Commander Marcos] I can tell you I have military training  but nothing else. I know the difference between fighting in the  city, in the countryside, in the flat lands, in the mountains,  in the jungle, and in the desert.    A colleague of Commander Marcos addresses him and they talk  for a few minutes. I look around. I see Chiapas Indians, armed  with really old guns except for some 19 or 20 of them who carry  better weapons. I take the opportunity to ask one of them about  the reasons and risks of this uprising, and the only reply I  received was: "We have been shafted, we are hungry, but we are  fighting. We have no home or medicines, but we are fighting."    I return to Commander Marcos who just learned that the  uprising was reported on television. He stares at me and says:  "Let's see if those sons of bitches continue to deny the  existence of guerrillas in Mexico."    [Gutierrez] Have you anything to do with Liberation  Theology?    [Commander Marcos] No, we have become liberated without any  theology. he laughs Among our people we have  evangelists, Catholics, atheists, sorcerers, etc. I am not  joking about the sorcerers. There are sorcerers from Chiapas.    Marcos seems well instructed and very sure of his  statements. He jokes around as if his life were not in serious  danger    [Gutierrez] Does the EZLN want new elections after a  transition government?    [Commander Marcos] We are demanding real elections for the  first time in many years. What we now have, what they are  planning for Colosio is just a masquerade. We all know that the  votes do not count and that everything follows the whim of  (Carlos) Salinas, who is a usurper and a traitor. We demand  real elections with a chance for all parties, not just for the  PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party].    [Gutierrez] Everything seems to indicate that the  inhabitants  of San Cristobal are not in the least happy with your attack on  this city. Everyone on the street is making comments like,  violence doesn't lead anywhere and other similar things. Are  you not worried about this repudiation by the people?    [Commander Marcos] Of course I would prefer things to be  different. But I want to clarify that San Cristobal's residents  and the non-Indian population are racists. If one of them  boards a bus and an Indian is seated, they make him stand to  allow the other person to sit. If an Indian is coming down the  street, either walking or on his bicycle, they will drive their  cars dangerously close, threatening the Indian. If those kind  of people condemn the EZLN, you can imagine that I do not care  in the least.    "As for the issue that violence doesn't lead anywhere, I can  answer you that we have adopted this extreme position because of  the institutional violence that causes us to die of cholera,  malaria, or measles; which allows the Army to permanently  violate human rights; and which allows hunger and misery to  prevail in the country, all because of Salinas. We do not even  want to become the government. We only want a democratically  elected government and respect for ethnic groups.    Another thing I would like to clarify is that I am not the  leader of the EZLN. We do not have a leader; we have a  committee. I am only in charge of the operation in San  Cristobal."

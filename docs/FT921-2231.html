			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Shares to be affected by election already on the move Shares that might gain from a Labour victory rose strongly yesterday while those that might gain from a Tory win dropped. 'Labour gainers' are now less that half a percentage point below their level on the day the election was announced. Unpolitical factors are partly responsible: BAT Industries, the tobacco and insurance company, rose most, after raising its dividend on Wednesday. All but one other Labour gainer rose. 'Conservative gainers' are 4 1/2 percentage points below their announcement-day level.</p>

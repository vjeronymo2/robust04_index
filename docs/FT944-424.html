			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / NTT told to open its lines to competitors Japan's telecommunications authorities have ordered NTT, the domestic carrier which has a virtual monopoly on local calls, to allow competitors access to its lines. NTT provides local and long-distance services while three new common carriers compete with it in the long-distance market. The order to NTT by the minister of posts and telecommunications follows a protracted dispute over connection to NTT's local loop for virtual private network (VPN) services, which offer call discounts to large customers. The new carriers have been negotiating for five years without success with NTT, seeking connection to its local lines to enable them to provide VPN services. After NTT began offering such services itself this year, the three carriers asked the telecommunications ministry to intervene. This is the first time the Japanese authorities have intervened in a dispute between telecommunications companies under the telecommunications business law. The ministry said allowing new carriers access to NTT's lines for VPN services would provide greater convenience for telecommunications users. However, it highlighted a big difficulty in Japan's telecommunications industry, in which one company dominates the local network and also competes with much smaller companies in the long-distance market. NTT is the second largest telecommunications company in the world. Japan's new common carriers complain that NTT's dominance of the local network has prevented them from competing with it on an equal footing in the long-distance market. The dispute over VPN services, which prevented the new carriers from providing value-added services at the same time as NTT, will add weight to their argument. The issue has also strengthened calls for a break-up of NTT into long-distance and local businesses when its operations are reviewed next year by the government. The tele-communications ministry believes a break-up could stimulate competition in the telecoms market which has lagged that of the US in terms of new services on offer.</p>

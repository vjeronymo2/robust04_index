			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTERSHOCK JARS NERVES BUT IT DAMAGES LITTLE  </P> <P> A 4.7-magnitude aftershock sent jittery residents of foothill communities in  San Bernardino and eastern Los Angeles counties ducking under desks and rushing  for doorways Friday morning, but authorities said it caused little new damage.  </P> <P> The sharp jolt at 9:26 a.m. triggered rockslides along mountain roads and  stretched some cracks in walls and ceilings, but most of the damage appeared to  be to already frayed nerves.  </P> <P> "About four or five of us tried to get into the same doorway," said Michael  Boddy, an official at the Claremont School of Theology, where staff members  were just beginning to recover from the 5.5-magnitude temblor on Wednesday.  "It's been a little hard to get our steam up."  </P> <P> The aftershock caused a leak in a natural gas line at the University of La  Verne, said Jeff Allred, La Verne's assistant city manager. Several water lines  elsewhere in the city, a few miles from the epicenter, were also reported  broken.  </P> <P> In the most severely affected communities Friday, residents were still sweeping  up glass and rubble and assessing losses from Wednesday's quake.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the state Office of Emergency Services said the agency was  preliminarily estimating damages at $12.3 million. As of late Friday, 38 people  had been reported injured, including four pregnant women who went into early  labor, and 243 homes and 92 businesses had been reported damaged.  </P> <P> At the theology school library Friday, a distraught John C. Trever got his  first glimpse since Wednesday of his collection of ancient Middle Eastern  pottery and artifacts, some of the pieces more than 3,000 years old.  </P> <P> "It's worse than I thought," said Trever, a retired archeologist who was the  first American allowed to examine the Dead Sea Scrolls, 2,000-year-old  manuscripts unearthed more than 40 years ago in what was then Palestine.  </P> <P> Shards of pottery were strewn along the floors of display cases. "It breaks my  heart to see the collection in this condition," Trever said. He leaned close to  a display case and smiled with relief. "I'm glad that wasn't broken," he said,  pointing to a small flask. "It's a little dipper flask that was used in the  time of Solomon."  </P> <P> Also preserved was Trever's photographed copy of the Scroll of Isaiah,  displayed in frames along one wall.  </P> <P> Municipal building inspectors and structural engineers continued making their  rounds Friday. In Claremont, 150 houses were reported damaged, but few so  severely that closure was required, inspectors said.  </P> <P> On the theology school campus, the Kresge Chapel, a towering structure with  67-foot ceilings, has been sealed until engineers can check cracks between roof  and walls. A portion of a building on the campus of the Claremont Graduate  School was sealed off because a concrete panel on the second floor had slipped  its anchoring.  </P> <P> In the Lang Art Gallery on the campus of Scripps College, about 20% of a  collection of modern ceramics was destroyed in the quake Wednesday. But the  gallery is planning to open its annual ceramics exposition as scheduled this  evening, said Steve Comba, registrar of galleries for the six Claremont  Colleges.  </P> <P> In the Honnold Library, which serves the six colleges, staff and volunteers  were cleaning up Friday after the first quake knocked about 10% of the books  onto the floor. Parts of the third and fourth floors were especially hard hit.  Free-standing tiers of bookshelves stood precariously at drunken angles, and  the aisles were knee-deep in books.  </P> <P> In one four-square-block area of Pomona, three pre-1940 churches were blocked  off. The original sanctuary of the First Baptist Church, on Holt Avenue, was  sealed after cracks were detected in the bell tower and on the facade.  </P> <P> "It's really not as bad as it looks," said Dennis Endert, church business  manager. "A couple of blocks came loose and there's some damage to the bell  tower."  </P> <P> Down the street, parts of the Pilgrim Congregational Church also were sealed  off, including the entrance to the Sunday school over which was perched a stone  cross that had swiveled during Wednesday's quake.  </P> <P> "It used to face north," structural engineer Michael Krakower said. "Now it's  facing west."  </P> <P> A block away, on Gibbs Street, members of the congregation of the Trinity  United Methodist Church determined the property had sustained $50,000 in  damages. On Wednesday, they said, bricks and heavy concrete cornices from the  main building had tumbled onto an adjoining nursery, smashing a hole in its  roof. No one was in the nursery at the time.  </P></p>

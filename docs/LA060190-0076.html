			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA AS A TREND-SETTER AND OPPOSITION TO PROP. 111  </P> <P> There should be minimal surprise if we wake up next Wednesday to find the  ballot initiative raising the gasoline tax to pay for improved roads and  highways has been soundly trashed.  </P> <P> Gas prices at the pump have been creeping inexorably, relentlessly higher for  many weeks. The increase averages 25% and is climbing -- in spite of a  well-documented worldwide glut of crude oil and falling wholesale prices.  </P> <P> It's business as usual: the defenseless driver flogged senseless by oil company  greed. Could a voter be blamed for refusing to add even more pain by  masochistically approving a gas tax hike?  </P> <P> ALAN HARVEY  </P> <P> Arleta  </P></p>

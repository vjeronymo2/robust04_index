			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Semih D. Idiz] </F>   [Text] Ankara--The allied force deployed in Turkey under  "Operation Provide Comfort," for protecting Northern Iraqi  Kurds, should go because it sets a precedent for countries such  as Russia to intervene in other areas, a senior Iranian official  said on Wednesday [4 May].    First Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Hashemi, brother of  Iranian president Hashemi-Rafsanjani, added that there was no  longer a risk of Iraqi aggression because it had lost its  economic and military strength and was alone in the world today.    Hashemi, answering questions by the TURKISH DAILY NEWS and  the daily HURRIYET after two days of political consultations in  Ankara with his Turkish counterpart, Foreign Ministry  Undersecretary Ozdem Sanberk, also said that the deployment of  foreign troops in Turkey could lead to regional crises but did  not elaborate.    On the Bosnian question Hashemi said that Turkey and Iran  had  to work together to seek a way for Islamic countries to send  arms to the Bosnian Muslims, who are faced with murder while  international organizations such as the United Nations and NATO  simply looked on.    Referring to his contacts in Ankara, Hashemi said that this  was his first visit abroad after his appointment as First Deputy  Foreign Minister and suggested that this signalled the  importance his country attached to Turkey.    He said that the need for enhancing economic, commercial and  industrial ties between the two countries was one of the  bilateral topics discussed at the Ankara talks.    Hashemi said that the sides had also agreed on the need to  enhance cultural ties which have been noticeably low in the past.    Indicating that security matters were among the priority  issues discussed when taking up bilateral issues, Hashemi said  the cooperation in this sphere between Iran and Turkey "had  reached the desired level."    "The Turkish side has thanked Iran for its close interest in  this area. They are happy that we have returned PKK [Kurdish  Workers Party] militants to Turkey and I will convey their  satisfaction in this area to Iran" he said.    Hashemi was referring to the recent extradition of militants  of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is  fighting a separatist war in southeast Anatolia, and which has  used Iranian territory as a refuge and a base for mounting  attacks against Turkey.    Hashemi also said that they had agreed during the talks on  the need to increase the number of high level contacts between  the two countries in the security field.    Pointing out that Iraq was one of the topics discussed at  great length, Hashemi said that the two countries agreed that  the territorial integrity of Iraq had to be preserved. Hashemi  indicated that there was a consultative mechanism between  Turkey, Iran and Syria for assessing developments in Iraq and  Northern Iraq.    "We are bothered by the presence of foreigners in the  region.  This problem can only be solved with the participation of  regional countries. The problem can not be solved without  Turkey and Iran" Hashemi said, making a clear reference to  Operation Provide Comfort.    He added that Iran also wanted to see more contacts and  more activity between his country, Turkey and Syria under the  "triple mechanism" set up to discuss Iraq. He said that Tehran  wanted to have these contacts not just at the level of foreign  ministers as has been the case to date but also at other levels.  Asked how the deterrence provided by Provide Comfort could be  replaced if this force left Turkey, Hashemi said "they had their  serious doubts" about this whole matter.    He said that if foreign forces are to be deployed in the  region, as they have been in Turkey, then this could set a  precedent for countries such as Russia to intervene in other  areas.    "Although the Soviet Union has gone, today's Russia has  pulled itself together militarily and has significant military  power at its disposal. It comes out in the press from time to  time that Russia wants to intervene in Azerbaijan, and it has  intervened in Tajikistan" Hashemi said, clearly reflecting his  country's concern about developments in the former Soviet Union.  Hashemi also said that "public opinion" was also opposed to the  presence of foreign troops in the region although he did not  mention which country's public opinion he was referring to. "If  public opinion does not want to see foreign soldiers in the  region, then this means that whatever foreign troops there are  in the region are there by force" he said.    Hashemi added that they saw "no necessity for these forces  to  be in the region."    "If we look at Iraq today it is no longer the Iraq of seven  or eight years ago. Both economically and in terms of its  military power Iraq is in a difficult situation today. It does  not have its old power. Apart from this, eight years ago Iraq  used to receive international assistance from many countries.  Many countries would supply it with arms and many countries,  such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, would give it financial  assistance. But today this support does not exist. Iraq has  been left on its own" he said.    Hashemi added that Iraq had failed to get what it wanted  after eight or nine years of fighting with Iran as it had failed  to secure anything from its attack on Kuwait.    "So Iraq has lost its strength and contrary to what is  thought and claimed, it cannot rise and threaten the region  again. Especially not when there is a strong Turkey next to it  on one side and Iran on the other."    He said because of this they saw no need for foreign forces  in the region.    "The presence of foreign forces, in my opinion, has also  caused concerns in Turkey. We are aware of these concerns. I  think the presence of these foreign forces can in the future  leave the region facing problems. They can force a crisis in  the region. I think their presence there, rather than acting as  a deterrent is for creating problems in order to lead the region  into a crisis."    Hashemi also said that Iraq country was suffering greatly  from the U.N. imposed embargo and this necessitated the lifting  of the embargo.    He underscored, however, that it was incumbent on  Iraq--whose  policies he said had destabilized the region by its great  mistakes--to comply with U.N. resolutions for the embargo to be  lifted. Referring to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan  Hashemi said that Armenian forces which had invaded Azeri  territory had to withdraw immediately.    Reflecting the ongoing tension between Tehran and Yerevan  because of the recent downing of an Iranian plane over the  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, allegedly by Armenians, Hashemi  referred to Armenian attacks in the region as "brutal." He said  that these were the results of a plan of "those enemies of Islam  who are against stability in the region" but did not elaborate  on the countries whose plan this was. Hashemi said that there  was a need to solve the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan  over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave within Azerbaijan, by means of  the mediation of countries that both sides could trust.    Asked if he thought recent positive developments in ties  between Turkey and Iran--which have often been strained in the  past--were due to a convergence of regional interests forcing  the two countries into a "strategic relationship" Hashemi said,  "I agree with your assessment on this."    He said that both Iran and Turkey were important countries  in  the region and they were working together for regional economic  and political stability.</p>

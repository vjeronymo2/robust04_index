			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE derivatives sector suff-ered one of the most uninspiring sessions this year, with little in the way of economic data to encourage dealing, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened at 2,849, and after a brief retreat moved steadily forward fuelled by sporadic buying. It reached the morning's high of 2,867 at around 9.45am. The early buying soon dried up and the contract declined to test 2,855, seen in more recent weeks as a market support level. It did indeed prove to be a resistance point and the contract traded between that and 2,867 over lunchtime. The strong opening on Wall Street brought another upward movement in the June contract. But dealers pointed out that most of the move was technical, and there was little in the way of actual buying. It finished at 2,874, a strong premium to the underlying cash market, but with volume a meagre 4,878 lots by the official close. The traded options were equally dull, turnover reaching only 14,937 contracts. A mere 4,869 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, and 2,298 in the Euro FT-SE option. Pilkington was the busiest stock option with 1,333 lots transacted after leading independent derivatives dealer Monument was reported to have carried out a large trade. It was followed by Glaxo, Lasmo, J. Sainsbury and Asda.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Israeli military has drawn up a long-term plan that assumes its troops will  still occupy the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the year 2000, an army spokeswoman  said. She said the plan, to be presented to the Cabinet next week, envisages  troops spending their entire three-year compulsory service in the territories,  scene of a 20-month-old Palestinian uprising, instead of the current rotating  tours of duty. Meanwhile, another Israeli army spokesman said the military is  creating a special unit to help put down the uprising after experimenting with  soldiers specially trained in riot control.  </P></p>

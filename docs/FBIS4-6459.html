			<p>BFN     [Text] According to military sources, U.S. imperialists  and South Korean puppets conducted provocative joint aerial war  exercise aimed at a northward invasion on 17 and 18 April by  drawing in various military planes from overseas bases.    On 17 April, fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes, VTOL  [vertical takeoff and landing] assault planes, and electronic  intercept planes took off from U.S. bases in the Pacific area  and were deployed to the U.S. Air Force bases occupying South  Korea for this war exercise. On 18 April, combat planes of the  Air Force and the Marine Corps, and an RC-135 strategic  reconnaissance plane flew in from bases in Kadena and Yokosuka,  Japan to South Korean bases.    Prior to this frenzied war exercise, EA-6 electronic  intercept planes created an electronic jam mainly in the skies  above Yongwol, Yangpyong, and Pyongtaek. An EH-60 electronic  warfare helicopter guaranteed a strike air corps' surprise  attack by creating an electronic jam while repeatedly circling  around in the skies above Kapyong, Pochon, and Kanghwa Island.  Various fighter-bombers, assault planes, and observation planes  mobilized in the skies above this area were madly engaged in an  intensive striking exercise against targets in the electric jam.    This fire game commotion [pulchangnan sodong], for which as  many as 500 military planes of various types were mobilized, was  aimed at examining the practicality [hyonsilsong] of a surprise  attack and the consecutive bombing capability of air corps of  each type of plane with electronic jamming.    While the joint aerial war exercise was frantically  conducted  on 18 April, an RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane flew from  Kadena base in Japan to South Korea, and madly carried out  electronic reconnaissance and aerial photographing of important  strategic areas of the northern half of the Republic while  making round flights in the skies above Yangyang, Hongchon, and  Tokchok Island.    On 17 and 18 April, a U-2 high-altitude strategic  reconnaissance plane and an RV-1 tactical reconnaissance plane  were madly engaged in aerial reconnaissance on the overall area  of the northern half of the Republic while flying in day and  night in the skies above the area near the military demarcation  line.    Meanwhile, the South Korean puppets conducted firing  [chongpo  sagyok] near the DMZ, in front of us. A tank group of the  puppet Army was moved and deployed in an area near Kumpa-ri,  Paju county on 17 April and fired some 170 tank shells on the  banks of the Imjin River. An artillery unit of the puppet  Army's occupied a firing position in Yonsan-ri, Kachon county  and wielded a war frenzy by randomly shooting some 80 bombshells  at areas near the DMZ.    On 18 April, after occupying a combat position at Konsol-ri,  Yanggu county and at Kojanha-ri, Yonchon county, the puppet  armed rascals stirred up a war atmosphere by arbitrarily firing  some 1,000 large-caliber gunshots.    The war commotion by the U.S. imperialists and South Korean  puppets is becoming all the more unscrupulous with the U.S.  military leaders' repeated conspiracy with the puppets to plot a  war scheme and their dragging in and deploying slaughtering  equipments, such as Patriot missiles, to South Korea. It is  driving the situation of the Korean peninsula to a grave phase.</p>

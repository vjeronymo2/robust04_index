			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation ICI shares have under-performed the market by just over 30 per cent since Sir Denys Henderson became chairman in April 1987. Perhaps he will do better by the Rank Organisation which has almost level-pegged the index in the same period, despite what many see as the misguided purchase of Mecca. A first step could be to sell the group's minority stake in Rank Xerox back to its parent. But that is not a new idea and there are tax obstacles aplenty in the way, not to mention the question of whether Xerox can afford the deal. The bigger strategic test will be to make sense of Rank's hotchpotch of managed businesses, ranging from video-duplication to holiday camps.</p>

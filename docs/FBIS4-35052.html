			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Message to the Nation" by President Rafael Caldera from </F> Miraflores Palace on 27 June -- live or recorded]    [Text] The Council of Ministers, which met this morning and  this afternoon, has come out definitively in favor of  establishing an exchange control. For this purpose, I held long,  arduous conversations with the Banco Central de Venezuela Board  of Directors. For respectable reasons, Banco Central had  expressed at many meetings the necessity of finding other paths  and formulas, none of which, unfortunately, yielded the expected  results.    I said in my inaugural speech on 2 February that there would  be no exchange controls. I said it with absolute sincerity. That  was my intention, and I have held it up until today. The truth  is, however, that we have been forced to take this measure by  the seriousness of the financial situation, the insistent wave  of rumors, the speculative movements that have tried to topple  the bolivar to the floor. We are well aware of the  disadvantages, problems, and dangers, but they are unavoidable.  We cannot allow international reserves to be depleted. We cannot  allow the unjustified devaluation of our currency to continue.  When I say it is unjustified, that is because Venezuela produces  the necessary foreign exchange for its legal commercial exchange.    The pressures on the exchange market are due to speculative  movements or to the distrust created by a series of rumors. Such  rumors have confused Venezuelans about the measures we had to  adopt to intervene at eight financial institutions, which we  tried to save by every means possible. In the end, however, we  concluded it was virtually impossible to save them.    To establish the exchange control, of course in keeping with  the Banco Central Board of Directors, another series of  indispensable measures had to be taken. One of them is the  suspension of constitutional guarantees. We have had to resort  to this extreme so my government will have the adequate means to  fully achieve its objective.    We have made this decision with total responsibility. We  will implement it prudently as we have acted throughout the five  months of my government. At the same time, however, we will  implement it with the force necessary to save the country from  the crisis in which it is immersed.    We did not created this crisis. The crisis is the result of  a  long period of corruption and serious mistakes in the country's  past. We have used all regular means to confront the crisis. We  have reached a point now when we feel we must take the  extraordinary measures afforded us by the Constitution and laws  without delay.    The Development Ministry will be in charge of placing price  controls on basic articles by applying a consumer protection  law. It is crucial that we achieve this because the wave of  speculation, under the pretense of the foreign exchange hike,  has been so disproportionate that it is totally unjustifiable. I  say it is a pretense because, although inflation can be blamed  on the decline of our currency, the price increase has been  several times greater than the highest inflation rate observed.    Thus the struggle against speculation is in the government's  hands. We feel our people's deep pain, especially in the lower  and middle classes, for the unbridled scarcity in the country.  We are going to fight beside the people so we can, in some way,  correct this tremendous mistake.    We will adopt several complementary measures at the cabinet  meeting to be held the day after tomorrow. Among the measures to  be taken is the issuance of food and transportation bonuses.  These actions seek to improve the true income of the sectors  that have been most negatively affected by the current crisis.    Furthermore, in addition to implementing foreign exchange  and  price controls, we will adopt measures to control the financial  institutions. We are willing to stringently apply all necessary  norms to see that banking institutions act correctly and that a  crisis of this nature does not happen again.    The government has done and is willing to do all it can to  protect the small account holders who have trusted in the  seriousness and responsibility of financial institutions and who  are overwrought because they don't know what will become of  their small savings. The small account holders can rest assured  that the commitments established by law and maintained by the  government will be upheld and increased by the measure necessary  to grant them the justice they are owed.    The measures we have adopted are not isolated acts. They are  part of our social and economic policies. The social policy is  based primarily on the price controls, food and transportation  bonuses, which I mentioned previously, and the struggle to  improve real wages. It is also based on a number of initiatives,  programs, and plans that will be announced to the people very  soon because they are already being implemented. We want to get  the consumer as close as possible to the producer by offering  better ways to obtain the necessary basic products in the  marketplace.    We also want to protect and defend the activities that  generate jobs, such as small and intermediate industries. These  sectors are going through a very difficult situation. The same  goes for the agricultural producers who have experienced a very  serious crisis in the past years, perhaps even more serious than  the one in the urban areas.    In this respect, I must say that the foreign exchange  control  puts us on a promising path. Now we can start thinking about  implementing a plan to decrease interest rates, which have  reached levels that are absolutely incompatible with the  possibilities of the productive sectors, and to eliminate the  zero coupon bonds. We have opposed this mechanism in the past  because, although it attempts to alleviate the country's  situation, it has triggered rather serious results.    On the other hand, all of this is within the context of an  overall economic policy. Venezuela is a good country for  investment. Investors come to the country every day, and we are  willing to offer them every guarantee. For some -- because some  people criticize everything -- the policy could seem to present  an obstacle to investors. On the contrary, investors need a  stable currency. Investors need assurances that the country's  foreign reserves will not be depleted. Investors need a system  they can trust, and it is precisely that trust which we want to  give investors and everyone in the country. We are willing to  promote investment and open paths for investment in the areas of  oil, petrochemicals, mining, and all other areas that are open  to projects through concession. It has taken us some time to  prepare the first plans for bidding, but the time is near when  we will offer those who are interested the opportunity to invest  in the Romulo Betancourt Eastern Freeway.    I have a great deal of trust in my country and I am sincere  when I speak to my people. I know that we are taking harsh  measures and that there are dangers we must avoid. One danger  posed by exchange controls is that they could be invaded by  corruption. We will keep an eye on that. We are going to choose  very honorable, patriotic persons who are determined to serve  Venezuela to supervise this matter.    It is essential that we work together. Today I was pleased  to  meet with representatives of the media. It was a cordial meeting  with reporters from various media. I met with those who write  the news, those who report the news on television and radio, and  those who inform us with their photographs, the photographers. I  told them that Venezuela is proud of its media, and we hope the  media will be proud of Venezuela. We do not want the media to  report only what is wrong. We do not want the media to enhance  the negative aspects. We want the media to cover positive facts,  to contribute to the advancement of our country, and to  encourage our people to be proud of being children of this  glorious country. I addressed the representatives of the media  with great affection, as I address my fellow countrymen now.    Dear Venezuelans, dear fellow countrymen, dear friends; let  us work together to overcome this crisis. You know this crisis  was not created by this government. If there is one thing you  can say about this government -- and as I said during my  inaugural speech -- we will do all we can to face the situation.  The time has come to use our extraordinary resources, but within  the framework of our Constitution and the democratic  institution. In order to maintain this democratic institution,  we must adopt measures that may be harsh and rigorous. These  measures, however, are honestly and diligently aimed at  guaranteeing the welfare of the country, Venezuela's welfare.  For the good of Venezuela, I reiterate my trust and absolute  assurance that we will have the understanding and support of the  Venezuelan people, who are confronting these times so full of  uncertainty and contradiction. We will overcome these problems  to ensure a good future for our beloved country, Venezuela.</p>

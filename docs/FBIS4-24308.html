			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The Senegalese opposition are continuing to agitate  for the release of party leaders Abdoulaye Wade and Landing  Savane.    Pressure has been building up since last week when two of  Wade's colleagues, Mody Sy and Samuel Saar, went on hunger  strike. They were detained in connection with the murder of the  vice chairman of the Senegalese constitutional court, in the  wake of last year's general elections which, Wade's party  claims, were rigged. And today, there was trouble in Dakar when  opposition supporters were banned from holding a rally. On the  line, Chris Green asked Odile Bueret when happened:    [Begin recording] [Bueret] You see, early this morning,  armored vehicles took place at strategic crossroads of the  Senegalese capital. Although Dakar police headquarters had  forbidden Abdoulaye Wade's party to demonstrate as planned, the  Senegalese authorities are really traumatized by the bloody  events on 16 February when six policemen were killed by  demonstrators, so they decided to have the police forces  positioned throughout Dakar. According to the Senegalese  Democratic Party [PDS]'s spokesman, Ousmane Ngom, since the  demonstration had not been authorized, the PDS sent several MP's  at the party's headquarters to tell militants that the  demonstration had been called off. In the meantime, says  Ousmane Ngom, 20 people were arrested including three MP's and  several people were hurt.    [Green] So, the MP's who were arrested had actually gone to  try and stop the demonstration?    [Bueret] That is right.    [Green] Have you any information as to how the people got  hurt. Was there fighting between the police and the  demonstrators?    [Bueret] I do not think they actually fought with the  police,  it's just, you know, there were so many people to be arrested  that things happened.    [Green] Do you know what happened to those who were  arrested?    [Bueret] Not yet. It is very difficult to get information  and I think the PDS party is likely to give a press conference  in a few hours, so we will know more in a few hours time.    [Green] So, following today's events, what is the atmosphere  like in Dakar tonight?    [Bueret] Everything is very calm, you know. You can see  [words indistinct], you can see armored vehicles all around  Dakar, not many but just at strategic points of the capital.  The only thing is the whole opposition is planning a  demonstration on Friday [1 July] and it wants to join with the  students, the unions, and it could be a big demonstration.  Probably, again, this demonstration will be forbidden by the  authorities but as you can see, all of people in the Senegal are  now ready to demonstrate against what is happening in Dakar and  the political situation with the main opposition leaders being  incarcerated for four to five months without being judged for  what they have been arrested.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] On 22 January, at the alliance's suggestion, the  United Nations sent an Australian representative in charge of  human rights to Cambodia.    Upon arrival in Phnom Penh this UN envoy announced before  the  press that he had come to protect the so-called rights of  Vietnamese nationals in Cambodia.    Our Cambodian nation and people clearly see through the  alliance's scheme in sending this man to Cambodia. It is in  order to kill our Cambodian nation and race and allow Vietnam to  annex Cambodia into its Indochinese Federation, thus turning our  Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian  territory annexed by Vietnam].    His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk has been well aware of  this  dark design of the alliance. This is why he wrote an important  essay dated 5 January 1994 entitled: Human rights in Cambodia  and the Cambodian People's Right to Live Peacefully Forever  Within Their Legitimate Land and Sea Boundaries as Recognized  Internationally Between 1963 and 1969.    The Cambodian nation and people and the king also well know  that the two-headed government has not paid attention to the  King's essay. On the contrary, it has welcomed this  representative of the bad elements who has come here to kill the  Cambodian nation and people. [passage omitted]</p>

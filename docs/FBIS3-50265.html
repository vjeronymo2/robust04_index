			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk </F> by unidentified reporters and an unidentified moderator in  Warsaw on the "Hundred Questions to..." program -- live; no  video available]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Moderator] Good afternoon to  you, ladies and gentlemen, to you in the studio, and to you  Minister Kolodziejczyk. I have an appeal to make to you, our  viewers -- we would like to also receive your questions which we  will then pass on to the minister. Some of them we will try to  answer during the program, and so our phone lines are already  open; the number is 625-66-77. We are waiting for your  questions and, while we are waiting for them, there will be  questions from us, journalists.    Mr. Minister, let us begin with what may seem like a routine  issue but which caused quite a bit of confusion last Friday [21  January] when the press, radio, and television circulated  reports of your planned dismissal. We have here a  once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to verify that. What is going  on? Are these just rumors? What is this all about?    [Kolodziejczyk] This happened because of ZYCIE WARSZAWY. Of  course, the information has absolutely nothing to do with the  truth. I am amazed since, up to now, ZYCIE WARSZAWY has been  regarded as a daily which provides truthful information.    [Moderator] So that means you are denying the reports.    [Kolodziejczyk] Yes, absolutely.    [Moderator] So the reports are truly false.    [Reporter] But Mr. Minister, what about the reasons which  were listed in ZYCIE WARSZAWY -- do you think they are not  credible, I mean for instance the coalition's pressure to assume  deputy- ministerial posts in your ministry? And what about the  budget draft, which I take it you are unhappy with and which is  currently being worked on in the Sejm, and also the probable  failure of the concept of a National Security Council? Do all  these reasons not cause you to consider the possibility of  resigning?    [Kolodziejczyk] No, they do not. I assumed the post to  solve problems and not to try to avoid solving them or to  desert. That is why everything is still ahead of us. The  budget has not acquired its final shape yet, whereas issues of  personnel appointments have not been on the agenda, and, frankly  speaking, there have not been any serious talks on that topic  yet....    [Moderator, interrupting] Mr. Minister, I think we will be  dealing with these issues later on.    [Reporter] But Mr. Minister, if we were to look at what I  will call a conclusion of everything that we are talking about  here: This is linked with this alleged dismissal of yours. You  are subordinated both to the prime minister and the president.  The president is commander of the Armed Forces whereas the  prime minister is the government's chief and also your direct  superior. Whose order would you execute if it were to turn out  that the two officials' orders contradict one another?    [Kolodziejczyk] The president is the constitutional superior  over the Armed Forces and he has appropriate powers for that.  But what you asked is quite a theoretical proposition because  up to now....    [Reporter, interrupting] But it may turn out a [word  indistinct] problem.    [Kolodziejczyk] Up to now, both these gentlemen charged with  responsibility over the country's security have been cooperating  with one another in a way which I think....    [Reporter, interrupting] And what if there was to be a  disagreement anyway [word indistinct]?    [Kolodziejczyk, hesitating] I hope that will not happen.  After all, the responsibility linked to these people's high  posts must prevail. There can be no private views of any kind  involved. The interests of the state are what must prevail, and  there are no signs so far that it should be otherwise.    [Moderator] Mr. Minister, excuse me. So let us finish the  issue of your alleged dismissal. You denied the rumors.    The next issue which I think will be a major theme of our  conversation today is the situation which has emerged after the  Prague and Brussels summits, and everything going along with  that. There were a lot of debates but mainly on the diplomatic  side, concerning the sense of safety, grand issues on a high  level, but I would like to ask you a blunt question: What about  the cost? The cost will probably have to be borne by you. I  read in one of your statements that you do not even have the  money to open up a bureau in Brussels. So what is the situation  practically speaking? What about our participation in joint  maneuvers? Who will pay for that?    [Kolodziejczyk] Well, strictly speaking, there is no such  item listed in the budget. I have postulated to have the budget  supplemented because naturally, these issues will have to be  accompanied by expenditures. In any case, the documents of the  Brussels summit clearly say that the partners shall bear the  cost of their participation. It is a huge problem since we are  aware that the NATO countries will come up with some monies and  they will be available to those who themselves have contributed  in a major way. So far -- if the budget is approved in its  proposed form -- there is really no money for participation in  the Partnership for Peace initiative.    [Reporter] On the topic of Partnership for Peace: Leszek  Moczulski, chairman of the Confederation for an Independent  Poland, said it was a defeat for Polish diplomats whereas other  political parties were more restrained in their assessments.  What is your evaluation of the proposal, from a military  standpoint?    [Kolodziejczyk] I regard Mr. Moczulski's evaluation as a  good sign for the initiative's future, since his predictions  have to date proved untrue.    [Reporter] My question is very specific. Last Thursday, you  held a conference with Foreign Minister Olechowski. You were  both working on a kind of letter of intent containing our  proposals, I mean a list of goals which we want to achieve  within Partnership for Peace. Could you tell us what are our  main goals which we want to achieve through the Partnership?  And another question, which is linked to that: Do you think  that this is a kind of camouflaged path into NATO? I mean  camouflaged in the sense that we have to do something so as not  to irritate Russia?    [Kolodziejczyk] No, no. First of all, I must make a  correction here. The meeting with Minister Olechowski took  place face-to-face, so whatever is said as to its topic is just  allegations, but I can reveal that information. The Partnership  for Peace initiative has been developing [hesitating] quite  fast. We must be prepared to undertake the appropriate  measures, but the immediate topic of my meeting [with  Olechowski] was my two-day visit to Prague, which begins  tomorrow, and another visit to Berlin where I will meet German  Defense Minister Ruehe. During the meeting with Minister  Olechowski, we had to agree on some details and on some topics  to be discussed there, and also to agree on some issues which  may be the subject of debates both in Prague and Berlin.    [Reporter] Let us continue with the Washington theme.  Namely, last Thursday German NTV Television showed pictures  during a report from Washington of Minister Olechowski talking  to the press and to some experts, and the television reported  that while substituting for you [Kolodziejczyk] he informed the  Americans about what type of airborne equipment we need, and  also what kind of modernization of armored forces and what kind  of airborne defense system we need. Can you confirm or deny this  information?    [Kolodziejczyk] I think it is a good sign if the foreign  minister is a spokesman for the defense minister and if he can  competently discuss some issues in my place. Minister  Olechowski and I are cooperating quite closely and I think that  cooperation will bring about good results.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, what kind of an amount are we  talking about? I mean, by how much would the ministry's budget  have to be increased to enable talking about Partnership in  reasonable terms? There is talk in the Sejm about a sum of 500  billion zlotys. Is that true?    [Kolodziejczyk] Yes, it is, but let us be more precise here.  NATO has about 200 various working groups and if we were to send  there just 100 officers this year without special equipment,  that in itself would cost about 60-80 billion zlotys. If we  want to participate in maneuvers, that will mean additional  costs, whereas it is the intensity of our participation  precisely in those maneuvers and also in work by the General  Headquarters and by other working groups, that determine the  rate of Poland's getting close to NATO. We want to see that  process of getting close happen.    [Reporter] But where will we get the money, Mr. Minister?    [Kolodziejczyk] That is exactly the question.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] of a social kind of  collection, such as in the case of the chief officer of a group  of villages, I think from Koscierzyna, who came up with the idea  of a fund which would support our Armed Forces [words  indistinct]?    [Kolodziejczyk] I regard Mr. Tkaczyk's initiative as a very  noble one, and in any event, it has been accompanied by quite a  good response, since both people associated with the old  National Army [Armia Krajowa] as well as the Podhalanie group  and other professional groups -- we also saw some street poll  results at the program's beginning. Right now, work is going on  regarding how to organize a foundation from a legal standpoint  -- a foundation which could financially support the Army,  especially regarding the Army's technical modernization.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] Mr. Minister, how many Polish  military officers speak English?    [Kolodziejczyk] About 1,000 -- this is how many of them are  active in various peace missions, so they have some experience  in that regard. We keep training them intensively, and not just  in Poland. It is of course a problem, but it is not  insurmountable. Still, money remains the fundamental problem  since it is also needed for language training.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] Mr. Minister, what are in  actual fact your priorities as defense minister in relation to  the West? Should not these priorities be, for instance,  primarily about gaining access to sophisticated technology, and  if so -- in what areas?    [Kolodziejczyk] Exactly, that is precisely so. That is the  most serious problem since if we want to approach NATO  standards, then we must have knowledge concerning those  standards -- that is guaranteed by the Partnership for Peace  initiative, that is the first thing. Secondly, we must  establish technological cooperation. Our intellectual potential  is significant and we are very close to finalizing many, very  interesting research and scientific projects. But there is no  money for that, including within the Scientific Research  Committee since the Army does not have a lot of money, either.  Technological cooperation could solve a great deal of our  problems based on our research institutes and our industry.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] technological cooperation  between Poland and NATO, and that we should be approaching NATO  technically speaking. Meanwhile, Hungary intends to purchase --  or perhaps they already purchased -- a Russian early-warning  system which is reported to be the most modern available. Is  what you said really the only direction for Poland?    [Kolodziejczyk] [words indistinct] not quite correct  information. Hungary has purchased -- or rather obtained in  lieu of their debt -- 24 MiG-29 aircraft which are regarded by  the NATO countries as contemporary technology, and Hungary also  intends to purchase an S-300 antiaircraft defense system.  Indeed, when one compares the technical parameters, that system  is more efficient and more productive than the Patriot system.  We ourselves are considering -- unless there are other offers  -- purchasing the S-300 system.    [Reporter] From Russia?    [Kolodziejczyk] [words indistinct] but that is a kind of  topic where I would like to add a few more things: Cooperation  with NATO does not mean identical techniques and technologies  immediately. The most important aspects are command systems,  fire-direction systems, communications systems which would most  probably have to be changed as priority, and reconnaissance  systems. These will be able to be made uniform quite soon. On  the other hand, introducing modern technology within the armored  or airborne troops -- that has to be extended into a process.  Anyway, just take a look if you please, at the state of  technology in the Portuguese Armed Forces, for instance -- the  country is a full NATO member -- and a comparison with Portugal  is not so bad for us at all....    [Reporter, interrupting] [words indistinct] excuse me.  German  Defense Minister Ruehe will probably suggest to you in a few  days that joint maneuvers should be conducted, and these will  take place very soon, that is in September 1994. Can we afford  to take part in such maneuvers? Is it your prediction that  apart from the joint trilateral naval maneuvers -- I mean among  Denmark, Germany, and Poland -- there will also be land  maneuvers? Can we afford that financially?    [Kolodziejczyk] Let us talk about that once I am back from  Berlin -- right now it would be tantamount to counting our  chickens before they are hatched.    [Reporter] Partnership for Peace is also about securing a  gradual, civilian, and democratic control over the Army.  Meantime, some reforms being conducted in the Defense Ministry  -- for instance the transfer of the Personnel Department to the  General Staff -- is kind of a contradiction of that democratic  principle.    [Kolodziejczyk] What you are saying was fabricated by the  press and has absolutely nothing to do with the truth. As for  today, the relationship between civilian-military structures and  those purely military ones, is a 50-50 relationship, or close to  it. Nobody has any intention of giving up any department for the  sake of the General Staff, and as regards the educational  functions and the practical work along with the soldier -- that  must be conducted in the command system, that is to say close to  the General Staff. I want to emphasize very strongly that we  are aware that one of the most fundamental and cardinal  preconditions for our approaching European security structures  is a democratic supervision over the Army, that is over the  Armed Forces, and we will not give it up.    [Reporter] But Mr. Minister, we are talking here about the  Army, which also includes the Military Information Services, so  do you think that these services should be subject to  parliamentary supervision?    [Kolodziejczyk] Of course they should. Regarding the type  of supervision or its extent -- that is something to be debated.  But the supervision as such must exist and I personally think  -- this is my personal view -- that the Sejm should appoint a  group consisting of people enjoying public confidence, for a  longer term -- something akin to the Constitutional Tribunal or  the State Tribunal -- and these people would then exercise a  very detailed supervision over the military special services.  For the time being, a completely different kind of measure is  being prepared it seems, the inception of which, by the way,  dates back to the 10th Term Sejm but was never implemented in  practice.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, I would like to return for a  moment to the Defense Ministry's budget. You are complaining  about lack of funds whereas in the meantime, about 4 percent of  the budget goes to the Defense Ministry's central agencies. The  central agencies represent military bureaucracy. The funds  spent on that purpose have not decreased during recent years --  that means that military bureaucracy is also getting stronger.    [Kolodziejczyk] Listen, it is 4 percent but it is not spent  on the bureaucracy -- that is what the whole misunderstanding is  about. The 4 percent is also spent on investments, including  computerization, introducing information systems -- everything  that is linked with technical progress and that is why we should  not ignore the fact that included in the 4 percent are all the  other sections without which we will never approach the level of  any contemporary army in today's world.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, you said you are very aware of the  importance of civilianization of the military services -- that  is the Army -- as one of the important preconditions for joining  NATO. But your first step after assuming the post of minister  was to suspend the internal regulations issued by the former  minister, who had acted in the direction of a firm  civilianization of the Defense Ministry. How would you explain  that?    [Kolodziejczyk] Very simply. First of all, the internal  regulations had indeed been approved but they were never  implemented in practice. There were some controversial  provisions included there which failed to delineate clear lines  of division of powers -- that is the primary thing. But there  is also the aspect that the law on the Armed Forces' functioning  is tangled up and in disarray, and we began the process of  remedying that from the top down: The prerogatives of the  Republic of Poland's Security Council, the Council of Ministers'  Defense Affairs Committee, amendments made to the Law on the  Popular Defense Obligation which will make a very precise kind  of distinction [hesitating] between [word indistinct] and  obligations or powers of a civilian defense minister and the  chief of the General Staff, followed by corrections made to the  internal rules you mentioned. To do it in reverse order would  lead to an even greater discrepancy than the one we have right  now.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, there are approximately as many  people working in our arms industry as there are in the Armed  Forces. What is your evaluation of the role of the Polish arms  industry in the efforts to increase the country's security? Is  there not any neglect here in terms of doctrine, in terms of  what we really want, or is it just an issue of money?    [Kolodziejczyk] No, there is no neglect of this kind, but we  are struggling with what is the legacy of the past period. Our  [arms] industry until recently -- that is as recently as four  years ago -- produced 50 percent of its production for the  purposes of the Armed Forces and the other 50 percent was  exported out of the country. Currently the exports have died  out completely, the Armed Forces' demand decreased to what are  outright symbolic figures, and so the huge industry and its  potential is not being used. Military orders alone are not  enough to keep the industry afloat, it needs to be restructured  soon, it needs a definition of those areas which have good  future prospects, as well as those that are not profitable in  which case....    [Reporter, interrupting] So could you define them?    [Kolodziejczyk] Listen, we have already been through that.  I could well define them once I learn in what areas of  technology we will be able to cooperate with the West. That is  the fundamental issue without which we will fail to decide what  to sustain. But it is an obvious truth that a sovereign state  must base its Army's supplies on domestic industry to a large  extent.    [Reporter] But on the other hand, the Defense Ministry  refuses to purchase quite modern IRYD aircraft and at the same  time the ministry maintains completely obsolete and costly  MiG-21 aircraft. One hour of operation by such an aircraft costs  about 50 million zlotys. Can you not see that these aircraft  devour the money that could be spent on IRYD aircraft that could  be manufactured?    [Kolodziejczyk] Listen, one just cannot confuse the  functions of an education-training aircraft with those of a  combat aircraft. Unfortunately, the MiG-21's are being  withdrawn, they will not be subjected to overhauls or  supplemented with [word indistinct] electronic equipment, which  is the case for instance with MiG-29's. Still, we need them for  the time being since we are below the level of [word  indistinct]. The IRYD on the other hand -- under the  assumptions guiding it -- was to be an education-combat  aircraft, but the industry failed to implement that  assumption....    [Reporter, interrupting] But it can still be such an  aircraft [words indistinct].    [Kolodziejczyk] If it becomes such an aircraft, then we will  start purchasing it. But it is not the case for the time being  and the industry is doing very little -- or practically nothing  -- to fulfill those preconditions which had been set at the  initial phase of the process of designing the aircraft.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] will you devote to Polish  industry this year?    [Kolodziejczyk] Out of the Defense Ministry's budget? It  will be about 15 percent. As far as I... I am sorry. Let me  put it another way: 75 percent of what there is, goes for arms  purchases and the remaining 15 percent will be for indispensable  purchases of spare parts as well as for overhauls of post-Soviet  equipment since our industry does not have the capability to  produce the parts.    [Reporter] On the issue of post-Soviet: Mr. Minister, do  you not think that the Soviet Union could use Partnership for  Peace to make a faster and more effective approach to the West  than Poland, which would then create a kind of political gap?  That is my first question, and I have another one related to  the first question: Namely, the current governing coalition  regards improvement of relations with the East as one of its  priorities, parallel to the strategic goal of getting closer to  NATO. What is your perspective on this? Do you see any chance  at all for such cooperation with the East regarding security  policy in a situation where the East is not making it easy for  you, for instance -- ignoring for a moment the issue of military  doctrine -- by refusing to decrease the levels of heavy  armaments?    [Kolodziejczyk] You know, these are extremely complicated  issues. You asked whether Russia will not get ahead of us in  its efforts to be a NATO member. The political situation is a  precondition to even begin talking about Partnership for Peace  -- by political situation I mean a democratic regime, clarity of  military budgets, democratic supervision over the Army, and so  on and so forth. I hope that kind of process has been initiated  in Moscow, although recent news from there does not indicate  that the process could be fast. Well, from a technological  standpoint I am sure Russia would be a more interesting partner  than us -- I mean aircraft, rockets, not to mention cluster  weapons, to name just a few. Now, regarding creation of  security for our country, I think there are four parallel paths  involved here: The first one is precisely about good  cooperation and relationships with all our neighbors and, at  least as far as we in the Defense Ministry are concerned, we are  trying to build such good relationships. A second issue -- or a  second path if you like -- is regional cooperation to which we  will be condemned for many years to come, for instance by using  the same kind of technology -- I will not discuss this in  detail, we will talk about this in Prague, as well. A third  direction is about getting closer to the European security  structures, while a fourth one is about activation of  disarmament, I mean the Vienna disarmament process. The fewer  weapons there are -- and there are still whole arsenals of  nuclear weapons in Europe to the east of our borders -- the less  security, naturally. [sentence as heard]    [Reporter] Do you believe that Ukraine will get rid of its  nuclear weapons like it declared during the  Clinton-Yeltsin-Kravchuk meeting?    [Kolodziejczyk] I hope it will.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, you said a moment ago that we must  establish technological cooperation with NATO countries. Does  Poland have access to the latest technologies right now?    [Kolodziejczyk] Unfortunately, we do not; but we are looking  for alternative solutions. We have cooperation with the Swedes  which looks promising, with a company as famous as Thompson,  which is already in cooperation with us with regard to  production of reconnaissance, identification, and navigation  systems which will make it possible to release some additional  frequency channels for television.    [Moderator] [Words indistinct] I have a few questions here  precisely on that issue: What is you perspective on the issue  of granting frequencies to television stations? [Former  Defense] Minister Onyszkiewicz kept saying it was apparently  possible.    [Kolodziejczyk] Whatever was possible, was done -- I am  saying that with full responsibility for my words. In any case,  this is an issue for the Communications Ministry, with which we  have signed appropriate agreements....    [Reporter, interrupting] [Words indistinct] done in that  case because you said whatever possible....    [Kolodziejczyk, interrupting] Those channels which the Army  is now using -- we cannot release them because of the security  of flights and because of state security.    [Reporter] So that means that the National Radio and  Television Council holds sessions and interviews candidates [to  receive frequency channels] almost for their own sake, but the  Army does not intend to release any additional frequencies  anyway?    [Kolodziejczyk] First of all, one must sit down at a table  and begin talking. So far this has not happened. We have been  debating through the mass media and [passage indistinct] and the  three channels is the absolutely minimum amount indispensable to  the Army and as we keep introducing new technologies --  especially radiolocating and electronic ones -- we will be  surrendering these channels, but there is resistance....    [Reporter, interrupting] On the issue of talking to one  another through the Sejm. The Sejm National Defense Commission  has criticized in the past the concentration of different  functions performed by Minister Milewski. Do you think that  there cannot be more than two deputy ministers in the ministry?  I think that would resolve a great many political problems....    [Kolodziejczyk, interrupting] I am sure we could use another  deputy minister just to act as sentry on the government's  benches during Sejm sessions, since it requires enormous amounts  of time.    [Reporter] I have a very specific question: How do you  intend to go about solving the following issue....    [Kolodziejczyk, interrupting] But I did not answer  completely a moment ago. The controversial case of Minister  Milewski is completely different than what the press presents to  their readers or viewers. The press is telling only part of the  truth. The other part is that his appointment is linked to the  intention to reform the entire management scheme of the state's  security apparatus, where the National Security Bureau -- or  practically the National Council's Secretariat -- will be  performing technical functions. The point is to avoid repeating  some functions within the Army's and the National Security  Bureau's structures, and that is why the post will be absolutely  of a technical nature; it is acceptable and there are no legal  impediments to that. On the contrary, I will say it could  facilitate transferring tasks from the National Council's  decisionmaking area to the executive area, that is the Defense  Ministry or the Council of Ministers and the Council of  Ministers' Defense Affairs Committee I mentioned before, which I  hope will be established soon.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] directs two ministries?    [Kolodziejczyk] That is a matter of convention. Social and  defense policies are reconcilable, and there is also the issue  of the number of director-generals and so forth who are a step  below, and we have to keep in mind we are trying to fight  bureaucracy. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, the rate of increase of religious  chaplains in the Army has been the same as the increase in the  popularity of the weekly NIE among the cadre. So my question  is: What are the guiding principles behind the education process  in the Army currently, and also: Are not the educators' minds  in a whirl?    [Kolodziejczyk] Listen, the Army is indeed the last  institution which has been trying to continue -- I repeat:  continue -- the education process. It is not possible during a  year and a half to make up for neglect which began back in  kindergarten, high school, or even in the family. We must be  very clear on that. But as regards reading NIE, I think that  the popularity rate is not very different from what happens  generally in society. Above all, if we talk about democracy --  including in the Army, which has to be somewhat limited there --  then let us not try to force soldiers to read this and not read  that. It is an issue of their will and that will must be  respected. [passage omitted]</p>

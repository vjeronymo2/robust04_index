			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Feeder-reliever airports supported Sir, Mr D R Hopkins, chairman of the British Air Transport Association, has clearly not read my report, Plane Commonsense, published by the Adam Smith Institute (Letters, November 28). Otherwise he would not have made so may elementary errors in writing about my study which puts the case for developing Northolt and Redhill as feeder-reliever airports. For instance, Mr Hopkins appears to be under the misapprehension that feeder-reliever airports could only handle business aviation, but my recommendations envisage feeder-reliever airports accommodating aircraft handling up to 120 passengers at Redhill and up to 160 passengers at Northolt. My proposals hinge on the observation that there is no realistic possibility of constructing additional full-scale runways at either Heathrow or Gatwick. The political opposition to such a move is just too great. I agree with Mr Hopkins when he points out that 'new capacity must be provided where it will expand and complement existing facilities along the Heathrow-Gatwick axis'. This is precisely what Northolt and Redhill offer. As I stress in my report, these two feeder-relievers could also accommodate many of the aircraft serving regional cities as well as restoring service to airports such as Liverpool and Humberside. Indeed, it is estimated that more than 25 per cent of the aircraft currently using Gatwick, but carrying a mere 5 per cent of passengers, could transfer to Redhill. In peak times, the percentage rises to 33 per cent, thus freeing a substantial number of precious slots at Gatwick's single runway. Mr Hopkins is also badly informed when he asserts that the airline industry is not fully supportive of this bold initiative. TWA, American Airlines, Manx and the European Regional Airlines Association are just a few of the airlines and industry groups that have indicated their support for the concept of feeder-reliever airports such as the ones I envisage at Northolt and Redhill. This is in stark contrast to the development of Stansted where only one carrier supported the BAA's proposals and British Airways appeared as an objector. Finally, the sale of RAF Northolt, coupled with the lease-back of an improved VIP terminal, would enhance rather than detract from the facilities available for the Queen's Flight and ministerial flights.

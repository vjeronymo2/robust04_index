			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and Dafna Vardi] </F>   [Excerpt] The U.S. Administration has recently expressed  concern over publications regarding contacts between Israel and  Iraq. U.S. Ambassador in Israel Edward Djerejian has asked  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin for answers on this issue.    The prime minister vehemently denied the existence of any  contacts with Baghdad. A senior political source in Jerusalem  said last week: "There is no point in maintaining contacts with  Iraq as long as Saddam Husayn is in power. Saddam is a madman,  and you do not marry one."    According to the British weekly FOREIGN REPORT, Israel and  Iraq have been holding indirect contacts through European and  Palestinian mediators in a bid to expand the peace process.  According to the paper, in the framework of the contacts,  efforts are being made to arrange a meeting between Foreign  Minister Peres and a senior Iraqi figure.    The foreign minister's bureau yesterday denied the London  weekly story, saying: "this is nonsense." [passage omitted]</p>

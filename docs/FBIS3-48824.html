In the same  way, it is as well not to forget that New Delhi's Republic Day  pageantry is an annual affair. There is a guest of honour every  year, and not all guests leave a significant imprint once the  dust of the ceremony has settled. If Prime Minister Goh Chok  Tong's presence lent a new dimension to Wednesday's  celebrations, it was because the honour bestowed on him  symbolises India's own changing economic perceptions. Now  nearing its end, Mr. Goh's visit to India is meaningful because  it is part of an integrated package and not just another  diplomatic ritual.    The timing is revealing. A Singapore Prime Minister's visit  would not have had the same impact even two years ago. Not only  does India appear to be psychologically prepared to make the  most of what Singapore has to offer, but many of the  institutional changes needed to take advantage of the connection  are already in place. However, the success that clearly marks  the tour may prompt two questions. First, why was this rapport  so long delayed? Secondly, will it result in a permanent  qualitative and quantitative change so that Singapore leads  ASEAN and the world in helping India to open up?    The usual short answer to the first question is that  economics was hostage to politics all these years. This  simplification may not be untrue, but it is not the whole truth.  The confluence of stars (to borrow Mr. Goh's phrase) demands  certain objective conditions that were not present earlier. It  has taken time and effort to develop the large industrial base,  a huge pool of scientists and engineers, and a  200-million-strong middle class that have made India attractive  to investors. Similarly, Singapore has built up gradually the  reserves that are now available for investment, and taken the  strategic decision to sprout a second wing. What is just as  important is the fact that these are complementary attributes in  a potentially strategic situation.    The agreements signed during the last few days would seem to  bear this out. Seldom does an official visit produce so much in  so short a time. But this is only a beginning. Important  though they are, the agreements alone will not generate wealth.  They will only help to create the right conditions for  resourceful Singaporeans and Indians to give a boost to trade or  set up joint ventures. The information-sharing arrangement  between the Trade Development Board and six Indian organisations  is a case in point. It will be exactly as rewarding as the use  to which the information is put is productive.    Ultimately, the relationship will be what the private  sectors  in the two countries make of it. Singapore brings special  expertise to the partnership. Not just capital or access to  technology, but an international outlook, and well-honed skills  in labour relations, property development and banking.  Singapore's unique achievement in attracting twice as many  tourists as there are citizens should be of interest to a  country that has some of the world's most spectacular natural  sights and human artefacts, but not the infrastructure for  enough visitors to enjoy them.    India might also find it worthwhile to decentralise  authority  further so that project clearance is not held up, and to open up  new areas, such as real estate, to foreign investment. Reforms  in both fields would have a tremendous impact on domestic  enterprise as well, and help to eradicate corruption rooted in  too many complex restrictions. New Delhi might tackle some of  these issues in next month's budget. Meanwhile, both countries  would benefit from a better flow of information. India is not  "Little India" writ large. Neither is Singapore only the  shopping in Orchard Road. The sooner these tired stereotypes  dissolve, the better it will be for pragmatic interaction.</p>

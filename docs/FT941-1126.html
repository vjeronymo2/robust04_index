			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank wins auction for Veba stake Deutsche Bank is to pay Frankfurt, Germany's most indebted city, about DM650m (Dollars 382m) for its 2.88 per cent stake in Veba, the energy-based conglomerate. The bank emerged yesterday as the winner in a US-style auction handled by private bankers B. Metzler seel Sohn. Mr Andreas von Schoeler, the Social Democrat mayor, said the shareholding had been sold to cut the city's annual interest payments on net debts of about DM7bn. The sale had been timed in the light of the relatively modest 4 per cent dividend yield on the holding and the strength of Veba's share price. Deutsche is to buy the 1.33m shares for DM470 to DM495, compared with yesterday's closing price of DM485.50.</p>

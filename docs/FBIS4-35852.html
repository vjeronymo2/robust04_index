			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Randah Habib in Amman] </F>   [Text] Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has  categorically denied Aden's accusation that Jordan is sending  weapons to Sanaa, saying that the accusation conflicts with  Jordan's support for dialogue in Yemen. Al-Majali asserted that  Jordan has never thought of sending weapons to any side in Yemen  and reiterated that Jordan does not support one side against the  other, and that it opposes infighting and believes in dialogue  to resolve the bloody crisis in that country.    Al-Majli also said that Jordan supports unity and legitimacy  in Yemen, that the unity was carried out as a result of the  Yemeni people's decision, and that Jordan will continue to  believe in that unless the Yemeni people want otherwise.    With regard to planes, al-Majali said that Amman had sent  Royal Jordanian aircraft, and C-130 transportation planes to  evacuate its nationals from Yemen, as well as other European and  Asian nationals on humanitarian grounds, and that these aircraft  carried nothing other than passengers.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Arts: Mother Courage - Theatre Any actress worth her salt must have a longing to play Mother Courage: it is one of the most testing parts in European drama. And the first comment on Ellie Haddington's performance in the new production of Bertholt Brecht's play at the Cottesloe is that she passes the test summa cum laude. Ms Haddington is magnificent. She never flags. She keeps her boots on till the end. Sometimes she is exuberant and looks as if she should be playing in Cabaret. For a woman condemned to the road, she goes through some remarkable changes of dress: always peasant-like, but never quite the same. Her facial expressions are wonderful. The highest compliment one can pay her is to wonder occasionally if she is not too good for the piece. Directors, too, must enjoy keeping the cart on the road. Mother Courage and Her Children is, after all, one of the great epic plays. If you want theatre about war, this is it. The trouble is that like the 30 years conflict that it covers, Mother Courage is rather a relentless work. There are limits to how many times one wants to see it: perhaps every five years at the most. For the play does not easily lend itself to re-interpretation: it is simply about Mother Courage ploughing on through the futility of war. The challenge lies in how well it is done. The previous mainstream London production was at the Mermaid four years ago with Glenda Jackson playing the leading role. Ms Jackson took a hands-on approach, pulling the cart about herself. At the Cottesloe, the cart seldom moves, though it is switched from one side of the stage to the other during the interval. Only at the very end does Ms Haddington give a pull of her own volition, and that is when she is left without her offspring. People come to the cart for its brandy, warmth and company rather than the cart going out to find people. I think that the Cottesloe approach is more effective, but that is an entirely personal judgment and perhaps the Cottesloe had no choice since it has a smaller stage. The new factor since Ms Jackson played the part is the break-up of Yugoslavia. This is where Anthony Clark's direction at the Cottesloe deserves the greatest praise. It resists the temptation to impose comparisons between what is happening in Bosnia now and the 30 years' war in the 17th-century. It lets the play speak for itself. Sometimes the best prizes go to those who exercise discretion. Here is one of them. Clark allows the audience to draw its own conclusions. Would that there were more directors like him. One final compliment. I did not realise till the end that the piece is played with a cast of only eight. This is a remarkable achievement over such a time-span and such a range of characters. If one sounds slightly jaundiced about the play, spare a thought for the critic who has seen the most intense of Strindberg (The Great Highway at the Gate) and the most intense of Brecht on almost successive nights. Tomorrow is off to fresh fields and pastures new with a little known play by Oliver Goldsmith called The Good Natured Man at the Orange Tree in Richmond. In repertory, Cottesloe, (071) 928 2252.

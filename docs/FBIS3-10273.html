			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Flores Castillo; quotation marks as </F> published]    [Text] In an analysis of her visit to Guatemala, Lucette  Michaux-Chevry, French minister delegate of humanitarian action  and human rights, noted that her country supports the  pacification process that is being advanced here although "one  of the main obstacles to attain peace is the refusal to hold  talks."    "I have seen, however, that there is hope, dedication, and  work among Guatemalans. That is very important, but I think 30  years of internal armed struggle is too much for a multi-ethnic  nation, although I must make it clear I did not come from France  to pass judgment or teach lessons. Based on her country's  experience, where there was slavery and exploitation, "one never  achieves a perfect democracy; one always has to move to  strengthen it," and that is the role Guatemala must play,  "because that commitment exists among Guatemalans, and my  country, France, supports that initiative."    Based on her experiences in Ixcan, Quiche, she stated the  Guatemalan people's spirit is always high because they are ready  to obtain a better future through work and respect for their  human, economic, and social rights. "The basis for a solution to  the nation's problems and the strengthening of democracy  constitute the fundamental pillars to building peace for the  peoples, especially for the people of Guatemala and Latin  America where exploitation and poor distribution of land is  almost a widespread problem.    The French official added: "When I return to my country, I  will report that the people of Guatemala want to have the right  to work and live." Michaux-Chevry's remarks coincide with the  United Nations call to the government and Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity to resume their peace talks on 3 to 7 March.</p>

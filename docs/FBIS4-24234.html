			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean Helene on assignment in Kabale, Uganda: </F> "Where Are the Weapons for Rwanda Coming From?"]    [Text] UN officials seem unable to end the arms trafficking  that makes possible the massacres....    Kabale--"To my knowledge, no weapons have been sent from  Uganda to Rwanda since the deployment of the UN Assistance  Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] in August 1993," declares Bangladeshi  Colonel Asnar, military head of UNAMIR. He adds: "We have  monitoring posts on all the roads leading to Rwanda, and our  foot patrols put up mobile roadblocks. Also, ground operations  are supported by helicopters providing aerial surveillance."    Are 80 observers really enough to watch over 170 km of  border  winding through hills, forests, and swamps? In private, UN  officials readily admit the border cannot be hermetically sealed  with such a small contingent, however well equipped. Moreover,  UN observers run up against perplexing snags from time to time.  For example, the fact that sometimes they must wait for days  before getting approval from Ugandan forces, the National  Resistance Army (NRA), to inspect a new zone; Colonel Asnar  blandly calls them "procedural delays."    In 1993, UNAMIR personnel had to wait for two weeks for  permission to monitor the environs of the Kakitumba border post,  across which all provisions for the Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF]  allegedly passed on their way into Rwanda (according to rumors  never confirmed), and until 16 June humanitarian convoys were  not allowed to use the asphalt road leading down from Kakitumba,  though it is the most direct route for getting emergency aid to  the RPF zone. These questions remain unanswered, and one has the  impression that neither the RPF nor Ugandan authorities are  being completely candid.    Of course, President Museveni tells anyone willing to listen  that it is no difficult feat to transport arms clandestinely in  that region. He can (and does) testify eloquently on that score  from his own experience: When he was chief of a small rebel band  in central Uganda, in the early 1980's, his men traveled to  Bujumbura to pick up Libyan arms at the Islamic Cultural Center  there, bringing them back by truck across Rwanda and Milton  Obote's Uganda and presenting false documents at every  checkpoint describing the cargo as Burundian tea!  <H5>  Clandestine Networks </H5>   To diplomats posted in Kampala, it seems clear the Ugandan  Army could seal the border "with 20 men per kilometer" if only  the political will existed. While some observers concede that  arms may also be coming in over the Zairian border, Uganda  appears in reality to be the sole conduit through which supplies  are reaching the rebels, the lifeline of the RPF, and the means  by which the latter easily circumvents the embargo decreed by  the UN Security Council.    The provenance of the arms also raises a number of  questions.  It is difficult to account, for example, for all the movements  of the Nigerian airplane that was held up several days in Cyprus  after a stopover in Israel last month and ultimately landed at  Entebbe. But it is possible some of the arms, destined for  rebels in south Sudan, were diverted to resupply the RPF.    In the Ugandan capital, debate continues over the extent to  which Yoweri Museveni is implicated in Uganda's support for the  RPF, a support that seems only logical given the large number of  Rwandan exiles who joined Museveni's guerrillas and helped him  take power in January 1986. Those who discount his involvement  put most of the blame on members of his entourage (both in the  military and in government political circles) who collaborate  closely, unbeknownst to the president, with RPF leaders, either  because they are ethnically Tutsi or Hima (Museveni's ethnic  group, the Ugandan tribe closest to the Tutsi), or because of  the help they received during their own guerrilla years. No one  here doubts the Rwandan rebels, when they launched their first  attacks in northern Rwanda (in October 1990), were equipped with  Ugandan military materiel, but was it slipped covertly to them  or openly proffered?    UN officials at Kabale believe arms were transferred  continously (i.e., in a series of deliveries) from Uganda to  Rwanda between October 1990 and August 1993, when UNAMIR was  deployed. Presumably, the RPF is profiting handsomely from the  downsizing of the NRA, which is demobilizing nearly one-third of  its 90,000 soldiers at the "suggestion" of the World Bank. The  downsizing has freed up a considerable amount of "surplus"  equipment, and some demobilized soldiers might be tempted to  join the Rwandan rebels.    Another source of provisions: supplies captured from the  enemy, especially munitions stores and heavy weapons of French  origin seen in rebel convoys headed for the front. The RPF has  built up a substantial "war chest" of funds collected from a  Rwandan diaspora that is very supportive of "the cause," i.e.,  the return to Rwanda. Finally, it is even possible the rebels  are receiving support from the predominantly Tutsi Burundian  Army, which turns a blind eye to quasi-overt RPF recruiting  efforts among Rwandans and Burundians in the refugee camps. Such  support, though understandable, makes it possible for the RPF to  persevere in its offensive. "The RPF's clandestine arms network  has been in place a long time," says one Rwandan diplomat,  "while we ourselves must rush around to find new suppliers. Our  normal suppliers, like South Africa, have been told to respect  the embargo."    Is Uganda's at least tacit support for the RPF intended to  repay the debt Mr. Museveni owes the Rwandan refugees? Or is he  attempting, as the interim Rwandan government claims, to "create  a Tutsi empire in the region"? "The president has other  concerns," explains one Western diplomat, "beginning with the  south Sudan problem."    The imminent arrival of Sudanese Army units on Uganda's  northern border--up to now in the hands of south Sudan rebels  backed by Kampala--may well accelerate destabilization of the  north at the hands of Khartoum, which already is arming a small  group of guerrillas there who are little more than bandits.  Uganda's president is reportedly eager to "dispose" of the  Rwandan exiles by sending them back home. "Back in 1988, I told  Habyarimana (the Rwandan president killed on 6 April, whose  death triggered resumption of the civil war) that he should let  the refugees go back," says Mr. Museveni, probably worried lest  the opposition capitalize politically on anti-Rwandan  xenophobia. In fact, Rwandan refugees (the first of whom arrived  in 1959) have done quite well for themselves in Uganda and have  often served as scapegoats, notably in 1982 when they were  literally expelled by then-President Obote to Rwanda, which  adamantly refused to accept them. The "Banyarwandans" then gave  their support to Mr. Museveni, who launched his rebellion. But  after the NRA captured Kampala, anti-Tutsi feeling exacerbated  the emergence of a veritable "Rwandan mafia" that Ugandans have  sorely resented.    Ever since the start of the conflict, Yoweri Museveni has  said the Tutsi insurgency was an internal Rwandan problem, and  he rarely used to criticize the RPF; but recently he has changed  his tune. Following the massacre of the bishops in Kabgayi, with  the Ugandan press reporting survivors' accounts of killings  attributed to the RPF, Museveni has been harshly critical of the  rebels.    The Ugandan head of state seems now to be distancing himself  from them, and calls publicly on the RPF to accept a cease-fire,  since "it lacks the means to win the war rapidly." He also  insists on the need for changes in the current government, as  envisioned in the Arusha accords and to remove those responsible  for the massacres. It is said that Mr. Museveni left the OAU  summit in Tunis in some haste, irritated as he was by criticism  from his peers over his support for the rebels at a time when he  was making an all-out effort to help, meeting on a regular basis  in Kampala with a "crisis committee" composed of the ambassadors  of neighboring countries and U.S., French, and British  representatives.    While it is obvious in Kampala that UNAMIR enjoys cordial  relations with the RPF, the same cannot be said for the  humanitarian organizations clamoring to get into the rebel zone.  The RPF wants to maintain tight control over the organization of  emergency assistance to the "600,000 displaced persons in camps  in the liberated zone," and humanitarian organizations are  raising a hue and cry about these constraints.    Other problems have also surfaced, such as the temporary ban  on access to some camps, which is still controlled jointly by  two officials, one political and the other military. For  "security reasons," it is difficult or impossible to leave these  camps, where observers have raised questions about "educational  meetings" which rightly or wrongly, are being described as  "reminiscent of Cambodia."</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> L.A.'S BRAND-NAME FAME COMES SOUTH  </P> <P> As flashy a bunch of Angelenos we're likely to see all year choppered south  last week for cocktails in a tent staked near MacArthur Boulevard at the San  Diego Freeway.  </P> <P> The occasion was a kickoff party for the as-yet-unbuilt Sports Club/Irvine,  tossed by club developers Nanette Pattee Francini, Michael Talla and  mega-millionaire Marvin Davis (who's so rich he has a guy with him who says  things like, "If you write about Mr. Davis, just call him a 'businessman'!  Don't write 'tycoon' or 'billionaire' or any of that nonsense!").  </P> <P> But rich we've got in Orange County -- no big deal. What we don't have in  excess is brand-name fame -- and that's what separated last Thursday's bash  from all the other fancy parties for the status-aware.  </P> <P> Mingling with more than 900 invitation-only guests were mountainous Lakers  heroes Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Earvin (Magic) Johnson; impossibly handsome  Oscar-winner Sidney Poitier; his bulky Hulkness Lou Ferrigno; Olympic  gold-medal decathlete Rafer Johnson, and aspiring actress Cornelia Guest.  </P> <P> Along with a pack of television actors, the big names who made the round trip  south are among Francini and Talla's celestial clientele at their Sports  Club/LA -- illustrating the business application for the old saw: Make new  friends, but keep the old.  </P> <P> After an hour-plus of buffet-trolling and trips to the hosted bar, guests  turned their attention to a raised stage, where the three club owners said  their bit and the stars sunk their sports-shoe-shod feet into blocks of cement  for a future walk of fame outside the club.  </P> <P> In the words of boy wonder Stuart Karl, watching shyly from the sidelines: "I  can't believe these people came to Orange County!"  </P></p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Papering over the cracks The habit of paying investors with non-existent money seems to be getting out of hand. By passing a cash payout and going for an enhanced scrip dividend, companies are trying to conserve cash as well as avoid advance corporation tax. Perhaps the recent rush implies a fear that the wheeze will be extinguished in the November budget. Yet an outright ban looks unlikely since in the last budget the chancellor said he wanted to ease the problems of companies with genuine ACT problems. That said, the government's promised proposals on how to resolve ACT difficulties are unlikely to provide a universal method of avoiding the tax. Surplus ACT can arise because a company has very large overseas operations and insufficient UK earnings to offset ACT payments. But those companies which have seen UK earnings collapse, yet have maintained their dividends at an unrealistically high level, also have the problem. A distinction between the two seems valuable. That division is increasingly seen in the market, where scrip dividends from companies with overseas earnings problems can still get a reasonable reception, but where those with high dividends, high gearing and negative cash flow feel a certain chill. Investors should ask themselves about the credibility of the implicit promise that comes with an enhanced scrip dividend. The paper they are offered is only worth money if the company can afford to service the increased equity base in future years. For those like Ladbroke and T&amp;N with uncovered dividends and high gearing, that promise may prove paper thin.</p>

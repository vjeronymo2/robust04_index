			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Helicopter group rides out a storm - A 'Thatcherite' enterprise that is making headway in spite of hard times WHAT WERE the bellwethers of the middle and twilight years of Margaret Thatcher's Britain? Soaring, then sliding, house prices? The spawning of new businesses at record rates then, also at record rates, company bankruptcies? Industrialists applauding the enterprise revolution, then wondering whether it was just a bag of hot air? Well, all these - and helicopters, too. In the six years after 1980, the number of craft on the UK's civil helicopter register hovered between 500 and 600. A mini-boom then took place over the next five years as numbers leapt by more than a half to well over 900. Companies from manufacturing to accountancy, as well as a few individuals with bulging wallets, decided that travel by their own rotary wing aircraft was a necessity. Either that or a toy talisman of success, the Bollinger flowing all the way to Brands Hatch or the British Open. But the balloon burst. Few new helicopters are being bought. Growth of the civil register first stalled, then went into gentle reverse. Second-hand prices have nose-dived. A twin-engined machine in good condition that would have sold for Pounds 180,000 can now be acquired, with a bit of searching, for half that. Flying into this economic headwind, Aeromega, a helicopter company in Essex, has still managed to make headway, raising its turnover steadily to Pounds 1.4m in the last financial year and Pounds 1.1m in the first seven months of this. A lot of military personnel need to rebuild lives outside the armed forces as a result of national defence cuts; Kit Pemberton and Mark Barry-Jackson, former Fleet Air Arm pilots and joint owners of Aeromega successfully made that transition, first working as pilots for private industry and then for themselves. Aeromega became airborne in the early 1980s, starting off in the unprepossessing location of an office above a kebab house in the seedy district of London's Soho. The company began with a brokering service, hiring planes and helicopters to do specific jobs, such as taking Revlon customers to France or organising powerboating junkets for cigarette companies. 'It was a bit like a travel agency,' says Barry-Jackson. 'We didn't mind what we organised as long as we got our 7 1/2 per cent.' It was seat-of-the-pants flying. 'We were living in penury and our wives were doing the supporting,' Pemberton says. Since moving to Stapleford airfield near Epping Forest, north of London, in 1984, Aeromega has grown into a company with 21 employees. Its expansion sheds light not only on the small world of operating and using helicopters but on running a business where information is the key to exploiting a market. Aeromega looks after 14 helicopters, only one of which it owns itself. Contracts for a dozen of these machines allow them to be chartered out by Aeromega to other clients when not in use by their owners. Of the hourly fees of Pounds 750 per flying hour for the twin-engined Aerospatiales and Pounds 450 for the single-engined Bells, owners take more than half. 'We tell them this could just about cover the cost of running their machine,' Pemberton says. 'In effect, we lease from the owners, feed the machines, water them and put them out to work.' Several wings make up the business. These include the managing and provision of engineering for helicopters, passenger charter, buying machines for clients, working for utilities like electricity and water, aerial filming and police support. It has a contract with Essex police and recently secured a three-year contract with Devon and Cornwall Constabulary. This has helped cushion the loss of 'soft' corporate business. 'Jollies are now very rare,' says Barry-Jackson. 'Companies taking clients to blow a wad of Pounds 50 notes at Doncaster races that doesn't happen very often now. The froth has blown off the top of the market.' The recession flipped some helicopter companies into a crash dive. But Aeromega continued to increase turnover, raise hiring charges and rack up pre-tax profits of a little under Pounds 50,000 a year. Aeromega's biggest expenses are its wage bill of Pounds 420,000 (pilots earn Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 40,000 a year), and renting two hangars at more than Pounds 40,000 a year. The company has never had to borrow. 'We could have expanded much faster by borrowing but in the present climate, I'm glad we didn't,' says Pemberton. The company uses a publicity brochure but navigates the market mainly by word of mouth. 'Keeping your ear to the ground is crucial in finding contracts,' Pemberton says. 'Our pilots are vital in this process.' It claims never to poach work from other helicopter outfits, nor to deliberately undercut on contract price. 'Clients will say: 'well, if they are undercutting on price, what else are they undercutting on?'.' The recession, though, has meant far more tendering for contracts. It has not all been easy. A flying school set up by Aeromega belly-flopped because of minimal margins, fiddly administration and a tendency to produce new helicopter pilots who immediately went off and set up businesses in competition. Passengers can also get a bumpy ride. 'A few people get sick,' says Pemberton. 'We normally make them clean it up themselves.' Aeromega, Stapleford Aerodrome, Stapleford Tawney, Essex RM4 1RL.

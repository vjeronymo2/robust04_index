			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Payments deficit revised up to Pounds 2.64bn BRITAIN'S current account balance of payments deficit was much higher than previously estimated in the six months to the end of March because of a disappointing performance on the so-called invisible trade account. The Central Statistical Office yesterday revised upwards this year's first-quarter current account deficit to Pounds 2.64bn from an estimated Pounds 2.17bn, while the deficit for the final quarter of last year is now put at Pounds 1.42bn - more than twice the Pounds 642m figure published in May. The revisions mean last year's shortfall on the current account, which gives the UK's balance of trade in goods and invisibles such as services, dividend payments and certain transfer payments, was Pounds 5.2bn compared with Pounds 4.4bn previously. Nonetheless, last year's annual current account deficit remains the smallest since 1987 and was less than a third of the 1990 deficit, which the CSO also revised upwards yesterday to Pounds 16.08bn from Pounds 15.45bn. CSO officials said the worse-than-expected deficit in the latest six months mainly reflected a sharp increase in UK transfers to the European Community in the first quarter of this year, and a large downward revision by a British company of earnings attributed to a foreign subsidiary in the final quarter of last year. Officials disclosed that the company had wrongly booked Pounds 400m as earnings from investments abroad in the final quarter. Britain's surplus on invisible trade was just Pounds 430m in the first quarter, or less than half earlier estimates of Pounds 900m. The Treasury blamed the figures on one-off factors. The figures unsettled sterling and contributed to a subdued mood in the equities and gilts markets. The figures also disclosed a large net capital outflow of Pounds 9.94bn from Britain in the first quarter compared with a net inflow of Pounds 11.74bn in the previous quarter. The outflow mainly reflected a large outflow from UK banking transactions. Direct UK investment overseas rose to Pounds 2.51bn from Pounds 300m, while foreign direct investment in Britain also rose to Pounds 4.38bn from Pounds 1.91bn.</p>

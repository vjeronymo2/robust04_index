			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Investors view Vietnam as Asian market of future CHINA, Hong Kong and South Korea are viewed as the most important markets in Asia for long-term investment, according to a survey by Euromoney. Vietnam was named as newly-emerging market with the most exciting long-term potential. International investors expected to raise their exposure to Asian markets over the next two years. But some survey respondents pointed out improvements were needed in several markets. Respondents found levels of liquidity one of the least satisfactory aspects. The report noted: 'In Asia, overall market capitalisation is not always reflected on the liquidity of an exchange. In many countries, it is common for a company's founding family or other relations to hold up to 70 per cent of the available shares, thus limiting a security's float.' Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia were the most liquid markets in Asia, while Indonesia, India, and the Philippines were considered least liquid. Respondents felt improvement was also necessary in the quality of research material, particularly on China, and information on particular companies, their finances and creditworthiness. The survey drew on the responses of 124 investment managers at the largest insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds/unit trusts, investment management companies and banks. International investors expected to increase their exposure to Asia in the next two years, from 15.8 per cent of total funds under management at the end of 1992 to 18.4 per cent by the end of 1994. Asian respondents planned to increase their exposure to the region by more than their European and US counterparts, from 14.6 per cent to 18.9 per cent. Within Asia, the survey revealed that investors allocated 84.5 per cent in the developed markets - Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand  - and 15.43 per cent in emerging markets, such as Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Taiwan, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Korea, and the Philippines. Some 0.07 per cent was placed in 'dormant or incubating' markets, which include Brunei, Macao, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam, Bhutan, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar. However, this asset allocation was expected to change as more emphasis was placed on the emerging markets, rising to 22.6 per cent, while developed markets would account for 76.3 per cent in two years. Of the emerging stock markets, China and South Korea could expect increased exposure by international investors over the next two years - from 15.6 per cent to 21.6 per cent in the case of China, and from 16.9 per cent to 22 per cent for South Korea - the report said.

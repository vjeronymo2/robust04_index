			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Israel and PLO to resume talks in Cairo Israeli and PLO peace negotiators are to meet again today in Cairo, having failed during two days of talks in Tunis to agree conditions for resuming peace talks on Palestinian autonomy suspended following last month's Hebron mosque massacre. The stumbling blocks appear to be Israel's refusal to allow an armed international force to be deployed in the occupied territories to protect Palestinians, and its rejection of PLO demands for the evacuation of the 400 Jewish settlers who live in the heart of Arab Hebron. Israel's foreign minister, Mr Shimon Peres, usually optimistic where Middle East peace prospects are concerned, seemed downhearted yesterday, speaking of the 'many obstacles' to be overcome before talks could resume. He firmly ruled out any prospect of a summit meeting soon between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman - that would signal the negotiations were back on track. The US peace talks co-ordinator, Mr Dennis Ross, and Mr Terje Roed Larsen, Norway's foreign ministry envoy, both of whom tried to help mediate a breakthrough in Tunis, flew to Cairo yesterday in anticipation of today's talks. According to Israeli and Palestinian sources, the two sides did agree on certain aspects of a Norwegian proposal, for the temporary deployment of international observers in Gaza, Jericho and Hebron, but the PLO insisted that these observers be armed, a proposal Israel rejected. Norway yesterday called for an emergency meeting of more than 20 donor countries, also to be held in Cairo tomorrow, to discuss arrangements for a Palestinian police force, originally intended to take over from Israeli forces after their eventual withdrawal. The donor countries will be represented by embassy officials. Officials and diplomats close to the talks said the meeting was likely to discuss the possible early deployment of a contingent of Palestinian police in Hebron should this form part of the negotiated solution. Today's Cairo talks are expected to be headed by Major General Amnon Shahak on the Israeli side and Mr Nabil Shaath for the Palestinians - the two men who had headed the now-stalled talks on Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. The Israeli team, which was last night briefing Mr Rabin on the Tunis talks, also ruled out PLO calls for the removal of Jewish settlers from Hebron. The settlers themselves threatened yesterday to use all means short of shooting soldiers to resist attempts to evacuate them, and said they were considering ways to increase the Hebron settler population.</p>

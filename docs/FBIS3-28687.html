			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- A government tax panel  issued its report on fiscal 1994 tax reform Wednesday [9  February], endorsing the income tax cut but expressing regret  over its insufficient discussions. The report handed to Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa also features tax breaks to encourage  housing purchases, the correction of unfair tax treatments and  liquor tax hikes.    The Tax Commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister,  considers the income tax cut as "unavoidable for a limited  one-year period...As an emergency escape to find a way out of  the economic slump."    But it calls for "appropriate measures over financial  burdens  caused by the temporary income tax cuts," and stresses that the  tax plan is against the panel's November "medium-term" report  that recommends a "single dealing" of an income tax cut and a  hike in the consumption tax.    Speaking at a press meeting after handing over the report,  panel chairman Kan Kato said he expressed his "regret" to  Hosokawa that the panel was not given sufficient time to discuss  its proposals thoroughly.    The government and ruling coalition parties decided Tuesday  on the 20 percent income tax cut, totaling 5.47 trillion yen,  but left aside the funding issue by setting up a forum to  discuss it for enactment as law by the end of the year.    The tax plan was included in a record 15.25 billion yen  economic stimulus package unveiled later Tuesday.    Kato urged the forum to promptly decide on tax reform bills  based on the November report, and said his panel would also  continue studying the issue to win public support. But he also  noted that the government and coalition debate over the tax  issue helped raise public interest, and repeated that the  funding problems should be settled in "six months" while that  interest remains high.    The report spells out that the panel "recognizes (the tax  plan) as a bridge toward realizing the tax reform" for a  balanced tax system among income, consumption and assets to cope  with the aging of the population.    Meanwhile, the panel also supports the government's planned  inheritance tax cuts, and the abolition of special corporate  tax, and a higher consumption tax rate on passenger cars. The  report endorses "appropriate" tax incentives to spur housing and  other effective use of land, but notes that the basic framework  decided in fiscal 1993 tax reforms to prevent a revival of  speculation and a land price boom must be maintained.    On unfair tax treatment, the panel recommends raising the  special low tax rate or lowering the tax exemption amount,  currently at 30 percent, on donations to religious and other  nonprofit organizations.    As for entertainment expenses which are seen to be used by  companies to evade corporate tax, the panel wants the government  to levy a given proportion of the current amount of tax  exemption at smaller businesses.    Concerning the punitive heavy tax on unexplained expenses  proposed earlier by the coalition parties, the panel thinks it  should be "temporary" because the effects on corporate  activities and tax enforcement are unpredictable.    The panel also calls for reviewing special tax treatments on  mass media and six other designated businesses and rewards to  medical practitioners under the social security program.    The report approves the tax hikes on beer and other liquor  decided earlier by the government.</p>

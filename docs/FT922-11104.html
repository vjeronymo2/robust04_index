			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: IRH shares suspended TRADING in International Resort Holdings, the golf course and property group, was suspended at 33p yesterday as the company announced that its net asset value had 'seriously diminished'. IRH, which warned in January that the profits outlook of the main development division was uncertain, said the group had incurred losses for the year to the end of March 1992. Trading in the USM-quoted group will remain suspended pending clarification of its financial position. It is believed that the net asset value of IRH has fallen to less than half the Pounds 5.6m called up share capital, prompting the Stock Exchange announcement. At the end of March 1991 IRH had debt of about Pounds 13m and assets valued at Pounds 16m. The group has been in talks with its banker, Gamelstaden, which also holds 15 per cent of the equity. If a refinancing based on a debt for equity swap or a rights issue cannot be agreed, then IRH faces administration or receivership. An extraordinary meeting is to be called to inform shareholders of the options facing the group. An announcement is expected by the week-end.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Luxembourg Wants Uniform OECD </F> Regulations"]    [Excerpt] Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel has  announced that he will make a harmonization of tax on interest  rates in Europe the highlight of Germany's duty presidency of  the European Union [EU]. He wants a solution that leaves  national taxation systems more or less untouched, but also makes  it impossible to avoid the duty to pay tax on the interest one  earns on one's savings.    Those EU countries that already have tax control systems  should retain them and place their data at the disposal of  countries that have systems of deducting tax at the source. In  these latter countries, tax should also be deducted from the  citizens of other EU countries living there. EU financial  institutions would be obliged to keep back the minimum tax to be  paid. In this way, Waigel wants to avoid a split in the capital  market.    As has been the case so far, investors from third countries  (non-EU nationals) would be exempt from this tax so as not to  disturb the flow of capital into the EU. Bank secrecy would be  preserved wherever it exists. Every member country should  decide by itself whether the tax on interest is to be included  in income tax, or whether it will exist as a separate measure.  It should be possible to pay voluntary sums of tax to protect  smaller investments.    A number of OECD countries have already established rules on  the collection of tax on interest rates. Waigel considers it  unlikely that there will be an escape of capital sums to exotic  tax havens as in the Caribbean or Middle East. He also sees no  danger to stock markets, national economies, or currencies.  [passage omitted]</p>

His  comments came as Washington and Paris accused the United Nations  of lacking the will to use air strikes, after Serb attacks on  French UN troops over the weekend.    Cot, the outgoing commander of the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia said he noted that authority to  order "close air support" had passed from the Secretary General,  Butrus Butrus-Ghali, to his special envoy in Zagreb Yasushi  Akashi. "I am convinced it is necessary to go further, and in  some clearly outlined, clearly defined cases authority should be  given to the military, which is not irresponsible," the French  general said at a press conference to introduce his successor  General Bertrand de Lapresle.    Cot has long demanded the right to order airstrikes and his  insistence largely prompted his dismissal by Butrus-Ghali in  mid-January. De Lapresle, using more guarded language, agreed  that "there are cases which justify a very rapid response, not  to make war but to guarantee our most important right, that of  legitimate self-defence." [passage omitted]    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe assailed the United  Nations on Monday for its slow response, saying, "One must act  faster and be more determined." French Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur, who visited Bihac on Sunday, strongly criticized "the  often overly long delays, (and) the too heavy administrative and  political procedures" preventing immediate retaliation when blue  helmets come under fire.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Japanese group in deal with Pilkington PILKINGTON, the UK glassmaker, is selling a 20 per cent stake in Triplex Safety Glass, its UK automotive glass subsidiary, to Nippon Sheet Glass of Japan for Pounds 13.3m. Pilkington shares rose 5p to 149p. NSG, the second largest flat and safety glassmaker in Japan, bought a 20 per cent stake of Pilkington's US glass business, Libbey-Owens-Ford, in 1989 for Dollars 230m. Mr Roger Leverton, Pilkington chief executive, said the Triplex deal was of great strategic importance. NSG was a leading supplier to Japanese carmakers in its home market. 'We are trying to underpin the already substantial business we have with Japanese transplants (Japanese-owned car factories) in the UK. The relationship with NSG in the US has been very successful in strengthening our links with Japanese customers there. We want to do the same in Europe,' he said. In the US, LOF supplied a 'significant' part of the glass for Japanese plants including Toyota, Nummi, Nissan and Honda. Pilkington is already a leading supplier to Nissan and Toyota in the UK, with 25 per cent of Triplex's sales going to Japanese manufacturers. Triplex has been nominated as the glass supplier for the Nissan Micra. A second motive for the link, Mr Leverton said, was a technology agreement with NSG, which is expected to improve efficiencies and cut costs at Triplex. Enhanced profits at Triplex should more than compensate Pilkington for its reduced stake. The deal price of Pounds 13.3m - valuing Triplex as a whole at Pounds 66.5m  -represented a 'reasonable' premium to net asset value, he said, which would benefit Pilkington's balance sheet. One analyst said it was 'a drop in the bucket' given Pilkington's high gearing. Triplex, which has production sites in St Helens, Lancashire, and Kings Norton, Birmingham, has an annual turnover of Pounds 80m.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Japan groups to reduce reliance on market growth MATSUSHITA Electric and Mitsubishi Materials, two of Japan's largest manufacturing companies, yesterday signalled that the economic downturn may force manufacturers to revise radically corporate plans based on the assumption of high rates of economic growth. In a marked shift away from reliance on market growth to lift sales, both companies plan to cut costs to improve flagging profitability because they believe the downturn will herald a period of much slower than forecast growth in Japan. Matsushita is next month expected to unveil a radically revised three-year plan which focuses on achieving higher profitability, in spite of assuming close to zero growth in demand for consumer electronics. The plan is likely to include staff cuts at the company's Osaka headquarters and sharp reductions in graduate recruitment. Mitsubishi Materials, the metals, cement and mining combine, has cut its targets for sales, profit and investment over the next five years which were drawn up only last year. The company said it had reduced its 1995 target for sales by 20 per cent to Y1,000bn (Dollars 8.33bn), pre-tax profits by 30 per cent to Y43bn and capital investment by 10 per cent because it now expects economic growth to remain at between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent. A further review of long-term targets will be launched early next year. The extent of the economic downturn's impact on traditional manufacturing companies was underlined by announcements that NKK and Mitsubishi Steel plan wide-ranging restructuring. Mitsubishi Steel said it made a net loss of Y900m for the half-year ended in September after initially forecasting a profit of Y1.1bn. NKK is expected to finalise a restructuring package for its troubled steel division in December. Meanwhile, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan's second-largest sheet glass maker, reported a 42 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y3.5bn for the half-year to September.</p>

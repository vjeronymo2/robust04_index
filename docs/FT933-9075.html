			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Commercial vehicle sales fall by 10.8% NEW COMMERCIAL vehicle registrations fell by 10.8 per cent last month to 7,038 as the industry remains stubbornly in recession. Sales have been lower year-on-year in six of the past seven months. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said that sales of new commercial vehicles in the first seven months of the year at 104,255 were 5.6 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year ago. The persistent decline had been caused in particular by weak demand for light commercial vehicles. July is the low point for commercial vehicles sales as purchases are delayed until the new registration letter in August, but the disappointing trend of the first half of the year has been maintained. Registrations of light vans - up to 1.8 tonnes (gross vehicle weight) - dropped year-on-year by 34.5 per cent last month. This segment has also been marked by a sharp fall in sales of UK-built vehicles. Imports of light vans have jumped 63.3 per cent in the first seven months, increasing their share of the segment to 35.2 per cent from 19.7 per cent a year ago. The rise in imports has largely resulted from General Motors' decision to switch the assembly of its Vauxhall/Opel high-roof light vans from the UK to Portugal. Registrations of trucks - above 3.5 tonnes - also fell by 3.4 per cent last month, a minor setback in a part of the market where sales have appeared to be slowly lifting out of recession. The firmest sign of recovery from recession has been shown by the heavy truck sector - above 15 tonnes - where registrations have risen in the first seven months by 11.7 per cent year-on-year. The overdue replacement of vehicles, in particular of long-distance haulage fleets, is responsible for the increase in sales. The recovery in this segment has helped the UK fortunes of leading European heavy truckmakers, particularly Scania and Volvo of Sweden and Iveco of Italy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-JULY 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Volume       Volume    Share (%)    Share (%)                         (Units)   Change (%)   Jan-Jul 93   Jan-Jul 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*           104,255         -5.6        100.0        100.0 Imports                  41,239         +8.5         39.6         34.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                    32,310         -8.4        100.0        100.0 Imports                  11,372        +63.3         35.2         19.7 Ford                     14,933         -1.7         46.2         43.1 Vauxhall (General   Motors)                10,260        -13.2         31.8         33.5 Peugeot incl.

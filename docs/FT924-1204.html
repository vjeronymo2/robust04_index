			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Pressure for higher US petrol taxes A COALITION of fiscal conservatives, environmentalists, car-makers and international economists has given new life to the proposal that the US needs higher petrol taxes. Mr Bill Clinton argued strongly during his election campaign against raising petrol taxes, but at his economic seminar in Little Rock this week, he appeared increasingly isolated. Politicians who have made the mounting budget deficit the centre of their message, such as Mr Ross Perot, argue there is plenty of room to raise the relatively modest taxes imposed on petrol. International economists at the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have also favoured petrol taxes as a way to reduce the US budget deficit, since every additional 1 cent per gallon would raise around Dollars 1bn (Pounds 658m) a year. Environmentalists favour higher petrol taxes as a way of discouraging the US's profligate fuel consumption, and so reducing exhaust emissions. With a US gallon of unleaded petrol now costing anywhere from Dollars 1 to Dollars 1.25, fuel consumption ranges from 19.7 miles per gallon in Hawaii, the most economical state, to 11.2mpg in Alaska. Car companies are surprising newcomers to the cause, but Mr Harold Poling, chairman of Ford Motor, backed higher petrol taxes at the Little Rock summit, and Chrysler and General Motors, the other two big US car-makers, have followed. The car companies would gladly accept higher taxes in exchange for the abolition of the current rules designed to discourage gas-guzzlers, which oblige them to make small, fuel-efficient cars which customers have no incentive to buy, because petrol is so cheap. Mr Clinton left open the possibility of pairing a rise in taxes with income tax cuts for the middle class. 'I don't think you ought to raise the heck out of gas taxes unless you're going to give the middle class some kind of a break somewhere else,' he said.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Fatal attraction to wrong decisions: A lack of luck and judgment at Ferranti Ferranti's final collapse into receivership yesterday raises some depressingly familiar questions. The company's history is one of technological triumph dragged down by commercial incompetence. Not all the blame lies with management. In the past 20 years the UK government's handling of Ferranti has veered between lame-duck subvention and dogmatic faith in competition, with little space for market solutions in between. There is a kind of melancholy duty about recalling Ferranti's record in the field of innovation. In the early 1960s it developed the Atlas computer, which challenged the largest machines available from IBM. In the same decade, it was one of the pioneers in numerical controls for machine tools. In the 1970s it developed the first European microprocessor, and in the early 1980s took a world lead in so-called ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) chips, sold to Black &amp; Decker for drills, Sinclair for computers and Leica for cameras. All of this came to nothing. The computer business was sold to the British computer maker ICL, now part of Fujitsu of Japan. The technology for numerically controlled machine tools now rests in the hands of Japanese, American and German manufacturers. ASIC chips were eventually abandoned, on the grounds that the required investment was too big and the likely return too small. The obvious question is what Ferranti could or should have done instead. It is hard not to feel a twinge of sympathy for any company which loses its nerve after a series of strategic reverses. Indeed, to be risk-averse in those circumstances may be no more than sober realism. But one conclusion stands out. If a company cannot afford the going rate of investment in its industry, or no longer has the stomach to bet the ranch on a new technology, it is in the interests of employees, shareholders and industrial efficiency that it should resign its independence while the going is good. Ferranti did the reverse. Its catastrophic acquisition of International Signal and Control in 1987 was the hammer-blow from which the company never recovered. It may seem unfair to generalise on the basis of ISC, a company so bizarrely fraudulent as to deserve a place in the commercial history of the 20th century. Even at the time, though, it was apparent that Ferranti was taking a risk of a different kind. Determined to retain its independence, it took on a company of such notorious secrecy and opacity that no sane competitor would risk a hostile bid for the combined entity. The essential point is that while ISC finished Ferranti off, the original business was sliding downhill on its own account. Even as the fraud unfolded in the late 1980s, Ferranti itself was periodically in loss. Its technological ambitions were pathetically diminished. Amid the world revolution in telecommunications, Ferranti's answer was to invest small sums in low-cost telepoint technology, which in the UK has already proved a dead loss. Long before the ISC debacle, Ferranti had taken another fatal strategic decision. If the risks and rewards did not stack up in the world of commercial competition, the answer was to seek safe haven in the cost-plus, nationalistic world of defence. This left the company open to the risk that defence spending would turn down, as happened after the collapse of the old Soviet Union. It also exposed it to another serious risk: that fashions and ideology would change in British industrial policy. Having been bailed out with taxpayers' money in 1975, Ferranti thus found itself 10 years later at the mercy of a new ideology which said that if Britain was to depend on domestic suppliers of defence equipment, it would at least guarantee competition between those suppliers. It was in vain for Lord Weinstock of GEC to point out to the Ministry of Defence that companies like Ferranti and Plessey were no longer big enough to carry the burden of research and technology. In the interests of competition, they had to be left to fend for themselves. The irony thus is that Ferranti could probably not have surrendered its independence had it wanted to: not at any rate in the mid-1980s, when it really mattered. The UK government has since reversed its stance, so that GEC has bought the essential bits of Plessey and will doubtless have official blessing to snap up the remaining defence bits of Ferranti from the receivers. If business, like war, needs luck as well as judgment, poor old Ferranti has had the worst of both.</p>

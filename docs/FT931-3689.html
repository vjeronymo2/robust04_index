			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Storms bring chaos to US east coast Residents check the damage to their neighbourhood in Gainesville, Florida, after it was hit by winter storms which left a trail of devastation along the Atlantic coast of the US. Up to 66 people were killed, motorways and airports were closed by heavy snow and flooding, and millions of homes were left without electricity. A state of emergency was declared by governors in 12 states, and President Bill Clinton ordered emergency aid to parts of Florida. By late yesterday, airports had re-opened, though delays were expected because of a flights backlog. Airports paralysed, Page 3</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Letter: The real role of the trade association Sir, In his excellent article on trade associations ('Lobbying not worth a button', July 15), Andrew Taylor puts a very persuasive case for Britain's 2,000-plus trade associations to modernise and become more effective in both the lobbying process and in the range of services they provide to their members. The gist of a speech by Mr Michael Heseltine, the president of the board of trade, about trade associations to the Confederation of British Industry in June was that, from a DTI standpoint, too many associations are narrowly focused, poorly resourced and ill-equipped to help the industries they represent become competitive. He therefore specifically welcomed developments in the chemicals and electronics sectors, where there have recently been a number of trade association mergers, as examples of what should be happening more widely across industry. It is certainly our experience in the Electronic Engineering Association that there is a 'critical mass' below which it is impossible for a trade association to provide sufficient resources to maintain effective contacts with government, Brussels and the many other national and international agencies which today affect the business environment in which member companies operate. We therefore strongly support Mr Heseltine's call for the development of a single, well-resourced trade association to represent each big sector of industry. The EEA itself is the result of a number of mergers. It will enlarge again by joining the Electronic Components Industry Federation to form a new Federation of the Electronics Industry on January 1 1994. The FEI will have more than 300 member companies and provide a powerful focus for telecommunications, information technology, defence electronics, business equipment, office products and electronic components elements of the electronics industry.

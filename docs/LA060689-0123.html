			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SENIORITY REMAINS STICKING POINT IN BUSCH DRIVER STRIKE  </P> <P> Anheuser-Busch's Sylmar distribution plant has responded to an 11-week-old  drivers' strike by using management personnel to keep the beer flowing to  retailers.  </P> <P> Negotiators for the plant and for Local 896 of the International Brotherhood of  Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America will meet today to  discuss issues dividing them, according to a union official.  </P> <P> About 45 management personnel have been making deliveries since the strike  began March 16, according to a plant spokesman.  </P> <P> Seventy-seven Teamsters walked off the job after the last of several contract  extensions ran out. According to Anheuser-Busch spokesman Russell Bell,  management made its first offer before the original contract ran out Oct. 1 and  has since made two offers.  </P> <P> Chuck Roberts, secretary-treasurer of Local 896, said the most important issue  to the workers is seniority. He said drivers believe that a new demand-based  delivery system sought by management in the new contract -- under which they  would work only as they are needed -- would take away guarantees that senior  employees have a full weekly work schedule.  </P> <P> Roberts said the drivers also believe that the new system could result in  layoffs and demands that the remaining drivers work overtime.  </P> <P> Also at issue is the wage scale for drivers, according to Roberts. He said  drivers are paid $11.70 an hour, plus a 10-cent commission for each case  delivered above 1,500 cases per week. The union has demanded a wage increase of  65 to 75 cents per hour each year for the next three years. Roberts said that  in its most recent offer, rejected by the union May 27, management offered an  increase of 45 cents per hour in the first year and 35 cents per hour in each  of the next two years. The offer did not respond to the union's seniority  concerns, he said.  </P> <P> Through the plant spokesman, General Manager Paul Nickel declined to comment,  but issued a statement that said the present offer "is as good or better than  any contract currently in force in the Los Angeles area at Anheuser-Busch  wholesalerships or those of our competitors."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Continue to Deliver  </P> <P> Nickel also vowed to continue deliveries. "We hope this matter can be resolved  shortly," Nickel said in the statement. "Until it is, we will continue to  deliver to our retailers using Anheuser-Busch management personnel."  </P> <P> According to Greg Allossery, Sylmar shop steward for Local 896, a similar  strike is in effect at an Anheuser-Busch distribution plant in Louisiana.  </P> <P> Jeff Davis, an Anheuser-Busch spokesman in St. Louis, confirmed that 76  Teamsters have been on strike at a plant in Metairie, near New Orleans, for a  month. He would not comment on whether the same issues are involved in the  Metairie strike.  </P></p>

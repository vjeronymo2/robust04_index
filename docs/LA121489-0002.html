			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> LITTLE BY LITTLE, A SMALL CITY SHOWS A BIG HEART IN ITS QUAKE RECOVERY  </P> <P> Undaunted by the destruction that the Oct. 17 quake dealt it -- and with the  help of some Southern California groups -- the small agricultural town of  Watsonville is shaking off the dust and climbing to its feet.  </P> <P> It has been rough for the 29,500 people of Watsonville -- one person was  killed, about 80 were hospitalized and 195 homes were destroyed. But this  working-class community includes some stout-hearted people.  </P> <P> I should know. From the age of 5 until I left for college 13 years later, I  attended school, shopped, went to Mass, worked and laughed with these people.  Watsonville was my stomping ground. Even today, when Los Angeles gets me down  and I feel the need to escape, I return to my hometown, where almost every  street and face recalls warm memories.  </P> <P> Watsonville -- a city known for its frozen-food processing plants -- is nestled  between the hills of Mt. Madonna and the Pacific Ocean, about 16 miles south of  Santa Cruz. Its population is about 50% Anglo, 40% Latino; the rest are Asians,  blacks and American Indians.  </P> <P> When I returned home a week after the 7.1 earthquake, I found that it had dealt  Watsonville a tremendous blow.  </P> <P> About 850 people, mostly poor Latino laborers, slept in tents that the city and  the National Guard pitched in parks throughout the city. St. Patrick's Catholic  Church, an enormous red-brick structure built in 1903, was heavily damaged, and  church officials said it will ultimately be demolished. Some residents whose  homes were severely damaged set up house in tents on their front yards and  cooked meals on portable barbecue pits.  </P> <P> Most of the Latinos displaced by the quake had been living in aging apartments  and run-down houses on the south side of town. Many of them had little to lose,  but lost what little they had.  </P> <P> Roberto Ramirez, who was forced out of his two-room apartment, just shrugged as  he watched two children run around in the mud in a vacant lot across the street  where he and his family had pitched a tent for shelter.  </P> <P> "It's what God commands," he told me in Spanish.  </P> <P> But within weeks after the destructive quake, Watsonville began to show signs  of recovery and -- in some cases -- the return of some normalcy. The number of  people sleeping in tents in local parks and in three shelters began to  diminish.  </P> <P> Colleen McQuillan, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Watsonville, said the agency  placed some people in hotel rooms until they could find other shelter. She said  the Federal Emergency Management Agency also provided about 100 trailers that  people could use on a semi-permanent basis.  </P> <P> A group of Latino activists in Watsonville provided counseling for  Spanish-speaking residents at a clinic called Salud Para La Gente, McQuillan  said. Some of the people who sought help at the clinic lived through the 1985  Mexico City earthquake and retained horrible memories of the experience, she  said.  </P> <P> "We have been coordinating mental health workers to let people talk about their  fears and anxiety," she said.  </P> <P> Less than a month after the quake, almost everybody had returned to work, she  said, and school buses had been rerouted to include stops at the shelters and  makeshift tent cities.  </P> <P> What overwhelmed most people, she said, were the donations and gestures of  support for those living in tents and shelters.  </P> <P> "It was just amazing how many people were concerned about the kids in the  shelter," McQuillan said.  </P> <P> Among those making contributions to Watsonville's recovery were a group of  music students from Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson, who raised money by  selling cassette tapes of original music they recorded.  </P> <P> The nine-song cassette, titled "Answering the Call," included funk,  Christian-oriented and progressive rock music. Students at the university  expected to raise about $1,000.  </P> <P> One campus official said the university chose to assist Watsonville because  "Dominguez Hills is one of the smaller campuses in the (Cal State) system, and  we decided to adopt one of the smaller cities damaged by the quake."  </P> <P> Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) and some other Latinos helped  collect about $1,000 in donations and filled a 60-foot-long truck with  everything from pots and pans to blankets and baby food.  </P> <P> Keith Malone, a spokesman for Polanco, said that "obviously there is a common  heritage here" and added that the goal of the relief drive was for "Latinos to  help Latinos."  </P> <P> For many, the quake drew a heavy emotional toll.  </P> <P> My dad -- a strawberry farmer who came to this country as a day laborer almost  30 years ago -- said that many Mexican workers who were displaced by the quake  had become frustrated trying to find a permanent house and returned to Mexico.  </P> <P> But he said tractors and other heavy equipment had begun the process of tearing  down the most heavily damaged buildings in the city's downtown commercial strip  -- much of which was built in the early 1900s -- to make way for their  replacements.  </P> <P> "Little by little," he said, "the city is getting better."  </P></p>

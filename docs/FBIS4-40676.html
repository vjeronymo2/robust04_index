			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Korium Khumaryan from </F> Yerevan; from the "Novosti" newscast]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Khumaryan] Armenian President  Levon Ter-Petrosyan received the chairman of the CSCE Minsk  group in Yerevan late this evening. During the conversation the  problems of a peace settlement of the Karabakh conflict were  discussed. The Armenian position on the matter is unequivocal:  There is no alternative to peace in the region. But a forced  confrontation has reached such a level that guarantee of peace  cannot be achieved without bringing in disengaging forces and  international observers in the conflict zone.    There is practically no contradiction between the Russian  and  CSCE peacemaking programs. It is now up to Azerbaijan's good  will.</p>

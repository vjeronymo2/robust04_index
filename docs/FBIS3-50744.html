The Zorraquin group,  centered in the petrochemical industry, is unable to escape the  effects of the free fall of international prices and the  invasion by imported products. In order to stay afloat, it has  put Saiar, the leader in the production of heating tanks, and  the jewel of its holding operations, up for sale. Philco, the  enterprise headed by Jorge Blanco Villegas, the president of the  UIA [Argentine Industrial Union], represents the other side of  this coin. It is enjoying the delights of a purchasing rate of  electrical domestic appliances that continues to rise. And it  has just bought Peabody in order to enter the freezer market, an  area from which it had been absent.    The Garovaglio-Zorraquin [G &amp; Z] business group, which  owns  the Ipako and Polisur petrochemical firms, is looking for ways  to eliminate ballast in order to stay afloat in the financial  crisis threatening to submerge it. The most effective method it  has found has been to eliminate some of its assets. It has left  some fields and ceased its participation in various  undertakings. What it has not yet succeeded in doing is to gain  control of a debt that totals about $150 million.    Now it has tacked the "For Sale" sign on the door of another  of the firms it controls--the Saiar metallurgical company. This  firm is the leader in the thermotank and heating-system market.  It holds the license for the U.S. Rheem brand, and as a result  it invoiced a total of more than 60 million pesos in 1992.    Its production activities are distributed between two  plants.  The first is located in Quilmes, in Greater Buenos Aires.    Although it is called the Iguazu plant, the other is in San  Luis, where it was built in the heat of the industrial upsurge.    Although Saiar was only put up for sale a very short time  ago, there has already been one principal interested party--the  owners of the Rheem trademark. But the talks with the North  Americans soon reached an impasse. The other buyer negotiating  at the present time is the Chilean Compania Tecno Industrial  [Technoindustrial Company], the leader in the electrical  domestic appliance market on the other side of the mountain  range. It has been learned that this company wants to establish  itself in Argentina, using Saiar as its base for MERCOSUR  [Common Market of the South] operations.    The Chileans are talking with Associated Merchant Bankers  (MBA), the firm managed by the Reynal brothers, which represents  Salomon Brothers in Argentina. It happened that MBA, which  provides financial advice to G &amp; Z, planned the entire Saiar  sales operation. It is managing the negotiations with the Bank  Club with a view to its financing of the debts of the group.  <H5>  Changes Planned </H5>   Ipako, the leading G &amp; Z firm, has for several months  been  undergoing a drastic adaptation plan. Federico Zorraquin, Jr.,  remained to head the internal reorganization after the entire  top management of the firm was removed.    Strictly speaking, the reorganization of this group began  earlier. One of the first decisions made was to sell for $8  million its share (50 percent) of Aluplata, a joint undertaking  with the Crown firm in the United States for the manufacture of  lightweight aluminum beverage containers.    Other steps in the same direction included the sale of four  floors of the main building to the Perez Company, deactivation  of the operations of the Cerro Castillo [Castle Hill] mining  company, and the sale of some rural properties.    Zorraquin's hope of preventing the enterprise from sinking  hinges on the negotiations with the Bank Club. According to  spokesmen for the enterprise, an agreement is very close to  being reached. They do not exclude the possibility that this may  happen before the end of this month.    They say that this agreement would be possible if a contract  for supplying ethylene to the petrochemical plants could be  agreed upon first. The Zorraquin people want a price lower than  Bahia Blanca Petrochemicals (PBB), a mixed enterprise, is  obtaining for this raw material at present.    "It would mean our doom if the agreement were to fall  through," a spokesman for the group said. If this were to  happen, according to the enterprise, the group would suffer from  another drain in addition to that resulting from the financial  suit against them that was won recently by the PBB requiring  that Ipako pay off a debt of $30 million.    The directors of Ipako are confident. They believe they will  be able to survive based on the plan for further adjustment and  refinancing of their debts. However, they immediately add that  they have no control over the development of international  prices (now at their lowest point) or the harsh competition  provided by the petrochemical firms in Brazil, which have  invaded Argentine territory with the lowest prices in history.</p>

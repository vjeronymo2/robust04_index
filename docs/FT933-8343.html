			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Retail sales register strongest growth in three years RETAIL sales rose in July for the seventh consecutive month, registering their strongest growth for more than three years, according to a Confederation of British Industry survey published today. The CBI's latest distributive trades survey shows that for the first time since 1990, more companies are indicating that sales are above average, rather than below, for the time of year. The news may point to a consumer-led recovery, particularly after a string of figures last week suggested growth in the manufacturing sector was slowing. But Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's director of economic affairs, said the improvement in sales suggested 'steady growth rather than a consumer boom. Even now, fewer than one in four retailers considers trading conditions to be good'. The improvement has not yet benefited retailers of all sizes, according to Mr Sudhir Junankar, an economist at the CBI. 'Retailers with only one outlet were still reporting that trade was lower than a year earlier,' he said. 'This indicates that the steady monthly growth in retail sales has not yet extended to all corners of the high street.' The CBI said the pick-up in retail spending was filtering through only slowly to the rest of the economy. Retailers still consider stock levels to be too high and orders placed with suppliers are growing at a much slower rate than sales. Official figures from the Central Statistical Office show retail sales to be growing at an annualised rate of 3.1 per cent. Growth has been above 3 per cent since March. Car sales rose modestly in July after two months of year-on-year decline, and orders for cars have risen sharply. There was a build up in stock levels among wholesalers. Overseas receipts of UK financial institutions jumped a net 19.8 per cent last year from Pounds 15.7bn in 1991 to Pounds 18.8bn, British Invisibles, a trade group, reported yesterday. Nearly all sectors achieved improvements in overseas earnings, with increased earnings from overseas portfolio investments fuelling much of the rise. These were boosted by September's devaluation of the pound. Overseas earnings from insurance institutions were particularly strong, jumping by 21.6 per cent to Pounds 4.3bn and taking net overseas receipts back to levels of 1987.

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bank charges to be levied - At a glance Save &amp; Prosper/Robert Fleming has announced it will be introducing charges on its current account for those in credit. The move may be the beginning of the end of free banking in the UK: Midland was the first of the big four English banks to introduce it in 1984. From April 1, customers holding the S&amp;P Classic Account with Robert Fleming &amp; Co will be charged Pounds 5 when their balances fall below Pounds 1,000 on the last business day of the month. No interest will be paid on deposits of less than Pounds 2,500 in the Deposit and Premier accounts. The previous threshold had been Pounds 1,000.</p>

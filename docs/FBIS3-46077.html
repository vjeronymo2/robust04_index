The meeting pointed out: Under the guidance  of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, with a focus on  economic construction, there is a need to deepen reform,  strengthen management, enliven human resources, improve  services, comprehensively fulfill institutional reform,  introduce the civil service system, and carry out wage system  reform in order to make new contributions to Hunan's  invigoration. Provincial party and government leaders,  including [Vice Governor] Chu Bo and Luo Haifan, attended and  addressed the meeting. Zhu Qiulin, director of the provincial  personnel department, made a report entitled "Expediting the  Pace of Reform, Strengthening Personnel Management, and  Establishing a Personnel System in Conformity With the Socialist  Market Economic Structure."    In his speech, Chu Bo referred to the province's economic  situation in 1993, stressed three major aspects of personnel  reform for this year, and explained the new situation and new  tasks facing organizational and personnel work.    He said: The overall arrangements for institutional reform  throughout the province were decided by the provincial party  committee and government last year. These arrangements still  remain unchanged. The province will strive to fulfill  institutional reform this year. Before institutional reform is  carried out, all localities should make the necessary  preparations.    Chu Bo said: Establishing and implementing a state civil  service system is the focal point of speeding up personnel  system reform. The provincial government's arrangements are as  follows: Personnel system reform will be carried out according  to state regulations, step by step and in a planned way in  coordination with institutional reform and wage system reform.  The personnel currently employed throughout the province will  basically become state civil servants this year. In the course  of implementing the civil service system, the relevant policy  should be strictly observed. No one is allowed to introduce  institutional expansion by taking advantage of this reform, to  do a rush job of promoting cadres, to increase the number of  posts for leaders without authorization, or to set up  nonleadership posts willfully.    Comrade Chu Bo also expressed his views on wage system  reform  in institutions and stressed the need to reform the social  insurance system in institutions and enterprises and to  establish talented personnel markets.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Man in the News: Cool, calm and selected - Thabo Mbeki To be a heartbeat away from the presidency is seldom a position of real prominence. But it carries a special, even awesome, significance when the president is 75 and the country in question is South Africa. Mr Thabo Mbeki is now in the limelight, though not yet centre stage. As first executive vice-president and deputy to Mr Nelson Mandela, the leader of the African National Congress who becomes South Africa's president on Tuesday, it is not surprising that he now attracts more scrutiny. Given the stature of Mr Mandela, the job of filling his shoes is well nigh impossible. But if anyone can provide the reassurance and continuity that his demise would require, it is this urbane 53 year old. For nearly 20 years, the soft-spoken Mr Mbeki, with grizzled grey beard and pipe to hand, has been, for many in the west, the acceptable face of South African black nationalism. Well before it was respectable to be seen in public with the ANC, some South African businessmen and Western diplomats established private links with a man who clearly would make his mark in a post-apartheid South Africa. His credentials are impeccable. The son of the revered ANC patriarch Mr Govan Mbeki, fellow prisoner of Mr Mandela, he won his political spurs in the ANC Youth League, which he joined in 1956. During a short period underground after the ANC was outlawed in 1960, he was national secretary of the African Students Association. In exile from the early 1960s, he put the ANC's case during postings in London, Botswana, Swaziland, Nigeria and Zambia. Between deployments, he got his MA in economics from Sussex University and underwent military training in the Soviet Union in 1970. None of this extraordinary and sometimes dangerous past shows. Mbeki, whose demeanour might suit the senior common room of an Oxbridge college, for years quietly defended the legitimacy of the ANC's armed struggle against white rule and pressed eloquently for the imposition of sanctions. Appointed to the ANC's national executive in 1977, he climbed steadily in the liberation movement's hierarchy. In 1978 he became political secretary in the office of the then-president, Oliver Tambo, who died last year. He added the post of ANC director for information to his responsibilities shortly afterwards. In 1985 he advanced his standing in the party after the ANC's congress in the northern Zambian town of Kabwe, becoming secretary for presidential affairs and winning a place on the ANC organ overseeing its underground activities, the politico-military council. But it was as head of the ANC's department of international affairs, which he took up in 1989, that he made his mark. In his dealings with foreign governments he avoided the revolutionary rhetoric of some colleagues and remained firm in the belief that a negotiated settlement was possible. He set out to promote the ANC, often seen in the west as a 'terrorist' movement to use the phrase of former British prime minister Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher, as a pragmatic movement. A senior western diplomat dispenses high praise: 'Whenever the ANC put its foot in it, which was often, Thabo was on hand to extract it.' This experience served him well in what was to be his key role in South Africa's transition to democracy. The talks which brought this about can be traced back to a meeting in a Zambian game park in 1985. It was then that, with the backing of former Zambian president, Mr Kenneth Kaunda, a delegation of top South African businessmen, led by the ex-chairman of the Anglo American Corporation, Mr Gavin Relly, flew to Zambia for discussions with the ANC. Within a short time the visitors had concluded that Mr Mbeki and his colleagues, including the late Mr Chris Hani, were politicians with whom they could do business. Further meetings followed in other centres from Senegal to London. They involved not only South African businessmen but academics, journalists, church leaders and pillars of the Afrikaner community. The latter risked, and in some cases received, a public denunciation from South Africa's then-president, the cantankerous Mr P W Botha. The composition of the ANC delegations would change, but the figure almost always at the heart of the talks was Mr Mbeki. On his return to South Africa after Mr Mandela's release in 1990, he was first contrasted with Hani, the former leader of the South African Communist party who had a powerful constituency among the country's alienated youth. Following Hani's assassination Mr Mbeki's main rival became Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary general who had a cut his political teeth in the rough and tough environment of strikes and stayaways when he led the National Union of Mineworkers. No less eloquent than Mr Mbeki, it seemed Mr Ramaphosa's role as the ANC's prime negotiator in the constitutional talks, and his talent as a hard-nosed political infighter, would make him a strong candidate for the number two job. Mr Mbeki, who sometimes appeared more comfortable in boardrooms than at political rallies, was criticised in some quarters for his apparent reluctance to involve himself in grassroots politics. Yet to the surprise of many, Mr Mbeki was endorsed by the ANC Youth League when he made his successful bid for chairmanship of the ANC in 1993. This support may well have swung the balance in his favour in the contest for the deputy presidentship, while Mr Ramaphosa decided to decline a cabinet post and concentrate on strengthening the ANC's organisation. One of Mr Mbeki's erstwhile adversaries in the De Klerk government, now an admirer who sat opposite him in the delicate behind-the-scenes encounters which opened the way to formal talks, remarks: 'He is one of the toughest, most able negotiators I have dealt with.' Says another government negotiator: 'His ability to maintain his ANC credentials while accommodating white fears was a key factor in the whole process.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of Russia's Unity and Concord faction in  the Duma, Deputy Premier Sergey Shakhray has spoken out against  bombing Serb positions at the Bosnian town of Gorazde. Talking  to newsmen on Monday, he suggested that such actions are very  dangerous and only lead to resentment and indignation. He is  convinced that in making such a decision, the mechanisms  envisaged by the UN Charter should be set into motion, which  necessitates a Security Council resolution.    This is not the way to settle conflicts, the issue would be  only aggravated by a decision to bomb, Shakhray said. In his  assessment an air strike would slow down the process of  negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs, and everything would have  to be started all over again.    [Moscow Radiostantsiya Ekho Moskvy in Russian at 0800 GMT on  12 April adds: "Those who decided to call in air strikes bear  personal responsibility for the breakdown of the peaceful  settlement through a process of negotiation, Sergey Shakhray,  leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, said to an Ekho  Moskvy correspondent. He said that bypassing Russia to act is a  slap in the face to the Russian president. Shakhray believes  that the air strikes hit not only Serb positions but the  internal political situation in Russia as well. He does not  rule out that the latest events in Bosnia could also affect the  process of reforms at home."]</p>

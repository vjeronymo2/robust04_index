			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAX SUBSIDY FOR PARENTS  </P> <P> I never expected to be in agreement with former Los Angeles Police Chief Davis  about anything. But he is absolutely right.  </P> <P> The child-rearing expert Selma Fraiberg, said: "Love-starved children are  likely to become bondless, hollow men and women who contribute largely to the  criminal population. Their non-attachment leaves a void in that area of  personality where conscience can be. When there are no human attachments there  can be no conscience. The potential for violence is far greater among these  bondless men and women. We must look upon a baby deprived of human partners as  a baby in deadly peril. This is a baby who is being robbed of his humanity."  </P> <P> The best child-care agency cannot meet a child's need for one-on-one,  constantly available parenting from either gender.  </P> <P> HELEN COLTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

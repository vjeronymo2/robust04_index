			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Shi Meisi (0670 5019 3128) and Wang Yunfeng </F> (3769 0061 1496)]    [Text] Guangzhou, 30 Apr (XINHUA) -- During an inspection  of the 75th China Export Commodity Trade Fair, Li Lanqing, CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau member and State Council vice  premier, called for efforts to further deepen foreign trade  reforms, introduce competitive mechanisms, and make the  Guangzhou export commodity trade fair a greater success in the  years to come.    Accompanied by minister Wu Yi of foreign trade and economic  cooperation and Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin, Li Lanqing  inspected the trade fair on the eve of its closing. He visited  trading pavilions, viewed transactions, met with various trade  delegation heads, and attended a discussion with officials in  charge of foreign trade and economic cooperation in various  provinces and municipalities. He also made an important speech.    Li Lanqing said: The latest Guangzhou export commodity trade  fair is quite refreshing with its display of a great variety of  commodities, which is a direct result of the introduction of  competitive mechanisms and enhancement of competitive awareness  by reforms in recent years. The trial implementation, since the  beginning of this year, of compensated bidding on the 13 kinds  of export commodities has yielded fruitful results at the trade  fair. This major reform program, which is aimed at promoting  fairness, has solved, to some extent, problems related to panic  buying of high-priced goods and dumping, and should be boldly  introduced to other commodities. In introduing more competitive  mechanisms for the next trade fair, we should implement the  system of "organizing trade delegations by provinces and  municipalities, setting up pavilions by chambers of commerce,  combining delegations with pavilions, and assigning exhibit  arrangements to various associations of trade." In this way, we  can bring into play the roles and advantages of provinces and  municipalities, chambers of commerce, and associations of trade  -- chambers of commerce in particular -- and can ensure a good  job in setting up pavilions. This will be an effective way of  managing the trade fair and of making things convenient for  visiting businessmen.    He pointed out: This year is a crucial one for deepening  reforms in China. We have introduced a series of major reform  programs, and the operation of new systems has in general  proceeded smoothly. Departments in charge of foreign trade and  economic cooperation should make ample use of the positive  results achieved through reform programs and should, needless to  say, pay attention to improving any imperfections whenever  found. They should coordinate with the relevant departments in  taking effective measures to prevent foreign businessmen from  using the trade fair to force China's export commodity prices  down and domestic exporters from driving up prices unreasonably,  thereby causing serious consequences of rising costs caused by  foreign exchange conversion.    He said: We should reform foreign trade enterprises and  should develop internationalized, industrialized, and  comprehensive trading companies. In developing  internationalized companies, attention must be paid to  standardizing operations. We should continue to promote the  reform aimed at introducing a modern system to foreign trade  companies and should allow workers and staff of selected  enterprises to hold a limited amount of company shares strictly  according to the State Council's relevant regulations.  Enterprises experimenting with this pilot project must follow  standards and must have the approval for the pilot project. It  is necessary to pay attention to summarizing experiences and  correcting mistakes in good time so as to further harness the  initiative of foreign trade enterprise workers and staff, to  increase their cohesive power, to prevent losses of state-owned  assets, and to maintain and increase their values, thereby  bringing into further play the leading role and advantages of  state-owned foreign trade enterprises.    Li Lanqing also discussed issues related to improvement of  the investment environment and training of multi-purpose  economic and trade personnel.    Yu Xiaosong, vice minister in charge of the State Economic  and Trade Commission, and Qian Guanlin, director of the General  Administration of Customs, inspected the trade fair together  with the state commission.</p>

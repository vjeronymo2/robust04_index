			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Westpac holders force poll on re-election of chairman WESTPAC, the troubled Australian bank, finally concluded its adjourned annual meeting yesterday, but not before shareholders forced a poll on the re-election of Mr John Uhrig, the recently-appointed chairman. Mr Uhrig was subjected to further attacks by small shareholders, who forced the adjournment of the meeting last week after angry criticism of the bank's financial performance. However, Mr Uhrig and another director subject to re-election were both re-elected by a large majority with the support of institutional and corporate shareholders. Rebel shareholders did manage, however, to block two changes to the bank's deed of settlement recommended by the board to bring the bank in line with federal corporations law. The changes, which would have abrogated elements of a 19th century Act of Parliament, failed by a small margin to achieve the approval of 75 per cent of shareholders at the meeting, as required by the deed. Westpac announced on Sunday that Mr Robert Joss, a vice-president of Wells Fargo, the US investment bank, would take over next month as managing director, replacing Mr Frank Conroy, who resigned last month. Mr Uhrig said the bank hoped to emulate the successful restructuring of Wells Fargo over the last few years. He said the restructured bank was 'pretty close to the way we think Westpac should be in the future.' There was criticism of the five-year contract offered to Mr Joss, which includes options for 5m Westpac shares which could be worth up to ADollars 8m (USDollars 5.7m), depending on the bank's share price. However, most shareholders supported the appointment. Mr Joss faces a significant challenge in turning round Westpac, which has suffered a series of reverses, climaxing in a record loss of ADollars 1.5bn for the year to end-September, after bad debts of ADollars 2.6bn and an unexpected US tax liability of ADollars 106m. Five directors, including the then chairman, resigned last year after a ADollars 1.2bn rights issue was largely ignored by shareholders, leaving 72 per cent of the shares in the hands of sub-underwriters. The board lost two more directors earlier this month when Mr Kerry Packer and an associate quit after Mr Uhrig and other directors rejected calls for a significant acceleration of the restructuring programme. Mr Packer, the Australian publishing entrepreneur, is Westpac's second-largest shareholder with 10 per cent of the shares, half of which is in the form of options.</p>

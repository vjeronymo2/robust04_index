			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Profits ahead of forecast at Pounds 14.9m and south-east targeted Takare, the nursing home group, is targeting the south-east of England for new development. More than half the beds now under construction are in the south-east. At present only two of the group's 39 homes are in the area. Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman, said that the Community Care Act, which came into effect nearly a year ago, had resulted in greater differences between fee rates in different regions. This made it possible to generate the same return from a home in the south-east as elsewhere. Mr Ron Reid, finance director, said that Takare's fee rates in the south-east averaged Pounds 340 a week, compared with Pounds 285 elsewhere, which would cover higher wage rates and land prices. The group beat its rights issue profit forecast of at least Pounds 14.8m in 1993, recording pre-tax profits up from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 14.9m, including a Pounds 371,000 exceptional profit on the sale of a nursing home. Earnings per share were 13.7p (12.1p), or 13.3p excluding the exceptional profit, and a final dividend of 1.4p is proposed, as forecast, to give a total of 2.07p (1.8p). Turnover growth was 52 per cent, from Pounds 48m to Pounds 72.8m, largely reflecting the rise in the number of beds the group had in operation, with prices rising only about 2 per cent. Operating profits were 59 per cent higher at Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 10.9m). However, interest payable of Pounds 2.8m (receivable Pounds 941,000), after capitalising Pounds 2.39m (Pounds 4.16m), held back the pre-tax profits growth. Takare received the Pounds 68m rights proceeds in mid-November. At the year end the group had net cash of Pounds 10.1m. However, Pounds 50m of debentures pay interest at 11.8 per cent while its cash deposits earn less than half that. Capital spending dipped to Pounds 33.6m (Pounds 40.9m) in 1993 as Takare delayed new construction while the community care reforms were implemented. During 1993 the group added 2,295 beds to take its total to 5,340 at the year end, with another 1,290 under construction. This year capital expenditure of about Pounds 50m is expected, with 1,500 to 1,800 beds under construction. Mr Bradshaw said following the rights issue, Takare was able to fund a greater proportion of its development from internal resources, and would not contemplate joint ventures or sale and leasebacks to pay for expansion. COMMENT Aside from the unfortunate management wrangle, and the question over Mr Pritchard's shareholding, the Takare story has not changed. Indeed, the move south-eastwards is to be welcomed. However, following the rights and with a rising tax charge, earnings growth will be dull this year, to be resumed next. On forecasts ofabout Pounds 21m pre-tax, the prospective p/e is in the region of 18 1/2 with the shares down 8p at 266p. After a good run post the rights, which came at 195p, the shares should mark time for a while.</p>

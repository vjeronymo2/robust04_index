			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Observer: Maggie landings Fanciful suggestions that Margaret Thatcher could soon wing in to take control of BAA have caused chuckles on the organisation's flight deck. The top brass of the former British Airports Authority - still sensitive to accusations that it commands one of the cosier, privatised mono- polies left in the erstwhile prime minister's airstream - sees the idea as a huge joke. But someone will have to step in as chairman when Sir Norman Payne, a brusque but affable 70, retires before long. After 14 years, his departure time is expected to be confirmed at the BAA annual meeting in July and head- hunters are on the prowl. The new team will face some weighty challenges, not least of which will be the fall-out from the first Monopolies and Mergers Commission review since BAA was privatised. It is due to be completed next month. There are also plans for a 15-year, Pounds 1bn airport investment programme. With Payne gone, day-to-day running of the business will be taken over by Sir John Egan, the former Jaguar man brought in last year as chief executive. Originally Egan was expected to assume Payne's all-powerful mantle, but BAA has decided to revert to the tradition of a part-time, non-executive chairman. So Payne's replacement, whoever he or she is, will not be expected to play a hands-on role. Can anyone seriously imagine Captain Thatcher keeping her fingers off the joystick?</p>

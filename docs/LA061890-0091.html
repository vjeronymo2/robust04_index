			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO CONSIDER SPECIAL TAX DISTRICT  </P> <P> With two major residential projects scheduled for development within the next  18 months, city officials are considering requiring homeowners in all future  housing tracts to pay higher property taxes as a way of offsetting the costs of  new public facilities and additional police and fire services.  </P> <P> The City Council will take the first step toward that end today as it looks  into establishing the city's first Mello-Roos special tax district.  </P> <P> A housing development on the 36-acre area bracketed by Ellis Avenue, Golden  West Street, Edwards Street and Garfield Avenue is under consideration. Deeming  it a Mello-Roos Community Facilities District would set future homeowners'  total annual property tax at 1.41%. First-year taxes would average about $2,366  in the 113-home tract, according to a report prepared by Deputy City  Administrator Robert J. Franz.  </P> <P> Current city residents would not be affected.  </P> <P> Officials say the tax-district debate may represent the first step in creating  a citywide policy to mandate that future homeowners in new developments pay  higher taxes for city services. After council members decide whether to approve  this week's Mello-Roos proposal, city planners are expected to turn their  attention to devising guidelines for similar special tax districts in the  massive Bolsa Chica and Holly Seacliff developments.  </P> <P> Under the state's Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982, a city may levy  a special property tax in a specified area -- exceeding the 1% limitation set  by Proposition 13 -- to pay for improvements such as gutters and storm drains,  as well as additional police and fire services.  </P> <P> The Mello-Roos tax revenue would repay a $2.5-million bond over the next 20  years to widen and improve Ellis Avenue, now a two-lane farm road west of  Golden West Street. Money from the bond will also pay for installing gutters,  sewers and other public amenities, and it will provide $40,000 to $50,000 worth  of additional police and fire services each year.  </P> <P> If the council approves creation of the Mello-Roos district, it would be  implemented upon approval of the majority of the area's seven landowners.

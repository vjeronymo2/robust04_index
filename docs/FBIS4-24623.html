			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wu Huizhong (0702 1920 1813)] </F>   [Text] Santiago, 23 May (XINHUA) -- During a meeting with  Liu Jiachen, Vice President of the Chinese Supreme People's  Court, at the presidential office this afternoon, Chilean  President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle underscored the great  importance that Chile attaches to developing friendly relations  and cooperation with China.    President Frei said: The Chinese judicial delegation's visit  is continuing the series of visits that have taken place between  Chile and China. Former President Patricio Aylwin Azocar,  during his visit to China in 1992, laid a sound foundation for  the development of relations between Chile and China. He said  he personally would continue to work for the further development  of relations between the two countries.    He said: Chile attaches great importance to developing its  relations with China and to learning from China's experience in  economic development. He expressed the belief that it was of  "crucial importance" to both countries to further develop  bilateral relations.    Vice President Liu Jiachen said: Relations between the two  countries have developed continuously since China and Chile  established diplomatic relations more than 20 years ago. He  expressed the hope that the visit would further increase  contacts between the two countries, especially between their  judicial circles.    This morning, the Chinese judicial delegation held separate  meetings with Chilean Supreme Court President Marcos Aburto and  Chilean Justice Minister Maria Soledad Alvear. In the  afternoon, it also met with Chilean Senate President Valdes.    The Chinese judicial delegation led by Liu Jiachen arrived  here this morning for a five-day official visit to Chile. It is  the first Chinese judicial delegation to visit Chile since the  two countries established diplomatic relations.</p>

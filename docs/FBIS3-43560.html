The ANC candidates -- who are assured of provincial  premierships if the ANC wins the April 27 election -- are  expected to learn from the experiences of Canadian provincial  premiers and US state governors.    Skweyiya was outlining the ANC's attempts to train a corps  of  civil servants to assume key posts in a post-election  administration. He said about 100 civil servants had already  been trained in the UK, US and Canada, and that the ANC was  engaged in several public administration-related training  programmes. Potential civil servants were also being hosted in  southern African states.    The ANC had also begun training a parliamentary unit that  would advise Cabinet Ministers and the president. The unit's  members would study the functioning of federal parliaments in  the US, Canada and Germany. Methods of constitutional  arbitration in federal states were also being studied.    Skweyiya said the ANC was collating curricula vitae of  people  it intended sending for specialised training and had thrown its  net as wide as possible to include people who did not  necessarily support the ANC.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Reliance Group puts life operations up for sale RELIANCE Group, the quoted insurance company which is controlled and headed by Mr Saul Steinberg, revealed yesterday that it is currently trying to sell its life insurance operations in an attempt to bolster its capital base. The company added that negotiations have already produced two potential buyers - the first of which offered to pay approximately Dollars 525m. However, according to Reliance, it was not possible to agree terms with this potential purchaser, and negotiations with the second bidder - at a higher price - commenced. The first potential buyer is now suing. Reliance maintains that the litigation is 'without merit'. As a result of the likely sale of the United Pacific Life Insurance subsidiary, Reliance said that it expects to take a fourth quarter charge and to report a loss for that period. Given the ongoing negotiations, Reliance will also postpone reporting 1992 results until no later than April 15.</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OREGON;  </P> <P> RACIST DOCTRINE TIED TO BEATING SUSPECTS  </P> <P> Allen David Mazzella, a California white supremacist, told a jury how he passed  on the violent racist teachings of Tom Metzger to three Portland, Ore.,  skinheads hours before they beat and killed Mulugeta Seraw, a 27-year-old  Ethiopian student. Mazzella, 21, testified on behalf of the victim's family,  who are suing Metzger, 52, of Fallbrook, Calif., and his son, John, 22, for $10  million, contending the leaders of the White Aryan Resistance and its Aryan  Youth Movement sent Mazzella and two other white supremacists to Portland in  1988 to recruit new members and teach a doctrine of hate and violence against  blacks and Jews.  </P></p>

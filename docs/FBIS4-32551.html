			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Wiadomosci" newscast; relayed by Warsaw TV </F> Polonia Network in Polish]    [Text] [Announcer Pienkowska] Deputy Finance Minister  Henryk Chmielak has presented his resignation to Prime Minister  Pawlak. As he said, he has received a number of offers from the  private financial sector and now wishes to work there.    [Unidentified correspondent] For three months after the  dismissal of Marek Borowski, Henryk Chmielak directed the  Finance Ministry until the appointment of Grzegorz Kolodko to  the post of finance minister.    [Begin Chmielak recording] I have received a number of very  interesting offers from the commercial financial sector, very  interesting in the professional sense, and I have applied to  Prime Minister Pawlak and Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko in  writing with a request for the opportunity to take advantage of  these offers. [end recording]    [Correspondent] The Government Press Office was not capable  of giving a reply to the question of whether and when the  resignation might be accepted. Journalists were only told that  Henryk Chmielak and Wojciech Misiag, a second deputy finance  minister, are continuing to work on the Strategy for Poland  program presented by Grzegorz Kolodko, the present finance  minister.    Unofficially, there is also talk that Wojciech Misiag will  leave the Finance Ministry, although not at his own request.  Prime Minister Pawlak is to give him his dismissal notice on  Monday [27 June]. We did not succeed in gaining confirmation of  this news at the Office of the Council of Ministers. Wojciech  Misiag himself did not wish to discuss this with the press. He  invited them for Monday. Wojciech Misiag was appointed to the  post of deputy finance minister by Deputy Prime Minister Leszek  Balcerowicz in the fall of 1989. For four years, he was  responsible for the preparation of successive state budgets.</p>

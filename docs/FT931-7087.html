			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Accountancy co-operation THE UK's six principal professional accountancy bodies are canvassing their members' views on increased co-operation which could lead to a series of mergers.

The work is being commissioned by the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, which represents the six existing main professional bodies.</p>

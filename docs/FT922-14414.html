			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Letter: Rock and role model Sir, Memory plays curious tricks, but as I heard Neil Kinnock repeatedly shouting 'Well all right' at Labour's Sheffield rally last week I felt the years roll back and, sure enough, there it is on the Rolling Stones' 1970 live recording 'Get Yer Ya Yas Out', just before 'Honky Tonk Woman'; Mick Jagger as political role model. Who knows, perhaps on Friday morning we can expect the next instalment from Mr Kinnock, as taken from the introduction to 'Carol' on the same record: 'I think I've bust a button on my trousers, hope they don't fall down. Ya don't want my trousers to fall down, do ya?' John Murray, 9 Cambridge Street, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, TN2 4SJ</p>

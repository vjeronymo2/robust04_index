			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement signed by His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk </F> Varaman"; dated 19 June -- read by announcer]    [Text] Once again, I would like to solemnly stress that:    1. I have no inclination nor desire to head the Cambodian  Government.    2. I respect and will continue to respect the  Constitution of our Kingdom of Cambodia [KoC].    3. I condemned Lon Nol and Siri Matak for staging the  coup d'etat and abolished the Constitution of the KoC on 18  March 1970. I cannot stage a coup d'etat even through peaceful  means. This is because if I did so, it would mean that I am no  different from Lon Nol and Siri Matak.    [Dated] Beijing, 19 June 1994    [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk</p>

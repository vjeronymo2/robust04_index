			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOMELESS PROVE ELUSIVE TO S.D. CENSUS TAKERS  </P> <P> It was just after dawn, and Benjamin Leff, census taker for a day, trudged  through a narrow, swampy path in search of subjects for the nation's population  count.  </P> <P> Latino day laborers en route to prospective jobs in Northern San Diego County  periodically passed on his left and right, behind him and in front of him, but  few were close enough to allow the counter to veer from his soggy route and ask  his array of questions.  </P> <P> "You'd have to have an army of 100,000 people out here to count 'em all," a  frustrated Leff said as he came to a dead-end, his progress blocked by a boggy  channel leading from the Agua Hedionda Lagoon. "Anyway, it's an adventure."  </P> <P> Leff's difficulties were emblematic of those faced by about 250 census takers  -- "enumerators" -- assigned to count residents of the migrant camps of San  Diego County, one of the nation's most singular outposts of homelessness.  Later, officials acknowledged that a recount of the migrants might be necessary  because of the North County's "unique set of characteristics" and the inherent  difficulty of counting such a population, said Michael J. Weiler, assistant  regional census manager.  </P> <P> Apart from the migrant count, officials said that counting the homeless  proceeded smoothly throughout the San Diego area. Advocates for the homeless  have long argued that official methodology would probably result in an  undercount, and Weiler conceded that "the results may be on the conservative  side."  </P> <P> Detailed data will not be available until at least April, 1991. The homeless  counts on Tuesday and Wednesday kicked off the tally for the 1990 census.  </P> <P> The census, a massive undertaking, is a critical funding tool; allotments of  government monies to areas are often based on population. For every resident  not counted, it is estimated that about $200 is lost -- $150 in federal funds  and $50 in state money.  </P> <P> In San Diego and Imperial counties, officials positioned about 650 census  takers, including 314 in downtown San Diego and 250 in North County. More than  700 locations were predesignated as homeless sites, although homeless advocates  said that many spots were probably missed, including many isolated migrant  camps in Northern San Diego County and some canyon residences in Balboa Park.  </P> <P> The Census Bureau "just doesn't know where these folks are," said the Rev.  Rafael V. Martinez, a Presbyterian minister who works with migrant workers and  has been critical of official plans to count the day laborers.  </P> <P> Among the enumerators on duty was Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who praised the  process.  </P> <P> As in other cities, some San Diego shelters provided incentives such as free  meals, movies and soft drinks to attract homeless people and make it easier for  visiting census officials to count them. At the St. Vincent de Paul/Joan Kroc  Center downtown, the city's largest shelter, a "slumber party" drew 800 guests  Tuesday evening, double the shelter's normal capacity. Cots were placed in the  dining hall and chapel.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most difficult homeless people to count in San Diego are the  thousands of migrant laborers, mostly men from Mexico, who are often in the  shadow of suburban homes valued at $250,000 or more. They reside in a variety  of crude squatters' dwellings ranging from shacks fashioned from scrap wood and  plastic to bunker-like caves excavated from the dirt -- "spider holes," as they  are known.  </P> <P> Estimates of the number of such homeless migrants, many of them undocumented,  range from 5,000 to 30,000.  </P> <P> Census authorities in San Diego had pledged to do their utmost to count the  migrant population -- whether they are legal U.S. residents or not.  </P> <P> "We'll go wherever these migrants live," vowed Maureen R. Wanzie, the Census  Bureau's district office manager in Carlsbad, on the eve of the count. "We're  talking about canyons. We're talking about spider holes. We're talking about  temporary housing that may consist of just a blanket or a piece of cardboard."  </P> <P> But counting the migrants proved a daunting task. Finding them was a big part  of the problem, and many census takers did not speak Spanish.  </P> <P> "Sign language," one census taker explained when asked how he expected to  accomplish his goal without speaking Spanish. Census counters acknowledged that  they largely dispensed with in-depth questioning and relied on head counts and  brief conversations.  </P> <P> By dawn at 6 a.m. in a lifting fog, two elderly census counters who spoke  little Spanish wandered alone through a field along El Camino Real, the main  curbside hiring venue for migrant workers.  </P> <P> "You seen anyone yet?" asked Robert Nelson, winded after a mile walk, as he  climbed over a barbed-wire fence, narrowly avoiding snagging his white,  government-issue vest identifying him as a census taker.  </P> <P> "We haven't seen a thing," said Nelson, who clutched his census clipboard and  forms. "Not even a jack rabbit out there."  </P> <P> Ahead were two small migrant camps. "Census? I haven't seen anyone from the  census," said Juan Prado, a 22-year-old undocumented Mexican who was just  waking inside his wood-and-plastic lean-to wedged into a hillside dotted with  migrant outposts. "Maybe the census people will come by the packing house  later," Prado said, speaking of the flower-packing facility where he  occasionally finds work.  </P> <P> Down the road, hopeful day laborers were starting to gather at the Country  Store in Carlsbad, one of the favorite migrant waiting spots for roadside  labor. Also present early Wednesday were a number of census counters, one of  whom dutifully took information from a number of men standing in front of the  shop.  </P> <P> "Hey," another census taker said, interrupting her busy colleague, "all of  these guys have already been counted."  </P> <P> Most migrants appeared willing to chat with the census takers, despite their  fear of authorities. "I'll do whatever I can for the government of the United  States," offered Francisco Carvajal, a 42-year-old Mexican man who had just  been interviewed by census officials in a nearby shopping center. "They need to  know that we're here."  </P> <P> Down the road, four census takers began walking through a swampy path they  hoped would lead to a camp. The route quickly led into a thickly vegetated  quagmire, and no further progress could be made without risk of becoming  covered in the inky goo.  </P> <P> "The best you can do is count 'em as they come out," said a woman census taker  proceeding gingerly along the sodden trail.  </P> <P> "One problem," said Leff, who was following along the trail, " . . . is that no  one seems to know where these people are for sure. There's nothing you can look  at and say, 'It's here.' Right now, there doesn't seem to be anybody here."  </P></p>

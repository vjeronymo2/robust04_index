			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [CTK and "(r)"-signed report: "Astonishment at the </F> Statements of Minister Mock"]    [Excerpt] Prague/Vienna -- Ladislav Spacek, the  president's press spokesman, said the following in reply to a  question from LIDOVE NOVINY on Austrian Foreign Minister Alois  Mock's interpretation of a statement by V. Havel on the  expulsion of the Sudeten Germans: "If V. Havel condemns the  principle of collective guilt and the collective responsibility  of nations, this does not mean that he is placing a historically  equals sign between the ethnic cleansing in present-day  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the post-war expulsion of the Sudeten  Germans, with which the victorious powers expressed their  agreement and which was in response to the horrors of World War  II. It is astonishing that the Austrian foreign minister is  again returning to issues that had been resolved in December  1974 in the Czechoslovak-Austrian treaty on settling financial  and property-related legal issues. All the claims for  compensation from Austrian physical and legal persons and also  from the Austrian state for Czechoslovak indemnification and  confiscation measures from World War II were settled by this  treaty."

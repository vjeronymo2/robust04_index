			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Hungary set to take off this year EXPORT GROWTH of 8-10 per cent will lift the Hungarian economy out of recession in 1992, according to official forecasts announced yesterday, Nicholas Denton reports from Budapest. 'A marked increase in total exports is why we think this is the year of turn-around,' Mr Bela Kadar, minister of international economic relations, said yesterday. 'This will result in economic take-off, hopefully by Christmas.' Driving the improvement is a continuing boom in exports to the west. Hungary's association agreement with the EC is expected to cushion the knock-on effect from any German growth recession. Hungary expects the direct effect of easier access to EC markets alone to push up exports by Dollars 100m (Pounds 55.2m) to Dollars 200m a year. Increasing signs are that last year's collapse of the Soviet market has run its course. 'The real basis for optimism is that this year we cannot lose more than last,' said Mr Kadar, predicting a slight increase in exports to the east in 1992 from a low base. Hungary's deliveries to the developed world grew 31 per cent in 1991 over the previous year, pushing total hard currency earnings up to Dollars 10.2bn but this was negated by a fall of over 50 per cent in exports to the former Soviet Union. One factor behind the increase in Hungary's western market share has been a record inflow of foreign companies, improving the marketability of Hungarian goods. Foreign direct investment was Dollars 1.4bn (4 per cent of GDP) in 1992, raising the total to Dollars 2.8bn. That represented over half the Dollars 5bn total committed by western investors to eastern Europe.</p>

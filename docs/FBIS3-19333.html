			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["ky"-signed commentary: "Consultation Instead of </F> Confrontation"]    [Text] Former president Richard Nixon has been accused of  various things in the past, but not of being a foreign policy  amateur. During his recent private visit to Moscow, the  81-year-old proved once again he still has great knowledge of  world politics. At the end of his visit he came to the  conclusion that Russia will remain a great power whose interests  will, however, not always be identical with those of the United  States.    This realization may sound very simple, but it was far from  obvious over the past few weeks: The Ames espionage affair and  Moscow's latest diplomatic initiative in Bosnia and the Middle  East almost recreated the image of the aggressive Russian bear  as the United States' more or less natural opponent. It is,  therefore, all the more surprising -- and encouraging -- that  Secretary of State Warren Christopher has now come to the same  conclusion as Richard Nixon: Following his meeting with his  Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev, Christopher stated that  differences between Moscow and Washington are quite natural.  They just have to be solved as soon as they arise.    In Vladivostok, the Russians once again emphasized what is  important to them. They want to be consulted, not taken by  surprise by U.S. initiatives. This complaint contains the  threat of starting their own initiatives that have not been  agreed beforehand. This would mean a relapse into the Cold War.  As long as Russia emphasizes its interest in a constructive  partnership, it should be taken at its word.</p>

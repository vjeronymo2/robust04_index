			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Ratner quits retail group after shareholder pressure MR GERALD RATNER, the jeweller who became famous for applying the description 'crap' to one of his products, has quit the ailing retail group which bears his family name. He follows many other retail personalities who flourished in the 1980s consumer boom but have since been deposed, such as Sir Ralph Halpern of Burton and Mr George Davies of Next. In a prepared statement, Mr Ratner said: 'I am obviously saddened to be leaving a business of which I am so proud. However, the continuing negative press I have attracted leads me to believe that this decision is in the best interests of the group and the people working in it.' Mr Ratner is thought to have felt under pressure from the group's bankers and shareholders. At the annual meeting in September, shareholders called for his resignation. Mr Jim McAdam, Ratners' chairman, who will now take over Mr Ratner's role as head of the group's UK jewellery business, said Mr Ratner's departure was 'very much his own decision'. Mr Ratner will receive compensation of Pounds 375,000, equivalent to a year's salary. Although Mr Ratner's departure had been discussed internally for some time, it was only agreed yesterday. Ratners' fall from grace follows a familiar pattern of companies which expanded too aggressively, financed by borrowings, and failed to anticipate the recession. Its profits grew from almost nothing in 1984, when Mr Ratner took charge of the group from his father, to a peak of Pounds 130m in 1990. He expanded in the UK, acquiring chains such as H. Samuel and Ernest Jones, and into the US with the purchase of Sterling and Kays Jewellers. The group's stock market value peaked at Pounds 840m in June 1990, just before the Kays deal was agreed. From there the slide was rapid. Yesterday the shares closed at 18p, down 1p, valuing the company at Pounds 52.7m. News of his departure came after the market closed. Mr Ratner was credited with changing UK jewellery retailing from a staid business with customers making rare but expensive purchases to a fashion business. Ratners' extensive use of 9-carat gold and the development of devices such as hollow earrings, brought the prices into the range of everyday purchases. But Mr Ratner's fate was sealed by a remark to a meeting of the Institute of Directors in April 1991 that a sherry decanter with six glasses on a silver plated tray which sold in his shops at Pounds 4.95 was 'total crap'. The comment hit sales in the shops. In August this year, Ratners reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 122.3m for the year to February 1, compared with a profit of Pounds 112.1m the previous year. It announced a change in marketing strategy, a plan to close 330 shops, and said its bankers had agreed to extend its loans until June next year. Mr Ratner holds 790,000 Ratners shares, 0.3 per cent of the company. Cut price Midas, Page 24</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Letter: University/polytechnic statistics must be looked at more closely Sir, Michael Dixon's well-researched report ('A sad final blow for the polytechnics', October 7) would have been even better if his interpretation of the figures had been more detached. The recession has, of course, affected every sector, from nursery schools to universities. Polytechnics, it is true, fared marginally worse on the jobs market, but it would have been wiser to look more closely at the figures. When one analyses some of the contents of Mr Dixon's table, the following facts come to light. The number of 'old' university graduates rose by some 2 per cent in 1991 over 1990 whereas the number gaining polytechnic degrees rose by 14.9 per cent over the same one year period. When you study the next category - those entering regular jobs in the UK - one finds the proportions down: the universities by 4,150 graduates and the polytechnics by just 800. Finally, those who can expect an 'at best short-term UK job' again produces nothing more than a marginal difference, with both sectors worse off: universities by 2,016 (2.3 per cent) in the period studied and polytechnics by 2,704 (4 per cent). All this proves is perhaps that number-crunching and 'league tables' should always be avoided or treated with the care. It is a fruitless task, even a silly game, for it looks only at figures, not people. Statistics are devoid of soul. But Michael Dixon's concluding paragraph is absolutely correct (possibly because he has abandoned his numbers game and returned to reality): many employers, faced with two candidates, one from a traditional university and one from the old polytechnics, are stubbornly snobbish enough to go for the former, regardless of the piece of graduation paper proffered. This, as Mr Dixon rightly surmises, is likely to change now that all the polytechnics are universities in title as well as in fact.

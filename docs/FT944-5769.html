			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Council tax bills likely to rise after government cuts funding The government yesterday imposed the toughest financial settlement on local authorities since the 1970s, with a cash cut in the funding they will receive from central government and a projected rise in council tax bills of twice the rate of inflation. Councillors of all parties reacted angrily, predicting job losses, a reduction in services and larger school class sizes. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, announced that aggregate external finance for local authorities - from specific grants and business rates - will be reduced by 0.4 per cent in 1995-96, to Pounds 34.672bn. He told the Commons the settlement was 'tough' but said it was clear many authorities had 'considerable scope to increase their efficiency'. Environment Department officials said the move meant a shift in the tax burden from centrally raised taxation to the council tax. The government estimates that councils which meet its standard spending guidelines should raise bills for properties in the council tax band C - valued at between Pounds 52,000 and Pounds 68,000 - by about 4.6 per cent next year, from Pounds 467 to Pounds 491. Under the same measure, Band D (Pounds 68,000 to Pounds 88,000) bills would rise from Pounds 525 to Pounds 551. Councils predicted an average rise of 6 per cent. Strict 'capping' of council budgets by the government is intended to prevent excessive rises. Councils outside inner London will have their budgets cut if they spend more than the government's assessment for them, and if they raise spending by 0.5 per cent or more compared with this year. Inner London councils will be allowed a 2 per cent rise. There will also be a cut in the transitional relief paid to authorities which lost out after the council tax replaced the old community charge or poll tax. This will lead to additional increases varying from Pounds 67 a year to Pounds 137, according to which band the property is in, on top of the so-called standard spending council tax. In a joint statement, the three English local authority associations said: 'Councils will suffer a very difficult year, and the public - in particular the elderly, the infirm and children - face losing vital services because the government will not let local authorities spend enough to give their communities what they need.' Several Tory backbenchers also registered concern. Sir Peter Fry, MP for Wellingborough, protested that Northamptonshire would have a 'very disappointing' settlement for the second year running, requiring many teachers to be made redundant. Mrs Rita Taylor, a Tory district councillor for Bromsgrove and a member of the Association of District Councils' finance panel, said: 'Conservatives in local government are not a happy lot. The initial reaction of many will be despair.' Councils stretched, Page 8</p>

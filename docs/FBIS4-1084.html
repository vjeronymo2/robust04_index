			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] An important step was taken today at the Lusaka  talks between the government and the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. The two delegations  reached agreement on the general principles of the electoral  process. The document was signed today by the government and  UNITA, under the auspices of the mediator and in the presence of  the observers.    The general principles on the completion of the electoral  process include four points -- namely, reinstatement of state  administration throughout Angola, guarantees of security,  freedom of expression for citizens, and resumption of air and  ground communications throughout Angola to ensure the free  movement of people and goods. The United Nations will be  responsible for monitoring, verifying, and declaring whether the  conditions have been created to hold the second round of  presidential elections, of which the candidates are Jose Eduardo  dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi.    Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in Angola,  invited Angolan newsmen to attend the signing ceremony.    Tomorrow the delegations will begin discussing the specific  principles on the electoral process. The government and the  UNITA negotiating teams have already received the respective  document.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 7  June.    The Agriculture and Livestock Marketing Institute has  announced that it will buy the entire rice crop of 45,000 tons  in Ariari, Meta Department, where the Guillermo Leon Valencia  Bridge collapsed, leaving the area cut off from the rest of the  nation. It is possible that the government might also purchase  the corn crop. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Canal A  Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 31 May 94)    The National Administrative Department of Statistics [DANE]  has reported that inflation reached 1.53 percent in May, adding  that for the first five months of the year, overall inflation is  running at 13.65 percent. DANE statistics indicate that the May  inflation rate was driven higher in part by rent increases.  Pasto was the most expensive city, while Monteria was the least  expensive in the same month.

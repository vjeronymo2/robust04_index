(Granite State), filed a petition with the Commission for a limited waiver of Section 21.1(a) of the General Terms and Conditions of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, to extend to December 1, 1994, the period to direct bill and flow through to its former sales customers out-of-period purchase gas costs for which Granite State expects to be billed by upstream suppliers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Granite State states that it is a non-major downstream pipeline and that it commenced restructured operations on November 1, 1993. It is further stated that Section 21.1(a) of the General Terms and Conditions of its tariff provided for nine months after the termination of its purchase gas cost adjustment procedures to recover from its former sales customers out-of-period purchase gas costs. Granite State states that its purchased gas cost adjustment procedures terminated with the effectiveness of its restructuring tariff on November 1, 1993, and the nine month-period for the recovery of out-of-period gas costs expired July 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to Granite State, it purchased substantial quantities of gas for its system supply in the months of September and October 1993, which were delivered by Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) after Tennessee commenced restructured operations on September 1, 1993. It is further stated that Tennessee experienced difficulties with its nomination and scheduling procedures during the early months of its restructured operations and has recently developed corrective information for its cash-out procedures for the months of September and October, 1993. Granite State indicates that it expects in the near future to be directly billed by Tennessee for out-of-period gas costs related to September and October, 1993 gas purchase activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, Granite State states that it expects that Tennessee's out-of-period billings will be passed through to CNG Transmission Corporation and National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation, and then by these two pipelines to Algonquin Gas Transmission Company (Algonquin) and, in turn, by Algonquin to Granite State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its petition, Granite State requests an extension to December 1, 1994, during which it can flow through to its former customers the out-of-period billings for gas costs for which it will be directly billed by Tennessee, and the indirect billings passed through by other upstream pipelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Granite State states that copies of its Petition have been served on its customers, Bay State Gas Company and Northern Utilities, Inc., and on the regulatory commissions of the States of Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426 in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214).

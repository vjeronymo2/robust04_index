			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- The Japanese Government and  the ruling coalition parties agreed early Friday not to cut the  government purchase price for wheat in fiscal 1994, government  sources said.    The government purchase price, or producers' price, will  stay  unchanged for the third consecutive year despite the  government's desire to cut the price. Mutsuki Kato, minister of  agriculture, forestry and fisheries, will refer the agreement to  the rice price council at a meeting to be held later in the day,  the sources said.    The government had wanted to narrow the price gap between  Japan and other countries. The price of domestic wheat is said  five times higher than the price of imported grains. But the  coalition parties, which were backed by wheat producers opposed  to the price cut, claimed a cut would weaken production capacity.    The wheat price was cut for six years in a row from 1986.  The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Social Democratic Party  (SDP) were also opposed to the price cut for fiscal 1994. The  council will apparently decide the wheat price on the advice of  the ministry.</p>

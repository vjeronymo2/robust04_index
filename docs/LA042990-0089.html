			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIND MONEY FOR SHORTSTOP JAIL PROJECT  </P> <P> In the past 11 years, thousands of "pre-delinquent" youths who have had a minor  brush with the law in Orange County have been sent by judges and others to  Shortstop, a privately funded program. Youngsters briefly get locked up in a  holding cell and are told what they can expect if they lead a life of crime. At  one point, several young people -- some in shackles -- are brought from  Juvenile Hall or the California Youth Authority to tell their contemporaries  what it's like behind bars. The two-part program gets parents involved by  teaching them the signs of drug use, gang membership or other law-breaking.  They also participate in homework aimed at getting families to communicate.  Shortstop, like the baseball position after which it is named, is designed to  intercept a potentially damaging hit.  </P> <P> The program has earned high praise from all involved, including law  enforcement, district attorneys, public defenders, judges, parents and the  youths themselves. It is run by the Orange County Bar Foundation, which is  funded primarily by the Orange County Bar Assn. Last year, Shortstop received a  $22,000 grant from the CYA to develop a program for Latino youths and their  families who do not speak English. But it found that more was needed than  simply translating materials into Spanish. It has asked the county Board of  Supervisors for $40,000 in seed money to hire staff members to put the program  on its feet.  </P> <P> The County Justice System Advisory Groups, which make recommendations to the  board on how to spend $218,000 in state grant money, praised Shortstop  Programa, as it is called, but couldn't find money to pay for it. The Board of  Supervisors should override this recommendation and grant the money.  </P> <P> If you follow the money, you can see why it's worthwhile for government to pay  for attempts to direct pre-delinquent youths away from crime. It costs about  $150 to put a family through Shortshop; $35 is paid by the family and the rest  by the Bar Foundation. It costs more than $30,000 to keep a youth locked up for  a year -- all of it paid by taxpayers. And that is not to mention the hardship  on young people or their families.  </P> <P> Shortstop has proven itself effective and should be encouraged to expand into  the county's growing and gang-plagued Latino community. The Bar foundation is  asking for a one-year grant; after that it will find its own funding. If there  is any way for the Board of Supervisors to find the money without seriously  harming other important programs, it should. That check to Shortstop Programa  should have thank you written on it.  </P></p>

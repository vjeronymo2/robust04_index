			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Book Review: Crimes of capitalism BEAR HUNTING WITH THE POLITBURO By A. Craig Copetas Simon and Schuster, Pounds 15.99 Soviet capitalism - a coupling of two words that strikes us as incongruous - has in the first years of its more or less permitted existence been more revealing of the effects of communism than of the shape the market might take in the former USSR. The principal effect has been that most businesses - except those few which, with western assistance, can work at the very top end of the market (in consulting, accountancy, investment banking) - must operate for much of the time as criminals. Supplies must be liberated from the state, or diverted from their planned destinations. Officials must be bribed. The nature of production or trade must often be concealed. Add to that the tendencies to lie, cheat, overcharge, evade taxes and con customers natural to early commercial cultures, and add to that again a public largely hostile to trading and profit of any kind and long inured to cheap commodities, and you have the environment of a piranha fishtank. This environment is a field replete with the ghostly echoes of a million unfulfilled promises, unfilled contracts and ventures that got no further than the brainstorming stage. A. Craig Copetas has written the best book that I have seen on this wasteland, although it has a few of the annoying mannerisms of American 1960s-1970s journalism of the Village Voice/Rolling Stone school, and is over-emphatic, even dogmatic, in its dismissal of any possibility that Sovietised business people might raise a capitalist culture  -for all his experience, he cannot know that the current fumbling efforts will remain the rule. But the great thing about Bear Hunting with the Politburo is the vigorous intelligence of a reporter who has dug deep into Soviet commercial life. Copetas, working for different US magazines and free of the crippling constraints of daily or newsweekly deadlines, was able to see what being a 'co-operator' meant. In one chapter, among his best, he describes the attempt of an Azerbaijani farmer named Hajibau to build a co-operative farm in an environment controlled by an overlapping series of Party, family and most of all corrupt institutions, which brook no challenge from those seeking to use the frail new laws to start their own businesses. 'Seventy per cent of Azerbaijani co-ops are run by criminals who bribe the state to stay in business or limit production to maintain shortages,' explains Hajibau. 'The communists first came back to me about my chickens. Hajibau had more chickens than the state (farm). They did not like this. The criminals on the state farms sold the people eggs at five for one rouble; Hajibau sold them for 15 for one rouble. 'The communists said this was not good for them and told me to destroy my chickens. Hajibau said no. The communists said, give us more money. Hajibau said no. They came back and burned my chickens.' This story is a good antidote to perestroika - although, today, no one has to try very hard to convince a western audience that perestroika has not worked (this dulls its impact a little: Copetas's argument that the west should not delude itself about the real intentions of the Gorbachev regime assumes a level of gullibility now probably past). Much of the book is devoted to Vladimir Yakovlev, the founder of the Fact co-operative, and now the founding editor of Commersant, a successful weekly newspaper that prints in Russian and English. Yakovlev was Copetas's main guide through the co-operators' inferno. The picture he paints of Yakovlev, and of his and related ventures, is of a world where business ethics, even the most self-interested kind, do not exist. Copetas quotes an American, Lorrie Grimes, who had come to Moscow in 1988 to promote rock music and other ventures. She made a deal with Yakovlev, for which he demanded (and got) computers and other electronic equipment, and publicity in the US press. But he delivered almost nothing that he had agreed to. Says Grimes: 'I realised Yakovlev was incapable of taking responsibility for his mistakes and was only interested in getting computers and press for himself. He was not interested in doing business at all. He never thought anything through to the end. If it created an interview or a computer, that was enough.' Here is a description of a 'business' mentality which is not, in capitalist terms, rational. Modern capitalism demands both rational planning, codes of behaviour and service, and a public style which lays stress on reliability and honesty. Can this miasma of dirty dealing ever be clean? Can those who come out of Orthodox and communist traditions, both of them hostile to capitalism, develop a business ethic? There is no reason, on the face of it, why not: many proper and successful capitalist companies have criminal great grandfathers - it is a pity that they did not have reporters like Copetas to preserve their contemporary records. His is the first Soviet business narrative: it sets a high benchmark.</p>

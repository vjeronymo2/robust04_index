			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ATTORNEY ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL;  </P> <P> 3 CLIENTS CONTEND THEY WERE SWINDLED OUT OF $51,000  </P> <P> A Chatsworth personal injury lawyer, accused by the State Bar of embezzling at  least $125,000 from dozens of clients, pressed an accident victim to sign a  retainer agreement as the victim lay disabled with a brain concussion in a  hospital bed, the former client testified in Van Nuys Municipal Court.  </P> <P> "I was sick in the hospital; I didn't know what I was doing," Patrick Boyd said  at a preliminary hearing that concluded Thursday. "This gentleman came to see  me and I signed some papers. I did not know what I was signing. I did not read  it. I had a concussion."  </P> <P> Judge Aviva K. Bobb ordered attorney Richard F. Murkey to stand trial on three  felony counts of grand theft embezzlement and two felony counts of forgery for  allegedly swindling Boyd and two other clients out of $51,000 in insurance  settlements.  </P> <P> Murkey was also ordered to stand trial on two felony counts of practicing law  after his temporary suspension from the State Bar of California in August. The  State Bar is seeking Murkey's permanent disbarment on grounds that he kept at  least $125,000 in insurance money belonging to more than 29 clients and their  doctors.  </P> <P> Both Boyd and former client Louis Patrick testified that insurance companies  sent Boyd and Patrick's money to Murkey, who kept it.  </P> <P> Murkey settled Patrick's case for $20,000 for injuries sustained when Patrick  fell at a Venice shop. Patrick, who had $170,000 in medical bills, said he  never agreed to settle for less than his medical expenses and received no  money.  </P> <P> Boyd said Murkey settled his case for $12,000, but "he never personally  informed me that my case was settled. I never received a dime."  </P> <P> Bank records indicate that Murkey, who filed for ankruptcy earlier this month,  used the money for real estate investments, said Los Angeles Police Detective  Richard Mulligan.  </P> <P> Murkey forged his clients' signatures to deposit the checks, prosecutors said.  But defense attorney Sherwin C. Edelberg contended that both Boyd and Patrick  signed retainer agreements authorizing Murkey to sign any checks they received.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, State Bar officials declared that Murkey's retainer  agreement was unethical.  </P> <P> "If a client were to legitimately empower his attorney to have the power of  signature to endorse drafts and checks, then this should be clearly brought  home to the client," State Bar referee Diane L. Karpman wrote. Murkey is "not a  merchant engaging in cutthroat practices in the marketplace. He is an attorney  and therefore owes a duty of explanation, protection and safekeeping."  </P> <P> After the hearing, Bobb reduced Murkey's bail from $500,000 to $150,000.  Murkey, who has been in County Jail, will be arraigned in Van Nuys Superior  Court on Oct. 12.  </P></p>

Rasit stated  that the Turkish Cypriot side expects all relevant parties to  act in goodwill at the very least.    The foreign minister announced that the accusations leveled  by European Union Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek, who visited  south Cyprus, against the Turkish Cypriots with regard to the  confidence-building measures triggered amazement and regret in  the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.    In a statement to TAK [Turkish Cypriot News Agency], Rasit  remarked that the departure statement issued by Van Den Broek,  who did not feel the need to visit the Turkish Cypriot sector or  listen to the views of Turkish Cypriot officials, is highly  unfortunate on the part of those who claim they want to  contribute to a lasting and just solution in Cyprus.    Given the goodwill and positive attitude demonstrated by the  Turkish Cypriot side throughout the negotiating process, Rasit  said, such prejudiced statements issued after listening to the  views of only one side, at a time when efforts are being exerted  to eliminate the difficulties created by the new elements  introduced with the aim of satisfying Greek Cypriot  Administration leader Kliridhis and the Greek Cypriot side,  greatly damage the ongoing negotiating process.    In a statement yesterday, Van Den Broek charged that the  Turkish Cypriot side is pursuing an intransigent policy on the  implementation of the confidence-building measures.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 29 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank recently  approved a 350 million U.S. dollars loan for China in the  construction of the Yangzhou Thermal Power Plant while providing  a guarantee for the bank's extended Co-Financing Operations  Program (ECO), also for the plant project.    The ECO program agreement worth 120 million U.S. dollars was  signed here today between China's Ministry of Finance and more  than a dozen banks from six countries involved in the program.    This is the first financing for China under the World Bank's  ECO. The project is one of China's largest energy projects to  date, and the financing also represents the first syndicated  loan financing undertaken by the Ministry of Finance on the  international market.    Present at the signing ceremony were Chinese Premier Li  Peng,  Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli, Minister of Electricity Shi  Dazhen and senior Jiangsu provincial officials.    The Yangzhou Thermal Power Plant Project, about 100 km from  Nanjing, the Jiangsu provincial capital, includes the  construction of two 600-megawatt coal-fired generating units and  ancillary facilities as well as two 30-km high-voltage  transmitting lines.    The whole project involves a total investment of 1.3 billion  U.S. dollars, of which 470 million U.S. dollars are coming from  the World Bank and the ECO program. The remainder will come  from domestic sources.    The ECO financing consists of two parts: a 90 million U.S.  syndicated loan facility involving 12 banks from six countries  and a 30 million U.S. dollar-equivalent yen facility provided by  four Japanese life insurance companies. Both facilities carry a  15-year final maturity and a 5-year grace period, with all  principal repayment after 10 years fully guaranteed by the World  Bank.    An official from the finance ministry said the first  syndicated ECO program extended the loan to 15 years from the  earlier period of ten years. This, he noted, has opened a new  channel for China to use more overseas capital, including  financing from the World Bank.</p>

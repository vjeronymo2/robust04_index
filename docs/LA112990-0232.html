			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> CARBON CANYON FIRE CONTAINED  </P> <P> The arson-sparked brush fire that charred 80 acres of Carbon Canyon Regional  Park last night was fully contained this morning, but firefighters were being  kept on alert as Santa Ana winds began to kick up.  </P> <P> "There are still hot spots that we can't walk away from," Orange County Fire  Department Capt. Dan Young said this afternoon.  </P> <P> The blaze, which was started by an incendiary device, burned mostly grassland,  missing a grove of 130 California redwoods in the park and coming to within a  quarter of a mile of homes. No one was injured, and no property was destroyed.  </P> <P> Young said a plea for help in locating the arsonist seems to be working, with  fire and police investigators receiving numerous tips this morning.  </P> <P> "We've been getting lots of calls," Young said. "We've got several leads, and  they are good leads."  </P></p>

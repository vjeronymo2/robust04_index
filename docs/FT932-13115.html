			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Workers with a stake in success - Employee Share Schemes / How staff can promote their own company MORE THAN 1m people are taking part in profit-related pay schemes, according to the government. This week, it launched a booklet* publicising the various tax-efficient plans which encourage employees to help in promoting the financial health of their companies. Profit-related pay, or PRP, is just one of the schemes mentioned in the booklet. All-told, one fifth of the workforce is now covered by some kind of financial participation scheme. The main types are: Profit-related pay PRP schemes link part of an employee's earnings to the profitability of the company for which he works. If it is a registered scheme, PRP is tax-free up to a limit of 20 per cent of pay or Pounds 4,000, whichever is the lower. The costs incurred by a company in setting up such a scheme are tax-deductible. David Cohen, of City lawyer Paisner &amp; Co., says many recent schemes have asked employees to sacrifice part of their basic pay in order to qualify for the profit-related element. The government believes PRP will encourage flexibility in pay levels and improve the labour market in the long run. Profit-sharing schemes A trust is set up by a company to which it gives cash (often based on the group's profits); the money is tax-deductible for the firm. The trust uses it to buy shares which it allocates free to employees who, so long as they hold the shares for at least five years, will not have to pay income tax on the proceeds. But capital gains tax could be payable, based on the increase over the initial value of the shares. Discretionary share option schemes These tend to be known as executive schemes, since they can be offered to selected employees. Executives are allocated options at a fixed price and pay with their own money. If they are held for three years, profits are not liable to income tax. But CGT is payable, based on the difference between the option and sale prices. SAYE share option schemes Employees can put aside up to Pounds 250 a month for five or seven years. The sum saved is deposited with a bank, building society or with National Savings and earns tax-free interest (in the form of a terminal bonus). At the end of the period chosen, the employee can either take the cash or use it to buy shares in the company. The price set for the share purchase will be at a discount (normally 20 per cent) to the trading price at the start of the saving period. So, provided the company has not got into difficulty, there is a chance of a substantial profit on the shares. If not, the savings plan still provides a reasonable tax-free return, equivalent to 5.53 per cent over five and 5.87 per cent over seven years. Rates on options granted before April 1 are more attractive. Employee share ownership plans A company sets up a trust which acquires and distributes shares to existing employees. Payments by the company to the trust qualify for corporation tax relief. Cohen says these trusts are designed for longer-term ownership, but do not have the same tax advantages for employees as a profit-sharing trust (although the two can be used in tandem). The idea behind all these schemes is that, if workers have a stake in their employer, they will be motivated to work harder (and less likely to go on strike). As far as the employees are concerned, such schemes are normally paid on top of their basic salary - and any extra money (especially in a tax-free form) is welcome. The SAYE scheme, although it involves investing your own money, is regarded generally as a highly attractive investment provided you can maintain your holding for the minimum of five years. After the qualifying period is up, employees must decide whether to hold their shares or exchange them for cash. The danger is that if the employer goes bust, they could not only lose their job but the bulk of their savings as well. On the other hand, shares tend to outperform the building society in the long run. If you have savings elsewhere, and you are confident about your company's financial strength, then a shareholding could be a very profitable long-term investment. Shares acquired through an approved option scheme can be transferred directly into a single company Pep (without the normal bed and breakfasting costs) if the transfer is made within 90 days of the shares emerging from the scheme. Individuals can invest Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep (in addition to a Pounds 6,000 general Pep holding) in any tax year. Returns within a Pep are free of income and capital gains tax. *Sharing in Success: The Government's Employee Financial Participation Schemes.

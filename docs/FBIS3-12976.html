The Libyan envoy conveyed to the brother chairman a message  from his brother Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the  Libyan 1 September revolution. The message deals with the  brotherly and militant relations between the two countries, as  well as issues and developments of interest to the Arab nation.  The message also deals with the current developments in our  country and the efforts being exerted by brother Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi and other brothers in Libya to bring views closer  and to heal the rift in the Yemeni ranks in order to maintain  the march of unity, democracy, and stability in Yemen. The  message stresses the Libyan brothers' eagerness to support all  efforts and do whatever is possible to contain the current  political crisis in our country, to halt its regrettable  repercussions, and to stand by our people to surmount the  current challenges and maintain Yemeni unity, which is a major  pan-Arab gain and a model for realizing the Arab masses' dreams  of Arab unity.    During the meeting, the two sides reviewed their brotherly  bilateral relations, the developments of the situation in our  country in light of the efforts being exerted by the military  committee to halt the regrettable military developments, and the  efforts being exerted to begin implementation of the accord  document. Those efforts are designed to end the crisis and  enable the state's constitutional institutions to resume their  responsibilities so that they can move collectively to implement  the contents of the document in a manner that ensures its  success, achieves the national aspirations for a modern Yemeni  state, and entrenches unity and democracy in our country.    During the meeting, the Presidential Council chairman  expressed thanks and appreciation for the efforts, the sincere  fraternal sentiments, and the outstanding pan-Arab eagerness of  his brother Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi and other brothers in  Libya to help their brothers in Yemen to maintain Yemeni unity.  He noted that the brothers in Libya had a pioneering and  positive role in enhancing the march of unity from the outset  and in supporting all the steps and efforts toward unity that  led to the establishment of the Republic of Yemeni and the  restoration of Yemeni unity on 22 May 1990. He indicated that  Yemeni unity is a pan-Arab accomplishment and an Arab enterprise  of interest to all advocates of unity and good in the Arab  homeland. He added that maintaining this unity is a pan-Arab as  well as a Yemeni responsibility. He emphasized that whatever  the challenges and difficulties, our Yemeni people will maintain  their unity in order to fulfill their aspirations for progress.    The Presidential Council chairman asked Col. Mustafa  al-Kharrubi to convey an oral message to his brother Col.  Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. He wished the fraternal Libyan people  continued prosperity.    The meeting was attended by brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi,  Yemeni deputy prime minister; Ahmad Ba-al-Khayl, Libyan under  secretary for foreign liaison and international cooperation; and  brother Sartawi Yusuf, charge d'affaires of the Libyan  brotherhood bureau in Sanaa.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Samuylov: "The Inter-Civilization </F> Approach--Russia Needs To Come Forward With a Counter Initiative  to the `Partnership for Peace'"]    [Text] At the present time  NATO is the only political and military structure which unites  the main components of Western civilization--North American and  Western European--into a single whole. One of the weighty  arguments of the Atlanticists, who advocate preservation of the  alliance under U.S. leadership in the postcommunist era, is the  need to preserve the West as a kind of unified whole.    The fact that, in the opinion of many American experts,  Turkey recently has been distancing itself from NATO and  claiming leadership in the Islamic world, confirms once again  the Western nature of this alliance. Many counties of Eastern  Europe and the Baltic are literally bursting to get into NATO  today, trying to return to the West--undoubtedly their ancient  historical, cultural, and geopolitical bosom--as quickly as  possible.    If we stand on the ground of historical objectivity, we must  recognize that, unlike many Eastern European countries, Russia  was never a part of the West. Even if we disregard the adoption  of Orthodoxy in the 10th Century, it is well-known that  approximately from the time of Peter the Great, that is roughly  from the first quarter of the 18th Century, Russia was one of  the Great European powers and an inseparable component in  maintaining the European balance of powers, but it did not  become part of Europe. Despite the significant Europeanization  of the ruling dynasty and dominant class, Russia was seen in  Europe as an alien, expansionist, and Asiatic power.    One of the primary reasons for this was the different  manners  of joint historical existence of the different peoples and  ethnic groups. Whereas in the European empires the dominant,  privileged nation stood out clearly, arrogantly classifying  subordinate peoples as inferiors, trying to assimilate them by  force and upholding imperial unity by force on the grounds that  this nation itself was the representative of the Christian  world, true civilization, and so on, and whereas in the later  period the monoethnic nation states of Europe were formed by  force and at the cost of great bloodshed and numerous wars among  them to establish "natural" borders, on the other hand the  formation of the Russian Empire differed fundamentally from this  European model.    The governing strata of the peoples who joined or were  conquered were not annihilated, destroyed, nor deprived of their  privileges; rather they were immediately taken into the ruling  classes in Russia. What was demanded of them above all was  devoted service to the empire. They and their peoples usually  kept their unique religious, ethnic, and cultural features.  Despite the periodic attempts of tsarist authorities at forced  russification, the Russians who colonized the vast spaces of  Eurasia did not become an imperial nation and did not act as the  master people in relation to the ethnic groups who were  conquered or annexed; assimilation was generally peaceful and  painless. That is exactly why many peoples who were threatened  with extinction as ethnic groups by more powerful neighbors  joined Russia voluntarily, even though their leaders today  prefer not to talk about this. It can be said without  exaggeration that this difference between Russia and the West is  a difference between civilizations.    In other words, the Western model of the attitude toward  different civilizations, ethnic groups, and cultures begins from  an ideology of Eurocentrism according to which the entire world  is a backward province of the West and must be civilized; this  justifies their assimilation and Westernization, by force in the  past and by other methods today, for their own good. In other  words, it takes for granted the establishment of a universal  pro-Western uniformity. The Russian model, by contrast, begins  from exactly the opposite idea, that preservation of the  diversity of spiritual worlds, ethnic groups, and cultures is  the natural form of their mutual existence. Put differently,  neither the Russian Empire nor the USSR was an empire in the  classical, European sense of this word.    One of the main reasons for the conflicts that have occurred  and may occur on the periphery of the former USSR is exactly the  fact that the leadership of a number of former Union republics,  measuring everything by Western standards, are trying to create  monoethnic nation states despite the artificiality of their  borders. And this does not work for them because the small,  separate ethnic groups and territories of these new states  prefer the Russian model, which guarantees preservation of their  unique ethnic and cultural features. In the European version  there is a high probability that they would be lost.    So whereas the West has reasons for a guarded attitude  toward  Russia because it is in fact a different civilization, the  Russians have just as good grounds for the same attitude toward  the West. After all, armed aggression from the West has come on  the Russian land more than once, bringing a multitude of  misfortunes, and it took great exertion of forces to defend our  national independence. The historical memory of a nation is a  reality which is formed by the centuries, and its action today  manifests itself in an extremely guarded attitude toward  possible enlargement of NATO and its drawing closer to Russia's  borders.    This is even more so when it appears that the West today,  while renouncing forceful methods, has not changed its  intentions regarding Russia. And they basically amount to the  same civilizing mission, to assimilation of Russia, spiritually,  ideologically, and culturally first of all, and later  politically and economically. Through the "Partnership for  Peace" program, the proposal of possible NATO membership, and on  the defense level.    If the West is able to get its way their will be a high  probability of gradual establishment of pro-Western uniformity  all across the planet, but before that there will be a global  standoff on a North-South line and in this case the non-European  peoples will naturally resist furiously. If Russia preserves and  consolidates itself as an independent civilization and a unique  political nation, then the natural form of human existence as a  great diversity of civilizations, ethnic groups, and cultures  will also be preserved.    Russia does not need to walk always on a Western leash; it  must come forward with a counter initiative which is linked to  possibly joining the "Partnership" program.    It can be proposed to NATO to form a joint, permanent  headquarters for conducting peacekeeping operations in Europe,  where an equal number of NATO and Russian officers would be  working, headed alternately by NATO and Russian generals, who  would be given special military units from both the Alliance  countries and from Russia. They would be rapidly deployed under  his command in the case of a crisis situation. This headquarters  should be subordinate not to NATO, but to the U.N. Security  Council, where Russian has a veto. The CSCE is still an  amorphous forum, not even an international organization, and so  it is not suitable for rapid response to a crisis. Such a  headquarters can act as a regional or European branch of the  U.N. military staff committee, which is permitted by the Charter  of this organization.    This version of Russia-NATO partnership would put an end to  the deeply-rooted historical distrust of Russians for Western  military activity, even under the U.N. flag, and the possible  engagement of mixed forces close to Russian borders would not  arouse fears. On the other hand, a serious step would be taken  in the direction of creating a multipolar, and therefore more  stable, postcommunist world order.    For their part, the United States and NATO would get a  weighty, truly peace-oriented, and not just Western but  all-European substantiation for extending the existence of the  bloc, which they have been trying so hard to find since the end  of the cold war.    It should also be stated that Russia does not intend to join  NATO, even if it joins the "Partnership" program. Such  membership is unacceptable for Russia because of its Eurasian  location and the possibility of serious complications of  relations, primarily with China.    As for the East Europeans, Russia has no power to stop their  return to the West, but it is possible to try to direct this  process into a course that is more acceptable. It can be  suggested that for a start they join the Western European  alliance, the EC defense structure, toward which Russia does not  have the negative attitude that it has toward NATO.</p>

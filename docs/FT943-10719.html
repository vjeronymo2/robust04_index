			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Crown Eyeglass shares improve on 25% advance Crown Eyeglass saw its shares jump 20p to 185p after the USM-quoted maker of spectacles and reading glasses reported profits up 25 per cent for the year to March 31. Turnover climbed 47 per cent to Pounds 5.51m and while some margin was sacrificed by way of special promotions, pre-tax profits reached a record Pounds 530,000 (Pounds 423,000). With tax returning to a more normal level, earnings per share rose 46 per cent to 22.4p (15.3p). Mr Joe Lee, chairman, cautioned however, that having regard to the competitive trading climate in Crown's sector, it was prudent to expect less dramatic growth this year than last. The recommended final dividend is 6.5p for a total of 9.5p (7p). Mr Lee said Crown intended to continue its development through an ongoing expansion programme, which would involve opening additional optical centres in the UK and Sweden. In the UK, four new optical centres opened in the second half bringing the total of new outlets for the year to seven. In Sweden, Crown's Direkt Optik offshoot had continued to expand and accounted for 24 per cent of group turnover for the year. Crown now had five Swedish optical centres and negotiations for three more were currently taking place. At the year end, group net assets stood at Pounds 1.49m, including cash of Pounds 460,000.</p>

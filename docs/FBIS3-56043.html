			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ivan Zhagel: "Dollar Has Increased in Cost by 42 </F> Rubles in One Go"]    [Text] The routine 12 January auctions at the Moscow  interbank currency exchange reflected a drastic destabilization  in the situation on the currency market. The ruble exchange  rate fell to a record low and was 1,335 rubles [R] per a U.S.  dollar, while at the previous auctions the rate was R1,293 per  dollar.    Analyzing the reasons for such a drastic surge in the  exchange rate, A. Zakharov, general director of the Moscow  currency exchange, noted that one of the main reasons for the  increased demand for dollars is the ban on currency trade  introduced at the start of the year. In this connection trade  organizations buying food and goods abroad have been obliged to  start converting their ruble profit through the exchange. And  so far market mechanisms and the efforts of the Central Bank are  unable to neutralize and even out the increased demand or  currency.    In addition, in A. Zakharov's opinion, the uncertainty of  the  political situation and the lack of clarity as to what economic  program the Russian Government will implement are also having an  effect. Incidentally, it is worth recalling here that the  previous drastic decline in the ruble exchange rate was in  September last year, that is when the Russian president's edict  on the dissolution of parliament. So that political instability  remains a very important factor determining the state of the  national currency.    Finally, we cannot discount either the fact that in  accordance with the president's edict "on financing state  expenditure from the Russian Federation republican budget in the  first quarter of 1994" money has begun to enter all spheres of  the economy. And since control over its passage and expenditure  remains at a low level, a considerable proportion of these  financial resources is starting to surface at the exchange,  putting adverse pressure on the ruble exchange rate.</p>

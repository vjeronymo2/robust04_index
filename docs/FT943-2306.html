			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television BBC2 presents an 'Education Special' called Simple Minds based on recent Harvard University research which shows that much science teaching is hopelessly misconceived. Children, as we should all know, having been children, do not have empty 'simple minds' into which logical concepts can be poured; they have their own ideas about the world around them and how it works, ideas that are often at odds with scientific explanations (7.20 BBC2). Cookery programmes are old hat. Now you have to do 'lifestyle' or 'culture' series, which means lots of travel and folksy wisdom, and precious few recipes. In the first of Raymond's Blanc Mange we are told that Martin Jarvis plays Brillat-Savarin. Oh dear (8.30 BBC2). In Trial And Error David Jessel suggests that Sheila Bowler is serving a life sentence for the murder ofher aunt because her unemotional manner convinced police of her guilt. He maintains that her alleged motive would have been rejected by any crime fiction writer as being on the thin side (9.00 C4). C4 begins 704 Hauser Street, a latterday 'All In The Family' (11.50).</p>

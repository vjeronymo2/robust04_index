			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S&amp;L BAILOUT PLAN;  </P> <P> BUSH SAID TO BE CONSIDERING HIGHER FEES FOR BANKS, THRIFTS  </P> <P> Bush Administration is leaning toward charging U.S. banks and savings and loans  higher fees to pay for the cleanup of the thrift industry after its suggestion  of having depositors pay user fees was shot down by Congress last week, banking  sources said Monday.  </P> <P> "It appears they have moved off the user fee on deposits toward increasing the  assessment on depository institutions," said Kenneth Guenther of the  Independent Bankers Assn. of America.  </P> <P> "What started out as a user fee on depositors now looks like a hike in deposit  insurance premiums," added Fritz Elmendorf of the Consumer Bankers Assn.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration invited controversy its first week in office with its  idea to charge bank and thrift customers a fee of 25 to 30 cents for every $100  of deposits. The funds would go to rescue the nation's ailing thrift industry.  </P> <P> The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures deposits at member  thrifts for up to $100,000, faces billions of dollars in liabilities because of  losses at federally insured thrifts.  </P> <P> The Treasury Department has been considering higher premiums for deposit  insurance and is undecided whether banks or customers should pay, a department  spokesman said.  </P> <P> But after severe criticism from members of Congress, President Bush now wants  to narrow the size of the group that will pay to clean up the nation's thrift  crisis, said the IBAA's Guenther.  </P> <P> "They are still rejecting the broadest group of all by saying they will not  take the money out of general revenues," Guenther said.  </P> <P> Raising insurance premium fees on banks to pay for troubled thrifts will also  cause hundreds of profitable banks to go into the red, Guenther added.  </P> <P> Richard Breeden, a special assistant to Bush, told the American Banker trade  publication that the Administration wants to avoid having taxpayers cover the  cost of the savings and loan crisis. It would be easier to raise the premiums  on banks than to charge depositors a user fee, Breeden told the newspaper.  </P> <P> "If you raise premiums, you don't have to ask taxpayers to pay a nickel,"  Breeden said, adding that he thought federal deposit insurance was underpriced.  </P> <P> One plan being considered would have financial institutions pay the higher fee,  White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said in a television interview Sunday.  </P> <P> In addition, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said last week that the  25-cent user fee was one option Treasury was considering to restore FSLIC to  financial health.  </P> <P> But members of Congress criticized the idea, saying it violated Bush's pledge  of no new taxes and would also discourage savings.  </P> <P> Referring to higher premiums, the Treasury spokesman said: "An option within  the option is who would pay the fee, the banks or the depositors." No decisions  have been made.  </P> <P> Banks and thrifts now pay 0.083% of their deposits for federal deposit  insurance, while thrifts also pay a special assessment of 0.125%.  </P> <P> Separately, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it will require savings and  loans to spell out how they are managing exposure to interest rate risks. The  board, parent of FSLIC, said the new rules are contained in a bulletin from the  Office of Regulatory Activities.  </P></p>

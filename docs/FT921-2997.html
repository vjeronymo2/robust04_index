			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Rugby falls 16% on downturn in construction PRE-TAX PROFITS at the Rugby Group, which sells about a fifth of the UK's cement, tumbled by 16 per cent from Pounds 66.7m to Pounds 55.8m in 1991 as construction output fell sharply in the UK, US and Australia. Turnover fell almost 8 per cent, from Pounds 578m to Pounds 532.6m. Despite the profits fall the company proposed a maintained final dividend of 3.6p for an unchanged total of 6.45p. This is comfortably covered by earnings of 12.7p (14.9p). Profits from the UK cement division, which accounted for 37 per cent of trading profits, fell by a quarter from Pounds 25.7m to Pounds 19.1m. Mr Peter Carr, managing director, said that UK cement volume sales fell by almost 18 per cent, compared with about 16 per cent for the industry as whole. Rugby's main markets are in southern England which has been worst affected by the downturn in construction. Mr Carr said that UK cement sales were expected fall by a further 5 per cent this year. Profits from the UK joinery business, fell from Pounds 18m to Pounds 15.2m, despite benefits from new acquisitions. The division was hit both by falling sales and prices as UK residential and commercial property markets went into reverse. The UK steel reinforcing business suffered particularly badly with profits falling from Pounds 4.23m to just Pounds 509,000. Overseas profits also dipped sharply. The only respite was found in Australia where demand from the alumina industry pushed cement and lime profits up by a quarter to Pounds 9.68m. This was partially offset by a fall in Australian joinery profits from Pounds 1.29m to Pounds 203,000. US joinery profits fell from Pounds 342,000 to Pounds 265,000. Joinery profits from continental Europe fell by 6 per cent to Pounds 2.27m. Glass profits from continental Europe, however, rose by almost a third to Pounds 2.14m. COMMENT Forget about the profits, look at the strength of the balance sheet. Last year Rugby produced a positive cashflow of Pounds 18.6m leaving it with net cash at the end of the year of Pounds 23.8m. The oligopoly in the UK cement market, where there are only three large manufacturers, means that cement prices have not come under the same sorts of pressures as other building materials. Rugby, meanwhile, has put in some hard work reducing costs, cutting a further 400 jobs in the past 12 months. The cash flow benefits of cement making, however, is well known and is already in the share price. The group is in a position to spend up to Pounds 100m on acquisitions if it could find something worthwhile. Pre-tax profits slightly higher at Pounds 57m would put the group on a prospective p/e of 15. The shares are safe but look fully valued at this point in the cycle.</p>

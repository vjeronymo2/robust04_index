"He is  unreliable -- a regional leader destined to disappear as soon as  he tries to acquire a national dimension." The League? "It will  collapse in the elections." These words are worthy of a sworn  enemy, but they were actually spoken by [National Alliance (AN)  leader] Gianfranco Fini, the League's ally in the elections.  There is constant strife within the alignment clustered around  [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi. While Bossi, for his part,  attacked the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] from Milan,  vindicating the League's hegemony within the right-wing  alignment, the AN leader fired a volley against the Senator  [Bossi nickname] in an interview with MILANO FINANZA.    "Bossi has no concrete arguments," Fini said in the  interview. "He can shout when he stands there alone, claiming to  be a tough guy, but when it comes to moving on from the shouting  stage to the reasoning stage, he becomes unreliable and is not  recognized as a leader."    Fini was almost laughing at the League's political chances  in  the future: "Bossi had to join an alliance with Berlusconi  because he knew that Forza Italia would take half of the votes  away from him. The League could hold its ground," Fini added,  "as long as it presented itself as an absolute novelty.  However, the real novelty today is Forza Italia -- and, in the  north, the AN may also constitute a novelty." The AN leader  went on to give his grim forecasts of the League's electoral  results: "I am convinced that, in the proportional voting, the  League will be deserted by its supporters in favor of us and  Forza Italia."    However, Fini was predicting a difficult outcome for the  political situation after the elections: "I do not think that  an overwhelming victory of any of the contending forces is  likely. It could happen, of course, but I do not believe it  will. Instead, we risk ending up with a parliament in which  those with the least support, namely [Italian Popular Party  (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni,  will wield a much greater power -- the power of restraint."  This scenario reminded Fini of the situation in past years:  "It is the PSI's [Italian Socialist Party] old power scheme,  typical of a proportional voting system. It is also the best  way to set off on the wrong foot, but unfortunately this is  exactly what may happen."    Finally, according to Fini, [President] Scalfaro will have  to  resign as soon as the elections are over: "The last president  of the First Republic cannot be the first of the Second  Republic, and this is so irrespective of the illegal funding and  the Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic Security Service] affair."</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Personal View: Opting out from the welfare state The welfare state is in trouble, in the UK as elsewhere. As the public cost of pensions, education and health inexorably outpaces tax receipts, the government is finding it increasingly difficult to honour its commitments to the elderly, the young, and the ill. And in spite of the rise in welfare spending, the disparity between rich and poor has widened over the past decade. Under the current system of universal benefits large amounts are spent on people who are already well off. It is widely believed that the only alternative is to channel welfare state services to the poor through means tests, taxes on pensions, and the like. This would reduce poor people's incentive to become self-reliant and erode the middle class's political support for the welfare state. There is, however, another alternative, one that reduces the government's welfare state spending without making the poor or the affluent worse off. It is my welfare opt-out programme, which gives people the option of relinquishing their entitlements to certain publicly provided welfare state services in return for a rebate. The size of the rebate would depend on the cost of the relinquished entitlements. The average per capita cost would be computed for different groups of people, depending on their income, age, sex, marital status, and other determinants of welfare state demands. This rebate would take the form of a claim against the government amounting to 70 per cent of the cost of the relinquished entitlements, for each group of people. Where the cost accrues in the future (such as pensions for people currently of working age), the claim would take the form of government bonds with an average maturity commensurate with the costs; where the costs accrue at present (such as education for people with school-aged children), it would amount to an immediate tax reduction. Of course, the option would have to be tied to compulsory insurance against sickness, disability and old age. That would leave 30 per cent of the funds to cover the 'deadweight loss' arising because people consuming few services are more likely to choose the opt-out option. By specifying the characteristics of each opt-out group sufficiently narrowly, the deadweight loss could be reduced below 30 per cent of the available funds, leaving a surplus to improve the state-provided services. To get a rough indication of how this programme would work, observe that over the past decade, the government's national insurance spending (excluding unemployment benefits) was about 8.2 per cent of UK gross domestic product minus total central government revenue. Thus people who relinquished their entitlement to publicly provided retirement pensions and sickness and invalidity benefits would qualify for a rebate amounting to about 5.7 per cent of their income, on average. By the same calculation, people who gave up their National Health Service entitlement would get a 5.3 per cent income increase; and those not taking advantage of publicly provided education would receive a 4.6 per cent rise in income. Some say that allowing people to leave the welfare state system would turn it into a poverty programme. But this argument does not apply here. There would be no incentive for the affluent to opt out while the poor stay in. Those consuming few welfare state services would receive a small rebate and thus have a small incentive to opt out. And since the rebate is tied to the cost of the state-provided services those who opt out would have no incentive to vote for a run-down of the state sector. The welfare opt-out programme would give people the right incentive for choosing between public and private provision of welfare state services. The people who opt out would be the ones whose particular needs could be met more adequately through private providers. Given the enormous diversity of needs and the inevitable standardisation of publicly provided services, it is inevitable that such people should exist. So the public and private welfare state systems would exist side by side, each providing services in which they have a comparative advantage. The resulting competition would give both an incentive to become more efficient. Here is a way for the government to reduce its spending without hurting anyone. The reduction in distortional tax-and-transfer arrangements among middle class groups should gradually generate enough savings to the government - through taxes from new private welfare state providers - to permit improved state provision.

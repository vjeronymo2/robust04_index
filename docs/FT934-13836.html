			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Minister pressed on industry aid DEMANDS for government help for manufacturing were stepped up yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers' Federation. Both organisations called for new policies to encourage investment in industry, claiming such moves were vital if companies were to raise finance for expansion. The CBI said at a manufacturing seminar in Birmingham attended by Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, that the government should replace the Business Expansion Scheme with a new system to raise 'seedbed finance'. Mr Mark Radcliffe, CBI adviser on industry, said: 'The government is not doing enough in areas where it has unique responsibility. We want to see more help for new small and medium-size companies and enhanced credits for exporters.' His call was backed by Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation. He said the government must restructure tax allowances for investors. The minister, however, said industry did not want to see government intervention beyond the pursuit of a low inflation strategy for growth. London's economy was yesterday given a qualified seal of approval by the London Chamber of Commerce, which reported a slow improvement in business but continued job losses, Peter Norman writes. In the chamber's third quarter survey of member companies, both manufacturing and service sectors reported improved domestic activity with more businesses expecting profits to rise in the months ahead than at any time in the past 3 1/2 years. Exports weakened, however, particularly among manufacturing companies.</p>

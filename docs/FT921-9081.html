			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares weak as base rate hopes fade THE BANK of England's dis-couragement of optimism for early cuts in domestic interest rates left UK stocks to drift lower in thin trading yesterday. Investors were also cautious ahead of news from the opening day of the meeting of Opec ministers. Rumours of another Soviet coup, while not taken too seriously and soon denied, helped unsettle a market already lacking confidence. Turnover in UK equities remained depressingly low, although there was no lack of specific features to keep traders on the alert. Increasing signs of stakebuilding in Lonrho, the mining and industrial group, brought suggestions that Charter Consolidated might be the interested party. Lacklustre performances from Tokyo and from Wall Street, where the Dow managed a gain of a mere 2 points early in its new trading session, undermined London throughout the day, and helped prompt a minor sell-off towards the close. After rallying at first from a loss of 12 points on the Footsie scale, the market turned down again to finish at the day's lowest levels. The final read-ing put the FT-SE Index at 2,523.7 for a decline of 13.4. Once again, however, the more revealing picture of the market came from a Seaq volume total of only 448.1m shares; Tuesday's 432.7m shares reflected retail business of only Pounds 768.7m, still well below the Pounds 1bn benchmark of a financially healthy stock market session. Revived concern over the fortunes of the property sector, both in the UK and in Japan, helped to dampen investment confidence. P &amp; O suffered a renewed selling bout on new worries over its property interests and there were losses in most of the leading property stocks. The fall in trading volume is ascribed by market strategists to the prospect of a general election in the UK this spring, probably at the beginning of April. The equity market appears to have settled into a trading range which may not be challenged unless the outcome of the election becomes more clearly predictable. The lack of genuine investment interest left the market open to speculative excitement in a few selected areas, but traders admitted that the big investment institutions largely refused to play. Some building shares advanced, in spite of the discouragement of interest rate optimism, which received a further twist when similar hopes in Spain were also damped down. The international leaders showed a mixed pattern, drawing little solid benefit from the firmness of the US dollar, in which many of their profits are received. ICI stood out firmly but Wellcome, Glaxo and BAT Industries all gave ground. The stock market became more cautious at the close as some traders backed away in front of the announcement today of the December average earnings data for the UK. Pay proposals this week for some public sector workers, including teachers and the armed forces, have revived fears that wage inflation may continue to hinder recovery from the economic recession still bearing down on domestic industry. The market also faces statistics today on UK employment and mortgage repossessions, while tomorrow brings the domestic inflation numbers for January. Equity analysts expect inflation to have levelled out, or at best fallen only very slightly.</p>

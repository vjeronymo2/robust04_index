			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Leading Article: Latin America It is a long time since a senior US official has advised Latin American governments to do what they can to strengthen trade unions. And it is a far cry from the Reagan and Bush years when that same official argues that markets alone, without governments, cannot bring prosperity. Yet this was the message of a powerful speech by Mr Lawrence Summers, the US Treasury undersecretary, to the InterAmerican Development Bank last week. His words, if put into action, would have profound implications for Latin America and other developing regions. They also contain some risks. Regional development banks such as the IADB were, he said, 'as important to the new world order as the regional security organisations were to the old one', as the challenge of defeating communism had been replaced by that of sharing prosperity. The development banks certainly have much to recommend them in helping to address social problems that threaten regional prosperity. On its own, however, throwing money at social problems will not work. Nor is there any one blueprint for success in confronting them. And if it goes too far in emphasising government action on social issues, there is a danger that the US administration could help to reinforce rather than to remove obstacles to reform in Latin America. As Mr Summers himself implied, Latin American governments can now begin to address social challenges only because of their improved macroeconomic management and market-oriented reform programmes. The first priority for governments attempting to address unequal income distribution is to tackle inflation which daily widens the gap between rich and poor. As Brazil shows, governments cannot even think about social programmes while suffering four-digit annual inflation. The risk is that the emphasis on social issues will raise conflicts which play into the hands of those wishing to block further necessary reforms. Most Latin American countries already have strong labour laws (though they are unevenly applied) which inhibit competitiveness and benefit those with jobs at the expense of the unemployed. Public-sector trade unions continue to impede reform of bureaucracies, health and education systems. More ominously, the new American emphasis on social ideals has parallels with its stance on labour and environmental standards in trade negotiations. Developing countries may ask what lies behind these arguments. Is the US really worried about conditions of workers in Peru or is it looking to hobble competition from poorer countries? Some of these concerns can be alleviated by the multilateral approach described by Mr Summers. But Washington must take care not to impose its ideas on Latin America. Otherwise, its new drive for social justice in Latin America will be seen as a covert means of pursuing the perceived commercial interests of the US.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The meeting between Greek Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou and U.S. President Bill Clinton this evening at the  White House is anticipated with great interest. Our  correspondent in Washington Mirella Kalostipi reported that the  two leaders will discuss the situation in the Balkans, the  problem between Athens and Skopje, the Bosnian crisis, the  Cyprus issue, the tension in Greek-Turkish and Greek-Albanian  relations and also the further improvement of relations between  Greece and United States.    It should be noted that while addressing Prime Minister  Papandreou last night at the reception in his honor, the U.S.  President appeared particularly warm toward Greece and  Papandreou, and expressed the certainty that their talks would  be successful.</p>

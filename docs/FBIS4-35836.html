			<p>BFN     [Text] Kabul, June 4 (AFP) -- Iran's deputy foreign  minister, 'Ala'eddin Borujerdi, is to mediate while here between  rival groups within the Afghan Shiite faction Hezb-i-Wahdat,  party sources said Saturday.    A Foreign Ministry official here said Borujerdi arrived  Friday for a five-day visit that will include meetings with  Afghan leaders.    Borujerdi came amid an ongoing leadership dispute in Wahdat  between incumbent 'Ali Mazari and his challenger Akbar 'Azimi, a  former member of the party's central committee.    Sources in the Iranian-backed faction said the row, which  triggered fighting between supporters of the two men late last  month, had caused the indefinite postponement of plans to hold  party elections.    Wahdat is loosely linked with an alliance fighting to  overthrow Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani, which is made up  mainly of Prime Minister Golboddin Hematyar's Hezb-e-Eslami and  forces of the Uzbek warlord General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam.    Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have frequently urged the  warring Afghan factions to settle their differences to end the  five months of fighting that has left more than 2,500 dead and  at least 17,000 injured.    Borujerdi has held talks with Rabbani and sources said he  was  due to travel to Hekmatyar's nearby base at Charasiab late  Saturday to meet with the president's arch foe.    He may also meet in Kabul with former defence minister Ahmad  Shah Mas'ud, Rabbani's strongman, the sources said.    According to the Foreign Ministry official, Pakistani  Foreign  Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali was expected to visit Kabul in  the coming week.</p>

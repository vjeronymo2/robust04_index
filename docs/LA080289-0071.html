			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Drug czar William J. Bennett called on parents and churches to spearhead the  fight against drug addiction and urged tough punishments for casual drug users.  Bennett, in a taping of television's "Oprah Winfrey Show," said the public  cannot wait for the federal government to solve the drug problem. Bennett  called on corporations to fire drug-using employees and he chastised casual  drug users. "The yuppie taking drugs is part of an international conspiracy,"  Bennett said. "He helps keep drugs on the street. One thing that might cure him  is to lose that BMW fast." In urging more parental and church involvement,  Bennett said that although police are able to clear an area of drug dealers,  the community must step in and reclaim the streets.  </P></p>

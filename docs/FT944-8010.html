			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Arts: Primitivism given the nod - An overdue retrospective of Frank Dobson's sculpture Frank Dobson died in the summer of 1963 at the age of 77, closing a career which had brought him early critical success but ended in illness and comparative neglect. He was recognised as a distinguished artist up to a point - Royal Academician, sometime Professor of Sculpture at the Royal College and all that. And he had continued to work until his last few years. Indeed he was responsible for the Zodiacal clock which happily still animates the preserved facade of Bracken House, the old headquarters of the Financial Times, beside St Paul's. Even so, he was to be memorialised in that very British, faintly patronising way, as an artist whose talent had been unsustained, his promise unfulfilled. With the judgment of his obituary in The Times was a hint as to why this should be so: '. . . the intrinsic merit of his work . . . always commanding respect, even though it was to some extent overshadowed by, or at all events less spectacular than, that of some of his contemporaries.' Yes indeed, and it is by the nicest irony that this present exercise in critical rehabilitation - which is entirely welcome - should be undertaken under the aegis of the Henry Moore Foundation and its Institute for Sculpture at Leeds. For Dobson was of the generation of artists that immediately preceded that of Henry Moore, trained in the years before the Great War and declaring a first creative maturity in the first years of the peace, when the Moores, the Hepworths and the Skeapings were still at art school. His immediate sculptor peers were such artists as Jacob Epstein, Eric Gill and Gaudier-Brzeska, and like them and their pre-war contemporaries abroad - Kirchner, Matisse, Picasso, Modigliani - he was already well aware of the invigorating creative possibilities opened up by the example of primitive and ancient sculpture. The earliest piece in this show, a crouching figure carved in sandstone, arms crossed and head laid back flat upon the shoulders, dates from 1915, and openly declares the clear if generalised influence of pre-Columbian carving, a source which a dozen years later we find Henry Moore tacitly reserving to himself. It is easy to forget just how general the interest in the primitive was even by the turn of the century, with Gauguin away in the South Seas, and how strong its effects upon both painting and sculpture across Europe. It is equally easy to forget quite how effective Moore and his critical apologists, Herbert Read and Adrian Stokes, were in rewriting the critical history of British Sculpture, AM as it were, and PM. The reputations of Gill, Gaudier, and Epstein especially, have been reappraised and much restored in recent years. That of Dobson, who in the early 1920s was widely considered the best of them all, alone has continued to wither in neglect almost until now. There is no need for us to swing back to the adulatory excesses of Roger Fry, who considered Dobson's to be the first true and pure sculpture ever to be attempted in England, or Clive Bell, who thought he 'promised to become the best (sculptor) we have produced for centuries', to find such neglect, on the evidence of this beautiful exhibition, both gross and unfair. But we can also begin to understand quite why he fell so out of favour. He would always be safe enough for a public commission here, an offical exhibition abroad there, to be chosen for the aborted Venice Biennale of 1940, for example, or in 1951 to be given a commission for the Festival of Britain. But we can see now that even at his most popular and celebrated moment in the 1920s, he never was a truly avant-garde or experimental artist. That nod towards the primitive was no more than a nod, and his truer sympathies lay with that more classical strain in modern European sculpture represented by Maillol and Bourdelle. And why not? Dobson was ever intelligent and sensitive in his modernism, looking to such as Matisse and Picasso as it suited him but never self-consciously or artificially. And if the natural development of his work led him away from abstraction or an extreme formal distortion, it should never be a criticism of an artist to accuse him of not being avant-garde. But our age would seem to require it. Dobson was never the greatest of our sculptors, his example more useful for the probity of his craftsmanship than for any conceptual innovation. Do the reclining figures of the 1920s show a way that Moore would follow yet never admit? Do the combined heads and figures offer a link to Gaudier and Modigliani? Do the little bronzes look to Matisse and Degas? The arguments go round and round. It should be enough that in the works shown here, notably an exquisite torso of 1928, and the larger figure, 'Cornucopia' of 1927, in both of which the figure turns with the easiest of grace, he produced some of the most beautiful and accomplished carvings of his time.

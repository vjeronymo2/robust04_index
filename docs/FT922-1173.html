			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Giat turns in FFr400m deficit GIAT Industries, the French state-owned armaments maker, yesterday revealed a 1991 loss of FFr400m (Dollars 75.9m) and said it would have to shed 2,000 of its 17,000 jobs to adjust to reduced defence spending. The loss compares with a FFr600m deficit in 1990 and is the first time the formerly secretive Giat has published its results. It was transformed two years ago from a defence ministry agency into a semi-autonomous state-owned company. The defence industry faced 'severe rationalisation' and job losses would accelerate, said Mr Pierre Chiquet, chairman. He warned that the outlook for the group this year was more difficult than in 1991, but maintained that Giat would still hit its target of breaking even in 1993. The group, which manufactures the Leclerc battle tank, has been attempting to boost exports to soften the impact of the downturn. The French army is expected to buy 800 tanks. Giat's reduced losses were made on turnover up from FFr6.2bn to FFr11.3bn over the same period. However, the sales increase mostly reflects the first-time inclusion of FN Herstahl, the Belgian arms maker bought at the end of 1990, and Manurhin and Luchaire, two French ammunitions groups.</p>

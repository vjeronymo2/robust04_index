			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Five marginals still to declare result THE spotlight today will shift to the 33 seats where the votes are still to be counted, as all parties hope for a swing in their favour. However, only five of those seats look at all likely to change hands. The Conservatives and the Scottish National party both have hopes of winning Argyll and Bute from the Liberal Democrats - the result there is expected shortly after noon. Labour is aiming to capture Kensington from the Conservatives, while both Labour and the Conservatives are hopeful of their chances in Liberal-held Brecon and Radnor. Conservative-held Cornwall North is one of the Liberal Democrats' main targets while the Tories have a slim chance of snatching Truro from the Liberal Democrats. The seats to declare today are Easington (Lab); Wentworth (Lab,); Bridlington (Con); Ludlow (Con); Truro (Lib Dem); Argyll &amp; Bute (Lib Dem); Harborough (Con); Berwick-upon-Tweed (Lib Dem); Devon West &amp; Torridge (Con); Gainsborough &amp; Horncastle (Con); Richmond, N Yorks (Con); Rother Valley (Lab); Skipton &amp; Ripon (Con); Chelsea (Con); Daventry (Con); Dorset West (Con); Kensington (Con); Lewes (Con); Brecon &amp; Radnor (Lib Dem); Lagan Valley (Ulster Unionist); Antrim East (UU); Antrim South (UU); Boothferry (Con); Foyle (SDLP); Newry &amp; Armagh (SDLP); Ulster Mid (Democratic Unionist); Upper Bann (UU); Antrim North (DUP); Buckingham (Con); South Down (SDLP); Londonderry East (UU); Cornwall North (Con); Fermanagh &amp; South Tyrone (UU).</p>

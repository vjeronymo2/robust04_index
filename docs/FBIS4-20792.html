The Government has directed the  premier oil exploration and production agencies, the Oil and  Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and the Oil India Limited (OIL)  to step up output by 15 per cent annually over the next three  years. This is essential to meet the target of 47.08 million  tonnes of output by the terminal year of the Eighth Plan.    Unless production is raised to these levels, oil imports  will  have to be substantially increased to bridge the growing  demand-supply gap. Official sources say the higher production  will be required to meet domestic demand even though the  hydrocarbons sector is facing an acute resource crunch. As much  as 70 per cent of total Plan outlay has already been utilised,  with another three years remaining in the Eighth Plan.    In view of the constraints on resources, sources point out  there is no escape from liberalisation and restructuring of the  hydrocarbons sector in case the country is serious about  achieving the goal of self-sufficiency in oil production.  Several measures have already been taken to ensure greater flow  of resources like inviting foreign oil majors to participate in  the process of crude exploration and production of proven  oilfields. But evidently the terms and conditions have not  proved attractive enough as the response for exploration has not  been as enthusiastic as desired. On the other hand,  multinationals are keen to enter into projects for production  and processing of proven fields where contracts have recently  been awarded to Reliance Industries in collaboration with Enron  of the U.S. and Videocon in a tie up with Marubeni of Japan.  <H5>  Increase in Imports </H5>   Expressing concern over the low domestic crude output in  recent years which has already led to an increase in oil  imports, the Petroleum Ministry notes that production during  1992-93 was only 26.95 million tonnes. This is 5.3 per cent  lower than the target and nearly 21 per cent lower than the peak  of 34.09 million tonnes achieved in 1989-90. Even during the  current financial year, output is likely to be marginally lower  than in 1992-93, according to latest reports.    The decline in production over the last few years, however,  was due to unavoidable factors. One of the primary reasons was  the need to carry out rectification measures in the Bombay High  offshore fields, the most prolific oil producing area. The  rectification was necessary since the fields were "flogged" by  overproduction in the mid-eighties. As a result, the reservoir  was damaged leading to the present situation where numerous  wells have had to be closed down for workover operations.    Another factor affecting production has been the law and  order situation in Assam, which has effectively curbed output  from the northeastern region.    Though these are factors beyond the control of the ONGC or  OIL, there is no getting away from the fact that there has been  considerable slippage in achieving Plan targets. The Petroleum  Ministry and Planning Commission are believed to have directed  the two leading exploration and production agencies to take  remedial steps quickly to take corrective action so that  production targets are achieved.    The increase in availability will have to be achieved  despite  the shortage of resources. Latest official data shows that the  outlays for the first two years of the Eighth Plan have absorbed  as much as 70 per cent of the total allocation of Rs. 24,000  crore for the petroleum sector in the Plan period.    The ONGC which has lately been converted into a public  limited company is already in the process of raising funds by  disinvesting 20 per cent of its equity. The disinvestment  programme which is to be completed this year will be partially  in European capital markets and partly within the country. The  company is expected to become more effective in its prime role  of oil exploration in its new restructured incarnation as a  corporation instead of a commission.</p>

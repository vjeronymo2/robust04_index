			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Austria (6): Focus on EU entry terms - The agreement to join will open a new era Most of Austria's diplomatic energies in the past year have been directed at negotiating the terms of entry into the European Union. There was no doubting the immense satisfaction in government and business circles at the settlement reached early last month. However, the country has also remained active on other fronts, particularly concerning what it calls its neighbourhood, the countries of central and eastern Europe. It has also participated in the multilateral Middle East peace negotiations. And it has once again suffered an embarrassment with its state president. The agreement to join the EU, provided it is ratified by a national referendum in June, will open a new era in Austrian political and economic affairs. Mr Alois Mock, foreign minister, said after the conclusion of the negotiations that entry would enable Austria to regain its place at the heart of Europe after 40 years of forced neutrality. 'Thanks to its historical relations to the countries of central and eastern Europe, Austria will be able to make an important contribution to the policies of the union in this region,' Mr Mock said. The country's economic and social stability, its hard currency and highly-trained workforce should also contribute to the integration process, he said. As expected, the sticking points among the nearly 400 negotiating topics were agriculture and trans-Alpine transit, but Austria won satisfaction on both. A particularly aggressive sugar lobby won quotas beyond their expectations. 'At times, we thought we were in a sugar negotiation, not an accession treaty,' an Austrian diplomat says wryly. On transit, serendipity appeared in the final tense stages of the negotiations when on February 20 the Swiss voted to ban all transit lorries from their Alpine passes from 2002. EU negotiators realised they had no choice but to concede to Austria's demand that the existing bilateral treaty forcing gradual reductions in lorry emission over the next decade. The EU also magnanimously encouraged the European Investment Bank to help finance a Sch80bn rail tunnel through the Brenner pass to take the pressure off the motorway there. The upshot is that the immediate impacts on Austria of joining the EU look relatively modest. Manufacturing industries have already adjusted because of the activation of the European Economic Area (EEA) at the beginning of this year. Mrs Maria Schaumayer, president of the Austrian National Bank, has served notice that the Austrian schilling will remain tightly tied to the D-Mark. Mr Mock believes the biggest impact will be on farmers, whose lot will improve because of specially targeted national aid. He also looks forward to the breakdown of quasi monopolies in many consumer product sectors as competition from EU producers increases. Already, Bavarian milk producers are upsetting the Austrian retail milk market, reportedly taking up to 15 per cent of the market. Another area that will change is Mr Mock's own department from which some 800 bureaucrats are expected to be despatched to Brussels to work in the European Commission. Apart from its relations with the EU, Austria's main external preoccupation at the moment is with the nearby countries of central and eastern Europe. Austria has tried in many ways to support their economic and political reconstruction because, as Mr Mock puts it simply, 'Their stability is our stability.' He points out that Austria's trade with Slovenia is already greater than its trade with Russia, and the government continues to try to mobilise support in other western European countries for financing infrastructure developments in these countries. Austria has been particularly concerned about the former Yugoslavia and from 1990 to 1992 when it was in the UN Security Council, it made several proposals, such as the setting up of security zones and the sending of preventive peace forces, that were subsequently adopted. However, sensitive to the complexity of neighbourly feelings, it has refrained from sending its own peacekeeping troops to Bosnia. Instead, it has sent troops to other trouble spots such as Rwanda, so that other UN forces would be available to serve in Bosnia. The Middle East is another area of Austrian interest, following the long and sometimes controversial policy of the former chancellor Bruno Kreisky to promote ties with Arab countries. Dr Kreisky was the first western leader to invite Mr Yasser Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation leader, to Europe, and the PLO's first representation in the West was opened in Vienna. Last June, Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor, signalled a return to a more balanced policy, becoming the first Austrian chancellor to visit Israel. He provided the long-demanded formal apology for Austria's involvement in the Holocaust. 'We share moral responsibility because many Austrians welcomed the Anschluss, supported the Nazi regime and helped it to function,' Mr Vranitzky said in a speech to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. 'We admit to all that has happened in our history and to the deeds of all Austrians, be they good or bad. Just as we claim credit for our good deeds we must beg forgiveness for the evil ones, the forgiveness of those who survived and the forgiveness of the descendants of those who perished.' Austria's relations with Israel and many other countries were made awkward in the late 1980s because of the efforts by Mr Kurt Waldheim, its president, to cover up his record as an officer in the German army during the second world war. Mr Waldheim finally stepped down in mid-1992, making way for Mr Thomas Klestil, the polished former chief of the Austrian diplomatic service. Mr Klestil has worked hard to restore external links, making visits to several countries. But his value, too, came in doubt last winter when he admitted publicly that his marriage was in trouble because he was having an affair with an official in his office. He dithered for some time over how to handle the situation and ended up losing both his wife and his mistress.</p>

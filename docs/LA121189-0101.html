			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BUSEY PLEASES HELMET GROUP  </P> <P> Actor Gary Busey's apparent turnaround on the use of motorcycle helmets -- he  now advocates wearing them -- has delighted the Motorcycle Safety Foundation.  </P> <P> Busey, who suffered a severe head injury a year ago when his motorcycle struck  a curb in Culver City, had in the months following the accident insisted on his  right not to wear head protection while biking.  </P> <P> Last year, before the accident, Busey and others helped defeat a proposed state  law forcing motorcycle riders to wear helmets.  </P> <P> But during a Nov. 28 appearance on television's syndicated "Arsenio Hall Show,"  Busey told his host he had a change of heart.  </P> <P> "I have a whole new attitude about helmeting . . . my attitude now is becoming  helmet-conscious, to wear one," Busey said. The actor, who needed  rehabilitation to recover from his injury, said he had reflected on the  accident and on the safety of young riders.  </P> <P> "Next time you're doing 45 m.p.h., look at the curb and think about  slam-dancing with it once, and you'll start thinking about helmets," Busey said  on the show.  </P> <P> "Busey's comments on the 'Arsenio Hall Show' put to rest any doubts about his  position on helmet use," said Irvine-based Motorcycle Safety Foundation  President Alan Isley.  </P> <P> Busey didn't say if he would go as far as recommending a helmet law.  </P></p>

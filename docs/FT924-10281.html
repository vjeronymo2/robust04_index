			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Evidence implicates Bush in Irangate PRESIDENT George Bush knew about and personally supported the Reagan administration's covert arms-for-hostages dealings with Iran at a White House meeting in January 1986, according to fresh evidence presented by a grand jury in Washington yesterday. The evidence was in a new indictment of Mr Caspar Weinberger, the former US defence secretary who was charged yesterday with lying to Congress about the transactions. The evidence, based on a handwritten diary note by Mr Weinberger, contradicts Mr Bush's claim that he was 'out of the loop' on the Iran-Contra affair. Mr Bush's knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair, together with allegations that the Bush administration has covered up Washington's involvement in the arming and financing of Iraq, have both become issues in the election campaign. Democratic candidates Bill Clinton and Al Gore have both questioned whether Mr Bush has told the truth in both the Iran and Iraq affairs, with Mr Gore claiming the dimensions of the alleged cover-up are 'larger than Watergate'. According to the new indictment of Mr Weinberger, he attended a White House meeting held in the Oval Office on January 7, 1986 with then President Ronald Reagan; Vice-President Bush; Mr Schultz; Mr William Casey, then CIA director; Mr Edward Meese, then Attorney-General; and Mr John Poindexter, then National Security Adviser. According to yesterday's indictment, Mr Weinberger's notes from that meeting included the following: 'Met with President, Schultz, Poindexter, Bill Casey, Ed Meese in Oval Office. President decided to go with Israeli-Iranian offer to release our five hostages in return for sale of 4,000 TOWs (anti-tank missiles) to Iran by Israel. George Schultz and I opposed. Bill Casey, Ed Meese and VP favoured, as did Poindexter.' That meeting took place 10 days before Mr Reagan formally approved a covert plan for the arms-for-hostages transactions.</p>

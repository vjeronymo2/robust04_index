			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Poland targeted for satellite TV venture A new selection of subscription satellite television channels is to be established in Poland by autumn, through a joint venture which includes Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. The new company, MultiChoice Poland, which will supply the channels, is a joint venture between News Datacom, a News Corporation subsidiary, and Nethold, the parent company of European pay-TV operator FilmNet. Poland has been targeted because it is already the third largest satellite television market in Europe, after the UK and Germany. There are an estimated 1.5m satellite dish owners in Poland and 1m cable television households. This will be the first time a package of subscription channels will be legally available in Poland. Nethold has already set up MultiChoice subsidiaries or offices in several European countries, including the Benelux and Nordic regions, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. Channels already using the News Datacom subscription technology, VideoCrypt II, include FilmNet's Complete Movie Channel; The Discovery Channel, which concentrates on factual programmes; The Children's Channel; Country Music Television Europe; the Adult Channel; and QVC, the shopping channel.</p>

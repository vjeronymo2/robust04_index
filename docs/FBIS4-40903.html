			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Gorbunov: "Kolyma Unites"] </F>   [Text] Magadan -- A new political association has been  registered in Magadan Oblast. It is called "Civic Union of  Kolyma." It includes representatives of sundry political  parties and movements from the region which have addressed a  "statement" to northerners setting out the union's basic program  provisions.    Just the other day the second stage of elections to the  Oblast Duma and Magadan City Duma were held in the oblast. The  elections, in which 27 percent of the voters took part, were  successful. Former USSR Supreme Soviet Deputy Vladimir Yudin and  a number of his colleagues from the "Civic Union of Kolyma"  became Duma deputies. More than half the Duma members are heads  of rayon administrations and personnel from the oblast's state  structures. One of the main topics in the election program was  the preservation of the economic and social potential of one of  the principal northern regions.</p>

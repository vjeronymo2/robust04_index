			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / CD sales beat LPs by almost five to one COMPACT DISCS outsold long-playing records by almost five to one in the UK last year, according to provisional figures from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). In 1990 CDs outsold vinyl albums by two to one. Music companies have been reducing the number of titles available on vinyl and WH Smith, the retailer, announced earlier this year that it would stop selling LP records. Music companies and record stores say their decision to limit vinyl sales reflects a growing preference for CDs. Mr Rupert Perry, UK managing director of EMI Records, said: 'If the consumer was still interested in vinyl we would continue to put it out.' The number of CDs sold increased by 23.4 per cent to 62.8m last year, in spite of a 5.5 per cent fall in unit sales of recordings of all types. LP record sales fell 47.9 per cent to 12.9m. Cassette sales fell 11.1 per cent to 66.8m, only slightly ahead of CDs. Two years ago cassette sales were twice as high as those of CDs. The higher price of CDs meant that their wholesale value was 44.6 per cent higher than that of cassettes. The wholesale value of CDs last year - excluding distribution costs, retailer's margin and value added tax - was Pounds 345.5m, an increase of 26.4 per cent on 1990. The wholesale value of cassettes fell 2.9 per cent to Pounds 239m and the value of LPs fell 42.3 per cent to Pounds 46.4m.</p>

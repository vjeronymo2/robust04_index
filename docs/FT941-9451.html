			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Recorded music sales rise 13.5% Sales of recorded music grew 13.5 per cent last year to Pounds 785.7m, the British Phonographic Industry said yesterday. The strong growth ended a period of contraction. It came after a disappointing 1992 when sales dropped 2.4 per cent to Pounds 692.5m - the first fall since 1980. The BPI, which represents UK music companies, said compact disc sales continued to grow at the expense of vinyl records and cassettes. CD sales rose 31.7 per cent last year to 92.2m - the highest number of albums ever sold in any format. The previous record was for vinyl long-playing albums and was set in 1975 with 91.6m sales. The number of vinyl LPs sold last year fell 25.6 per cent to only 5m. This compares with 24.7m sold in 1990. The number of cassettes sold last year fell by 1.3 per cent to 55.7m. Sales of singles on cassette and CD grew last year. The number of CD singles sold increased by 43.2 per cent to 23.4m, while cassettes rose 18.8 per cent to 16.3m. By contrast, the number of seven-inch singles sold last year fell by 38.6 per cent to 7.9m. This compares with 28.9m sold in 1990. The price of music did not increase as quickly as unit sales, the BPI figures show. The value of CD album sales grew to Pounds 480m - an increase of 26.1 per cent, or 5.6 percentage points less than the rise in unit sales. The prices of CDs are being investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The price of both vinyl LPs and of cassettes fell more sharply than their unit sales. The value of LP sales fell by 31.8 per cent to Pounds 16.3m. The value of cassette sales declined by 1.4 per cent to Pounds 204.1m.</p>

Minister for Interior Maj-Gen (red) Nasirullah Khan Babar  told the National Assembly on Sunday that the government has  decided to remove all illegal immigrants who were allegedly  engaged in terrorist activities.    "We will not allow anyone to use our soil for carrying out  terrorist activities against any country," he maintained.    Mr Mehmood Khan Achakzai had raised the issue in the House  and demanded of the government to remove all illegal immigrants.    He was of the view that their (immigrants) activities were  creating tremendous problems for Pakistan.    Maulana Fazlur Rahman, Secretary-General of JUI(F)  [Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam], however defended them and said today  those who were being branded as terrorists were once declared  freedom fighters.    He said that the government was taking action against Arab  dissidents on the pressure of the U.S. and demanded not to take  any action against them.    But the Minister for Interior said there was no question of  being lenient on the question. In this regard, he particularly  mentioned Egypt and said Cairo was Pakistan's very good friend  and it has raised the issue of Egyptian dissidents who were  operating from Pakistan against Husni Mubarak's government.    "Our government believes that these illegal immigrants are  undesirable elements who could not be allowed to live on our  soil," the Minister said.    He said Afghan Jihad was over and nobody would now be  allowed  to live in Pakistan without having legal documents. "These  people should go to Afghanistan as we will not be offering them  any refuge."    He further said hundreds of illegal outsiders have already  been removed from the country and others would soon be expelled.</p>

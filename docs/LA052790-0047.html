			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW GOLD RUSH;  </P> <P> PANNING ENTHUSIASTS SEE BRIGHT PROSPECTS FOR HOBBY  </P> <P> When it comes to gold panning, you have your recreational speed panners and you  have your unvarnished, dirt-chewing prospectors.  </P> <P> Speed panners practice in the comfort of their backyards. Prospectors scrabble  through the wilderness, scuffing knuckles and fingernails in gravelly stream  beds.  </P> <P> "Us old miners who have been in the field a long time tend to pooh-pooh the  speed panners," says George Massie, president of the Gold Prospectors Assn. of  America.  </P> <P> But Jack Roberts, a retired mechanical engineer and confirmed suburbanite from  Claremont, is different. Not only is he the current world champion in speed  panning, he can also get down and dig through muddy gravel with the best of  them.  </P> <P> "They say a cowboy ain't a cowboy till you've seen him ride," says Massie.  "Well, I saw Roberts pan once, and he's one heck of a gold panner."  </P> <P> Roberts won the 28th World Championship Gold Panning contest last month in  Dahlonega, Ga., extracting eight gold nuggets from a panful of sand in 11.54  seconds.  </P> <P> Competitive panning is an oddball skill, with only a distant resemblance to  stream-side panning, most competitors acknowledge.  </P> <P> You're handed a pan brimming with fine sand, in which gold nuggets have been  secreted, explains Roberts, who has done his share of both back-yard panning  and prospecting. The idea is to plunge the pan into a barrel of water and,  using a distinctive swirling motion, quickly lose the sand while retaining the  nuggets.  </P> <P> "If you're lucky, you won't lose a nugget (into the barrel)," he says.  </P> <P> Roberts, 64, a brusque man with an ivory-colored mustache that, after 17 years'  growth, corkscrews across his cheeks, demonstrates the technique in his own  back yard.  </P> <P> "The gold should stay in the bottom, because it's seven times heavier than  sand," he says, pushing eight small gold nuggets into sand heaped in a pan.  </P> <P> He smoothes the surface, pauses like a runner waiting for the starter's gun,  and thrusts the pan into the barrel. Much of the sand forms a cloud in the  water. The rest, under pressure from Roberts' side-to-side motion, quickly  slides out of the pan, revealing the gold nuggets nestled at the bottom.  </P> <P> It's easy, he says. "You've got as much chance as anybody of becoming a  champion. It's 80% luck."  </P> <P> Roberts is one of a growing number of amateur panners and prospectors who,  equipped with pans, sluice boxes and shovels, head for the nation's streams and  forests on weekends to search for gold and silver. "It's the fastest-growing  hobby in America today," says Massie, whose Northern California-based  organization has almost doubled its membership in three years to 76,000.  </P> <P> California, site of the gold rush of 1849, is Mecca for weekend prospectors.  Though there is no reliable count of those who participate, the state  Department of Fish and Game expects to issue about 1,000 suction-dredging  permits this year to people struck with gold fever, at $27.50 apiece. About 900  permits were issued last year.  </P> <P> "The dredgers are only about 10% of the people (prospecting)," says Massie.  </P> <P> The East Fork of the San Gabriel River, in the Angeles National Forest, has  always been one of the most popular gathering spots for gold panners. U.S.  Forest Service officers say that on a busy weekend, there may be as many as 300  panners between Follows Camp and Cattle Canyon Bridge, single-mindedly  shoveling gravel and sticking their faces close to their pans to search for  telltale glints.  </P> <P> "At the moment, there are no restrictions," says Charles McDonald,  environmental coordinator for the Angeles National Forest. "Unless they're  bothering an archeological site or they're digging holes in an embankment that  could fall in on somebody, we don't bother them."  </P> <P> Roberts, who is a member of the Gold Panning Hall of Fame in Dahlonega, Ga.,  says he got the gold bug 23 years ago. A 29-year employee of Aerojet, he took  his family on a company camping trip to Arizona, where the gold panning  championship was being held.  </P> <P> "I got into the contest myself and I didn't win," he says. "But I saw I had a  chance to be a world champion. I told myself I'd do it in 10 years. It took me  eight."  </P> <P> Roberts' son, Don, the current world record holder in the sport (he did it in  7.55 seconds last year in Arizona), says his father, who was born in Iowa, was  drawn implacably into the active outdoor life in his adopted state.  </P> <P> "Being from back East -- at least, in our terms -- Dad came out here and, I  guess, decided to try all of the California type of things," says Don Roberts,  a Diamond Bar computer programmer. "He wanted to do everything that he imagined  that people did in California."  </P> <P> That included surfing, hiking, camping out and prospecting.  </P> <P> Not satisfied to sift sand, Jack Roberts got out into Mother Lode country,  dipped into streams and rivers in Idaho and Montana, haunted the East Fork. He  found some nuggets, accumulated little jars of gold dust.  </P> <P> "There's gold in every stream in California," Jack Roberts says. "Ninety  percent of it is still up there. There's always the hope you'll hit something  nice."  </P> <P> Mostly he had fun. "It's probably the best family sport there is," he says.  "Get a pan for five bucks and go out to any stream."  </P> <P> Fun? It's a lot more like hard work, demurs Don Roberts. "Once you've tried it  for a while, you find out why people don't become professional prospectors," he  says.  </P> <P> "Picture yourself kneeling or squatting for hours on end, with your feet higher  than your hands, with your hands stuck in freezing water. That'll give you an  idea of what it's really like."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the whole Roberts family has tried it. Jack Roberts' wife,  Beverly, has won a few trophies of her own, and his daughter-in-law, Stacey,  Don's wife, placed third in this year's championships. Only daughter Cathy, a  Hacienda Heights dental technician, has rejected the sport.  </P> <P> Jack Roberts drove up into San Gabriel Canyon the other day to his old East  Fork stomping grounds, which he hadn't visited in more than 10 years. He  carried a shovel and a gold pan -- a plastic device like a big pie pan with  little ridges cut into it -- down to the river bank and picked out a spot.  </P> <P> "The rocks form a natural riffle here," he said, digging into the stream bed  near a row of rocks that formed stepping stones across the stream. In other  words, the gravelly stuff rolling along the bottom of the stream tended to sort  itself out there.  </P> <P> Roberts filled a pan with dirt and stones, separated out the big stuff and  sloshed the rest around in the pan. "The chances of finding a nugget here  bigger than a quarter of an inch aren't very good," he said. "If you do, it'll  shine out at you like a flashlight."  </P> <P> Soon, there was an accumulation of fine black sand on one side of the pan.  Roberts pulled out a pocket magnifying glass. "Holy Moses, there's a bunch of  it in here," he said, squinting through the glass. "I may come up here again  this weekend."  </P> <P> There they were. Tiny specks -- "colors," Roberts called them -- glinting in  the black. Impressive when magnified 10 times, but nothing to get excited  about. "It'll take about 20,000 of those specks to make an ounce," Roberts  said. "That's why I just do recreational prospecting."  </P></p>

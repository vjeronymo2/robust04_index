			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Doboj, April 29 (TANJUG) -- Moslem forces continued  Friday strong artillery and infantry attacks on the Serb  settlements and positions of the army of the Bosnian Serb  republic (R.S.) in northern Bosnia -- around the towns of Doboj  and Teslic, the R.S. military sources set out. Artillery fire  on Teslic caused considerable material damage, a statement said.  It also noted that one member of a Moslem commando-terrorist  group was liquidated and several were wounded when this group  attempted to infiltrate the Serb territory around Teslic. All  the Moslem attacks were repelled, and the Moslem forces forced  to withdraw, the statement said.    The Serbs in Doboj have been for over a month under  sustained  Moslem fire and suffered high casualties among the civilian  population. As part of a general offensive on the Serb  territories launched in late March, the Moslems especially  stepped up combat activity against Doboj in an attempt to cut  the Serb corridor in northern Bosnia linking eastern and western  parts of the R.S.    The Moslem forces opened antiaircraft artillery and infantry  fire also on the positions of the R.S. army around Srbobran  (formerly Donji Vakuf) in central Bosnia, the statement said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Outgoing Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa on Tuesday urged coalition partners to halt an  intracoalition standoff over key policies and ideologies to  prevent the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from sweeping back to  power.    "It is critical to preserve the current overall combination  of coalition partners by reviving the memory of the initial  objective of the coalition," Hosokawa told Muneaki Samejima, the  deputy secretary general of his Japan New Party. However,  Hosokawa, who made a surprise resignation announcement on Friday  over his personal financial deals, hinted it is also crucial to  win over new defectors from the No. 1 opposition LDP saying, "it  is important to have more new forces defect to our side."    Hosokawa's coalition stripped the LDP of its 38-year lock on  power last August after dozens of LDP rebels splintered from the  scandal-tainted party and joined the anti-LDP alliance.    In the campaign period that led up to the 1993 general  election that brought him to power, Hosokawa made it clear that  his chief aim was to oust the LDP, thereby revamping the  political structure in place since 1955.    In a lecture meeting Tuesday afternoon in a Tokyo hotel,  Hosokawa said he does not want to see Japan's power structure  transformed back into the "1955 structure," where the LDP used  to monopolize power on the basis of its pro-business, pro-U.S.  economic and security policies.    He said, "although some politicians have proposed making  Japan a `normal country' or a `country that shines,' or proposed  getting social democrats and liberals together, these ideas are  a mere ideological carryover from the now-defunct 1955 structure  in which political debate was dominated by constitutional and  security issues."    He was apparently referring to phrases coined by Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa who warned  that the international community would not regard Japan as a  "normal country" unless it assumed greater responsibility in the  field of U.N. peacekeeping operations.    His reference to the phrase "a country that shines" revolved  around Sakigake [Harbinger] leader Takemura's slogan that Japan  would still receive respect from the international community  even if it avoided taking a greater part in U.N. peacekeeping  missions.    "Now that moves toward a reconfiguration of the political  community have gained momentum since my announcement of the  intention to step down, (the coalition) should unify themselves  into a new party with their emphasis placed on a transformation  of the nation's economic structure," he said.    However, Hosokawa sided with the position of Ozawa in  dealing  with Japan's defense policy in the face of North Korea's  suspected nuclear weapons development program. "We have to  conduct domestic preparations so that we can respond  appropriately to moves to be taken by the U.N. Security Council  and relevant countries," he said.    He called for speeding up the process of toughening the  relevant laws in advance in preparation for possible U.N.  adoption of a resolution slapping economic sanctions on North  Korea.    As for the burgeoning intracoalition hostilities over  policies and ideologies, Hosokawa cautioned that the coalition  might not be able to survive the current political turbulence  which he compared to a storm at sea.    "Now that we are running a revolutionary government, we will  not be able to survive the current storm unless we suspend the  `theological dispute,' saying I like this man or dislike that  person and taking issue with others' political tendencies or  tactics," he said.</p>

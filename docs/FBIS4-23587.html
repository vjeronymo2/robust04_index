			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 9 Jun (AFP) -- Members of the disbanded  Senate, most of whom are wanted by the police for opposing the  regime, today renounced their decision to surrender "en masse"  to the police. The disclosure was made to AFP this morning by  one of their spokesmen in Lagos.    One of the former senators, contacted by AFP on 7 June on  his  underground telephone, had indicated that a group of his  colleagues planned to surrender "within 48 hours" to the police  "for the security forces to do what they like with us, and the  earlier the better."    The spokesman, speaking in a telephone interview from his  hideout, pointed out that "we have reconsidered our decision. I  think we can be more effective outside rather than inside the  prison walls."    He further said that "it is perhaps silly to surrender so  easily and be imprisoned, whereas there are so many things that  we can deal with while we are free."    The former senators issued a communique yesterday in which  they described the regime as illegal, and called on it to take  all the necessary steps to proclaim Chief Moshood Abiola the  presumed winner of the 12 June 1993 presidential election,  which were annulled by the military government.    Last week the Nigerian security forces began a series of  arrests within the opposition ranks, which had called on General  Abacha to relinquish power and hand over the reins of office to  Moshood Abiola.    Two arrested persons, former Senate President Ameh Ebute and  one of his colleagues, Polycarp Nwite, were charged on 6 June  with "plotting and treason," an offense punishable by life  imprisonment.    Instead of surrendering in a group to the police, the  senators plan to file a legal suit to prevent the government  from "harassing" them, their spokesman stressed.</p>

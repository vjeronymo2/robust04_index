			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Daiwa Securities Co.  Chairman Sadakane Doi was unofficially appointed Wednesday [9  March] as the next chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers  Association, association officials said. The appointment of  Doi, 65, to the post will be officially determined on July 1 at  a meeting of directors.    Masaru Aratani, 69 , a former deputy president of the Tokyo  Stock Exchange, is currently chairman of the association.    This is the first time since the revelation of the series of  stock scandals in 1991 that an official from one of the "big  four" brokerage houses will head the securities industry  organization. Before the stock scandals involving loss  compensation by major brokerages to big customers were revealed,  the big four -- Nomura Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co.,  Yamaichi Securities Co. as well as Daiwa -- customarily took  turns to supply the association's chief.    The outcry against the malpractice forced the big four to  take a back seat, but the prolonged securities business slump  and intensifying competition led many smaller brokerages to call  for leadership from the big players, according to the officials.    The officials said the association will ask the Finance  Ministry to end its restriction on the association personnel,  set in the wake of the scandals. The ministry has advised the  association that its head should not double in the post and as  chief of his own company.</p>

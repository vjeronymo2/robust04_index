			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: GOOD WURST IS THE BEST OF MEATS  </P> <P> If you have read this column with any regularity throughout the years, you are  aware that I am something of a "nut" for sausage.  </P> <P> To my taste, a good wurst is the best of meats. My wife and I had dinner not  long ago at Campton Place, the lovely little hotel on Stockton Street in San  Francisco that the talented young chef Bradley Ogden made famous. Ogden is no  longer at Campton Place; but fortunately for those of us who live in Marin  County, he moved to Marin and opened his own place -- the Lark Creek Inn in  Larkspur. Campton Place was lucky to have Jan Birnbaum, another young and  talented chef, there to take over when Ogden left.  </P> <P> Not only did he work with Ogden for some time, Birnbaum spent four years with  Paul Prudhomme in New Orleans before heading off to New York to take over as  chef at the Quilted Giraffe. He then stopped off for a spell to cook at the  Rattlesnake Club in Denver before moving on to San Francisco. Campton Place is  fortunate.  </P> <P> One night after dinner, Birnbaum joined us for coffee. In almost no time, after  "How's Brad doing?" and "Have you heard from Paul?" the conversation turned to  sausage -- Birnbaum is a sausage "nut" too. "I've got a couple new ones that I  think you'll like. I'll fax you the recipes." He did, and I did, and I think  you will like them also.  </P> <P> CHICKEN-FENNEL SAUSAGE  </P> <P> 3 pounds chicken thigh meat  </P> <P> 3 pounds pork butt  </P> <P> 5 cloves garlic, chopped  </P> <P> 1/4 cup fennel seeds  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons paprika  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons white pepper  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon black pepper  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 bunch Italian parsley, chopped  </P> <P> 1 bunch fresh sage, chopped  </P> <P> 1/3 cup Pernod  </P> <P> Hog casings  </P> <P> Cut chicken and pork into strips appropriate for grinding.

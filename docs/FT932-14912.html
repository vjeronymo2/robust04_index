			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Lloyd's faces new criticism on regulation MANAGERS of four lossmaking Gooda Walker syndicates artificially inflated their profits in the 1980s through the improper use of specialised reinsurance policies, a detailed report alleges. A 200-page report prepared by GW Run Off, which is now handling the affairs of the syndicates, was passed to the Serious Fraud Office earlier this week, and has prompted fresh criticisms of regulation at Lloyd's. Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names Action Group, which is co-ordinating the Names' own legal action said: 'It reveals an appalling state of affairs. It shows a total failure of regulation by Lloyd's' One agency manager said the events showed that the system had failed Gooda Names completely. 'We have to recognise that.' The report's findings have also been sent to the insurance market's investigation committee, which has been examining the syndicates for some months. The report could also be used as evidence in the legal action being taken by more than 2,000 Gooda Walker Names against their agents. Members of the Gooda Walker syndicates are among the worst-hit of the insurance market's Names - the individuals who supply its capital. Their losses amount to more than Pounds 900m, with many individuals facing losses of more than Pounds 1m. The report focuses on the use by Gooda Walker syndicates of 'time and distance' policies - reinsurance policies which allow Lloyd's syndicates to manage their reserves against long-tail claims - which emerge many years after the inception of policies - more effectively. Such deals allow insurers to 'discount' their reserves against future claims. Policyholders pay a reinsurance premium which is then invested by the reinsurer, with the proceeds - less a profit for the reinsurer - repaid at an agreed future date to meet claims. Insurers are allowed to credit future benefits from such policies in the year in which they buy the policy. The report shows that between 1980 and 1988 the profits of four syndicates - numbers 164, 290, 295 and 298 - were increased by some Pounds 37m as a result. In some years in the early 1980s virtually all profits were generated from such policies. But few details of the policies were included in syndicate accounts. During these same years the profitability of Gooda Walker syndicates attracted many Names to join, with each of the syndicates' capacity - or capital base - expanding significantly. The report says that the re-insurers of some of the policies in turn reinsured their exposures with the same Gooda Walker syndicates. The investigators were unable to find any evidence that the Gooda Walker syndicates had prepared formal cashflow forecasts which would detail when they expect future claims to emerge. These are essential for the controlled use of 'time and distance' policies. Warnings from Lloyd's regulators that 'there could be no question of (a Gooda Walker syndicate) reinsuring its own risk back to another Gooda Walker syndicate' were apparently ignored, the report adds. Investigators have identified three policies purchased from Pinnacle (the Bermuda-based company which provided reinsurance to the Gooda Walker syndicates), elements of which were reinsured to other Gooda Walker syndicates.</p>

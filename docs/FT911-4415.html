			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: First Executive policyholders file suit POLICYHOLDERS at First Executive, the ailing Los Angeles-based life insurer whose two main operating units have been seized by the insurance regulators, yesterday filed a suit in the Manhattan courts, writes Nikki Tait. It alleges fraudulent activity, accuses First Executive's management of misleading policyholders, and claims that they did not disclose the speculative nature of the group's investments in 'junk bonds'. First Executive had an abnormally high proportion of its portfolio in junk, and much of troubles stem from this. A similar class action was filed in the Los Angeles courts last week.</p>

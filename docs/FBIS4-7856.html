			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Barbara </F> Sierszula; place and date not given: "Vaclav Klaus for  RZECZPOSPOLITA; Relations With Poland Are Developing Normally"]    [Text] Before the Sunday (10 April) meeting between Czech  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and his Polish counterpart, Waldemar  Pawlak, in the castle of Czocha near Lesna (in the vicinity of  Jelenia Gora), the Czech prime minister answered a few questions  for RZECZPOSPOLITA.    [Sierszula] Why will this meeting be of an informal nature?    [Klaus] I talked with Prime Minister Pawlak for only an  hour, when President Clinton was visiting Prague. Now I remember  that the informal meeting with former Prime Minister Hanna  Suchocka was very successful, so I believe we should return to  this tradition.    [Sierszula] As a result of your activities, almost no one  uses the expression Visegrad Group any longer, and, instead, the  states of our region are called CEFTA (Central European Free  Trade Agreement). However, do you think CEFTA is really  functioning?    [Klaus] CEFTA is operating to such a degree that its member  states have been able to reach an agreement. What has been  agreed on is functioning; however, one should think about  whether we should go any further. Among other topics, this is  what I would like to discuss with Prime Minister Pawlak.    [Sierszula] Are you satisfied with the present state of  relations between the Czech Republic and its neighbors, such as  Poland and Germany?    [Klaus] The relations are what they are. They result from  the relations in the "micro" platform, from everyday contacts  among various enterprises, companies, establishments, and people  of culture. What is being done by the governments, prime  ministers, presidents is only the tip of the iceberg, which is  not the most important thing. Politicians should try to build  up the contacts among states. Incidentally, I do not get the  impression that these "microcontacts," which are said to be of  paramount importance, between the Czech Republic and Poland,  Germany, Austria, and Slovakia, are bad.    [Sierszula] What do you think is currently the greatest  problem in Polish-Czech relations?    [Klaus] I do not think there are any fundamental, urgent  problems that would call for an SOS meeting. I think our  relations are developing normally. We are interested in  building them up further. Sometimes they make our lives a  little complicated, and the atmosphere is marred by various  attempts to outrun each other in the race for NATO or the  European Union. We should try to avoid this.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Capital flow study takes EC by surprise THE US call for a study of global capital flows and their impact on the world monetary system caught European policy-makers by surprise yesterday, although it is likely to be taken up in the months ahead. It emerged yesterday that the proposal - made in a speech on Wednesday to the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund by Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary - had not been discussed with European finance ministers during the past weekend's monetary meetings in Washington. It is understood that Mr Lamberto Dini, chairman of the Group of 10 deputies which Mr Brady has asked to carry out the study, only learned about the US plan after returning to Italy from Washington yesterday. However, European nations are certain to examine the idea of the study, which Mr Brady has sought in his present capacity as chairman of the G10. That does not mean that it will be easy to come to joint conclusions. It is also uncertain whether it could be completed in less than a year. The events of the past two weeks - when short-term capital movements have challenged the parity of the French franc and overwhelmed central bank defences in Italy, the UK and Spain - have led some European policy makers to consider ways to regulate somehow the flows on a more lasting basis than the temporary re-imposition of capital exchange controls, as in Spain on Wednesday and in Ireland and Portugal yesterday. 'There has to be a rethinking,' said one senior European monetary official. 'These flows cannot be allowed to undermine our economies.' The G10 - embracing the G7 (US, Japan, Germany, France, UK, Canada and Italy) plus Belgium, Netherlands and Sweden - now has 11 members since Switzerland's entry.</p>

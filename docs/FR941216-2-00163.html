			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Given the SEC's prior determination that it is virtually impossible to measure the impacts on market quality of changes in SAT firm activity and given the applicability of the SOES changes to all NNM securities, NASD monitoring has focused on a before-and-after analysis of commonly accepted measures of market quality, without trying to distinguish the impacts of trading by SAT firms. The SOES changes are treated as a partial reversal of a microstructure change made in mid-1988 (the 1988 SOES changes) and analyzed on a before-and-after basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The impacts of such structural changes do not occur completely on the immediate day after their introduction. For example, spreads did not widen immediately after the mandatory SOES exposure limits were put in place in mid-1988. Rather, adjustments to such changes and their impacts are gradual and distributed out over a period of time. Competitive forces cannot be expected to reverse instantaneously the quality of market conditions that evolved from microstructure restrictions and related arrangements that were in place for nearly six years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the SOES changes impact indirectly the measures of market quality. Each change, while important, can be expected to have different adjustment time periods. While a change in the maximum size order permitted to be entered into SOES is immediate, changes to market-maker exposure limits require adjustments by traders, as they reevaluate their quotation and inventory management procedures and their use of order-driven systems (rather than displayed quotations) to adjust inventories. Also the new automated quotation update, permitted after a transaction, cannot be implemented without varying time lapses by the many different market makers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nonetheless some improvement in the quality of the market for Nasdaq stocks has occurred in the period following the SOES changes. The analysis of the impact of the SOES changes on market quality focuses on the associated movements in Nasdaq market spreads, stock-price volatility, volume of SOES trading, the average size of SOES trades, and other indicators of market quality. The objective is to determine whether any apparent changes in market quality measures followed the reduced SOES regulations on market makers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To evaluate the impact of these changes, the NASD established a data set for the one-year pilot, beginning with November 11, 1993, and including complete audit trail information for a sample of days that includes approximately two days each month during the pilot. Although the pilot period is not over, enough data is available to derive some findings as to the changes in market quality that followed these SOES changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Impact of the SOES Change on the Level of SOES Activity <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The average daily share volume of SOES transactions and the number of SOES trades declined sharply following the SOES changes (see Chart 1). The immediate decline in average daily SOES volume approximated 52 percent from January to February, and the decline in the number of SOES trades was 17 percent. Moreover, the average SOES trade size declined 43 percent from January to February. The average trade size, which had risen from 310 shares in mid-1988, when the mandatory minimum exposure limits were instituted (see Chart 2) to 581 shares in January 1994, dropped sharply to 332 in February. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the average trade size in SOES that appears to best reflect SOES activist trader presence in the data. It is apparent from Chart 2 that SOES activists entered the market as proprietary traders immediately after the imposition of the mandatory SOES exposure limits in mid-1988. Because this activity violated SOES rules however, the NASD took action to preclude such trading through SOES and they withdrew as proprietary traders. Later, in 1989, these SAT firms began coaching individuals to trade through SOES in a similar fashion. As a result the average size of a SOES trade began its long uptrend in 1989, ending in January 1994, with a resulting substantial widening of spreads of large, actively traded stocks (See Chart 6). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- A Bank of Japan (BOJ)  source, commenting on a concerted market intervention in  currency markets by major industrialized countries on Friday [24  June], said the bank hopes the action will help normalize  currency markets.    The source said the intervention shows the "resolute stance"  of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized countries to secure  stabilization of foreign exchange rates.    The concerted action is aimed in part at sending warning  signals to speculators, the BOJ source said.    The Bank of Japan expects the intervention to have maximum  possible effect on the foreign exchange markets, the source said.    The G-7 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,  Japan and the United States.    In addition to these countries, Spain, Belgium and other  European countries reportedly participated in the concerted  market intervention.    The action immediately lifted the dollar to about 101.80 yen  in New York trading on Friday.</p>

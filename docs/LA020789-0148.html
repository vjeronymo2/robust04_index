			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> L.A. OVERRIDES GUN LOBBY, ADOPTS BAN ON SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS  </P> <P> Over the loud objections of gun owners, the City of Los Angeles enacted a  sweeping ban on the sale and possession of semi-automatic weapons that have  become increasingly popular with gang members.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley signed the ordinance about an hour after a unanimous City  Council voted for the two-pronged assault on the military-style weapons. Under  the ordinance owners of the rapid-firing rifles will have 15 days to render  them inoperable or turn them over to police for their destruction. Sales of the  weapons are outlawed immediately.  </P> <P> Gun shop owners and members of the National Rifle Assn., who booed the council  during its debate, vowed to fight the new ordinance in the courts. They said  that criminals will not turn in the assault guns, leaving law-abiding citizens  vulnerable to attack.  </P></p>

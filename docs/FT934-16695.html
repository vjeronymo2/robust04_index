			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Heywood Williams Pounds 10.6m glass buy HEYWOOD WILLIAMS Group, the building materials and automotive components company, has acquired the UK automotive replacement glass interests of TCG International for Pounds 10.6m. The Huddersfield-based group is paying Pounds 4.4m in cash and issuing nearly 1.82m new shares, worth Pounds 6.23m based on yesterday's closing price of 343p, up 2p on the day. TCG International's auto replacement glass business trades as Bridgewater Speedy Auto Glass, which has 53 branches throughout Britain, and Trans Britannia Glass which has two wholesale depots. These operations, which achieved profits of Pounds 599,000 in the seven months to July 31 and had net assets of Pounds 3.19m, will be integrated with Auto Windscreens, Heywood's existing windscreen and automotive safety glazing service. The two businesses make a good geographical fit since Heywood's auto glass operations are strongest in the north and the Midlands while Bridgewater is strongest in the south. Heywood has been refocusing its glass businesses. Earlier this year it sold a substantial part of its UK glass division to Pilkington for Pounds 95m and subsequently paid Dollars 53.3m (Pounds 34.5m) to acquire LaSalle-Deitch, a US-based distributor of building products and furnishings. Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, chairman, said, 'This is a good commercial deal for Heywood Williams and its shareholders. It is a logical step forward in our strategy of developing our remaining specialised glass businesses and fits in well with our overall plan for repositioning the group.' Mr Hinchliffe said that it should be possible to improve the performance of the depots and make administrative savings as a result of the merger which he said will 'more than fill our manufacturing operations.'</p>

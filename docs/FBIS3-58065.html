			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Michel Rosten: "NATO: The Cards Are on the </F> Table"]    [Text] Algirdas Brazauskas, former first secretary of the  Lithuanian Communist Party, has officially presented his  country's application to join NATO, in his capacity as head of  state. His approach, made on the eve of the Alliance summit, is  fairly clumsy in that everybody knows that the Sixteen are not  really prepared to expand their circle for the time being and  that the procedure which prevails in their organization makes  provision for them to invite a partner to sit among them; they  are therefore not accustomed to welcoming partners on request.    However, the initiative taken by Vilnius at least has the  advantage of making things clear and showing the Allies that  their idea of a Partnership for Peace does not really  fundamentally satisfy those to whom it is addressed. And, even  if it has failed to shake the conviction of those who want to  keep the Central and East European countries waiting in NATO's  antechamber for "some time," Mr. Brazauskas' application at  least shows that not everybody is necessarily deceived.    Having said that, Washington is sticking to its positions.  On Wednesday [5 January], Strobe Talbott, number two in the  State Department, categorically rejected the application made  the previous day by Lithuania. Perhaps some may be surprised by  this hasty procedure (as things stand, decisions are made by  consensus within the Alliance); but, at least, everybody will  have registered the idea that "the subject which we have before  us at present is not the consideration of new members..., but  the Partnership for Peace." Those who still naively believed  that the subject of expansion would be included on the summit's  agenda will therefore be disappointed!    At the same time, the Kremlin also complained. In response  to Vilnius' application, the Kremlin spoke out, once again,  against an extension of NATO toward the east. Boris Yeltsin  said he is worried "by the tendency to extend the system of  blocs." And, while recognizing "an independent country's  democratic right" to turn to the Brussels headquarters, he said  that the admission into the Alliance of countries which were  formerly members of the Communist bloc would jeopardize the end  of the Cold War and would lead to "political and military  destabilization." In short, the cards are on the table.</p>

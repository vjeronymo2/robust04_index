			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Arts: Radical chic, not racial rage - Cinema MALCOLM X (15) Spike Lee TOYS (PG) Barry Levinson CONSENTING ADULTS (15) Alan J. Pakula Malcolm X, Spike Lee's movie portrait of the black activist who spent 12 years firebreathing for the Nation of Islam until his assassination in 1965, is three hours 20 minutes long. At the end we are still not sure what we are supposed to have been watching. Propaganda? Biography? Social history? Indignation-as-cinema? A diffuse mixture of all four is the answer. Aiming to appeal to the widest possible movie constituency, Lee has made the blandest possible movie. And perhaps, once a major studio (Warner) and major star (Denzel Washington) were involved, plus an expanding budget into which everyone from Time Warner to the Reverend Jessie Jackson threw bundles of money, the writing was on the wall. In the finished movie, the 'X' in Malcolm X comes to stand not for the shock-horror lexical sign scrawled on the poster but for that characterless all-purpose cipher we use in equations. X for Mr Everyman. X for Take The Cardboard Political Hero You First Think Of and then multiply by four: one for each of the serial guises Denzel Washington adopts as we traverse the stations of the black prophet's cross. Lee's film begins in a stylised 1940s America, with a swooping/craning camera, a zoot-suited young hero and his pal (played by Spike Lee) and a dance-hall scene that could have strayed in from John Waters' Hairdo. This is a flippant and sumptuously disingenuous way to lead up to Malcolm's start in life as a street pimp and petty crook. Then we follow our hero into the slammer. Film noir menace; gritty close-ups; picture of a black man hardening to the punitive reality of the white man. The movie's third and most sustained Malcolm comes next. A meeting with a fellow-prisoner leads him to Nation Of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad and confirms our man in his firebrand vocation as a race-war orator. Soon we are off into the street marches backed by inspirational music; the streams of anti-white invective; the famously brusque response to JFK's assassination ("The chickens have come home to roost"); and the media Malcolm who burst into the TV and newsreel age to make the sound-bite bite. But already, here in the film's sprawling midsection, we are hearing a simultaneous and different sound: that of a film-maker trying to retreat at the same time that he advances. While not overtly distorting the facts about his hate-prophet protagonist, a Spike Lee aware of how many non-black people he must keep from stomping from the cinema if he is to make his money back increasingly muffles those facts. The 'chickens' quote, for example, is hidden half-audibly inside a montage of sounds and images conveying the post-Dallas frenzy. And the words for Malcolm's street speeches are delivered by Denzel Washington with actorly skill rather than incendiary elan - and are nearly all taken from his less virulent orations. Lee, of course, could defend this blanding-out of the middle-period Malcolm by citing the fourth and last Malcolm: the man who went to Mecca in 1964, a year before his death, and came back a changed, more peaceable man. Plucking a new name from the Arab thesaurus - El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz - he renounced his separatist views. Thanks to this lucky accident of history the film can segue its dismayingly emasculated pre-'64 Malcolm into the authentically emasculated figure of the last year. Then it is into the Audubon Ballroom, New York, for the glorifying martyrdom by Nation of Islam assassins. Malcolm X achieves the remarkable feat of taking a confrontational hero and never really confronting him. Good or evil, crackpot or calculating, Malcolm X raised the emotional stakes of the civil rights debate. A man who made slap-in-the-face speeches deserves a film with moments of slap-in-the-face impact. But Malcolm X is radical chic in the worst sense. It turns its hero into a tie-in product of yesterday's agitprop fashions, beautified and beatified for today by the casting of Denzel Washington. This actor has become today's answer to Sidney Poitier: he is almost impossible to view in any light other than Mr Nice Guy. Malcolm X should have been a questing, provocateur movie about the limits - or non-limits - of racial indignation. It should have kept alive the dramatic torch it lights in the inflammatory opening credits sequence, as the American flag is cross-cut with footage of the Rodney King beating. Instead it becomes a mixture of Black Gandhi and Guess Who's Coming To The Assassination. The chickens, instead of coming home to roost, are allowed to chicken out. Toys belongs to that genre of allegorical fiction summarisable as 'All The World's A (supply missing word)'. Where Orwell gave us the world as an animal farm, Fritz Lang as a futuristic city, Swift as a package tour to Parable-land, writer-director Barry Levinson opts for a toy factory. The 'Zevo Toys' plant puffs away on the skyline, like a power station built from playblocks. Here funny-innocent Leslie Zevo (Robin Williams) and his funny-robotic sister Alsatia (Joan Cusack) strive to carry on their late-deceased Dad's traditions of fertile, simple-hearted inventiveness. But lo] Trouble in Paradise. Dad, it transpires, has willed the place to their barking mad uncle, General Michael Gambon. He - a Dr Strangelove with extra weight and a funny accent - wants to turn Zevo Toys into Zevo Weapons. The Oscar-nominated costumes and designs steal the show. Not only that: they throw a honking great brick through the flimsy plot and leave a mess of shattered ideals. Levinson nursed this pet project apparently for 12 years, all through grown-up films like Good Morning Vietnam, Rain Man and Bugsy. But the movie as now realised is poised between the arch and the preachy. While the design caprices constantly bewitch our eyes - the country mansion that opens like a picture-book, the factory wing shaped like a giant elephant, the hilly green corridors with crossings for toy ducks - the message delivered to our ears is less winning. It should say 'Be innocent.' Instead, scrambled by infantilist sentimentality, it sounds more like 'Be winsome, whimsical or retarded.' Americans, being innocent anyway, cannot 'do' innocence. Thinking it something separate from themselves, they caricature it. Cusack and Williams both mug and wisecrack bravely to avert coyness - Williams alone is a one-man Wright brothers in his bid to achieve verbal flights-of-fancy despite the sticky terrain - but they keep seizing up in whimsy. What can a grown actress do when required to go night-nights in a giant lacy-fringed cradle? Our own Mr Gambon thrives best, as the heavyweight cuckoo lumbering into the alien nest. The Gambonic use of eyebrow and slow-cranked nasal drawl, even the hardworking American accent (given a brief early soliloquy of comic justification), help to give the film what it most needs: not more mercurial comic lightness but a large chunk of deranged comic solidity. Finally, here is a structural breakdown to assist you in enjoying Consenting Adults. Or in deciding if you want to go at all. First part: mildly hypnotic tale of clean-living couple (Kevin Kline, Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio) led into criminal and sexual temptation by new neighbour and wife (Kevin Spacey, Rebecca Miller). Second part: loony thriller in which Kline chases evil Spacey across Carolina while the womenfolk sit around twiddling their thumbs. Third part: end credits and dawning realisation that there were even more holes and inanities in the plot than you first thought. Alan J. Pakula, who once made Klute, directed. Matthew Chapman, who once made Strangers Kiss, screenwrote. How are the mighty fallen on hard times.</p>

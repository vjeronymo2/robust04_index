			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 31 (BTA) -- The anticommunist Union of  Democratic Forces (SDS) today confirmed its boycott of  parliament declared last week. The leaders of the coalition say  the Constitution was violated when on May 13 parliament rejected  the structural changes in the government moved by the prime  minister, and the latter did not tender his resignation.  Following a regular meeting of the leadership of the  ex-communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), Doncho Konakchiev  MP said he could not rule out the possibility of the Socialists  moving a no-confidence vote in the cabinet. "It all depends on  the cabinet's performance and meeting of commitments," he said.    "For the SDS it is beyond doubt the Lyuben Berov cabinet's  staying in office violates constitutional order," SDS leader  Filip Dimitrov told a press conference following a regular  meeting of the SDS leadership. "The SDS decided to stand out  against the attempt to trample on the Constitution and keep the  government in power," he said. He said the coalition decided  there was no reason for maintaining the status quo. The SDS  MP's will not take part in plenary sittings. Dimitrov, however,  said the faction will enter the debating chamber in new cases of  violation of the Constitution. Asked if the SDS will take part  in the passage of bankruptcy and scheme-of-arrangement laws,  Dimitrov said decisions will be made for each individual case.  The coalition will expand extraparliamentary activities, and  calls rallies on the Persin Island (on the Danube) on June 4 and  in Sofia on June 7.    Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and BSP floor leader Nora  Ananieva today had a telephone conversation on parliament's  legislative work. According to Chief BSP Press Officer Klara  Marinova, the prime minister guaranteed he would personally take  part in parliamentary debates on amendments to the Privatization  Act, a BSP priority.    According to Konakchiev, BSP will urge parliament to discuss  probable changes in the Constitution and a new election law  before its summer recess. SDS leader Dimitrov said changes in  the Constitution were a complex issue.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO-CHOICE MARCHERS  </P> <P> As a participant in the march in Washington for women's equality and  reproductive rights, I would like to commend The Times for its coverage and  editorial position.  </P> <P> However, the article on lobbying members of Congress omitted much of what  actually occurred that day.  </P> <P> I was a member of the delegation from Los Angeles that had a scheduled and  confirmed appointment with both Sens. Cranston and Wilson. Wilson did not show  up for this meeting, but sent an aide to represent his position on the issues.  Cranston not only met with the entire 200-plus members of the delegation, he  stayed for half an hour to answer all questions.  </P> <P> LYNDA PALEVSKY  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

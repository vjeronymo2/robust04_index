			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALES OF JAY LENO, MR. NICE GUY  </P> <P> I went to the Long Beach Grand Prix with only one intention -- to see Jay Leno,  who was one of the celebrity drivers. As I peered through a fence, he came out  of an outhouse. I yelled out, "Hey, Jay!" He turned and did his little "chin  thing" . . . funny without even saying a word.  </P> <P> OK -- so maybe it was a little rude to bother him at such a moment, but I sure  wish that I'd had my camera!  </P> <P> PAM LLOYD  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

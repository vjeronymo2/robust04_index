			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Arts: Keyboard Skills - Theatre The Bush Theatre has many virtues but is not normally a load of fun. This week it has thrown-off its sackcloth and ashes and gone up-market with a sprightly comedy about junior ministers in the Conservative Party. Moreover, Keyboard Skills does not even sneer at the Tories in their misfortunes. At times, it is a bit of a sentimental weepie. The keyboard skills are not those of the piano. They belong to the typing-room. There used to be a woman, played here by Marcia Warren, who trained young girls to become secretaries, indispensable to their boss and perhaps one day becoming his wife. Trouble almost invariably followed, of the kind you read about in the newspapers every other day. True, much the same thing happens in the Labour Party but, without saying so directly, Keyboard Skills is unmistakeably about the modern Tories. Watch (it would be hard not to) the immaculate performance by Deborah Findley as the girl in question. She is well-dressed, well-coiffured, relatively efficient, patient, forgiving and totally well-meaning. Only when it comes to the mind, which it does not very often, is there something lacking: it is not her fault that she has not been properly educated. She wants her man and will protect him. But the man, through a mixture of vanity and ambition, lets her down. Even then she may stick by him. After so many real-life stories, there is a danger of parody. Keyboard Skills, written by Lesley Bruce, who learned her own skills while working at the BBC, avoids the pitfalls. As the wife of the junior minister, Ms Findley is an altogether stronger and more interesting character than her husband. Yet Jonathan Coy, as the minister, is not entirely caricature in the way of (say) Spitting Image. He wants a Cabinet job in the next 18 months, then one that really matters before the general election, and who knows what might happen after that? He might even become - he does not say the next two words, but we know what he means. This is quite close to the bone. Of course, he gets into trouble. Do not expect a David Mellor story. The plot is much cleverer than that. Do not expect an attack on the media either. The newspapers are simply a power in the background. They never pounce and indeed never appear. The minister leaves his bag unattended in a pub in Bromley, rather as the late Richard Crossman (how the social nuances change) once left his papers behind in Pruniers in St James's Street. It is the minister's bag that is taken by the police for an IRA device, though it turns out that there is a real one as well. There are some lovely twists. If the junior minister seems less than a Tory patrician, he is nothing like such a creep as the young Tories coming up. Early in the play, with a set cunningly designed by Robin Don, we have a peep into the minister's wardrobe. It contains several dinner jackets and about 10 suits in varying shades of grey. The younger MP, aspiring to become a junior minister and whose surname is Compton-Miller, wears a bright blue cummerbund and tie to match. Wardrobe matters. Almost the best scene in the play comes when Ms Findley opens her own. It is very extensive: from Gucci to the Scotch House, everything that the wife of an ambitious Tory MP could need - 'stylish without being showy', 'sexy without being tarty'. The descriptions go on as, one by one, she throws her costumes to the floor. An impressive array of shoes remains unflung. This is a much better political play than David Hare's The Absences of War at the National Theatre: livelier, more contemporary and avoiding moralising. If it has a message, it is Tory feminism. The piece is directed without a single fault by Geraldine McEwan. Yet one should be wary of talking about transfers. The production is designed for the small stage, which is probably where it should stay. Bush Theatre, (081) 743 3388</p>

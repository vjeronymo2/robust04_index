			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Fund managers' dealings to be probed Personal share dealings by money managers in the booming US mutual funds industry have come under regulatory scrutiny, prompted by congressional and public concern that some managers may have been making personal profits at the expense of their investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission has written to 30 mutual fund groups asking about managers' personal share dealings. It is trying to uncover the extent to which fund managers invest personally in companies whose shares are also held in the portfolios they manage. This could create a conflict of interest, since managers could be tempted to deal personally before they trade on behalf of their funds. News of the SEC's action came in a letter from Mr Arthur Levitt, the Commission's chairman, to Mr Edward Markey, chairman of the House sub-committee on telecommunications and finance. Responding to concerns raised by the congressman, Mr Levitt said: 'I assure you that we will take whatever measures are appropriate to correct any abuses we discover as a result of our inquiry, including, if necessary, recommending new laws and legislation.' The SEC's investigation follows the sacking of a fund manager at funds group Invesco last month, and the launch of an inquiry into dealings by managers at Boston-based Fidelity Investments, the US's biggest mutual funds group. There has been concern in Washington that the regulation of the mutual fund industry has failed to keep pace with its rapid growth. By the end of last year mutual funds had amassed Dollars 2,000bn (Pounds 1,340bn) in assets in the US, accounting for a substantial part of personal investments.</p>

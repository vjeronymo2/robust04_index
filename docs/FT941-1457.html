			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Keating set to name Lawrence health minister Australia's prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, was yesterday expected to appoint Ms Carmen Lawrence, the former West Australian premier, to the post of health minister as part of the fourth ministerial reshuffle in as many months. The portfolio was vacated yesterday by Senator Graham Richardson, one of the Labor Party's most influential powerbrokers, who resigned from the cabinet with a view to leaving politics.  -Senator Richardson claimed he had already decided to quit after Labor's win in the 1993 election, although he had originally planned to step down in August 1994. After spending half his adult life in parliament, the senator said he wanted to pursue other interests, beginning with his memoirs. Speculation suggests he is planning to work for Mr Kerry Packer, or he would seek to become chief executive of the Sydney Olympics Games Organising Committee. For much of the past 10 years, he has been viewed as the key 'numbers man' in the federal Labor Party, effectively making and breaking prime ministers. Mr Keating's ascendancy tended to undermine Senator Richardson's power base, and the two men recently clashed in public over possible changes to the Medicare levy. But the prime minister and the senator insisted they were on friendly terms. Senator Richardson is the fourth senior minister to depart in as many months, and the 15th since Mr Keating took over from Mr Hawke in 1991. There has been no pattern to the departures: Mr John Dawkins left the treasurer's position for personal reasons, Ms Ros Kelly and Mr Alan Griffiths left after differing controversies. To an extent, the impact of the latest departure has been offset by the publicity surrounding Ms Lawrence's arrival in Canberra. Labor Party members agreed last night she should be given one of the three ministerial positions now vacant, the others going to Mr Gary Punch and Mr Con Sciacca.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Rabbi killed as Arab-Israeli clashes increase A RABBI was stabbed to death by a Palestinian at a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip and a Palestinian woman was shot dead by soldiers in the West Bank yesterday. They were the latest victims in the surge of violence in Israel, the occupied territories and Lebanon which has overtaken the campaign for the Israeli general election on June 23. The attack on Rabbi Shimon Biran, a resident of the settlement of Kfar Darom, followed a similar fatal knife attack by a Gazan Arab on a 15-year-old Israeli schoolgirl in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv, on Sunday. The killings, combined with a wave of Israeli air strikes on Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas in Lebanon, provoked heated debate between Israel's ruling Likud party and the opposition Labour party over security, traditionally a central issue in Israeli elections. Gangs of armed Jewish settlers in Gaza went on the rampage against Palestinian property and beat at least two people in revenge for the Rabbi's death. The army doubled a three-day order closing all exits to Israel from Gaza. Later, in an unconnected incident in the West Bank town of Jenin, a 55-year-old woman was shot dead when soldiers opened fire after their bus was stoned. Labour has strongly attacked the Likud over the stabbings, saying that the government was neither in control of security nor making progress towards a peace settlement that might ease the problem. In the past, Labour tended to lose out to the more hardline Likud on security matters. But under Mr Yitzhak Rabin, a former chief of staff and defence minister, it now has greater confidence in confronting the issue. Mr Rabin has publicly warned the government against trying to exploit security concerns for electoral gain following a spate of air strikes in Lebanon of unusual ferocity, in one of which two small girls and their mother were killed. Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, yesterday strongly denied that political considerations formed any part of operational decisions. But, in a briefing for foreign journalists, he came close to admitting that the Likud might benefit from incidents like those of the past few days. In the past, he said, such events had produced a 'more realistic view' among Israelis about the dangers facing them and the need for strong government.</p>

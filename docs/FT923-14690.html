			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Number of adults gaining jobs after ET drops again THE ABILITY of adults to gain employment after retraining on the government's main training programme has continued to deteriorate according to figures published yesterday. Thirty per cent of trainees gained employment after leaving Employment Training (ET) in the 12 months to July last year compared with 35 per cent in the previous year according to an analysis of unpublished government figures by the Unemployment Unit, an independent research organisation. The scheme, administered in England and Wales by Training and Enterprise Councils, (Tecs) has been widely criticised as underfunded and ill targeted. The government is considering wide reform of the scheme and the Department of Employment is discussing with the Treasury new flexibilities in the way Tecs train unemployed adults. Tecs want to improve the quality of training even if this reduces the number of recruits. They believe ET as presently constituted is concerned more with reducing the number of people on unemployment registers than with providing people with quality training. According to the survey the number of trainees gaining qualifications improved from 22 per cent in the year to June 1990 to 30 per cent in the latest period measured by the survey, a period when Tecs took over the scheme. The Unemployment Unit said that while job entry rates could be explained partly by the weakness of regional employment conditions qualification rates reflected only the competence of Tecs and providers of training in placing trainees on to courses designed to lead to vocational qualifications. Mr Paul Convert of the Unemployment Unit said: 'ET is an underfunded and unloved scheme. It was designed at the tail end of the 1980s boom to get people into work by giving them worthwhile vocational qualifications. These latest figures show that it is doing neither.'

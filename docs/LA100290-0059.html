			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY WORKERS PROTEST NEW PARKING FEES  </P> <P> Los Angeles County employees staged a protest outside the Hall of  Administration Monday to protest new parking fees that went into effect this  week.  </P> <P> The fees are intended to encourage employees who work downtown to car-pool and  use public transit rather than commute alone. The county's biggest labor union,  Service Employees International Union, Local 660, contends that the charges --  which range from $70 to $225 a month -- are designed to open parking lots for  private development, which will lead to more air pollution and traffic  congestion.  </P> <P> Judging by the large number of empty spaces in usually jam-packed parking lots,  the plan appeared to be working, county officials said.  </P></p>

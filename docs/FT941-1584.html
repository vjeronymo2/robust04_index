			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Frederick Cooper up 37% and confident on future Frederick Cooper, the West Midlands architectural hardware, coatings and electrical group, yesterday reported what it called its 'best interim trading performance' since 1989 as it exploited slightly improved markets off a reduced cost base. Pre-tax profits for the half year to January 31 were 37 per cent higher from Pounds 1.77m to Pounds 2.43m. Earnings per share rose to 3.3p from 2.5p. Mr Eddie Kirk, chairman, said he was confident enough about prospects to recommend an increase in the interim dividend from 0.7p to 0.8p. Total payments for the year to last July were 2.2p. 'Our costs are firmly under control and we continue to gain market share in all divisions. Our outstanding order book is 10 per cent higher than last year and additional new products provide further potential to increase turnover in the second half,' Mr Kirk said. He added that a new range of high security multi-locks had just won orders which would raise turnover by Pounds 500,000 a year starting in June. During the first half turnover rose from Pounds 40.1m to Pounds 44.3m, of which Pounds 528,000 came from a metal railings business, which has now been closed. The most striking increase in the results came from the manufacturing side of the security and architectural hardware division, where profits more than doubled to over Pounds 1m. Spectra, the US coatings business acquired last May, made a first contribution to profits of Pounds 170,000. Although Mr Kirk thinks the prospects for Frederick Cooper are the best for five years, he finds the UK economic recovery 'fragile'. The coatings trade in Germany remains steady but the French and Italian markets are still sluggish.</p>

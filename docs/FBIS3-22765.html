[Begin correspondent Sanjiv Thomas recording] India has  achieved self-sufficiency in the manufacture of nuclear fuel  rods for power reactors. The Hyderabad-based nuclear fuel  complex has to date produced 100,000 of these fuel bundles.  These rods are made from uranium oxide, a zirconium alloy [as  heard]. They are used for producing power in pressurized heavy  water reactors. India is the fourth country to achieve this  capability. The monthly production of these rods is about  1,200, but it will soon touch 1,500. These rods are used at a  rate of 2,000 per year at each nuclear reactor. India has seven  running reactors and five are under construction. The nuclear  fuel complex chairman, Dr. C.

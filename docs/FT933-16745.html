			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / US backs Japanese, German UN bid THE US yesterday formally supported the admission of Germany and Japan to permanent membership of the UN Security Council, but Britain cautioned against 'precipitate action'. Noting that the 15-nation council had finally assumed its intended position 'at the centre of world affairs', Britain argued there was no pressing need for change, although 'success should be built upon'. While backing the well known aspirations of Bonn and Tokyo to join the present five founding permanent members, the US added a caveat that they must be prepared to be active in global peace and security activities. That would involve being ready to provide UN peacekeepers, for which both countries would need constitutional amendments. However, not all members would welcome an increased military role for the former second world war enemy states, whose defeat led to the creation of the UN. The US and British statements responded to a resolution requesting members' views on 'Equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council'. The issue will be debated by the General Assembly later this year. While backing Germany and Japan for permanent seats, the US emphasised that the current big five - also including France, Russia and China - had political and economic influence and the capacity and will to enhance global security through peace keeping and other activities. 'Their status on the council should remain unaltered.' Thus, fears that the US might eventually be willing to see Britain and France superseded, as declining powers, were emphatically allayed. In reply, Britain made no mention of Germany and Japan but stressed the present council had been able to respond rapidly to international crises and permitted equitable representation from all regions working with the permanent members. No fewer than 70 resolutions were adopted last year alone and 60,000 UN peace keepers were deployed.</p>

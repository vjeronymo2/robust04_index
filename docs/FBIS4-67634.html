			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Michael Horsnell: "Cambridge Fears Meningitis </F> Outbreak After Student Dies"]    [Excerpt] More than a hundred Cambridge University staff  and students have been treated after an undergraduate died of  meningitis and her friend was admitted to hospital in a critical  condition.    Julia Birkbeck, 19, died within an hour of admission to  Addenbrooke's hospital but Paul Bentley, 21, is responding to  treatment. The students and staff who were in contact with them  over the past seven days were traced by the Cambridge Health  Authority and given antibiotics.    Miss Birkbeck had been rowing on the Cam the previous day  but  the authority discounted the river as the source of the  infection and said it was possible that a small dinner attended  by Miss Birkbeck and Mr Bentley in college on Saturday night  held the key to the outbreak of the severe meningococcal version  of the disease. Suggestions that the Cam was the source of a  bacterial infection which attacked three women members of a  Cambridge college boat crew earlier this week, causing their  hands to swell to twice their normal size, were similarly denied.    Miss Birkbeck, from Glasgow, was a first-year modern  language  student at Girton College and all-round athlete. She took part  in an energetic row with her college eight on Monday complaining  of a headache before becoming sicker that night. She was  admitted to the hospital's intensive care at 7:30 am on Tuesday  and died an hour later. Mr. Bentley, from Essex, a medical  student at Gonville and Caius College who was admitted three  hours later, was said to be improving.    Dr Roger Buttery, a Cambridge Health Authority consultant in  communicable disease control, said more than 100 contacts of the  two students had received an antibiotic prophylactic and been  told to contact their GPs if symptoms of meningitis occurred.    He said: "There is no possibility the outbreak had anything  to do with the Cam, though we constantly stress that people  shouldn't jump in because any river is infected. Whether the  dinner party was a relevant connection with the outbreak is  uncertain."    Sarah Key, the dead woman's senior tutor, said: "She was so  strong and so vital, it's almost impossible to think she has  just died."

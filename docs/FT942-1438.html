			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Prescott urges industrial revival Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, yesterday sought to put his commitment to Labour's traditional values in a modern setting by calling for a joint public and private-sector initiative to revitalise core industries. Mr Prescott, who is standing on a traditional socialist platform in Labour's leadership and deputy leadership elections, accused the government of deliberately destroying core industries as part of an attack on unions. He told the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation conference in Jersey that a joint initiative was the only way to revitalise industries such as shipbuilding, railways, steel and coal. 'It is a national disgrace that the government has destroyed the capacity of these core industries through a deliberate policy of industrial vandalism, designed to attack the power of trade unions,' he said. But he said Britain must work in harmony with its European Union partners, using the European recovery, infrastructure and regional funds to stimulate industrial recovery. 'International finance, co-ordinated international recovery and co-operative international social policy is the reality of our traditional values in a modern setting,' he said. Mr Prescott's remarks were in line with attempts during the campaign to dilute his image as an opponent of Labour's modernisation drive. But he reaffirmed his commitment to the use of targets to measure the progress of a Labour government towards achieving full employment. The use of targets has been rejected by Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary and favourite to succeed John Smith as leader. Mr Prescott said it would be 'a moral outrage if we accepted mass unemployment as a permanent feature of our economy'. Mr Prescott called in an interview in the Daily Mirror for a 'massive training programme' funded by a levy on companies.</p>

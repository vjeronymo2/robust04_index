			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jad al-Akhawi dispatch from Jba', southern Lebanon] </F>   [Excerpts] Here in the town of Jba' in Iqlim al-Tuffah the  inhabitants are cautious. From time to time they hear the  sounds of bombs or of Israeli reconnaissance planes, which  usually precede air raids. This is when they rush to shelters  and safe rooms. [passage omitted]    It has been learned that Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq  al-Hariri and Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah have  held a telephone conversation in which the need for containing  the situation and depriving Israel of any pretexts to perpetrate  new acts of aggression was stressed. It was also learned that  similar contacts were held between Syrian officials and the  Hizballah leadership.    But, according to fundamentalist sources, the resistance  will  continue its operations and a response to the raid near  Ba'labakk last week must be expected. The sources said the  visit to Lebanon by Iranian envoy Kazem Khonsari and his  meetings with Lebanese officials and with resistance leaders  came as support for the resistance, not to ask it to calm the  situation and refrain from reacting, as the Lebanese papers  reported today.</p>

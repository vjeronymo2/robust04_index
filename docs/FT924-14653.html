			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Israeli troops shoot 90 marchers ISRAELI soldiers shot and wounded at least 90 Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip yesterday during marches in support of a prisoner hunger strike, Reuter reports from Rafah, Gaza Strip. Soldiers fired live ammunition, plastic bullets and tear gas to disperse several thousand demonstrators outside the Red Cross headquarters in Rafah refugee camp. Palestinians threw stones and fire bombs in the fiercest clashes in the Strip in five months. One man was critically wounded in the head, hospital sources said. Another was shot twice in the neck and one woman lost an eye. Seventy-two others suffered light wounds. In Mughazi camp, 15 protesters were wounded, four seriously, medical sources said. The army said 20 to 25 Palestinians were hurt, none seriously. The protests were to back an 11-day-old hunger strike by thousands of Arab prisoners demanding better conditions. Israel says the strike is a political move to bolster the Palestinian position at the peace talks.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Walker insists funds for coal review are sufficient LORD WALKER, the former Conservative cabinet minister selected to oversee the regeneration of coalfield areas, insisted yesterday that the Pounds 165m allocated by the government was sufficient for the task in the coming 12 months. On his first public visit to a coalfield since his appointment in October, Lord Walker said he wanted more government money to continue the regeneration effort - using his first-year experience to assess how much was needed. 'As far as future years are concerned, when I've got down to the detail of the task I would discuss with the government departments what was required,' he said. Suggestions that the funding was inadequate were a myth, he said. 'I have a reputation of not being backward in asking for money I need.' Citing his track record as Welsh secretary, Lord Walker said successful regeneration programmes did not increase public expenditure, since they reduced unemployment and social security payments and brought in taxpaying activities. The appointment of Lord Walker, energy secretary during the 1984-85 miners' strike, to lead coalfield regeneration was announced by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, after the public outcry over the proposed closure of 31 pits. Yesterday's visit to the Durham coalfield was at the invitation of the local authorities' East Durham task force. A year ago the task force said the area needed Pounds 158m investment to have any chance of recovery from 10,000 mining jobs losses since 1981. It now faces the closure of its last two pits, employing more than 2,000 men. Lord Walker disclosed that he recently privately visited the Nottinghamshire and west Midlands coalfields. He emphasised that his visits did not pre-empt the outcome of the government's pit closures review.</p>

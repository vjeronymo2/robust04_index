			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Domestic &amp; General shows 25% rise GROWING DEMAND by consumers to insure their domestic appliances against breakdowns helped lift pre-tax profits at Domestic &amp; General, the Wimbledon-based specialist insurer, by 25 per cent to Pounds 6.19m in the six months to June 30. Earnings per share rose from 48.11p to 61.13p and the annual dividend is raised to 18p (15p) with a proposed final of 12p. Mr Martin Copley, chairman, said: 'We're obviously very pleased. This is a creditable result given the continuing recession.' He said the company's service - which arranges repairers rather than simply providing insurance to cover breakdowns - combined with growth in insurance schemes operated by appliance manufacturers had helped raise premium income. Gross premiums for domestic appliances rose to Pounds 43.5m (Pounds 32.9m) and other premiums fell to Pounds 232,000 (Pounds 421,000), reflecting the company's concentration on its core business. Turnover rose by 29 per cent from Pounds 34.2m to Pounds 44.2m, while expenses increased 13 per cent to Pounds 10.5m. Investments in Copley, a subsidiary which provides personal loans to police officers, jumped to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 7.9m). Total investment income rose 14 per cent to Pounds 5.9m. Mr Copley said the company's strong connections with the domestic appliance suppliers and its broad management services had helped it stave off growing competition over the past 12 months. He said Domestic &amp; General had had to reduce its premiums in line with the market, but it was taking steps to limit attempts by the 1,000 repairers it uses to widen their margins.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US alters China MFN stance Opposition to President Bill Clinton's decision to extend Most Favoured Nation trading status to China may depend on what non-human rights conditions are attached. An actual announcement, the presentation of which will be closely watched, was expected either later yesterday or today. The president ducked all questions on the subject during his early morning jog, but administration officials have made it clear that the central decision to de-link MFN and human rights had already been reached earlier this week. The likeliest target for modest sanctions are Chinese-made guns and ammunition, specifically the SKS rifle, once in standard use by the Chinese army and throughout the former eastern bloc. The ban on sales of Chinese weapons in the US was lifted in 1987. Nearly 1m SKS guns were imported into the US last year by two Chinese trading companies with close ties to the Red Army, making it the fourth most popular weapon in the country, after three cheap handguns. SKS rifles were described in an article in the Wall Street Journal yesterday by a US government official as 'high tech firearms at Saturday Night Special prices'. A ban could, therefore, be portrayed as part of the anti-crime drive. An embargo on an easily identifiable product would be easier to enforce than a broader proscription on goods made by Chinese state industries and prison camps, as demanded by some in Congress and as considered recently by the government. Congressman David Bonior, Democrat whip, warned yesterday Mr Clinton could face a big fight in congress if he were not 'tough enough' with China. The administration is resigned to the fact that it is certain to come under attack in Congress and human rights organisations for backing away from the president's executive order of last June tying renewal of MFN to improvements in seven areas of Chinese human rights policies. Measurable progress has only been made in two areas. Some of that sting may be drawn by the prospect of large US commercial contracts with China. Yesterday, for example, Boeing was obliged to deny comment on reports it was close to landing a Chinese order for over 50 airliners valued at over Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.4m).</p>

The two Commonwealth  delegates who arrived in the country to try and assist the  government in quelling the situation, Dr. Moses Anafu and Mr.  Max Gaylard, told the media that there was unanimous support  from the political leaders to help in the ending of the  hostilities. However, Mr. Gaylard did not rule out the fact  that there was still a danger that further fighting might break  out. As to what the Commonwealth would do if the situation  worsened, resulting in the toppling of the government by force,  Dr. Anafu said the Commonwealth would not hesitate to take harsh  measures. They expressed optimism that their discussions with  representatives of the two warring army factions would be  fruitful and end the crisis.</p>

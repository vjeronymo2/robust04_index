			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: UBS calls in Mountleigh bond after payment missed UNION Bank of Switzerland has called in the Mountleigh Finance 5 1/4 per cent SFr150m 1988-1995 bond, Reuter reports from Zurich. UBS said it had acted as neither the issuer nor the guarantor - collapsed UK property company Mountleigh Group - had made an interest payment due on the bonds on May 19. Last month, UBS had announced that Mountleigh had a 10-day grace period to meet the payment, and this too had now elapsed. Mountleigh collapsed when banks owed some Pounds 400m withdrew support and put in KPMG Peat Marwick as receivers. Last week, Geneva-based Warburg Soditic also declared three Mountleigh Swiss franc bonds, for which it acted as lead-manager, as due and payable.</p>

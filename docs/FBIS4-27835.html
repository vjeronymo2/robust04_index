			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 5 KYODO -- Amid heightened tension over  the North Korean nuclear issue, Japan's military establishment  is proceeding with "operation rabbit ears," keeping tabs on  North Korean moves by mobilizing electronic spy planes and  electronic data-gathering facilities.    The Defense Agency and the Self-Defense Forces, having  failed  last year to promptly confirm North Korea's test-firing of a  Nodong 1 ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan, recently  succeeded in rapidly detecting Pyongyang's firing of another  ballistic missile.    One intelligence official, however, said Japan's  capabilities  remain quite limited when compared with satellite reconnaissance  capabilities of the United States.    The main actors in the ongoing operation are some 10  electronic data-monitoring posts spread throughout the country,  from Japan's large, northernmost island of Hokkaido to the  southernmost island of Kyushu.    The facilities have already proved themselves, such as when  in 1983 they successfully intercepted communications between  Soviet fighter planes that downed a Korean Air jetliner over  Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East.    Today's operations also make use of modified YS-11 and C-1  transport aircraft and EP-3 electronic warfare data-collection  planes, which fly daily runs over the Sea of Japan.    Maritime Self-Defense Force ships are also on alert status,  officials said.</p>

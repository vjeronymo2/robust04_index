			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUDIOCASSETTE REVIEW;  </P> <P> RAUCOUS READING FOR TOOLE'S 'CONFEDERACY'  </P> <P> **** "A Confederacy of Dunces" by John Kennedy Toole. Read by Arte Johnson.  Abridged by Mary Margaret Moffitt on two cassettes. Dove.  </P> <P> Success came too late for John Kennedy Toole, who died by his own hand before  his mother badgered his manuscript into print, where it became a best seller.  His portrait of a gross but vivid eccentric, Ignatius J. Reilly, his  hard-tippling, hysterical mother and a supporting cast of New Orleans zanies  gets a raucous, hilarious reading from comedian Arte Johnson.  </P> <P> Johnson does a running romp through a variety of voices from Ignatius'  stentorian imprecations to his mother's sirenlike wailings about her wayward,  300-pound, 30-year-old boy. The book's undertones of estrangement and despair,  the feeling that it is a mad look at a maddening world, are better found in the  text. But as a listening experience, the abridgement is an unmitigated  delight.CHARLES CHAMPLIN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar </F> Velayati by Amin Muhammad Amin; place and date not given]    [Text] Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati has  stressed that his meetings with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr  Musa dealt openly with the two countries' views on a number of  issues and the means of building confidence between them. He  said that both Iran and Egypt are of major importance due to  their unique positions on the world map. He invited the United  Arab Emirates [UAE] to visit Teheran to continue the dialogue  over the three islands.    Velayati denied that his country has given support to any  terrorist group in Egypt or Algeria. He noted that Egypt and  Iran have to cooperate in the regional and international  spheres. He also denied that there are Egyptian prisoners in  Iran from the Iraqi-Iranian war, stressing that all Egyptian  prisoners have been handed over to Egypt.    On the obstacles impeding the restoration of relations  between Egypt and Iran, Velayati said that Israel and  cooperation with it are the main obstacles.    [Amin] Does this apply to all the Arab countries with which  you have good relations but which are seeking peace with Israel?    [Velayati] The matter differs from one country to another  according to the interest that countries show toward Israel.  Our relations are based on this.    [Amin] This means that you do not now support the  Palestinian  cause, especially after the Palestinian-Israeli agreement?    [Velayati] Palestine does not have a united stand. We  support justice and reject humiliation for the Palestinian  people at the hands of Israel, which is looking to increase its  hegemony over the other countries in the region. Therefore, we  will not stand idle and see the whole region fall under Israeli  hegemony.    [Amin] But the international conditions have changed, the  power struggle in the world is over, and the current move is  toward peace.    [Velayati] Do the international conditions allow one party  alone to use force but not others? If this is the new world  reality, then does this mean that we should all rush to hand  over the region, which is the heart of the Islamic world, to the  enemies, when our grandfathers fought for more than two  centuries? Are we required to be beaten and to depend on  Israel's mercy?    [Amin] If the parties to the conflict have accepted a  peaceful solution, why then this insistence on continuing the  fighting and the armed confrontation?    [Velayati] The struggle must continue. We have before us the  example of South Africa, which we supported.    Certainly, any step must have an effect. There is a  difference between those who welcome and bless peace and those  who are compelled to make peace.    [Amin] Then, in your view, the Palestinians and Syrians are  being compelled to reach an agreement and to go along with the  peace process?    [Velayati] They are certainly being compelled to do so. What  is happening in Gaza now is ample proof of this. 'Arafat is  merely the mayor of Gaza and Jericho and his entry there means  that Israel has become the master of the situation in the  region. Hence, the Palestinian-Israeli agreement is not a  profitable deal.    [Amin] This means Iran will not back the Palestinian  self-rule authority.    [Velayati] Of course we will not back Palestinian self-rule,  because while Israel has given back one part, it has taken 100  parts in a strange and unequal deal.    [Amin] What about Gulf security?    [Velayati] The security of the region cannot be established  except through the desire of the Gulf countries themselves.    [Amin] Will this take place by establishing a strong joint  military force or a united organization?    [Velayati] These are the many and varied stages of the road  to cooperation. It starts out with economic, political, and  security cooperation. But we have not yet discussed the origins  and bases of the idea.    Unfortunately, we in the Gulf region have got the big  arms-exporting powers used to making us various offers of arms  deals. They create a whimsical danger to blackmail the region  and stockpile arms there. The danger is constantly being moved  around and the attrition continues.    [Amin] If Iran realizes the effects of the arms race in the  region, why does it participate as a major party?    [Velayati] We are the country in the region that buys the  least amount of weapons in relation to our population. Our  expenditure on arms does not exceed 4 percent of the Iranian  budget.    [Amin] What about the Gulf countries with a low population  density?    [Velayati] If this criterion is applied, every small country  would have the right to buy more weapons than it could absorb.  This is a dangerous criterion to apply.    [Amin] What about your stance regarding arms deals with the  United States?    [Velayati] The United States does not sell us weapons. It  has frozen all deals made with it during the shah's rule. We  are getting our weapons from other sources.    [Amin] Your stance on the occupation of the three UAE  islands, Tunb al-Sughra, Tunb al-Kubra, and Abu Musa,  constitutes an obstacle to restoring confidence with the Arabian  Gulf states.    [Velayati] We are fully confident that if there is to be a  solution to this problem, it must take place through peaceful  dialogue. But if one party wants to corner the other party and  internationalize the problem, this party will lose more than the  other. We started peaceful dialogue with the UAE in Abu Dhabi a  year ago and agreed to convene a second meeting for dialogue in  Tehran. That meeting has not taken place.    Velayati said that through AL-AHRAM he extends an invitation  to the UAE foreign minister to visit Tehran to continue their  peaceful dialogue regarding the islands anytime he likes.    [Amin] There are some accusations indicating that Iran backs  the terrorist organizations hiding behind the guise of religion  in the region.    [Velayati] We vehemently deny these accusations. Let anyone  who has proof of this come forward. We have never supported any  terrorist group in Egypt or Algeria. Unfortunately, some  Western forces are playing a major role in escalating terrorist  and extremist currents in the region.    [Amin] What is your comment on events in Yemen?    [Velayati] We support the continuation of unity in Yemen and  a peaceful solution of all the problems that pose an obstacle to  the march of unity. We support solving problems through  dialogue, not fighting.</p>

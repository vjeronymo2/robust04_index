			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Stockholm takes comfort from Ericsson ERICSSON gained 9.4 per cent yesterday after releasing 1992 results which exceeded most analysts' forecasts, writes Our Markets Staff. STOCKHOLM took new life after the Ericsson results, lifting the B shares by SKr18 to SKr209 and the Affarsvarlden General index by 4.2 to 948.9. Turnover was SKr1bn after SKr1.2bn on Monday, with Ericsson accounting for some SKr341m. Profit-taking affected some other issues after recent gains: Volvo B lost SKr1 to SKr385 and Skanska B fell SKr3 at SKr88. Electrolux B improved SKr6 to SKr224. OSLO rose 3.1 per cent to its highest close of the year as investors were encouraged by lower interest rates . The all-share index rose 12.23 to 401.86 in turnover of NKr456.8m. Hafslund, which reported good 1992 earnings on Monday, advanced NKr6.50 in the B shares to NKr151.00. COPENHAGEN extended its slide, depressed by high interest rates, the KFX index losing another 1.36 to 82.10. Den Danske Bank fell DKr6.27 to DKr285 after solid gains in recent weeks and Sophus Berendsen was DKr13 lower at DKr416, affected by the fall in sterling. HELSINKI closed higher on a fall in domestic interest rates, the Hex index rising 11.8 to 911.0. FRANKFURT eased, but chemicals improved as the DAX index closed 5.58 lower at 1,641.58 in turnover down from DM6.4bn to DM5.8bn. BASF, the neglected stock among the big three over the past year or two, led the sector yesterday with a rise of DM2.40 to DM227, Bayer adding DM1.10 to DM275.60 and Hoechst a modest 30 pfg to DM264.30. Hoare Govett said this week that BASF had 'considerable potential' for a positive dividend surprise, and cyclical recovery prospects but that Hoechst, even with its large US operations, was overvalued after a long run of relative strength on the dollar. Meanwhile, AMB defied the ebb in financials with a rise of DM15 to DM885 taking its gain to DM100 this month. Mr Bob Yates at Fox Pitt said that speculation about AMB's ownership structure, 29 per cent with AGF of France ('in the driving seat') and 20 per cent with Fondiaria in Italy, ignored the perils of being in a German minority. PARIS weakened further with Eurotunnel, down FFr1.15 to FFr37.70 on profit-taking, continuing to be the most active stock. The CAC-40 index finished down 10.68 at 1,894.05 in turnover of FFr2.8bn. Havas rose FFr9.50 to FFr439.00 with two large blocks totalling 250,000 shares going through the market: there was speculation that Lyonnaise-Dumez, down FFr4.90 at FFr425.20, might have been selling part of its stake. Chargeurs improved FFr7 to FFr1,369 on news that it might increase its stake in BSkyB, the UK satellite operator, and Bouygues shed FFr6 to FFr634 on taking a 26 per cent shareholding in a South African building group. Axa, which fell sharply after it announced a FFr3.6bn convertible bond issue after the Monday's close, lost FFr28 to FFr1,114, while Total slipped FFr3.70 to FFr235.60 on 1992 figures which were generally in line with expectations. ZURICH consolidated after last week's gains and the SMI index eased 1.5 to 2,135.7. Nestle bearers were unchanged at SFr1,085 as it announced the sale of parts of its Perrier mineral water operations to SAI, French parent company of the Castel group. MILAN marked time after its recent strong run as trading fell off ahead of the close of the monthly trading account next Monday. The Comit index fell 9.44 to 499.68. Fiat set the tone, fixing L163 lower at L4,686 and falling to L4,615 after hours. Banco di Roma, L44 higher on Monday, rose another L39 to fix at L2,049 before trading up to L2,060 amid renewed speculation about the bank's privatisation. AMSTERDAM saw currency sensitive stocks fall back as the CBS General index closed down 0.1 at 97.9. Elsevier and Unilever were affected by weaker sterling, declining byFl 2.10 and Fl 1.20 respectively to Fl 126.00 and Fl 195.40. Akzo and DSM reversed the trend with gains of Fl 1.20 and Fl 1.50 respectively to Fl 144.20 and Fl 74.90. MADRID dropped on gloomy economic news and futures-related selling. The general index lost 4.14 to 235.03, reflecting profit-taking after last week's gains, and higher unemployment and lower economic growth. ATHENS put on another 6 per cent with the banking sector leading the way, mainly on strong domestic buying. The index rose 48.44 to 882.07 in turnover estimated at some Dr5-6bn, up from Monday's Dr3bn and well ahead of the average daily figure of Dr1bn. TEL AVIV closed sharply lower in active trading in reaction to comments by the Bank of Israel governor, Mr Jacob Frenkel, warning that the market was a 'bubble'. The blue chip index fell 4.8, or 2.2 per cent to 213.37, its first loss after seven consecutive gains.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- February 9                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1125.86     1126.30    1126.32    1124.99 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1180.11     1179.78    1179.10    1177.43  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00       14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1126.04     1125.99    1124.93    1124.14 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1177.97     1177.46    1176.17    1177.40  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Feb 8     Feb 5     Feb 4     Feb   3   Feb 2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1131.12   1129.52   1113.35   1097.03   1089.43 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1190.15   1189.21   1183.60   1171.25   1155.59  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1126.58; 200 - 1181.19 Low/day: 100 - 1123.73 200 - 1173.84.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Books: An African enigma SWAHILI ORIGINS by James de Vere Allen James Currey(UK)/Ohio Univ. Press Pounds 35/Pounds 12.95, 272 pages THE WORLD OF THE SWAHILI by John Middleton Yale Pounds 19.95, 254 pages THE SILLY season offers a once-a-year opportunity for literary pages to catch up on books which would otherwise be ignored. James de Vere Allen's Swahili Origins is an example. It deserves the attention not just of the African academic but of the historically-aware FT reader who may have an interest in East Africa, because the Swahilis and their culture present one of the more fascinating aspects of that part of the world. Jim Allen was a famous Kenyan character, a scholar who founded the excellent museum on Lamu Island and died young in 1990. John Middleton, a senior Yale anthropologist, has nobly seen through the press the posthumous summation of Allen's lifelong research. That sounds boring. But this is the academic on the front line, and it is fun to watch. There is a long-running argument about the Swahilis. Since 800 AD they have occupied a 1,500-mile stretch of coastal settlements and islands from Somalia to Mozambique. There have never been more than half-a-million of them, but they had - have - a remarkably sophisticated culture (magnificent architecture; a beautiful and poetic language; complex folk traditions). So who are they? The answer - the argument - lies in the mix, the tension, between their African and Arabian roots. Allen was never afraid to push his theories to the limit. He believed that the Swahilis can be traced back, well before the Battle of Hastings, to the imperial town of Shungwaya - 'one of the great enigmas of East African historiography'. The snag is that Shungwaya has not been found; it ought to be somewhere near Lamu, and it must have faded before 1500, but until the archaeologists dig it up it will remain merely a legend and the critics will continue to scoff. It follows that Allen believed in an African essence to the Swahili identity; this is disputed by other academics, who are entitled to point out that a lot of this book is guesswork. As Allen retorts, let's have a better hypothesis. Meanwhile, his book has all sorts of incidental details which confirm the particular fascination of medieval history - we shall not easily forget the Shungwaya ruler who fell from grace not because he deflowered the Coast virgins (which was his princely right) but because he did so with his big toe. John Middleton, who has edited Allen, had earlier produced his own The World of the Swahili. It is an interesting and accessible account of 'the people of the Coast' until it drifts into material too heavily anthropological for the amateur reader. These are both 'academic' books, but they are - both - fascinating and very readable, especially on the beach at Malindi or Shela.</p>

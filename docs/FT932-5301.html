			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Letter: Landlords dislike being bitten Sir, Your otherwise excellent article, 'In search of the private landlord' (June 1), ignores the main reason why the private landlord will remain 'reluctant to revive the private rented sector'. The landlords of long-term tenants are facing the prospect of losing their properties under the provisions of this 'Conservative' government's urban development and leasehold reform bill. Now the principle of expropriation is established who can be sure future ministers, or indeed Sir George Young himself, will not seek to enfranchise short-term tenants too? Once bitten, twice shy.

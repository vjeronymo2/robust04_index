			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: RAINDROPS -- BUT NO CLOUDS -- CAMP OUT AT CHILDRENS CHAIN DINNER  </P> <P> Soppy tuxedos, sprinkled designer gowns and wet hair became simply de rigueur  at the big black-tie do given by the Childrens Chain of Childrens Hospital.  What started out as the most sophisticated of evenings -- balmy cocktails on  the front lawn of Richard Sobelle's magnificent colonial in Brentwood Park --  turned into alarm as raindrops skittered on guests moving to the tennis court  for a sit-down dinner by the sculpted 14-foot Eugenia hedge.  </P> <P> As guests began to sit, clouds dumped dinosaurian raindrops. Some rushed for  the poolhouse, others to the living room and the barbecue corner. More doubled  over under orange and lemon trees. The rain ceased. Then it began again. Start  and stop.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the crowd stayed until 12:30 a.m., dancing up a storm to Daniel  Savant's Orchestra. The band got the driest spot, to protect musical  instruments.  </P> <P> Amazing kudos to these: Laney Techentin and Joan Graves, who moved under their  table and ate their dinner camp-out style. Golden kudos to Nancy and James  Birdwell and Richard and Jenny Schreiber, who with their guests, ate under  brightly colored Mary Poppins-style umbrellas they had the foresight to bring.  Silver kudos to George and Karen Harb, Wayne and Jo Ann Ratkoviche, Gary and  Laurie Griff, Kyle and Nancy Kirwan and Alan and Cuchi Clark who dined with  vintage wine at their tables sheltered only by coral napkins. Plastic kudos to  Richard and Stephanie Johnson, whose dancing-est pals fashioned plastic rain  suits from coverings borrowed from Somerset Catering.  </P> <P> Earlier, Chain president Tink Cheney and ball chairman Brooke Young (in the  most fabulous black Carolyne Roehme one-armed black taffeta), had chorused: "It  isn't going to rain. It isn't going to rain." Their husbands, James Cheney and  James Young, winked in disbelief. Wishing did not make it so.  </P> <P> Some were saying they hadn't had so much fun since camp. As for Silver Birches,  which did the magnificent tall centerpieces, it had well-watered posies. As for  Pamela Clyne, Childrens Chain dinner dance chairman seven years ago when the  dance was totally rained out, she was one of the last to leave.  </P> <P> Well, folks, this is what society does to raise gobs of proceeds for charity.  It would have been mucho thousand less had they rented a tent to outfox the  weather.  </P> <P> MEANWHLE: Nearby, in the neighborhood, under plenty of cover, Clarice and Ed  Ellis were hosting an elegant party to welcome former Angelenos Mary Alice and  Pen Tudor back to town from New York.  </P> <P> PLAUDITS: To Yvonne Fedderson, surprising her best friend Sara O'Meara Sigholtz  at an enormous birthday at the Bistro Gardens. . . . To Susie and Ted Field of  Beverly Hills, who headed the luncheon/fashion show for the Young Musicians  Foundation at the Beverly Hilton. . . . To the Friars honoring the late Johnny  Green at a tribute evening. . . . To Keenan Behrle, chairman of the UCLA Annual  Fund. . . . To Norvel and Helen Young, for their 50th wedding anniversary  party.  </P> <P> HONORS: In its most successful efforts to encourage corporations to promote  health in the business world, the American Cancer Society, Central Los Angeles  Unit, last week honored Donald R. Beall, chairman and CEO of Rockwell  International, with its prestigious Sword of Life award at a luncheon at the  Regent Beverly Wilshire. Rockwell has led the pack, providing 120,000 Rockwell  employees with workplace cancer screenings and educational programs.  </P> <P> Leaders in the audience included Edward Cazier Jr., chairman-elect of the  American Cancer Society (California division), Nancy Keating (Los Angeles  president), Dr. Esther Hays, Beall's wife Joan and Assistance League president  Beverly Thrall.  </P> <P> CAN'T MISS: The Huntington Medical Research Institute's celebration for  neurosurgical research and brain tumor immunotherapy Saturday at Joey Leslie's  estate in San Marino.  </P> <P> PAST PERFECT: Wellesley College alumnae and their president Nan Keohane mapped  plans last week for their largest campaign ever: $150 million. . . . Friends of  the Julia Ann Singer Center, headed by Fay Kozberg, held their annual fashion  fund-  </P> <P> raiser at the Beverly Hilton with designer Michael Novarese, honoring the  Foundations of the Milken Families. . . . The Music Academy of the West in  Santa Barbara is reveling in the excitement of auctioning 60-some items in  Montecito at the party organized by Mrs. Yoel Haller, Mrs. Julian Smith and  Mrs. Thomas Fly.  </P> <P> AGENDA: Hermes hosts the Hermes Grandprix of Los Angeles during the Los Angeles  International Jumping Festival this afternoon at L.A.

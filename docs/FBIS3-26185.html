			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Zhang Yishan,  alternate representative of Chinese delegation, spoke here  Thursday [3 February] on the right of peoples to  self-determination at the 50th session of the Commission on  Human Rights. The following is the excerpt of his statement:    "The right of peoples to self-determination has been  universally recognized as the most fundamental prerequisite to  the enjoyment of all human right and fundamental freedom.    "Respect for the right of peoples to self-determination  means, first and foremost, opposing any foreign aggression,  interference and domination, safeguarding independence,  sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, and ensuring  the people of each country to freely determine their political  status, social system and economic development model. This is a  basic guarantee to a country's survival and the precondition for  the people of each country to fully enjoy their human rights and  fundamental freedom.    "The right of peoples to self-determination is applicable to  peoples who are under foreign or colonial domination and foreign  occupation. It must not be used as a pretext for supporting  aggression or infringing upon the territorial integrity,  sovereignty and political independence of any state.    "The Vienna declaration and program of action adopted by the  World Conference on Human Rights last year clearly points out  that the realization of the peoples to self-determination shall  not be construed as authorizing or encouraging any action which  would dismember or impair, totally or in part, the territorial  integrity or political unity or sovereign and independent  states. [sentence as received]    "The 48th session of the UN General Assembly, in its  recently  adopted resolutions, reaffirms the right of peoples to  self-determination, and the legitimacy of the struggle of people  for independence, territorial integrity and national unity.    "To strictly abide by these principles in today's  international relations has an important and practical  significance. Some events happened in certain parts of the  world have shown that any distorted interpretation and  application of the principle of self-determination, will only  lead to or exacerbate ethnic conflict and social upheaval, or  even result in a civil war or regional conflict, thereby posing  a grave threat to world peace and security.    "How to deal with the right of peoples to self-determination  has become a question of serious concern to the international  community. The Chinese delegation has always maintained that the  international community must uphold the original meaning of this  right and should implement in earnest the principles set out in  the UN Charter and a series of international instruments and UN  resolutions in this regard."</p>

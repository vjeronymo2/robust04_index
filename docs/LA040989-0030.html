			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZAN THOMPSON: SEASON BLOSSOMS IN THE HILLS  </P> <P> Spring has tossed in her petals in the Linda Vista Hills like a no-tomorrow  gambler.  </P> <P> Even my crotchety hill has never looked so handsome. The roses are as big as  lettuces, and even Mandy's cymbidiums are theatrically ruffled. We inherited  the cymbidiums six years ago, along with Mrs. Goldfarb the cat, because Mandy,  Patsy's daughter, and her husband were off to Japan on a tour of duty. Mandy  didn't think either the plants or the old lady cat would live through the  requisite quarantine, so they became our foster charges.  </P> <P> I haven't wanted to tell you but with everything in exuberant bloom, I feel you  are strong enough to hear that dear Mrs. Goldfarb with the green grape eyes,  has nipped off quickly and painlessly with a heart attack. No one knew how old  she was because she adopted Mandy 17 years before she died and she was a young  lady cat then. Patsy and I were consoled because we had managed to give the old  lady six years of pampering and quiet. When she lived with Mandy's family, she  contended with four kids and three Samoyeds. At our house, all she had to put  up with was an occasionally tidy kiss from Peaches.  </P> <P> The cymbidiums were not as adjustable. They hunkered down in their pot and  didn't do anything for four years. One day, our esteemed and treasured friend,  Dr. Arvid Underman, was at the house and looked sadly at the pouting flowers.  He kindly took them home to his greenhouse where he raises exotic blooms of  great beauty and ministers to malcontents belonging to other people. He  separated Mandy's cymbidiums, which were living in woefully overcrowded,  substandard conditions, and placed them in three different pots. This year, for  the first time in their lives, they are flinging forth great garlands of  flowers.  </P> <P> The irises I planted on the driveway hill are vying to see which one can  produce the most ruffled blooms. I love them all but the lemon yellow with the  bright orange center and the chocolate brown are probably my favorites.  </P> <P> Even the azaleas are blooming. (I know other people have great mounds of  azaleas every year but I never have.) And the kolenchoe, the breath of spring  and the amaryllis are loaded with blossom.  </P> <P> I know this isn't a patch on what other people have every year but for me, who  has growing trouble with everything except one giant, aboriginal known to us as  the geranium that ate Pasadena, it's a veritable fairyland of bloom.  </P> <P> I carefully pulled up the tulip bulbs a week or so ago when they stopped  blooming. Tulips are gorgeous but they are niggardly with their flowers. One  flower to a stalk and that's it. I have always been told to refrigerate the  bulbs so the dumb things will think they are slumbering in the dark cool of the  forest and be ready to be put in the ground in the fall, where they will bloom  in the early spring. I have never been able to make that work.  </P> <P> Someone -- Doug, Tim, Patsy or maybe old Green Thumb herself -- has always  thrown them out during the winter months, thinking they were long-tailed onions  or just because of boredom with looking at them. Last winter, Patsy threw them  in a stew by mistake, and although I am not suggesting this is a gourmet  fillip, we didn't know the difference. Recently, I read an article by a tulip  specialist who said to toss the bulbs out and start all over again in the fall.  </P> <P> I am sorry to say that I have nothing for a garden encore. When these pretty  things are finished, it's back to geraniums and roses for the rest of the year.  Actually, that's not too bad. The rose bushes get to be big, hulking brutes  with thorns like Malay daggers and have blooms until they are pruned in  January.  </P> <P> Happy springtime, everybody, and I think I'll just go ahead and throw out the  tulip bulbs right now.  </P></p>

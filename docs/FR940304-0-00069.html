			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra giffardii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the African violet family (Gesneriaceae)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a shrubby tree usually 10 to 20 ft (3 to 6 m) tall. The opposite, stalked, papery-textured, toothed leaves are usually 2.4 to 4.7 in (6 to 12 cm) long and 1 to 1.8 in (2.5 to 4.6 cm) wide and have a few tiny, coarse hairs on the upper surface. Clusters of three to five flowers have a moderate amount of short brown hairs throughout the cluster, a main stalk 1 to 1.4 in (2.5 to 3.5 cm) long, two linear bracts about 0.25 in (6 to 7 mm) long, and individual flower stalks 0.6 to 1.2 in (1.5 to 3 cm) long. The calyx, 0.1 to 0.4 in (3 to 9 mm) long, has an outer covering of short, soft brown hairs and is divided into five narrowly triangular lobes. The corolla consists of five fused white petals about 0.5 in (12 mm) long, with lobes about 0.08 to 0.1 in (2 to 3 mm) long. Only immature berries have been observed, and they were white and about 0.4 in (1 cm) long. Both this species and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra tintinnabula <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are distinguished from others of the genus and others on the island of Hawaii by a combination of the following characteristics: The opposite, more or less elliptic, papery leaves; the presence of some hairs on the leaves and more on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the inflorescences; the presence of three to six flowers per inflorescence; and the size and shape of the flowers and flower parts (Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra giffardii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was found on the island of Hawaii on the northeastern slope of Mauna Kea near Kilau Stream and south to the eastern slope of Mauna Loa near Kilauea Crater. The 3 extant populations on State-owned land are located near Kilau Stream, Stainback Highway, and Puu Makaala, extending over a distance of approximately 31 by 3 mi (50 by 5 km) and containing a total of about 14 to 20 plants (HHP 1991j1 to 1991j5; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992). This species typically grows in shady koa-, 'ohi'a-, and tree fern-dominated Montane Wet Forests at elevations between 2,400 and 4,900 ft (720 and 1,500 m) (HHP 1991j1 to 1991j3, HPCC 1991d1, 1991d2, Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). Associated species include other taxa of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (ha'iwale),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hedyotis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spp., and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Perrottetia sandwicensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (olomea) (HHP 1991j1 to 1991j3, HPCC 1991d1; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992). The major threats to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra giffardii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disturbance and plant damage by feral pigs as well as stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing populations (Stone 1985; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on a plant he collected in 1909 on Mauna Kea, island of Hawaii, Rock named  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra tintinnabula. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The specific epithet describes the bell-shaped calyx of the plant (Rock 1919a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra tintinnabula <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the African violet family is a shrub 3.3 to 6.6 ft (1 to 2 m) tall with opposite, stalked, elliptical or oval, papery-textured leaves 5 to 10 in (13 to 26 cm) long and 2 to 4.8 in (5 to 12.3 cm) wide. Leaves, especially the lower surfaces, have yellowish-brown hairs. Flower clusters, densely covered with long soft hairs, comprise three to six flowers, a main stalk 0.4 to 0.7 in (1 to 1.8 cm) long, individual flower stalks 0.2 to 0.6 in (0.5 to 1.5 cm) long, and leaflike bracts. The green bell-shaped calyx is about 0.4 in (9 to 10 mm) long and has triangular lobes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hairy white corolla, about 0.5 in (12 mm) long and about 0.2 in (5 mm) in diameter, is divided into five lobes, each about 0.1 in (3 mm) long. Fruit and seeds have not been observed. This species differs from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra giffardii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by its habit, its larger leaves, and its shorter flower stalks (Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

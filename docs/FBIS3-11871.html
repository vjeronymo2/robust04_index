The organization  will be called the 2000 Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement  [Movimiento Revolucionario Bolivariano 2000 -- a play on the  name of Chavez's military movement, the 200 Revolutionary  Bolivarian Movement, which emerged during the 4 February 1992  coup attempt]. Chavez and 14 lower-ranking officers of the  Venezuelan Army were released today. They were pardoned by  President Rafael Caldera who is seeking reconciliation within  the Armed Forces after the two 1992 coup attempts.    Dozens of supporters were waiting for Chavez when he was  released at the military hospital were he had been held. He  called on them to search for "the structural changes needed by  the country" by forming a "wide national front." The Bolivarian  Movement emerged after the 4 February 1992 military coup attempt  against then-President Carlos Andres Perez on the grounds that  Perez's economic adjustment policies were hurting the people.  Meanwhile, thousands of other supporters gathered outside the  San Carlos de Caracas military garrison to receive the 14  officres who participated with Chavez in the coup against Perez,  whom they accused of being "corrupt and a traitor."    Meanwhile, in Peru, General Francisco Visconti, one of the  leaders of the 27 November 1992 military uprising, announced  that at least 25 officers who took asylum in that country would  return to Venezuela to surrender to military justice tomorrow,  Sunday. With the release of Chavez and the 14 officers, the  number of people granted presidential pardons, which are part of  President Rafael Caldera's so-called "pacification policy," has  risen to 60. With the exception of Gen. Visconti and the 46  officers who took asylum in Peru, practically all of the leaders  of the two coup attempts carried out two years ago have been  released.</p>

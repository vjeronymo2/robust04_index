			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Timber groups attack grant scheme A grant scheme for tree planting was criticised by timber groups yesterday for failing to provide enough incentives for new land or money to be put into forestry. The Forestry Commission scheme is part of government efforts to boost production of conifers for timber and improve woodland management. The scheme involves an increase of at least 10 per cent in funding, although the total has not yet been agreed with the Treasury. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said the scheme particularly aimed to ensure a steady supply of softwood for UK timber processing in the next century. New conifer planting has fallen from 25,000 hectares a year to about 10,500 hectares since the abolition of controversial tax incentives in 1988. Britain produces only about 14 per cent of its timber needs. Under the scheme the grant for new conifer plantations increases to Pounds 700 a hectare, up from Pounds 615 for plantings of 10 hectares or more. Farmers will be encouraged to turn surplus arable or grassland over to conifers with a Pounds 200 a hectare increase in special grants for this purpose to Pounds 600. To improve existing woodland, the commission is offering discretionary payments for work that leads to 'significant environmental benefits'. There is also a new annual grant of Pounds 80 a hectare for farmers who promote regeneration of woodland by preventing grazing. The Timber Growers' Association, which represents woodland owners and forestry businesses, said the package amounted to 'tinkering' rather than a successful forestry strategy. The association also expressed disappointment at the absence of moves to widen forestry ownership by making it possible to buy shares in a forestry investment scheme rather than having to buy a whole forest.</p>

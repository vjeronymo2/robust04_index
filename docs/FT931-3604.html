			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sotheby's falls to Dollars 6.5mas auction income dives PRE-TAX profits at Sotheby's Holdings, the auction house which is controlled by the Detroit-based Taubman family but still quoted in London and New York, tumbled from Dollars 21.5m to Dollars 6.49m, or Pounds 4.57m sterling, in 1992. The main cause of the fall was that pre-tax income from auctions declined to Dollars 4.02m (Dollars 18.9m) on revenues up slightly at Dollars 200.9m (Dollars 193.9m), though profits from financial services slipped to Dollars 5.21m (Dollars 7.81m) on revenues down at Dollars 14.5m (Dollars 20.6m). However real estate profits grew to Dollars 2.09m (Dollars 312,000) on revenues ahead at Dollars 9.63m (Dollars 7.83m). The company said: 'Auction sales increased modestly' to Dollars 1.13bn (Dollars 1.1bn). Operating income emerged at Dollars 1.1m (losses Dollars 3.82m), though this excluded income from Sotheby's principal activities sharply down at Dollars 1.77m (Dollars 15.9m) and one-off restructuring costs of Dollars 4.86m. This resulted in operating losses from the auction activities of Dollars 1.99m (profits Dollars 12.1m). Earnings per share dropped to 7 cents (25 cents). The company said there had been improvements in certain areas and that the Impressionist and Modern market had been more stable. Here the Dollars 10m barrier was broken for the first time since 1990 when Henri Matisse's L'Asie was sold for Dollars 11m. It added that in 1992 it had sold 70 works for more than Dollars 1m, against 51 in 1991.</p>

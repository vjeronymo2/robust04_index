			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Arts: Monteverdi's 'Orfeo' - Boston Early Music Festival The Boston Early Music Festival and Exhibition is the annual American rally for cornetto freaks, luthiers and glass-harmonica makers, besides offering also a crowded bouquet of performances: for a few days the city's churches, chapels and meeting halls resounded this year to Byrd, to 14th-century cabaret, and to viola da gamba players flying on the good fortune here of Alain Corneau's 'Tous les matins du monde'. The main event - held in the Sanders Theatre of Memorial Hall, Harvard's equivalent in architectural appeal to the Oxford Union - was a staging of the Monteverdi Orfeo, under the musical direction of Andrew Parrott. He is a festival regular. His brisk, fit performances of the Bach suites with the BEMF Orchestra have just been released on CD, and previous festivals have yielded fine concert recordings of the Mozart Requiem and C minor Mass. In that succession, the Orfeo was disappointing. Early music people have long been an international family, but the combination here of British musicians (Parrott, Andrew Lawrence-King) and Americans (the strings of The King's Noyse, the wind band Concerto Palatino, and sundry continuo players) sounded like an assortment of separate parties, some of them with their own ideas about intonation (the kit fiddles used for Monteverdi's 'violini piccioli alla francese' were particularly acid). The singing had its problems too - chiefly of dullness. For a breath of life one had to wait, paradoxically, for the underworld scene where Orpheus meets Charon. Joseph Cornwell's 'Possente spirito' was, like his whole performance in the central role, studied, efficient and uniform, but Jan Opalach as the Stygian oarsman produced a nice cameo of dim-witted nobility. Maybe all the others were thoroughly depressed by their clothes. Someone had gone to the trouble of consulting drawings of masque costumes by Inigo Jones and others, but the results - badly made, in modern textiles synthetically dyed - were lamentable. With almost all the cast made up as rosy-cheeked dolls, with clumsy efforts at rhetorical grouping and posture, and with a coarsely painted and crude simulacrum of a Baroque set, the visual experience was dire: maybe that, more than anything else, was responsible for the musical failures. Singers perform well when they look good. Instrumentalists, in a singer-focused opera, concede to the messages they hear from the stage. What we heard from both may well have been dismay.</p>

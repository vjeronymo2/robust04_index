			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: In other words Sir, Jim Kelly reports ('Electronic tax return spells end for dreaded form', November 7) Mr John Whiting as saying: 'We do need to incentivise our system.' This, I understand, will hugeify the beneficiations to be obtained by the electronicisation of our tax returns. The cost of modifying the English language to accommodate these developments has to be allowed for. Perhaps Dr Marshall of The Oxford Dictionary Group may care to comment.

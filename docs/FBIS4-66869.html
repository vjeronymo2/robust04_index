			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Weapons Developer Georgiy Tsyrkov interviewed by Vladimir </F> Gubarev: ``Reflection of the Nuclear Age: Georgiy Tsyrkov on the  Fate of Nuclear Weapons Past and Present'']    [Text] I have been trying to interview Georgiy  Aleksandrovich Tsyrkov for 25 years. I think it was a few days  before a gas flare was extinguished in Urtabulak that Minister  of Medium Machine-Building Yefim Pavlovich Slavskiy gave  permission to me, a correspondent for KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA in  those years, to witness an experiment. ``And now I will  introduce you,'' he said, ``to our main `producer.' Take a good  look at him, for a journalist he is a mine of information! He  knows everything about weapons, but he won't talk about them.  Bear in mind that I am permitting all subjects except  `products,' you have no right to go near that subject. But don't  worry: You won't be allowed to anyway.'' Yefim Pavlovich  laughed, apparently quite pleased with his joke.    A few minutes later I met Georgiy Aleksandrovich Tsyrkov,  chief of the ministry's most secretive chief administration. As  it turned out, we established a good rapport. To be honest, I  tried several times in recent years to strike up a conversation  about weapons, but Georgiy Aleksandrovich always said no. And  understandably so, for his assessments of various researchers,  designers, events, successes, and failures could not be ``purely  personal''--he held too high a position in the ``nuclear  pyramid'' that had formed not just in our country, but also  throughout the world. To bear responsibility for a nuclear  weapons program is too heavy a load, and he always has to be  cautious. After all, people are people, and the comments of a  chief administration director are too important. Moreover, it is  hard to assess one's own work from the side, for Georgiy  Aleksandrovich Tsyrkov has been at the center of events from the  creation and testing of the first atomic bomb to the present.    However, quite recently I nonetheless succeeded in  conducting  the much-sought interview. There was a good occasion for doing  so: The birthday of Yuliy Borisovich Khariton is approaching,  and I took advantage of it. Georgiy Aleksandrovich couldn't help  but say some good things about Khariton. Then the discussion  moved on to other subjects, although again, Tsyrkov could not  speak with a level of openness that would fully open many pages  of the history of nuclear weapons. And he was probably right  again on this score: The time has not yet come when it might be  possible to tell all secrets to the public. In both the past and  the present, the development, production and testing of nuclear  and thermonuclear weapons remain one of the most tightly guarded  secrets of any state. And international treaties ban the  proliferation of nuclear technologies--the world is too fragile  and not as secure as some might think.    And so I present excerpts of my discussion with Georgiy  Aleksandrovich Tsyrkov. We talked only about the tip of the  iceberg; the bulk of it remains in the depths of an ocean of  secrecy.    Gubarev: When did you first meet Yuliy Borisovich?    Tsyrkov: In 1948, when intensive efforts were  under way to develop the first model of our nuclear weapon. I  saw him at work, and he was energetic and demanding. He followed  literally every measurement and carefully analyzed all areas of  work. In general, Khariton was everywhere. At least that's the  impression one got, and it was close to reality.    Gubarev: Where was that?    Tsyrkov: In Arzamas. I went there and ended up in  the sector that was intensively engaged in developing the  warhead, and so Yuliy Borisovich and I immediately established  working contact.    Gubarev: What exactly were your duties?    Tsyrkov: To fine-tune the design of the first  warhead in actual dimensions. Many parts were various laboratory  models and so forth, and I was assigned to a group led by  Zakharenkov. We were engaged in so-called ``physical final  design.''    Gubarev: In the celebrated ``green house''?    Tsyrkov: It was white then.    Gubarev: Where the security was especially tight,  with the lowest rank being captain, as I recall?    Tsyrkov: That's right.    Gubarev: And Khariton was there all the time?    Tsyrkov: Of course. He hardly ever left.    Gubarev: He was the director, a theoretician, was  he not?    Tsyrkov: That's incorrect. He was always not only  a very talented theoretician, but also a very talented  experimenter. He was interested in every detail, every  experimental method. And for this reason his advice was always  useful. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of nuclear physics,  explosives, and metallurgy. It was simply amazing: His knowledge  in all fields of science was so vast! I am not saying this for  flattery, not because it is Khariton's birthday. It is the  absolute truth!    Gubarev: But today many people in both the West  and in our country write that the first atomic bomb was not our  achievement, that all the data were obtained by intelligence  operatives, and that Fuchs, in particular, provided detailed  information about the bomb.    Tsyrkov: Yes, that's what they say, but I can't  agree. I became convinced from my own experience that we had to  work through literally every detail of the ``product,'' and very  carefully at that. Naturally, I did not know at the time, nor  did most people, that Fuchs had provided any materials. We  didn't read anything, and we worked out all the details from  scratch, from ``a'' to ``z.'' Maybe Khariton and Shchelkin read  something. If Fuchs did pass something on, it was a general  plan, but all the technology and details are incredibly complex.  The verification methods, physical parameters, technology for  making the most complex measurements and so forth--Fuchs did not  pass on any of that, nor could he have! The general plan for the  first American atomic bomb would have something else. Such data  would be important, of course, especially for that time, but the  development of our first model required the development of an  entire complex of sciences and production, the acquisition of  equipment and much, much more. At the time, we who were directly  involved in the project thought that we were doing everything  from scratch. We had no prompting.    Gubarev: How did it happen that you were  immediately assigned to Zakharenkov's special group?    Tsyrkov: I worked in the Ground Forces Engineering  Academy where professor Georgiy Iosifovich Pokrovskiy was head  of a department and laboratory. He was a very talented  researcher in gas dynamics and demolitions.    Gubarev: As well as a very talented artist!    Tsyrkov: That's right. And a very intelligent and  kind man. And fortunately, I worked for him after graduating  from the Moscow Higher Technical School. I was working on  munitions. When they started selecting specialists for  Arzamas-16, I got an offer to go there. Obviously, because I was  already a demolitions specialist, and for that reason I was  immediately assigned to Zakharenkov's group.    Gubarev: No doubt all that was happening seemed  strange to you.    Tsyrkov: Absolutely. We realized what an enormous  task confronted the country--it was essential to end the  Americans' monopoly on nuclear weapons, and so everybody worked  at full capacity. Everybody without exception. We worked till  two and four o'clock in the morning, ignoring our own interests;  there was just one desire--to develop the atomic bomb as quickly  as possible. Incidentally, we never mentioned it, except perhaps  only in whispers, although everybody know, of course, what we  were doing. This, the work, is what was unusual. And the whole  country was helping us. While it was sometimes hard to obtain  equipment and various materials for Pokrovskiy's laboratory,  there we had a ``green light.'' The work was interesting and  enjoyable.    Gubarev: You are one of the few people present at  the tests of the first atomic bomb. What did you do there?    Tsyrkov: I was assigned by General Pavel  Mikhaylovich Zernov to the operations group, which consisted of  three people: Yegorov, Maslov, and myself. We made sure that  preparations for the first test proceeded on schedule. I had  responsibility for ``scientific aspects of preparations,'' which  is to say physical measurements, equipment, and preparation of  the ``product.'' Maslov was in charge of design, and Yegorov was  in charge of experimental production. Pavel Mikhaylovich  obviously saw me as a fairly good organizer, and that path  ultimately led to become director of the Ministry of Medium  Machine-Building and the Russian Ministry of Nuclear Power chief  administration in charge of producing nuclear weapons. When I  went to the test range, it happened that I essentially become  the assistant to Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov for all matters  relating to coordinating the work of all divisions and so on. In  addition to organizational work, I also participated in  Zhuchikhin's group, which prepared the ``product'' detonation  lines. We were also in the tower, prepared the control panel in  the command and control facility and the detonation lines. We  were supervised by Kirill Ivanovich Shchelkin.    Gubarev: The man who was ``responsible'' for the  bomb and who detonated it?    Tsyrkov: At that time he was neither a three-time  Hero nor a corresponding member.    Gubarev: Were those good times? How do you look  back at them?    Tsyrkov: I think those years were exceptionally  unusual. The work was interesting, important, and enjoyable. We  knew that we were doing something very important and essential  for the country.    Gubarev: Who stands out in your memory most? I  know that you consider Zernov your mentor. What about the others?    Tsyrkov: At the tests, Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov.  He was striking in terms of his energy, knowledge, and  determination. You would look into his eyes and feel that some  sort of radiation was coming from them. He had a stimulating  effect on people. I probably have the strongest impression of  Igor Vasilyevich at that time.    Gubarev: You met and worked with very many  outstanding people. Tell me, for example, about Kirill Ivanovich  Shchelkin. Unfortunately, little is known about him.    Tsyrkov: He was a thorough researcher. Not only  was he involved in theoretical research on gas dynamics and  nuclear physics; he also knew how to ``build bridges'' to  practical work. He was a magnificent experimenter and organizer.  He was Yuliy Borisovich Khariton's first assistant for nuclear  weapons development. Unfortunately, he fell ill, left our work,  and died shortly thereafter. It is said that he ``burnt out in  his work,'' and this fully applies to Kirill Ivanovich Shchelkin.    Gubarev: What happened to you after the first bomb  test?    Tsyrkov: I left Zakharenkov's group and was  offered a position in the research department as a deputy to  Yekaterina Alekseyevna Feoktistova. She was a very famous  scientist and demolitions specialist. In that period I was  engaged in the first research on magnetic commulation  [kommulyatsia], which had been proposed by Andrey Dmitriyevich  Sakharov. This refers to the direct conversion of the energy of  a blast into magnetic energy. We conducted the first experiment.  There were no instruments, and we wanted to convince ourselves  that we were on the right path. Was it really possible to  convert blast energy directly into magnetic energy? I proposed  that we set up simple neon lamps. The first experiment was  conducted in April 1952, and it was very successful--the lamps  turned on. Sakharov's idea was confirmed. Back then this was all  new; today this field has been developed and new experiments are  under way. And only recent the two nuclear centers of Arzamas-16  and Los Alamos began working together.    Gubarev: I can confirm that the experiment was  successful--I was there!    Tsyrkov: Back then we were just getting started,  taking the first steps. We continue to lead in this field, just  ahead of the Americans.    Gubarev: And after that?    Tsyrkov: A new ``facility'' was being set up in  the Urals.    Gubarev: Hold on! You mean you were involved in  developing the hydrogen bomb?    Tsyrkov: You have good information. Indeed, I was  also involved in developing the first hydrogen bomb and took  part in the tests.    Gubarev: Was the detonation frightening?    Tsyrkov: No. I was in an emplacement from which  the detonation was controlled. It was 10 kilometers from the  epicenter. All the effects were known, and we felt them. Still,  my main impression is of when we emerged after the shock wave  passed, and we saw an enormous red cloud over us. It hung over  us, frightening and unusual. We got in the cars and left, you  couldn't stay there.    Gubarev: Did you take part in essentially all the  tests?    Tsyrkov: I once tried to count them, but I  couldn't. One hundred or 150, maybe 300--I don't remember. I  need to take a look at the lists of participants in each  experiment some time--they have certainly been preserved.    Gubarev: What took you to the Urals, to  Chelyabinsk-70?    Tsyrkov: An accident, you could say. I went to  Moscow, dropped in at the ministry, where we were working on a  new piece of equipment, and I ran into Kirill Ivanovich  Shchelkin. He immediately said that he wanted to offer me a  position as his first deputy. ``Agreed?'' he asked. ``I would  follow you to the edge of the earth!'' I answered. And that is  how I was first transferred to the Urals.    Gubarev: Why was it necessary to create a second  nuclear center?    Tsyrkov: Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev was Central  Committee First Secretary at that time. And he felt that a  backup for Arzamas-16 was needed. You will recall that not  everything was calm in the world at that time. It was 1955, the  height of the cold war, and there was a real danger that it  would become a hot war. It that event, the ``facility''--that  is, Arzamas-16--could be destroyed, and the country would lose  its nuclear weapons developers, there wouldn't be anyone to  service the weapons or designers to supervise their maintenance,  and so forth. I think that is why the decision was made to  establish Chelyabinsk-70. Secondly, any monopoly is harmful;  without competition, a field can become stalled. And both  research and design work go far more slowly in the absence of  competition, as we said at the time. And indeed, once we had two  institutes, there began a constructive competition of ideas,  methods, and ways of solving various design problems. I think  the appearance of the center in the Urals was of enormous  benefit to the development of the nuclear weapons complex.    Gubarev: I would now like to ask you, as director  of the chief administration in charge of both federal centers,  what are the virtues of each one? And naturally, what  shortcomings at Arzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70 do you see today?    Tsyrkov: Of course, Arzamas-16 has more  traditions, its physical sector is more developed, and it is  better equipped. The two centers probably have equal  capabilities with respect to gas dynamics. Experimental  production--that is, plants--is more advanced at Chelyabinsk-70,  simply because it was established later, and hence the equipment  is better. The theoreticians are close in terms of skills and  talent. However, there is one difference: Chelyabinsk-70 has a  younger staff, and so in the early years one sensed fervor,  vigor, a search for unusual solutions. A certain conservatism at  Arzamas-16 began to affect its work, while in the Urals, as is  characteristic of youth, bolder decisions were sought and found.  I don't want to talk about shortcomings, because it is my job to  rectify them! Moreover, in my view, we ourselves can sort our  problems out better and faster, excuse me, ``without the help of  the public.''    Gubarev: So secrecy plays a role?    Tsyrkov: How could it be otherwise?! We're not  accustomed to giving interviews.    Gubarev: Georgiy Aleksandrovich, in what way do  modern nuclear weapons differ from the ones you developed in the  early 1950's?    Tsyrkov: The difference is enormous, very great  progress has been made! I won't go into any design features. I  will only say that given equal yields, weights and volumes  differ by a factor of tens. The automatic equipment that  controls detonation has changed sharply and unrecognizably! For  example, the automatic equipment that sends signals to the  warhead used to weigh 300 kilograms, while today it weighs 150.  That's the kind of progress that has been made! The element base  has changed, and our scientists and designers have made an  enormous contribution to the development of this field of  science and technology. Not just in nuclear hardware, but in the  field as a whole. So the differences are very great. Not to  mention the wide assortment of ``products'' that perform  strictly defined functions. The progress is apparent not only in  figures; one only need visit the Nuclear Weapons Museum at  Arzamas and Chelyabinsk and then compare what you see with the  weapons that are sometimes shown on television. You don't have  to be a specialist.    Gubarev: Why so many weapons? I understand that  the politicians demanded new projects from you, but you should  have understood that such numbers of nuclear weapons were  unnecessary.    Tsyrkov: I didn't have that problem, since we had  little information. But there was real competition with a  certain adversary across the ocean, to which we did not have a  right to fall behind in technical terms. For example, we learned  that the Americans were developing some sort of antimissile  defense weapons. Were we not obliged to take appropriate steps?  We understood that if we did nothing, our missiles wouldn't  reach them, and hence they would acquire military superiority.  The same applies to naval weapons and other types. That concerns  types. As for the numbers of warheads, I honestly admit that I  didn't even know; nothing was said of this to us the developers,  everything was decided ``at the top.'' So nuclear weapons  developers are not to blame for ``nuclear excesses.''    Gubarev: The following question is logical: What  is nuclear disarmament, in your view?    Tsyrkov: If it is to be carried out properly, we  have to not only dismantle the nuclear warhead, but also convert  the plutonium and uranium to a state in which they cannot be  reused in weapons. Then you can talk about complete disarmament.  But I don't think we can do that as yet, since the situation in  the world is complex and dangerous. There are many so-called  ``threshold countries'' that could start testing and developing  nuclear weapons. They are well known. They may not be able to  develop sophisticated ``products,'' but they are fully capable  of ``primitive'' ones.    Gubarev: What is a ``safe'' nuclear weapon?    Tsyrkov: To talk about it, I would have to reveal  the design, and I don't want to do that. So I will confine  myself only to some general aspects. A ``safe'' nuclear weapon  rules out the possibility of nuclear detonation in any accident,  by any operator error, in a fire, or when being transported.  That was the first stage. The next one is to develop designs  that cannot disperse plutonium. It is very dangerous, and  everything possible is being done to make sure this never  happens under any conditions.    Gubarev: I saw how a train car holding a container  built up speed and then smashed into a concrete wall. But no  scattering occurred?    Tsyrkov: That was just one of many tests. We are  trying to ensure the full safety of our ``products''--it's one  of our main tasks today. Fortunately, we have many years of  positive experience--we have had no Chernobyl-type accidents  with weapons. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the  Americans.    Gubarev: When will there be real nuclear  disarmament?    Tsyrkov: You're asking a bad question.    Gubarev: Why?    Tsyrkov: I think that nuclear weapons should  exist. And they will. By treaty, we and the Americans will both  have 3,500 warheads in the early 21st century. So nuclear  weapons are going to stay. And 3,500 is a lot. The country's  self-defense system requires that we retain a certain number of  ``products.''    Gubarev: Have you ever thought that nuclear  weapons would be used sometime?    Tsyrkov: We have always felt that our country's  weapons are intended only for a counterstrike. No one in our  country has ever thought that we are the sort of ``aggressors''  and ``nuclear monsters'' capable of launching a first strike.  Nothing of the kind! And we worked as hard as we did, forgoing a  lot of things in life, only because we knew that the defense of  this country and our motherland was in our hands. We understood  that policy.    Gubarev: If you had to start life over again,  would you go into this field?    Tsyrkov: Absolutely! I am still happy that I was  able to enter this branch of science. I have always been an  ``arms-maker,'' I found it interesting, and, finally, each of us  should regard himself as a defender of the fatherland. That is  real patriotism, if you please. As a youth I dreamed about  becoming an officer, I wanted to enroll in a tank academy. But  they didn't take me right out of school, and then I developed  vision difficulties. And so I wound up in the military  department at the Moscow Higher Technical School, at least close  to the army. I became a munitions specialist. Life was hard for  our generation, but we spared nothing--not even ourselves!--for  the country, for the motherland. If you don't know that, if you  don't feel it, it is impossible to understand why and how we  developed nuclear weapons in such a short time.</p>

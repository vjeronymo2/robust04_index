The delegation  saw the remains of the savage destruction wrought by the Israeli  occupation forces before the heroic town was liberated.    The al-Qunaytirah governor briefed the delegation on the  sacrifices made by the people of the governorate and the Syrian  Arab people to defend the homeland, the Palestinian cause, and  the Arab nation's causes. The governor said: Syria is working  to realize the just and comprehensive peace expounded by  President Hafiz al-Asad -- the peace of the brave. This will  restore occupied Arab territories and return rights to their  owners, based on UN resolutions. The governor also presented  Mr. Darawshah with the shield of liberated al-Qunaytirah.    Replying to the governor's speech, Darawshah said: We are  pleased to arrive in this governorate, which is a dear part of  Syria and the Arab nation. We look forward to the bright future  when this part will be merged with the other side of the  occupied Golan, which will have to be liberated and returned to  Syria and the Arab nation.    Darawshah conveyed the love of our people in occupied  Palestine and the Golan to the sons of the Syrian Arab people  and the wise leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad.    Darawshah said: We bow our heads and pay homage to the  Syrian people's sacrifices and martyrs for the sake of Palestine  and the Arab nation.    Concluding his speech, Darawshah said: Victory will  inevitably be realized. Occupied Golan will return to Syria.  This is the peace we understand, a peace that restores rights  their owners and ends Israel's occupation of all occupied Arab  territories. This is the cherished peace as described by  President Hafiz al-Asad, the peace of the brave.    In a statement to the SANA correspondent, Darawshah said:  The destruction we have seen demonstrates the savagery of the  occupation. This is a deplorable crime by the occupation  against al-Qunaytirah. Other acts of aggression and savage  practices have been carried out in other parts of Arab  countries, especially inside Palestine. Hundreds of villages  were destroyed. Thus, the Israeli occupation has added other  crimes to its series of criminal actions.    Darawshah called for Israel's withdrawal from occupied Golan  and for its return to its Syrian owners so Syrians, under the  leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad, can rebuild  al-Qunaytirah, return its inhabitants, who were driven out, and  so it will return to its Syrian mother.    Darawshah and his delegation visited the martyrs cemetery,  placed a wreath on the martyr's monument, and read prayers for  the martyrs' chaste souls. He wrote an article in the visitors'  book in which he praised the heroic struggle of the Syrian Armed  Forces supported by the heroic Syrian people in defense of Arab  territory. Darawshah said: We are certain the darkness of the  occupation will end and the Israeli occupation will leave  occupied Syrian Golan and all occupied Arab territories.</p>

Meeting Deng Nan, visiting vice minister of China's State  Science and Technology Commission, Keating said that further  strengthening of the science links between China and Australia  will be beneficial to the economic development of not only the  two countries themselves but also the Asia Pacific region.    During the meeting, Deng briefed Keating on China's plan of  science and technology development in the 21st century, in which  Keating expressed his interest.    As a guest of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs  and Trade, Deng is currently on a 9-day visit here starting from  March 20.</p>

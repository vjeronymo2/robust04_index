			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / International Company News: Saab-Scania blamed for 80% slide at Investor INVESTOR, the main holding company of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family, yesterday blamed a worse performance from Saab-Scania, its vehicle and aerospace arm, and lower capital gains, for an 80 per cent drop in first-half profits after financial items, to SKr406m (Dollars 51m). Capital gains were SKr1bn less than a year ago, at SKr986m, while Saab-Scania's profits fell to SKr581m from SKr1.17bn following weak demand for many of its key products, including trucks, buses and aircraft. Investor says it expects Saab-Scania's full-year profits to be 'significantly lower' than 1992's SKr2.13bn. However, it did not give a forecast for the group result. All Saab-Scania's business areas reported lower income, except Saab-Scania Finance. Group sales fell 5 per cent to SKr13bn, while order bookings tumbled to SKr12.3bn from SKr23.3bn. Sales of trucks and buses fell to SKr8.19bn from SKr8.38bn, as the number of units sold dropped to 12,400 from 15,000. Although Saab Aircraft sales were unchanged at SKr1.77bn, new orders contracted sharply to SKr1.1bn from SKr12.0bn. Saab-Scania is a half owner in Saab Automobile, which earlier reported a SKr684m loss after financial items for the first half. It is also the leading member of the consortium manufacturing the JAS 39 Gripen multi-role fighter jet. It says it faced extra costs following the spectacular crash of one of the aircraft in central Stockholm two weeks ago, but hoped to have made the necessary changes to the steering system - which has been blamed for the disaster - within a month. Investor said the value of its strategic investment portfolio, which includes stakes in Swedish blue chips Astra, Ericsson, and Stora, amounted to SKr21.6bn at June 30. This represents an underlying 6 per cent increase in value since the start of the year, well below the overall 19 per cent increase in the stock market. Group net worth has fallen to SKr25.4bn from SKr32.4bn since the year end, primarily because of the fall in Saab-Scania's earnings.</p>

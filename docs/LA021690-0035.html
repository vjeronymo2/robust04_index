			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: FRAMING A BIG TIP  </P> <P> Beverly Hills hairdresser Dusty Fleming had one of those weeks last week. He  was shuttling about town do-ing some major heads -- Barry Manilow, Marvin  Davis, the Jordan Hubner and John Davis wedding party -- when he got the call  to Century Plaza to take an even more pressing assignment: Barbara Bush was in  town and needed a do. Although Fleming wouldn't charge for his services, Mrs.  Bush did give him a $10 tip, which, instead of pocketing, he framed.  </P> <P> GO GO'S BY FLO-JO: Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner, complete  with short-for-her, vivid-pink nails, quietly introduced her Flo-Jo by Mizuno  activewear/leisurewear earlier this week in Los Angeles. The  functional-but-fashionable sweat suits, T-shirts, tank tops, cropped tops,  biker shorts, stretch pants and cropped leggings have Flo-Jo's name emblazoned  across many of the pieces (sometimes it's her name and her portrait). But don't  go looking for these Japanese-made garments, which she helped design, unless  you're shopping in Japan. Prestigious department stores there are also privy to  the Florence Joyner Signature line of dresses and separates, and the Joyner  Dash line of casual sportswear, both of which are manufactured by Sosukaya.  </P> <P> $1,000 DATE: Some teens will spend as much as $1,000 to go to the prom,  according to Your Prom magazine, the new publication from Modern Bride. The  premiere issue of the magazine hit the newsstands last week. Should teens be  captivated by such articles as "Creative Corsaging," the publishers say Your  Prom will become an annual "write" of spring.  </P> <P> FASHION STAT: Thirty percent of the costume jewelry sales in the United States  are by Avon.  </P> <P> WHICH CAME FIRST?: "Dick Tracy," starring Warren Beatty and Madonna, is  scheduled to premiere June 15. But the spin-off merchandise is already in the  stores or on the truck. Village Mews, a Van Nuys-based T-shirt company, has its  $14 Dick Tracy T-shirts in Trendy Gifts in Torrance, Cartoon Junction in  Sherman Oaks and L.A. T-shirt Museum in Westwood. Jacques Moret, a bodywear  line imprinted with Dick Tracy logos, will be available by April at Bullock's.  And Timex will offer watches featuring our handsome hero, Breathless Mahoney  (Madonna's character) and Tracy's adversary, Flattop, available in May for  $29.95. (The first Dick Tracy watch, manufactured by the New Haven Watch Co. in  1934, sold for $2.65.) Jewelry designer Wendy Gell is on the bandwagon with a  variety of jewelry pieces priced from $12 to $35 that will be available in  March or April at Nordstrom and Disney stores.  </P> <P> FASHION FUTURES: The '90s may mean less constrictive office wear for men.  According to the 1990s Trend Forecast Report from the Rhinebeck, N.Y.-based,  Socio-Economic Research Institute of America, necktie sales will decline during  the decade because of the global warming trend and other environmental changes.

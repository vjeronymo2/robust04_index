			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OCEANSIDE SOUP KITCHEN PLANS MOVE; UNWANTED DOWNTOWN  </P> <P> Brother Benno's soup kitchen, acclaimed for its compassion for the poor, soon  may leave downtown Oceanside, where neighbors have complained that the  establishment attracts drunks and loiterers.  </P> <P> The Brother Benno's Foundation, that has run the eatery in an old house on  Minnesota Street since 1983, has applied for a city permit to operate an  expanded facility in an industrial area near Oceanside Municipal Airport.  </P> <P> After attempts to move elsewhere downtown failed, the foundation hopes a new  location outside downtown will end the criticism and allow Brother Benno's to  grow from a soup kitchen into a place where homeless people also can shower,  enjoy a day room and receive counseling.  </P> <P> "They're not going to be in anybody's back yard," said city Housing Director  Richard Goodman, who believes that the industrial site is much better than  keeping Brother Benno's downtown, near a blood center, a transit station and  county welfare offices.  </P> <P> "For a long time, there's been concern that too many facilities downtown keep  (homeless) people in that area," he said.  </P> <P> The city Planning Commission will decide later this month whether to grant  Brother Benno's a conditional-use permit for the Production Avenue site, off  Mission Avenue.  </P> <P> Volunteers at Brother Benno's now dish up free dinners to about 225 people a  night, but neighbors and city police have claimed that some homeless patrons  sleep on private property, burglarize and litter.  </P> <P> The foundation has explored moving into other neighborhoods, but opposition has  kept Brother Benno's out.  </P> <P> Ted Lundquist, a soup kitchen volunteer and a foundation member, believes the  proposed site on Production Avenue will improve the situation.  </P> <P> First, dinner no longer will be served because "there's more of a problem with  alcohol at the evening meal." Instead, Brother Benno's, starting in October if  the city permit is approved, will provide breakfast and a sack lunch.  </P> <P> Hours of operation are expected to be roughly 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., closing  earlier than it does now to dissuade patrons from loitering in the area after  they've eaten, showered or used the day room.  </P> <P> Initially, Brother Benno's only will offer meals. Lundquist isn't sure when the  additional services, including job and education counseling, will begin.  </P> <P> According to Goodman, "there is some opposition" to Brother Benno's relocation  plans, but "not nearly as strong" as before, when the foundation sought to move  into residential areas.  </P> <P> The most vocal opponents are the owners of Marty's Valley Inn on Mission  Avenue, where Marty Schroder Jr. is concerned that Brother Benno's patrons will  trespass and disturb the guests.  </P> <P> "Where are they going to go? They're going to be in my hotel, in my garbage  rack," he said.  </P> <P> Schroder said some homeless people already have caused trouble at the inn,  which recently underwent a $1.5-million renovation.  </P> <P> "Would you want a bunch of homeless people trampling on your front doorstep?"  he asked.  </P> <P> However, Lundquist said an "unenlightened attitude" is behind the fear of the  people served by Brother Benno's.  </P> <P> He said many patrons are women, children and working men who are too poor to  afford food. "We're not just there for the street homeless," he said.  </P> <P> Goodman said he will try to meet with the Schroders to discuss their concerns.  </P></p>

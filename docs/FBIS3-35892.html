			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the  latest incidents in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the  border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.    Combat operations on NKR's front lines have continued for  nearly two weeks. Azerbaijan's leaders and military command  headquarters are trying to resolve the Karabakh problem through  the use of force. Thousands of mercenaries are fighting on  Azerbaijan's side. Although the Azerbaijan National Army [ANA]  units have succeeded in placing several areas under their  control as a result of the violent clashes between the two  sides, they have been unable to significantly change the  situation. In fact, they have suffered many casualties and lost  a significant amount of military equipment. More than 10,000  Azerbaijani troops and mercenaries from various countries were  killed at the NKR front line during the past two weeks. Many  times more were wounded.    The ANA units lost a large quantity of military equipment.  For example, 19 of their armored vehicles were either captured  or destroyed until 25 January. Meanwhile, 16 tanks were  destroyed. The ANA units lost two T-72 tanks and 70 men in the  clashes that took place in the vicinity of Martuni on 27  January. The enemy units were forced to retreat. Obviously,  the loss the ANA units have suffered is significant.    The NKR Defense Headquarters has disclosed that combat  operations are taking place on all battlefronts at the present  time. Violent fighting took place in the northern part of  Kelbadzharskiy Rayon on 30 January. The NKR units not only beat  off the attacks but also counterattacked and forced the enemy to  retreat. Combat operations are also taking place in  Mardakertskiy Rayon. The Armenian fighters have repulsed the  occupationist attacks and forced their units to retreat.  Meanwhile, the situation in Agdamskiy and Fizulinskiy Rayons is  tense.    Several observers believe that the ANA units have failed to  achieve their objective despite making some advances. As we  mentioned earlier, the ANA units' success has cost them  significant casualties and loss of equipment. Azerbaijan will  be forced to mobilize 45-year-old or 50-year-old men if the  present state of affairs continues. [passage omitted]    Regrettably, a peaceful situation has not been effectively  established on Armenia's border with Azerbaijan. The  neighboring republic's military units have frequently fired on  Armenian residential areas close to the border with various  types of arms. The Armenian Ministry of Defense's Press Service  has disclosed that the occupationist ANA units violated  Armenia's border once again early this morning. Several enemy  patrols attacked Movses in Tavushskiy Rayon at 0310. The  Armenian border guards took retaliatory measures. The fighting  continued until 0630 this morning. A significant blow was  inflicted on the enemy units, which were evicted from the area.  The Azerbaijani units lost several men. No one was hurt on our  side.    No other incident occurred along Armenia's border until this  afternoon. However, serious tension continues to exist in the  region.</p>

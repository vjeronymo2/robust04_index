			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ORIGINS OF 'GET A LIFE!'  </P> <P> Re "Get a Life!" (July 26): I enjoyed Nikki Finke's article very much, but the  statement "Get a life!" has been around a lot longer than she may realize.  Perhaps a sketch on "Saturday Night Live" helped popularize the expression, but  my ex-girlfriend's best friend used to say it frequently in 1979, with the same  intent it has today.  </P> <P> If she read the piece and some of the dates presented therein for this phrase's  possible origins (1986, 1988) . . . well, you know what she would have said.  </P> <P> MIKE HARRINGTON  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

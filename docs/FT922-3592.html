After a brief inspection, he took a hammer, hit a pipe above his head, and the plant began working again. The manager thanked him, and told him to send his bill. When it arrived the next day for no less than Pounds 1,000, the horrified manager rang him, protesting that it was a lot to charge for one hammer-blow. 'Oh no,' the engineer answered. 'Only Pounds 1 of it is for hitting the pipe. The other Pounds 999 is for knowing where to hit it.' him'</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> IMELDA SINGS TO DYING MARCOS  </P> <P> A tearful Imelda Marcos quietly sang a love song today to her husband, ousted  Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, as he lay close to death.  </P> <P> "We are praying for a miracle," she said. "If I could just tell him he could go  back home (to the Philippines), I know this would save him."  </P> <P> The Philippine bedside song, "How Much I love You," appeared to get a response  from the deposed president, in a semi-comatose state with kidney, heart and  lung failure. He opened his eyes and squeezed his wife's hand, friends claimed.  </P> <P> Philippine President Corazon Aquino has refused repeated requests by Marcos to  return to his homeland to die.  </P></p>

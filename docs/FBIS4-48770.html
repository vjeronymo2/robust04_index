			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Approval for Defense Minister -- An editorial in  Johannesburg  THE STAR in English on 26 May on page 20 voices approval for  Defense Minister Joe Modise's appointment of General Georg  Meiring as head of the South African National Defense Force,  SANDF: "We applaud this move; we salute Defence Minister Joe  Modise for choosing the best man for the job. His vision is  clear: a legitimate, credible, balanced, modern and  technologically advanced military force with internationally  accepted professional norms, also fully representative."  Turning to related issues, the editorial notes: "Three other  points in the Minister's announcement need to be noted: the  realistic pegging of the force at about 70,000 men, the  preference for a voluntary system of enlistment and the emphasis  on a positive internal role for the SANDF. All this augurs well  for the future."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Concern Over `ANC Militarists' -- "The arms embargo against  South Africa is about to be lifted. Perhaps it would be better  for us all if it remained in force." Such is the sentiment an  editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 26 May on  page 8. Noting that ANC hawks and doves are beginning to divide  over the questions affecting the South African military, the  paper states: "We have a situation where Minister Jay Naidoo  repeatedly said the reconstruction and development programme  would be paid for predominantly through defence cuts. Now  Modise, preceded by some advance guard intellectuals and  intelligence operatives such as Rocky Williams and Abba Omar,  are fighting tooth and nail to preserve and perhaps even enlarge  the military establishment." The editorial rejects as  "self-serving nonsense" all arguments that the arms industry  creates needed jobs, and then it continues: "Modise also seeks  to make South Africa the policeman of the subcontinent, but  simultaneously and disingenuously asks neighboring countries not  to fear our huge military capability." After pointing out that  "ANC militarists are not having it all their own way," the  editorial concludes: "If the SANDF needs funding for the  integration of the various armed forces it should be provided --  but only on the understanding that it is to be spent purely on  demobilisation. The public will accept no more than that."  <H8>  RAPPORT </H8>   Peacekeeping Force Called "Exercise in Futility" -- "A  pathetic chapter in the history of the birth of the new South  Africa comes to a close when the so-called Peacekeeping Force is  disbanded. Seldom, if ever, in South Africa's proud military  tradition has there ever been such an exercise in futility at a  such a high price," begins a page-20 editorial in the  Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 22 May. "As a spectacle it  even dwarfs the disastrous task by the now defunct Department of  Development Aid, concerning the provision of hundreds of unused  toilets, which served as a great source of amusement to  antigovernment agents. Since the shoe is on the other foot --  the Peace Force was the creation of the ANC-dominated  Transitional Executive Council -- the laughter is considerably  more subdued. Even for this laughter the South African taxpayer  will eventually have to foot the bill....May such experiments  never be repeated so hastily again. May the Peacekeeping Force  rest in peace."  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   Black American Investors Welcomed -- "The fact that black  American businessmen and investors are streaming to South Africa  to take advantage of new opportunities here should be welcomed,"  notes a page-6 editorial in the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans  on 23 May. "America's own success story can be partly attributed  to the fact that it succeeded in attracting investors and  experts from around the world because it is regarded as the land  of opportunity. South Africa's developed infrastructure,  financial sectors, and communication systems are assets that  will also hopefully attract foreign investors. Black Americans  returning to their roots in Africa come from a western and  capitalist society. They have the necessary knowledge required  to reconcile the Africa culture with a democratic and capitalist  system....They are also aware of minority issues. Their  participation in South Africa could help to establish a  democratic culture based on a firm capitalist, economic  foundation, but one with its own unique Africa flavor."</p>

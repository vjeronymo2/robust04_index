			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (April 2) TURAN -- Yesterday there was the  session in Nakhichevan Supreme Majlis. Natiq Gasanov, was  appointed a new Chairman of Supreme Majlis of Nakhichevan  Autonomous Republic. Earlier he was the chief of the  Administrative Department of Supreme Majlis. The Chairman of  Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan, Rasul Guliyev, attended the  session as well.    Since June 1993, when the former speaker of Nakhichevan's  Supreme Majlis, Geydar Aliyev, took the office of the President  of Azerbaijan, the post of the speaker in Nakhichevan remained  vacant.    The tension in Nakhichevan mounts. There were a series of  rallies of the members of the opposition in Ordubadskiy and  Dzhulfinskiy region. The local powers of those regions support  Abulfaz Elchibey.    Deepening socio-economic crisis in Azerbaijan lessen Baku's  control over Nakhichevan. Obviously, after the elections  Azerbaijan will increase pressure on Nakhichevan.</p>

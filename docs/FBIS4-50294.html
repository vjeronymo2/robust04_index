			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Guang Li from the "Opinion" page: "Shares in </F> State Firms Are Investors' Best Bet"]    [Text] Investors expecting high and stable returns should  think twice before pouring their cash into China's real estate  market at the moment, economists warned at a recent seminar in  Beijing.    Those with foresight should instead use this opportunity to  buy shares in large and medium-sized State enterprises which are  debt-ridden but promising, said economist Li Yining of Beijing  University.    His view was echoed by the country's other leading  economists  and officials at a seminar on Baoan Group's modern enterprise  system set up.    Profits of the Shenzhen-based Baoan Group, the country's  first enterprise to introduce a shareholding system, soared in  the past few years thanks to its involvement in real estate.    And the real estate industry has enjoyed a great boom since  Deng Xiaoping reiterated in 1992 that the economy would speed up.    As thousands of foreign firms flood the country, the real  estate sector has grown to such an extent that China seems to  resemble a vast construction site, with cranes and bulldozers  everywhere.    When inflation hit double digits late last year, the central  government decided to put the brakes on the economy.    Though a soft landing was intended, real estate was hit by a  slow down in fixed-assets investment.    Beijing and Shanghai notwithstanding, the real estate market  has hit an all-time low. Many domestic and overseas developers  have difficulties selling million-dollar office buildings and  luxury villas.    "The present situation shows that, though investing in real  estate is lucrative, it is a risky business," said Dong Fureng,  honorary director of the Economics Institute of the Chinese  Academy of Social Sciences.    Despite the promise of high profits, businesses expecting a  stable return on their investment should not spend all their  money on real estate, Dong said.    The best bet for investors is to look to State industries  for  good bargains, the economists agreed.    And as the country moves from a planned to a market economy,  many State firms have been cut from government loans and cheap  raw materials. It's reported that more than one-third of the  large and medium-sized State enterprises are losing money.    Some of the companies are well-equipped and can turn out  quality products. What they lack is a ready source of capital.    Others are staffed by highly-qualified technical and  managerial personnel, but lack the funds to renovate and improve  the quality of their products.    "This situation has created the best possible opportunity  for  big investors to take over industries -- through buying and  holding shares," said Wang Yuzhao, an economist with Development  Research Centre under the State Council.    But investors face the difficult task of deciding which  industry to invest in. The economists offered some suggestions:    -- Select factories or firms which have a potential for  further development, said Wu Jinglian, an economist with the  Development Research Centre of the State Council. Investors  should not focus on single industries like real estate and  electronics. Smart ones will carefully study the government's  investment policies, development plans and the market rules  before deciding the direction of investment, Wu said.    What's more, they will benefit from the research experience  of Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan.    -- Special attention should be paid to the industries or  trades that are neglected by most investors, suggested Fan  Hengshan, deputy director of Comprehensive Planning and Trial  Department under the State Commission for Economic Restructuring.    It's always too late to start your engine when others are  already halfway to the end," Fan said. "To ensure a leading  position, one has to look for new destinations that are later on  to be targeted by others."    -- A breakthrough can be made in the sections that link  different industries or trades, Fan said. As the economy  develops, many new trades and industries will start. Those who  invest in these industries and trades first will have a good  chance to dominate them. Some examples are chain stores and  express mail service.    The seminar participants are also optimistic on the future  of  investment in the west, which is comparatively underdeveloped  but boasts rich natural resources.    "The fast development along the east coast has a lot to  attribute to the overseas investment, which on the other hand  have also benefited the investors a lot," Wang Yuzhao. "Now  it's time for the enterprises in the east to transfer their  labour-intensive industries to the western part of the country.  Such a transfer and investment will benefit both the east and  the west."    Agriculture is another good bet for the investors.    Now that agriculture production, especially in the  southeast,  is stagnant because a lot of arable farmland has been deserted,  investors should step in to take over.    Considerable profits can be made by developing modern  farming  through a combination of planting, breeding and developing  concerned industries like farming machinery, fertilizer,  pesticide, feed and processing industries.    Agricultural strategies guarantee these investors will enjoy  long-term preferential policies and farm products can expect a  burgeoning market now that living standards are finally  improving, the economists pointed out.    Hong Yamin, director of the Real Estate Research Institute  affiliated to Beijing Economics Institute, however, disagrees  with the above economists and officials.    "The experience of our more developed neighbouring countries  and regions shows that there should be three to five real estate  fevers in the process of development," she said. "Whoever can  survive the temporary low ebb will come out big winners."    She suggested, instead of pouring money into the  foreign-oriented luxury buildings, investors should invest in  the apartment and office buildings that cater to the needs of  common folk and domestic enterprises.    "There is a huge market in them," she said.</p>

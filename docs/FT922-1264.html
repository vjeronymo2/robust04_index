			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: French market recovers from swap setback THE French government bond market rallied yesterday, recovering some of the losses which were made in the wake of Friday's surprise announcement that the Treasury plans to exchange some of the old illiquid bond issues for its newest stocks. The statement from the Finance Ministry on Friday took the French bond market by surprise and led to a fall in prices before the weekend and yesterday morning. The French Treasury plans to exchange FFr140bn of existing state bond issues for the newer Obligations Assimilables du Tresor (OATs) in order to improve the liquidity and extend the maturity of the government's debt. With effect from today, the Treasury will offer to exchange 45 old stocks, worth about FFr140bn altogether, for newer issues. The old bonds include stocks issued by Caisse Nationale des Banques, Caisse Nationale de l'Industrie and the Fonds Special des Grands Travaux. 'Many of these issues are due to be redeemed in 1994, so the Treasury is trying to smooth the pattern of redemption,' said one economist. Dealers said the market reacted badly to the news initially due to concern that the exchange would mean an increase in supply at the longer end of the market. However, foreign buying helped to lift the market, and the Matif September futures contract settled at 107.22, up two basis points on the day. THE Italian government bond market picked up helped by a stronger lira and hopes that a government may be appointed by the end of the week. Although the market gained nearly half a point at one stage, it later fell back and closed only slightly higher on the day. The Liffe September BTP contract reached a high of 96.34 but settled at 96.17, up from Friday's 95.84 close. UK gilts slipped as worries about funding and the prospects for European economic and monetary union continued to haunt the market. The cash market ended lower across the range of maturities. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from its opening of 116 1/8 to trade at 115 15/16 by late afternoon, yielding 9.34 per cent, while the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 slipped from 101 3/8 to 101 5/16 to yield 9.25 per cent. The gilt futures contract ended the day slightly higher at 97.22, compared with its opening of 97.19, in healthy trading volume. The release of better-than-expected trade data for May led to a slight bounce in gilt prices in the morning but the effect was short-lived as funding worries continued to dominate the market. Tomorrow the Bank of England will auction Pounds 2.75bn of the 9 per cent Treasury stock due 2012, its largest to date. US Treasury prices moved in a tight trading range yesterday as investors held their fire ahead of this week's auctions. By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/16 at 101 27/32 , yielding 7.832 per cent, while at the short end of the market the two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/4 , yielding 4.969 per cent. Trading volume was reported to be extremely light. The lack of new economic statistics denied the market a new direction, and the subdued nature of business was exaggerated by concern among participants about taking large positions before today's Dollars 15bn sale of two-year notes and tomorrow's Dollars 10.25bn sale of five-year notes. In the credit markets, the Federal Reserve completed a round of three-day system repurchase agreements aimed at lowering the Fed funds rate, which was trading slightly above its 3 3/4 per cent target at 3 13/16 per cent. HOPES of lower interest rates helped to lift the Japanese government debt market yesterday, and bond prices ended slightly firmer or unchanged. The sharp drop in the Tokyo equity market contributed to speculation that the Bank of Japan would be forced to lower short-term interest rates to help the stock market and boost the economy, dealers said. The Nikkei index closed 598.65 points lower at 15,921.22, its lowest level since 1986. The rate on three-month certificates of deposit, which has fallen in recent weeks, was quoted at 4.50 to 4.55 per cent yesterday, compared with 4.55 per cent on Friday. The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue traded in a range of 5.355 to 5.375 per cent, but ended the day unchanged at 5.36 per cent. The September futures contract moved in a range of 102.42 to 102.55, ending the day at 102.50.</p>

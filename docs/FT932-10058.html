			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Letter: Scramble for bottom position Sir, It comes as a shock to read of a British government claiming credit for turning the people of our country into a reserve army of cheap labour ('Claim on wages attacked', May 4). And yet this is what Mr Major, the prime minister, and Mrs Shephard, the employment secretary, are seeking brownie points for. Come to Britain for the lowest pensions, the lowest wages, the lowest social benefits in Europe  - this is what our government is saying to German and other European companies, even if the case is exaggerated. There was a time when British governments felt it to be their first responsibility to improve living standards for the majority of people - to be the best in Europe, not the worst. Now after a decade and a half of low investment in industry and cuts in the social wage, the British government is begging European companies to take advantage of our low standards. What a commentary this is on the priorities of modern Toryism. And what a recipe to drive down standards in Europe as country after country is encouraged to scramble for bottom position in the league table of social benefits. As the union representing more than half a million skilled and professional people, MSF will use every avenue, including the European Court, to construct a level playing field within Europe's developing single labour market.

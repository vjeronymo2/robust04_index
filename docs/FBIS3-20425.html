			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Summary] Major factors that will influence the sugar  market in 1994 are:    1. In 1994 China will continue to strengthen macroeconomic  regulation and control, and funds for the sugar wholesale market  will be limited. China will strengthen price controls, and  increases in retail prices will slow. China will strengthen  management over the foreign exchange market, and the exchange  rate between the renminbi and foreign currency will stabilize.  These factors will be beneficial to stabilize the sugar market.    2. Sugar output will decline. In 1993 the sown area in major  sugar-producing regions declined. It is estimated that during  the 1993-1994 pressing season gross output will be 6.8 million  tons, a decrease of 900,000 tons from the previous period.    3. Exports will decline. Because China's sugar prices are  higher than the average international price, exports are  unprofitable. In addition, domestic supplies are tight,  therefore sugar exports will decline by about 700,000 tons.    4. Imports will remain at the same level as 1993. In 1994  international sugar prices will rise, and it will be difficult  for China to increase import funds.    5. In 1994 demand will increase by 400,000 to 450,000 tons.  However, because sugar prices will rise in 1994, demand is  likely to decrease.    Based on the above, in 1994 China's sugar supply will not  meet demand, there will be a shortage of about 600,000 tons.</p>

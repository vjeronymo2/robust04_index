			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (27): JAS: real test is yet to come - Sweden AFTER A troubled development phase, the military side of Sweden's aerospace industry can at last boast a few successes. In April the JAS 39 Gripen multi-purpose fighter aircraft successfully undertook its 1,000th test flight, and this month the first aircraft is scheduled to be delivered to the Swedish air force, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. For a programme that has fallen a year behind schedule and run well over cost estimates - and that at times looked as if it might collapse completely  -these are tangible achievements. But the JAS needs to make a breakthrough into the export market to ensure commercial success, and so the real test is still to come. There was acute disappointment when the Finnish government opted last year to buy 57 new F18s from the US group McDonnell Douglas, rather than the JAS. For the moment, the programme is underpinned by a healthy order book from Sweden's air force, with the final delivery not due until 2001. An initial order for 30 aircraft was supplemented last year by one for a further 110, which did much to cushion the blow of the lost Finnish order. These domestic orders have provided the consortium manufacturing the JAS - Saab-Scania, Volvo Flygmotor, Ericsson Radar Electronics and FFV Aerotech (part of the Celsius defence group which is currently being privatised) - with a good platform from which to launch their drive for further business, both at home and abroad. The manufacturers are hoping for further orders from the Swedish air force - possibly for as many as 150 aircraft - after parliament decided last year to maintain a fleet of 16 combat squadrons to meet the country's future defence needs. Further, they project a worldwide replacement need of 3,000 military aircraft in the next 10-20 years (even allowing for reduced defence expenditure), with a possible market for the JAS of half that total. The aim is to capture orders for a third of the possible market - or 500 aircraft. This is an ambitious target and the JAS partners accept that they are unlikely to achieve it on their own. Hence far more emphasis is being placed on co-operation with foreign partners, specifically other aerospace groups in the US and Europe. In Europe, discussions have taken place with British Aerospace, Dassault of France and Germany's Dasa, although no concrete proposals have yet emerged. If nothing else, these talks are a recognition of the fact that Sweden, with a population of just 8m, is going to find it difficult to maintain a viable aerospace industry on its own, for all its undoubted high technology expertise. The same thinking lies behind the government's decision to privatise the defence group Celsius where it is specifically hoped that private sector status will facilitate co-operation with foreign partners. In the military aerospace sector, it is considered unlikely that Sweden will ever again develop a new aircraft on its own as collaboration is seen as the only way to secure markets cost-effectively. Saab Military Aircraft, part of Saab-Scania, is reluctant to identify the markets it is targeting, although countries in south-east Asia, Latin America and central and eastern Europe have all been mentioned. Tough competition is likely from the American F16 and F18, Mirage 2000-5 and Mig 29 planes, which are all in a similar price bracket. However, in performance terms, its manufacturers say the JAS should be compared with the new generation of fighters, including the Eurofighter 2000, the Rafale and the F22. Whether it turns out good value for its manufacturers is another matter. The project's delays and the fact that the first 30 aircraft were ordered at a fixed price are believed to have cost the prime contractor, Saab-Scania, heavily in the late 1980s. Some ground should be recouped with the second order, but a real profits take-off will probably come only with export orders. One of the arguments that is thought to have persuaded the Swedish government to persist with JAS is the spin-off effects for the country's civil aviation business, which is also centred on Saab-Scania. The commercial side of Sweden's aerospace industry has developed successfully, but because of the downturn in world market conditions, new orders for Saab aircraft have not materialised as quickly as anticipated, and some have been cancelled. The civilian side of the company's air business is concentrated on two aircraft - the 35-seater Saab 340 and its bigger sister, the Saab 2000, which can carry 50 to 58 passengers. Test flights for the latter began only last year, and the first customer delivery is scheduled for this autumn. A breakthrough came in the early part of the year when a Chinese airline agreed to buy five Saab 2000 aircraft this year, and took options on a further 15 for delivery in 1995 and 1996. But many more such orders will be needed to recoup development costs. Saab Aircraft, which comprises Saab Military Aircraft and the commercial aircraft operations, made a profit of SKr163m last year, or 8.7 per cent in pre-tax returns on capital employed. That is slightly above the SKr150m recorded in 1991, even though sales fell to SKr3.92bn from SKr4.93bn. Even so, it is well short of what the company hopes to achieve in the late 1990s if foreign orders for the JAS and Saab 2000 come flooding in.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Piotr Aleksandrowicz: "In the Market </F> Direction"]    [Text] The president vetoed the new popiwek [tax on excess  wage increases] because he had sound reasons to do so. He  believes that this law gives the administration a lot of power  to make decisions concerning tax burdens; it poses a threat to  the implementation of the property law and to the development of  private entrepreneurship; it strengthens administration at the  cost of the parliament. The Sejm may override the veto;  however, the question arises whether it could just ignore the  arguments submitted by the president.    It seems that, approximately since 1991, there have been  reasons to believe that the administrative control of wages in  the state-owned sector might be replaced by macroeconomic  control and negotiations between employees and employers. The  fluidity of companies was limited, the money supply is under  control, and inflation is increasingly lower; the unemployment  level, however, is high, which curbs wage demands as well as the  development of competition.    There is no doubt that the departure from the administrative  control of shaping wages would be a step in the direction of  market economy principles.    The popiwek, a solution that seems indispensable in the  first  and second year of transformations, became an increasingly less  observed relic of the past as the situation was more and more  stabilized. However, it was in a way comfortable to some  authorities, establishments, and companies: It freed them from  some of the responsibility for the economic results.    Abolition of the popiwek would reinforce the demands  submitted by the National Bank of Poland, which should pursue a  definitely anti-inflation financial policy. Similarly, it would  set higher requirements for banks and the government in the area  of execution of credits, taxes, and bankruptcies. Finally, the  ministries exercising owner's supervision would have to fill  higher requirements as well. The owner should demand  responsibility from the directors and not, as it used to be,  succumb to joint pressure of employees and their bosses.  However, because the state is not an efficient owner, what we  need is consistency in privatization and in the development of  competition.    Neither the president's decision nor its approval by the  Sejm  threaten to cause chaos and higher inflation--on condition that  the government will be the government, the owner will be the  owner, and the central bank the central bank.</p>

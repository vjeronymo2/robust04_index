			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Names angered by letter refusal DISSIDENT Names reacted with anger yesterday at the refusal by Lloyd's of London to distribute a letter supporting their case for a series of resolutions discussed at the extraordinary general meeting last week, Andrew Jack writes. Mr Claud Gurney, leader of the egm initiative, criticised Lloyd's for not permitting him to send a second letter arguing the case for the resolutions to about 35,000 Names, the individuals whose assets underwrite the insurance market. Last week's meeting discussed four resolutions, including a call for the governing council to co-operate more with Names. Mr Gurney said he had been unable to send out the letter because Lloyd's had refused to supply him with Names' addresses, and had rejected a request even if he paid all costs.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Qiu Qi: "Council Blasts U.S. Action on </F> Textiles"]    [Text] China National Textile Council has blasted the  United States for its unilateral slashing of China's textile  import quotas.    "The U.S. announcement of its intention to slash China's  textile export quotas by 25-35 percent is an attack on China's  textile industry," a spokesman from the China National Textile  Council said.    Hundreds of Chinese enterprises that provide textile  products  for the U.S. market will be hurt by the move, the spokesman said.    Some producers may even go bankrupt, which could result in  as  many as 300,000 job losses in the industry, he added.    The council said the U.S. decision was irresponsible and  unreasonable.    The U.S. action also breached the Multi-Fibre Arrangement as  well as other multilateral trade relationships, he said.    China National Textile Council pointed out that the U.S.  reduction of import quotas will not solve the problem of illegal  transshipment.    "The U.S. decision hurts legal Chinese textile enterprises,  which is unfair, " said the spokesman.    He added the industry had already intensified its crackdown  on illegal transshipment.    The council also called for a negotiated settlement of the  issue of illegal transshipments.    The spokesman said the council hoped to set up an effective  system in co-operation with the U.S. to deal with the illegal  transshipment of China's textile products by overseas dealers.    At the same time, the China National Textile Council will  continue to fight the illegal activities with the support of  Chinese Government.</p>

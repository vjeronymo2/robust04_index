			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (20): Prime minister of the board THE CORPORATE BOARD: CONFRONTINGTHE PARADOXES by Ada Demb and F Friedrich Neubauer Oxford Pounds 27.50, 224 pages CORPORATE governance is continually in the news today with business scandals, company failures and legal battles involving large banks, institutional shareholders, auditors, and with directors in the dock. The need for reform is evident. As Ada Demb and Friedrich Neubauer say in The Corporate Board: 'We need to bring the mechanisms for corporate governance into line with current business reality.' As is clear from the difficulties which the regulators and auditors are having with their investigations of BCCI and the Maxwell empire, the scale and complexity of business activity has outrun the existing control mechanisms. In 1989 the world's ten largest companies taken together employed 4m people. Their combined sales were equal to the GDP of the four Scandinavian countries, or Canada. Businesses today rival governments in their ability to create and distribute wealth. This puts enormous power into the hands of the 'government' of these companies - the 200 or so people who make up the boards of directors of these ten companies  - a few people with an ambiguous mandate, and a narrowly based 'electorate.' Ada Demb and Friedrich Neubauer consider the problem of 'governance' not in terms of mechanisms: the size and structure of boards, the use of audit and remuneration committees, or relations with auditors and institutional shareholders. Rather, the authors set out to provide a chairman or chief executive with a set of 'diagnostic tools'. Their frameworks are useful. They argue that 'much of the expressed dissatisfaction with boards is, in reality, a dissatisfaction with the performance of our entire governance system', therefore we should not focus our attention just on board structures. Directors should also be assessing the regulatory system, relationships with owners, and social pressures. The authors suggest that developing a strong board is like building a bridge. There is no universal design which will fit every case. It is a matter of balancing the opposing forces and stresses to suit a particular situation. In a board there are three main sources of tension: (1) management autonomy versus board control; (2) commitment and involvement versus detachment and objectivity; (3) good teamwork versus the judgment and initiative of individuals The authors have achieved a breakthrough in management research. It is, I believe, the first time researchers have been permitted to interview the main board directors of large international corporations about the way they run their boards. They questioned 72 directors of 11 large corporations in eight countries, mostly in Europe, but also in Canada and Venezuela. The data they have produced comes from the widest possible range of directors: from two-tier boards and unitary boards, state-owned companies as well as private businesses; even a couple of employee directors were included. Surprisingly, they found that regardless of the board structure or the industry, all the directors faced the same kinds of problems. The price the authors had to pay for access to these directors was total confidentiality. From the readers' point of view this is a serious drawback. There are no company names - no case studies (not even in disguise), no information about the organisation's size, structure, product/market situation or performance - except that in general their performance was 'above average'. Nevertheless, the book has an air of reality because the argument is illustrated throughout by quotations from the directors who were interviewed. The 'bottom line' of the book is the need for board assessments. To quote Sir John Harvey-Jones: 'unless a board continuously criticises the way it is working it is extraordinarily difficult for it to improve its performance'. Even in the large corporations which the authors visited this practice was not established, except in a few cases on an informal basis. In the current debate about corporate governance, board assessments is becoming a hot topic. The Working Group on Corporate Governance, a group of distinguished lawyers representing large US companies and institutional investors, recently recommended regular and comprehensive appraisals of boards and individual directors by outside directors, and by institutional shareholders. Also, in 1990 the British Institute of Directors published a report ('The Effective Board' by Colin Coulson-Thomas and Alan Wakelam) which recommended that the chairman should require the board to undertake an 'annual review' of its collective performance and the personal effectiveness of each director. If this idea takes off, it will provide an important role for non-executive directors, and management consultants.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Technology: SmithKline cures a corporate headache Group decision-making is central to corporate life, but it can be time-consuming and socially awkward for many managers. In a move that introduces a touch of the television game show to business, SmithKline Beecham is trying to take the headaches out of joint decisions. The Anglo-US pharmaceutical group's solution is Teamworker, dreamt up by Tony Gear and Martin Read of Decision Dynamics, a small UK communications company. It consists of handsets, similar in design to pocket calculators, linked by radio to a centraI standard microcomputer. This is loaded with special software which presents data in logical order to the participants, who vote or register opinions on the keypads. The results appear instantly on a large screen. Teamworker is also used by the Ministry of Defence, Manchester University, and Allied Breweries, where it shows what the members of tasting panels think about differing beer flavours. The Head of SB's Gastrointestinal R&amp;D Category, Leanne Wagner, says the system makes research and development meetings much more effective. It was adopted to cut the length of time spent reviewing SB's extensive project portfolios. 'Our practice has always been to brainstorm in groups of 12 to 15 staff from a variety of disciplines, as well as to gather smaller groups dealing with individual therapeutic areas,' she says. 'The idea of portfolio review is to pinpoint where our resources should best be concentrated and evaluate research opportunities.' But this was often time-consuming and complex. Wagner says meetings are now better organised. 'The computer gives the cue for each project option to be presented and for its technical and commercial attractiveness to be discussed.' A group vote then shows instantly where disagreements arise, without participants being influenced by others' opinions. 'Social pressure is thus considerably diminished; participants can disagree without confrontation, producing a more honest spread of opinion. It becomes much more difficult for a senior member to dominate the meeting,' Wagner says. This is important when people from different disciplines are involved. John Dent, SB's former senior vice-president of project management, says meeting times are now much shorter. 'We normally took a 15-day yearly meeting to review our portfolio, and that has been cut to around four.' He is not sure whether the decisions are actually better. 'But one point which is important is that everyone understands what decision has been reached. At least this way, people who disagree have a fairer chance of being able to persuade the others.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Petrovac, 21 Jun (TANJUG) -- Radio Velkaton of  Velika Kladusa this evening denied claims made last night by  Muslim Radio Sarajevo that forces loyal to Alija Izetbegovic had  arrived at the perimeter of the Agrokomerc agricultural complex,  that they were successfully advancing towards Polje and Velika  Kladusa, and that Fikret Abdic had "disappeared in an unknown  direction." Radio Velkaton said that the army of the Autonomous  Province of Western Bosnia is firmly in control of all  separation lines and that Izetbegovic's forces "will never make  it to Velika Kladusa."    The same source said that "the remnants of the 5th Corps" of  the Muslim army loyal to Alija Izetbegovic this afternoon  continued their fierce attacks against positions and civilian  targets in the autonomous province of western Bosnia and added  that the heaviest infantry clashes and mortar exchanges are  taking place in the Caglica, Todorovo, and Pecigrad areas.  According to the radio, these attacks were repelled without  loss.    Radio Velkaton claims that units of the 5th Corps are  regrouping and redeploying, which means that there will be no  peace in this region for a long time to come.</p>

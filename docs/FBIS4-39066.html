			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [V. Pokidov video report; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program] </F>   [Text] Today, while the town of Svobodnyy-18 toils away in  its normal routine manner, the chief center for space research  is being created on the foundations of a former missile unit.  The Ministry of Defense has already allocated half a billion  rubles to ensure its survival and the city's development.  [Video shows aerial shots of Svobodnyy-18 town]    New complexes for launching regular space rockets will be  constructed on the basis of several launching pads that have  survived. The first launch of this kind is planned for the  beginning of 1996.    Everyone can see for themselves that it is perfectly safe to  live and work in the space research center; the Geiger counter  indicates a perfectly normal radiation background even near a  blown up nuclear missile silo. [Video shows uniformed personnel  inspecting exploded rocket silo]    What is the immediate outlook for developing Svobodnyy-18?  This was the subject of our talk with Colonel Kalanchev, chief  of staff of the center for space research.    [Begin recording] [Kalanchev] We have two leading documents  on the basis of which we conduct our work. Thorough technical  inspections of all buildings, structures, and technical systems  have been carried out, and orders for necessary equipment have  been placed. Plans have been made, and the necessary assets for  implementing these plans are being accumulated.    [Pokidov] You have made an interesting statement: We are  military people, and if we are ordered, we will launch a  spaceship within a month.    [Kalanchev] Of course, we will not be able to prepare a  serious launch within a month, especially if it is a booster  rocket. But military unit No. 06-660, which has been created for  the realization of these plans, will carry out its goals in  accordance with the timetable set by Colonel General Ivanov,  commander of the military space forces, and of course by the  minister of defense.    [Pokidov] In other words, everything depends on financing.    [Kalanchev] On financing first and foremost, but also on  goals and schedules set for us. [end recording]</p>

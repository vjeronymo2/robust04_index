			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Singapore may relax policies on savings MR LEE KUAN YEW, Singapore's senior minister, has said Singapore might relax some of its rigid policies on savings in order to allow entrepreneurs to start businesses and make more wide-ranging investments. 'There is merit in the view that the government should not over-protect people and give them opportunities to take risks and enrich themselves,' Mr Lee said. Several economists and academics have said that Singapore is saving too much and not properly utilising its considerable capital reserves. The Central Provident Fund (CPF), a compulsory social security scheme funded by employers and employees, has accumulated funds in excess of SDollars 50bn (Pounds 19.6bn) while Singapore's foreign exchange reserves are officially put at USDollars 40bn (Pounds 26bn). Savings stand at 47 per cent of GDP, one of the highest savings rates in the world. Mr Lee said that, while the government could not allow people to squander their savings, he agreed with suggestions that some CPF funds could be released. Mr Lee has been urging Singaporeans to become more adventurous and invest overseas.</p>

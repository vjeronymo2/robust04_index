			<p>CSO     [Text] As commissioned by the European space organization  ESA in Paris, European industry has developed high performance  solar cells which are particularly suitable for use in missions  far from the sun where the technology of [providing] energy is  difficult. ESA reports that under the conditions which dominate  in distant space, the solar cells reach an efficiency factor of  25 percent. This is the highest efficiency factor yet attained  with silicium cells without the use of optical concentrators.    According to reports, the silicium cells are 6 x 4  centimeters in size. ESA had already made the first breakthrough  about a year ago, an efficiency factor of 23 percent, which was,  however, achieved using 2 x 4 centimeter gallium-arsenide cells.  The new record performance with silicium is credited to a team  of companies under the direction of DASA [German Aerospace]  (Heilbronn), to which the Milan company Cise also belongs, which  was already responsible for the development of the  gallium-arsenide cells.    The progress is particularly noteworthy, because European  space flight cannot rely on the thermoelectric radioisotope  generators (TRG) used elsewhere, which are employed to supply  energy for missions into deeper space. In addition, the solar  cells currently used in space flight are generally not designed  for such low temperatures and such meager radiant [solar]  intensity, [conditions] which must be taken into consideration  at greater distances from the sun.    In orbits near the sun they have an efficiency factor of 10  to 20 percent, but they lose their efficiency in distant space.  For example, the radiant intensity of sunlight on Jupiter is  only five percent of its intensity near the Earth. The  equilibrium temperature of the solar cell designs falls to about  minus 100C at these distances.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / W European car sales at record in 1991 WESTERN European new car sales rose by 0.4 per cent last year to a record 13.53m, from 13.47m a year earlier. The increase was almost solely due to the 28 per cent jump in sales in Germany in the wake of the country's reunification, however, and masked a deep recession in several other key markets. Excluding Germany, new car sales in the rest of Europe fell sharply by 8.4 per cent to 9.3m, industry estimates show. Western European new car sales rose strongly in the first half of the year under the impact of surging demand in Germany, but began to weaken in the second half as German sales began to fall back from record levels. Sales were lower than a year earlier in four of the last six months of 1991, but the market staged a modest recovery in December, when sales rose by 4.1 per cent to an estimated 827,000. The Volkswagen group of Germany, which includes Audi, SEAT and Skoda, has established a clear leadership of the western European new car market, not least because of its dominant position in the German market. It increased its market share last year to 16.5 per cent from 15.8 per cent a year earlier, thanks to a 5 per cent increase in sales volume. At the same time the challenge for market leadership from the Fiat group, which includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Innocenti and Ferrari, has waned, as the Italian car maker's share of the domestic Italian market has come under concerted attack, in particular from Ford of the US. Fiat and the Peugeot group of France, which includes Citroen, were the losers among the big six volume car makers in Europe last year. Fiat's sales dropped by 8.7 per cent, depressing its market share to 12.8 per cent from 14.1 per cent a year earlier. The Peugeot group's sales fell by 6 per cent, which resulted in it being ousted from third place in the western European car sales league by General Motors of the US. Its sales recovered in the final months of the year, however, allowing it to stay narrowly ahead of Ford. The Japanese car makers made further inroads into the western European car market, increasing their share to 12.3 per cent from 11.7 per cent, mainly because of an 11.9 per cent jump in sales by Nissan, which is starting to benefit strongly from rising supply from its UK car plant, the first Japanese car plant in Europe. Overall new car sales fell last year in 11 of 17 markets across western Europe. The biggest decline among the big markets came in the UK, with a fall of 20.7 per cent, while France sales fell 12 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January-December 1991                        Volume     Volume       Share (%)     Share (%)                        (Units)    Change (%)   Jan-Dec 91    Jan-Dec 90  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET*       13,530,000     +0.4          100.0         100.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen** (incl.  2,230,000     +5.0           16.5          15.8 Audi, SEAT &amp; Skoda) Fiat (incl.

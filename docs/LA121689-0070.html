			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH CRITICIZED ON CHINA  </P> <P> While condemning other countries for "human rights" violations, Bush has chosen  to ignore the blatant abuse by officials in China. The world watched in horror  as innocent students were killed for asking for democratic reforms.  </P> <P> Lucky students escaped to the U.S. and European countries, but Bush has vetoed  legislation to extend protection to those Chinese students who have asked to  stay in this country. Then to add to this insensitivity, he secretly sent a  special delegation to make peace with the same officials who violated the  students' human rights.  </P> <P> As with his predecessor, he has shown that his greatest concern is financial  and not the well-being of people.  </P> <P> GWEN KOZMAN  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

The method is a combination of compression, electromagnetic  radiation, and thermal dissection. The owner of the process,  Pieke Beheer in Eindhoven, is presently trying to find  interested parties for an installation which can turn an annual  60,000 tonnes of chicken feces into a carboniferous end product.    Artificial fossilization speeds up the conversion of organic  materials into carbon, oil and gas. This conversion process can  achieve in about an hour and a half what nature does in millions  of years. This is achieved through a combination of existing  techniques which have never been combined before. Pieke Beheer  has patents for its process in Europe, Japan and the United  States.  <H5>  Homogeneous </H5>   One of Pieke Beheer's employees, engineer R. Eggink, worked  together with the late W.J.H. Schippers on the development of  the fossilization process. He believes that the procedure and  the accompanying three-stage reactor can convert all organic  materials into "Pieke Black", the patented name of the resulting  carboniferous end product. "The best results are obtained with a  homogeneous material such as chicken feces," according to Eggink.    In a first stage, research was focused on the conversion of  domestic waste. But because domestic waste consists of  extremely varied components, preference was given to organic  materials such as semi-liquid manure. The University of  Amsterdam researched the conversion of chicken feces into Pieke  Black. "The results were encouraging," says Eggink. From the  various research projects it became apparent that the manure  must have a dried consistency of at least 45 percent.    In the Pieke process, the first stage is compression. A  special press reduces the feces into vacuum blocks under high  pressure (280 kilograms per square centimeter). During the  second stage, an industrial microwave triggers off a biochemical  reaction which is needed to start the disintegration process of  the feces by means of bacteria. The blocks are sent in a  continuous line through the tunnel-shaped microwave, and are  exposed to microwaves at three points. In the microwave, the  temperature rises to about 70 or 80 degrees Celsius. The  evaporating moisture is sucked out and condensed.    The third and last stage is the thermal dissection  (gasification) of the feces. Before the organic material enters  the reactor, it is crumbled into small pieces. The temperature  of the reactor is first raised to 250 degrees, whereby a large  part of the moisture evaporates. Then the dung is gasified at  480 degrees maximum. Any inorganic material in the feces is  separated and collected into a special tube. The released gases  are suitable for two applications; the production of  electricity, or separation into oil and gas by means of  condensation.    Finally, following cooling (during which the temperature  drops again to 20 degrees) the desired end product, Pieke Black,  is obtained. Eggink says: "Tests have shown that our product is  very suitable as a filling material in rubbers and various  polymers."  <H5>  No Orders Yet </H5>   It seems, according to Eggink's own feasibility study, that  an installation with a capacity to treat 60,000 tons of chicken  feces annually, divided over two production lines, has the best  chance of success both technically and commercially. Such an  installation would produce 20,000 tons of Pieke Black, with a  value of 1,250 Netherlands guilders per tonne. The conversion  costs are 850 guilders per tonne. According to Eggink, the  energy balance of the procedure is also promising, in that the  installation produces more energy than it consumes, although  there are considerable internal differences for the applications  mentioned. "The combination of our process with the dehydration  of waste material gives a higher total yield than when  electricity is produced with the remaining gases."    According to Eggink, various authorities in Western Europe  have shown interest in the Pieke Beheer process, though no  orders have yet been placed. He is very confident, however,  that orders will come: "Artificial fossilization is a valuable  alternative to the present animal waste conversion  installations."</p>

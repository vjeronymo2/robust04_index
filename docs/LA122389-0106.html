			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: THE DOS AND DON'TS OF ELECTRONIC TAX FILING  </P> <P> Christmas is about the worst time to think about filing tax returns. But soon  the Internal Revenue Service will be mailing out those dreaded 1040s, this time  with a new pitch: File electronically, and you'll get your refund much faster.  </P> <P> Next year for the first time, taxpayers in all 50 states will be able to file  tax returns electronically through computer linkups between authorized  companies and the IRS. If you decide to use this service, however, be sure to  shop around for the best deals; fees vary widely. And be wary of some deals  that promise to get you your refund even faster through so-called refund  anticipation loans.  </P> <P> Electronic filing is not new, having been introduced in 1986 on an experimental  basis in selected markets. Each year it has become available in more cities.  Last year about 1.2 million returns were processed electronically through  nearly 14,000 IRS-approved firms.  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles area, however, it does not seem to have caught on yet. In  this past year's filing season -- the first time electronic filing was  available here -- only 5,500 taxpayers used the procedure, says Carole  Levitzky, public affairs specialist at the IRS district office in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The IRS, which plans a big promotional push this season to encourage electronic  filing, hopes usage will improve. It expects the number of returns filed  electronically to nearly double in the upcoming tax season, to about 2 million.  And in five years, some experts predict, the procedure will be used by as many  as 30 million taxpayers.  </P> <P> "By the year 1995, electronic filing will be the normal, accepted means of  filing your individual and business tax returns, and by 2000, the IRS will be  98% paper-free," predicts David Green, managing partner of Alder, Green &amp;  Hasson, a Los Angeles accounting firm.  </P> <P> There are two key advantages to electronic filing:  </P> <P> * Quicker refunds. Electronic filers can get their refunds in three weeks,  versus the normal six to 10 weeks for paper filers. If you have a direct  deposit arrangement with a bank -- whereby the IRS can deposit your refund  directly into your savings or checking account -- you can get your refund in as  little as two weeks.  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles area last year, the average refund on electronic returns  totaled $1,487 -- a nice amount of change to get a month sooner.  </P> <P> * Fewer errors. The IRS-approved software used to file electronically will  identify math mistakes. The error rate on electronic returns is only 3%, versus  16% for paper returns, the IRS says.  </P> <P> How do you file electronically?  </P> <P> You can't do it by yourself. Instead, you have to do it through a tax preparer,  bank, computer firm or other outfit approved by the IRS; they vary from  mom-and-pop street-corner CPA firms, to giant national chains like H&amp;R  Block, to companies peddling tax-preparation software. If you do your own taxes  on your personal computer using suitable tax-preparation software, you can take  or send your diskette to some services. Some will file your return  electronically if you fax your forms in.  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles area, some 1,060 firms have been authorized to offer  electronic filing for the upcoming season, up from about 660 in the 1989  season, the IRS's Levitzky says.  </P> <P> Call around, so you can also comparison shop for the best price and service.  Fees can run as low as $5 to well over $50.  </P> <P> Also, some electronic filing firms are offering to lend you the amount of your  expected refund. Fees for these refund anticipation loans can easily run over  $50. That can be equivalent to an annual interest rate of well over 100% --  just for getting the use of your money a few days early. Is that really worth  it?  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Yershov report: "Combat Wing-in-Ground Effect </F> Vehicle Will Come to the Rescue"]    [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod's "Volga" plant is developing the  "Spasatel" ["Rescue Worker"] wing-in-ground effect vehicle [WIG]  -- a top secret project six months ago.    The Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau here in the past  developed the designs on which the Russian high-speed river and  maritime fleet was based -- the famous Raketas, Meteors,  Voskhods, and Kolkhidas. R. Alekseyev, chief hydrofoil  designer, for whom this central design bureau is now named, was  a pioneer of this work. Only comparatively recently did it  become known that a fundamentally new type of hydrofoil was  created under his direction back in the sixties -- the  wing-in-ground effect vehicle.    Whereas hydrofoils can develop speeds of up to 120 kph  [kilometers per hour], a WIG craft has almost the speed of an  aircraft -- up to 600 kph. In moving over the surface this  vessel seems to break free from the water and hover above the  surface. A huge advantage is that it is not necessary to build  expensive take-off and landing strips for WIG craft; they can be  based on water and on shore alike. The WIG craft can move over  ice or a snowy surface and surmount any barriers.    The WIG craft, if it is successfully introduced, promises a  real "transport breakthrough." According to specialists'  assessments, the WIG craft belongs to the class of 21st century  flying machines, and in this field we are at least 20-25 years  ahead of many countries.    "Yes, we are the pioneers in the creation of WIG craft, but  in recent times we have increasingly become aware of Western  rivals 'breathing down our necks,'" Doctor of Technical Sciences  A. Maskalik says. "If urgent measures are not taken, we could  lose the advantage altogether. We have already designed and  successfully tested WIG craft weighing up to 500 tonnes which  can easily take off from, and land on, waves up to three meters  high."    At the "Volga" plant a huge craft with towering, gleaming,  duralumin sides stands on the building slipway. It is 77 meters  long, with a wingspan of 42 meters; the largest dimensions of  the fuselage are equal to those of a six-story block. This  craft was ordered by the military and is more than 80 percent  ready. But work has been mothballed for almost two years.  There was serious talk about whether to ax the craft  altogether....    In three decades the Nizhniy Novgorod plant has been  allocated funds for the entire "WIG program" which would suffice  for only half the cost of a single Il-76 aircraft. In his time  R. Alekseyev managed to bring together many talented young  specialists, made it possible to create the first studies for  the new flying machines to the highest standard. In recent  years, because of a lack of funding, many of those who pioneered  this work have been forced to leave the collective. Almost 150  designers and project workers now work in the "Tekhnologiya i  transport" joint-stock company, developing marine WIG craft of  various capacities to meet an order from a foreign firm. Some  $2 million has been poured into this project, and the first test  models should be manufactured and tested next year. The Nizhniy  Novgorod Aviation Plant is involved in the creation of small WIG  patrol craft [ekranoplany-katery]....    Maybe this is for the best -- the Central Hydrofoil Design  Bureau will have competitors, which promises the speediest  assimilation of the new flying technology. On the other hand,  the efforts of the specialists have been dissipated, and the  very rich scientific potential has been diluted. But one thing  is indisputable -- we must not lose our edge in WIG building.  At the same time, many firms in the United States, France,  Germany, and Japan are ready to join in the development of new  WIG craft with payloads of 1,500 tonnes. Talks on such  cooperation are under way.    I climbed together with V. Kirillov, the project's chief  designer, onto the building slipway of the half-built  "Spasatel," which occupied almost the whole of a workshop  several football fields in length. The "Spasatel" weighs 390  tonnes; it has a speed of up to 550 kph and a range of  3,000-4,000 km; the craft can carry up to 500 people. As my  companion remarked, the "Spasatel" has the dimensions of the  well-known "Ruslan" and "Mriya" aircraft. A hospital with an  operating theater and a resuscitation ward are envisaged here,  and also a special treatment post for providing aid to people  injured as a result of accidents in nuclear power installations  or in chemical strikes. The crew is equipped with inflatable  boats, ladders, and other rescue apparatus for operations in  conditions of strong sea gales.    All the same, the new WIG craft for peaceful purposes does  not yet have as rosy a future as one would like. The point is  that, effectively, these flying machines could be used in the  form of combined units consisting of three craft. The total  requirement for them in the initial period is at least 15 or so  vessels, but this already means profitable series production.  But at the moment the "Volga" plant complains of a shortage of  funds, which the Ministry of Defense is dishing out in overly  small portions. Meanwhile Russia's first "Spasatel," which is  awaited on the seas, is scheduled to leave the slipway this year.</p>

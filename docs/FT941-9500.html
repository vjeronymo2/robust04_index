			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Russia and China expected to lift sales of spirits Emerging markets such as Russia, China and South America could double world spirits sales within a few years, although sales of the top 100 international spirits brands were flat last year, according to Impact International*, the industry monitor. Total sales of the top 100 global brands were 268.7m nine-litre cases in 1993, with total world spirits sales at 530m cases, Impact says. UK-based International Distillers &amp; Vintners (Grand Metropolitan) remained the world's biggest spirits company, with sales of 43.2m cases, a 3.2 per cent increase on 1992. United Distillers (Guinness), the second largest, saw sales decline 1.1 per cent to 29.6m cases, but its higher-margin products performed well in the price-conscious UK, as well as in Japan and the US. Biggest loser among the top 10 companies was Japanese-owned Suntory, with sales down 9.1 per cent, due to depressed demand in Japan and the US. Scotch whisky remained the world's best selling spirit, with four brands (Grant's, Teacher's, Famous Grouse and Passport) among the 15 fastest growing worldwide. Johnny Walker Red Label remained the world's biggest selling Scotch, with 6.8m cases. The fastest growing spirits brand in the top 100 was Russia's Stolichnaya vodka, with a 20 per cent sales increase last year, much of it in the US. However, that was not enough to prevent temporary closure of Stolichnaya's distillery in Moscow last week. In addition to Stolichnaya, the Kristall plant produces a number of domestic Russian brands hit hard by increasing competition from western imports. IDV's Smirnoff sold an extra 600,000 cases in Russia last year, helping it to a 4.2 per cent increase in sales worldwide. Impact said the performance of western brands in Russia and two other emerging markets, China and South America, suggested spirits were poised for explosive growth. China showed strong sales of Cognac, with volume approaching 500,000 cases. Remy Martin, which has about half the Chinese Cognac market, increased global sales by 2.7 per cent thanks largely to performance in China. Scotch whisky is also catching on in China, with United Distillers selling more than 100,000 cases. In South America, sales in Brazil were especially strong, with brands such as Dreher brandy, Sao Joao de Barra brandy and Presidente brandy all showing strong increases. *Impact Intl, 387 Park Ave South, New York NY 10016</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Valuation warning on council tax A SIGN of potential contro-versy over property valuations for the council tax was given yesterday in figures from the Association of London Authorities which estimate that more than 400,000 of the capital's 2.8m properties are likely to be overvalued. The council tax will be based on property valuations at April 1991, with all properties allocated to one of eight bands according to value, with the lowest band A including properties of up to Pounds 40,000 and the highest band H taking in homes valued at more than Pounds 320,000. The figures from the Labour-dominated association are based on government figures for the likely number of properties in each band. The figures are qualified by an estimate by Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, that by April next year house prices in London will be 15 per cent lower than two years previously. On that basis, 420,000 households stand to pay an average of Pounds 93 a year more than if their properties were valued at 1993 prices. Since the decline in house prices has been sharpest in the south-east, homeowners in London stand to lose, compared to those in the Midlands, north and west. The Pounds 93 is calculated from estimates by an independent consultant. These suggest that next year's council tax for households with two or more people will vary from Pounds 359 for those in the lowest band to Pounds 1,079 for those in Band H. Figures released by the Inland Revenue's Valuation Office indicate that valuations are likely to come out lower than anticipated by the Department of the Environment. Some 45 per cent of properties across England are likely to be allocated to the lower two bands, compared to the government's estimate of 35 per cent. Since the basis of valuation is intended to be constant across the country as a whole, however, the perception of relative injustice and over-payment could remain strong. Homeowners will have no general right of appeal based on post-1991 declines in the values of their homes, but they will be able to make a challenge where they believe their property has been allocated to the wrong band on the basis of its April 1991 valuation. Mr Steve Bullock, vice-chairman of the association, said: 'With London house prices falling more rapidly than elsewhere, homeowners will end up paying a surcharge because the valuations will be two years out of date. Councils will be inundated with appeals but people will be annoyed when they find that there are no grounds in the legislation for such appeals.' The Department of the Environment dismissed the association's figures as 'speculation'. The valuation register will be available for inspection in the autumn, but local authorities are under no obligation to notify homeowners of their banding before the issuing of the first council tax bills next spring.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COUNCIL TAX: LONDON LOSERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Band                     Number       Number in     Average       Over-                        of homes      wrong band        bill     payment             (pounds)                               (pounds)    (pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A      up to 40,000      25,379             N/A         359         N/A B     40,001-52,000     166,358          24,954         419          60 C     52,001-68,000     447,329          67,099         479          60 D     68,001-88,000     629,312          94,397         539          60 E    88,001-120,000     677,619         101,643         659         120 F   120,001-160,000     435,491          65,324         779         120 G   160,001-320,000     442,475          66,371         899         120  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                 2,823,963         419,788         643          93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures do not include highest Band H  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Association of London Authorities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD CUP SOCCER;  </P> <P> ENGLAND AND SPAIN GET BERTHS WITH TIES  </P> <P> England and Spain tied their matches Wednesday but still became the seventh and  eighth nations to earns berths in the 24-team World Cup soccer finals next  summer in Italy.  </P> <P> Playing away from home, neither England nor Spain was able to win. England was  not even able to score in a tie against Poland at Katowice. Spain and Hungary  played to a 2-2 tie at Budapest. But all England and Spain needed to qualify  for the finals was the one point that is awarded for ties.  </P> <P> Spain's tie also virtually assured the first World Cup berth for Ireland, which  won Wednesday in Dublin against Northern Ireland, 3-0. To advance instead of  Ireland, Hungary would have to win at Spain next month by six goals and Ireland  would have to lose at winless Malta.  </P> <P> In other games Wednesday, Belgium, Romania and Scotland failed to advance to  the finals. But all still have an excellent chance of qualifying.  </P> <P> Aiming for its third consecutive appearance in the finals, Belgium tied, 2-2,  at Switzerland. Romania lost, 3-0, at Denmark. Denmark leads its region by one  point but must play Nov. 15 at Romania. Scotland lost, 3-0, at France, even  though the French were reduced to 10 men for most of the second half. Two of  the French goals came after defender Eric Di Meco was ejected.  </P> <P> Also, the Netherlands moved closer to a spot in the finals with a 2-1 victory  at Wales; Bulgaria won, 4-0, over Greece in a torrential rain at Varna,  Bulgaria; Portugal overpowered Luxembourg, 3-0, in a match played at  Saarbruecken, West Germany; and Yugoslavia, which already has clinched a berth  in the finals, beat Norway, 1-0, at Sarajevo on a penalty kick by Faruk  Hadzibegic.  </P> <P> England, which survived a last-minute Polish shot that ricocheted off the  crossbar, and its 40-year-old goalkeeper, Peter Shilton, did not give up a goal  during six qualifying matches. England scored 10 times as it won three games  and tied three.  </P> <P> In its victory, Ireland got goals from Ronnie Whelan, Tony Cascarino and Ray  Houghton against goalkeeper George Dunlop, an aircraft mechanic chosen to start  at the last minute for Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> "We're getting closer and closer (to the finals), and now we just want that  little whisper in the ear to say we're there," Ireland Coach Jack Charlton  said. "Then we'll all be delighted. It will mean a great deal to me, the  players and the people of Ireland, which is what it's all about, really."  </P> <P> It was only the fourth game ever between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> In Dublin, checks on cross-border traffic began Tuesday night in preparation  for the match, which started at noon Wednesday for security reasons.  </P> <P> More than 400 police and 1,300 match stewards were on duty in and around  Lansdowne Road, where large force of riot-control officers was standing by.  Police leave was canceled for the day.  </P> <P> Northern Ireland fans were being escorted to and from the stadium, where  possible, and checks for non-ticket-holders were being made half a mile from  the entrance gates.  </P> <P> Fewer than 1,000 tickets were officially sent to Northern Ireland fans, but  more fans than that were expected to go south.  </P> <P> Dogs trained to detect explosives joined searches of the stadium and  surrounding area.  </P> <P> The biggest security maneuver, however, was mounted in Poland, where 1,500 riot  police and anti-terrorist squad troops were drafted to watch the 1,000 or so  visiting English fans, after the violent scenes which marred England's visit to  Stockholm last month.  </P> <P> Police chief Major Wyszkowski warned: "If necessary we will use force. If the  English fans want to spoil it for their team, our cells are ready for them.'  </P> <P> Poland's leading authority on football hooliganism, Major Tadeusz Gorecki, said  Silesia Stadium in the Katowice suburb of Chorzow would be ringed by police and  mounted troops, roads into the city would be patrolled every 100 yards, and  units would be based outside the hotels where the fans were staying.  </P> <P> Inside the stadium, the largest policemen the country had to offer were ready  to form a human wall to keep the English fans segregated from the rest of the  crowd.  </P> <P> At Paris, where France and Scotland played, a special security fence was being  built to make sure that thousands of fans arriving without tickets did not get  near the stadium.  </P> <P> Yugoslavia was the only European nation to clinch a spot before Wednesday,  taking one of the two spots in its region. Brazil, Uruguay and Costa Rica also  have claimed spots, while Italy gets an automatic place because it is hosting  the finals and Argentina receives a spot as defending champion.  </P></p>

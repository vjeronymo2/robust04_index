			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- President Suharto cautioned Golkar  [Functional Group] leaders yesterday not to be easily swayed by  the political maneuverings of certain people.    Suharto, in his capacity as chief patron of the country's  ruling political groupings, said in a written statement that  there is talk of there being political undercurrents. He felt  that these are subverting Golkar because they have created the  impression that the group has been torn apart.    "These so called `undercurrents' don't exist," said Suharto,  who chairs the council that has the last word in Golkar. "They  are simply a few people who claim to speak on behalf of the  masses."    "This is nothing but political engineering. Politics cannot  be separated from engineering," he said in a keynote address to  Golkar's working conference. The speech was read by  Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare Azwar Anas, who sits  in the council.    Golkar has been shaken in the past few months by dissension  among some of its regional leaders in the elections of  provincial governors and regents.    Reports from the regents suggested that the dissenters were  responding to political engineering in those regions, and were  therefore casting their votes for the more popular local  leaders, instead of the candidates nominated by Golkar's central  executive board.    The term "political undercurrents" first became popular last  December with the election of Megawati Sukarnoputri as chairman  of the minority Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), despite stiff  opposition from the government and the Armed Forces.    Megawati Sukarnoputri, is the daughter of Sukarno,  Indonesia's first president.    The three-day conference is the first since the appointment  of Harmoko, minister of information in Suharto's cabinet, to  chair Golkar's central board last October.    Golkar leaders have attributed the regional dissension to  lack of discipline among the regional leaders, something which  they hope to straighten out at the gathering in Jakarta.    Harmoko told reporters after the opening ceremonies that the  central board will not tolerate disciplinary problems and will  punish members who have stepped out of line.    However, he denied allegations that Golkar was falling apart  just because some members refused to obey central directives in  local elections. "We are solid," he said.    In his speech, Suharto also told the estimated 600 Golkar  leaders to avoid debate on the presidential succession which has  been widely reported by the media in recent weeks.    The Patron Council feels it is not worth debating because  there is already a mechanism to deal with leadership  succession," he said referring to the five-yearly election  process through the People's Consultative Assembly.    Suharto, who is now 72, indicated several times this month  that he would not be pursuing a seventh, five-year term in  office but he stressed that he intends to stay till the end of  his current term in 1998.    The president also told the Golkar leaders to make sure that  the political grouping retains its majority position in the next  general election of 1997, targeting the estimated 21 million  young people who will be voting for the first time.    He said Golkar should ignore the allegations that the single  majority status that it has enjoyed could turn out into a  dictatorship.    "Five election victories have not turned us into a  dictatorship. On the contrary we have always represented the  views of the people and accommodated their aspirations."    He also said that Golkar should fight against any attempt to  reform election law, apparently referring to the constant  demands by PDI and the United Development party (PPP) for  changes in the electoral system.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Russian ministers warn of growing danger from 'fascism' RUSSIAN government ministers and their supporters yesterday warned of an imminent danger of 'fascism' as the battle lines were drawn ever more sharply between the majority of parliamentary deputies and the embattled reformers around Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. The army also stepped in as Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev warned the government's opponents yesterday that the army backed Mr Yeltsin and hinted it was ready to defend him with force. 'The army is on the side of the president, its commander-in-chief,' he said on television. 'Some politicians, making what they think are bold declarations towards the government and especially the legally elected president, are unaware of the consequences, not just political, but in terms of force, which could result from whipping up such political passions,' he said. Earlier Mr Pyotr Fillipov, a leading government supporter warned of a growing danger from 'former communists who are tomorrow's fascists'. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, himself departed from his usual restrained rhetoric when he said that 'in general, there exists a real danger of fascism'. The past 10 days have shaken Russia's political world out of a state of restrained hostilities to the verge of open war. The fragile power structure of the country is now in a ferment as the various forces battle for supremacy round the figure of President Yeltsin. On the government side, a group of ministers, together with Mr Yeltsin's most senior adviser, opened the campaign by briefing foreign journalists last Friday on the dangers of a reactionary coup. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister refined the argument to a claim that the president himself was under direct threat. Gen Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president and leading figure in the centrist Civic Union coalition - a coalition which has become increasingly hostile to the government, while still pledging allegiance to the president, democracy and reform - called directly on Wednesday for the resignation of more than six government ministers. On the same day, the Russian parliament rejected Mr Yeltsin's call for a four-month postponement of the Congress of People's deputies - the full legislature, comprising 1,045 deputies, many of them ex-communists, who are mostly bitter opponents to the government and its reform plans. Gen Rutskoi endorsed the parliament's action. In the midst of this, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, provided some light relief when he was accused, on Wednesday, of being under the influence of drink or drugs by Ms Bela Denisenko, the deputy minister of health. Mr Khasbulatov had alleged his life was in danger and that he was under constant surveillance: his medical advisor said he was suffering from overwork, too little sleep and too much smoking, and had him hospitalised. The incident had the political world buzzing, - but is an indication of the feverishly antagonistic state into which politics has fallen. These events took place against a background of steadily worsening economic crisis. Mr Feodor Prokopov, head of the Federal Employment Service, said this week unemployment had shot up from 200,000 to 600,000 over the past month and would reach nearly 1m by the end of the year - this may grossly understate the reality. In seeking to keep at bay the spectre of unemployment, the government has simply given up monetary discipline and has made little attempt to restructure industry. It is in danger of getting the worst of both worlds: it has not achieved a breakthrough in reform, but has not placated the forces ranged against it. Even if the president and a reform cabinet can bear this very hard pounding, it is now clear that radical reform, as conceived by Mr Gaidar's team and the world financial institutions, principally the IMF, is in tatters and can hardly be revived. Western governments, distracted as they all are by domestic pressures will, when they again focus on Russia, be required to take account of a situation much grimmer than it was in midsummer, when the Group of Seven met Mr Yeltsin in Munich and pledged continuing support. The IMF-approved plan for a rapid march to financial stability will not work: instead, aid will be required to achieve political stability. It may already be too late for the limited purchase foreign countries can exert. Even moderate opinion is deeply sceptical of western intentions: the 'centre' has shifted to a toughening nationalist position. Mr Yeltsin, like Mr Mikhail Gorbachev before him (though he hates the parallel), is seeking to pursue reform by a mixture of stubbornness, political skill and compromise; he has cards left to play, but they mostly involve raising the ante to confrontation, rather than making deals which can play one force off against the other. Winter is coming, and it will be the hardest the Russian president has yet had to face.</p>

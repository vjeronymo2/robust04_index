			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno; from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded]    [Text] One of the first new ministers to comment was Ciro  Zaa, transport and communications minister. He pledged to wage  an all-out struggle against administrative corruption at the  Transport and Communications Ministry, adding that will be one  of the first tasks he will undertake as minister.    [Zaa] "I also want to announce that I will invite the deans  of the engineering schools to work together to vindicate  national engineering by solving the problem of the black stain  [mancha negra]."    Carlos Bernandez, the new state minister and president of  the  Venezuelan Investment Fund, has affirmed the government's  commitment to devise a clear and extensive process of  privatization with the participation of national and  international investors. He has rejected the prevailing  arguments to avoid privatization of the airline Aeropostal  Venezolana, because, according to him, all airlines can be  privatized.    [Bernandez] "I don't believe there may be reasons not to  privatize anything. I think we must analyze the possibility of  privatizing all enterprises in the state's hands; moreover, when  there is talk of privatization, sometimes the very term is not  necessarily clear. What we must do is debureaucratize the state."    Meanwhile, Development Minister Alberto Poletto has  announced  he will officialize on 1 June a new 90-day extension of the  freeze of medicine prices but, rather, with a moderate  adjustment taking into consideration social circumstances and  the rate of inflation. Poletto has said he will strongly fight  speculation, adding he will use all legal means to apply severe  measures; nevertheless, he made it clear there will be no price  controls.    [Poletto] "We must differentiate between price increases  stemming from economic adjustments, such as the process of  devaluation, and those derived from speculation by the private  sector. I will strongly act against the latter and will try to  do all I can to prevent this from happening."    We have also received reports from the Presidential Palace  stressing the restructuring of Inavi [National Housing  Institute].    Francisco Gonzalez, acting urban development minister, has  announced Inavi will be reorganized to make it play an important  role in consolidating and equipping neighborhoods throughout the  country.    [Gonzalez] "I believe Inavi has a fundamental role to play  in  supporting the establishment of new regional housing institutes  in all states and regions; this will permit new housing  institutes to organize themselves under standardized criteria,  thus avoiding the creation of ill-conceived institutes and  additional disorder in this process."    Alfredo Gruber, the new president of the Venezuelan Guayana  Corporation, has made statements favoring [words indistinct]  strategic, similar to those signed in the oil industry. The  high-ranking official has explained he will analyze each case  that requires the participation of the private sector in order  to stimulate and promote the various industrial sectors of the  Venezuelan Guayana Corporation affiliates.    [Gruber] "After conducting an analysis upon the president's  request, we must implement the recommendations that are in the  country's best interests."    Finally, Luis Carlos Palacios, incoming Cordiplan [Central  Office of Coordination and Planning] minister, has said the  adjustment in exchange recently implemented by the Central Bank  of Venezuela will reduce the fiscal deficit to zero.    [Palacios] "The government's initial fiscal deficit for this  year was set at 2 percent of the gross domestic product. Now,  with the exchange rate, I am under the impression the  government's fiscal deficit will disappear, and a quasifiscal  deficit in the monetary area will appear. I will work to  evaluate the annual operating program."</p>

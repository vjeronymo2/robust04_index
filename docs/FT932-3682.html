			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A loan - or just a gift? Pounds 20,000 - against a property that my step-daughter has recently secured via an ordinary mortgage. I do not expect this 'loan' to be reduced and might soon wish to waive the charge. Will the Pounds 20,000 be treated as a gift for inheritance tax purposes? My wife and I wonder how to protect my step-daughter from this second charge in the event of our sudden deaths. We have not made provision for it in our wills. We would leave estate of around Pounds 140,000. If my step-daughter dies intestate, would 'her' property need to be sold to repay the second charge? We assume that you have loaned Pounds 20,000 to your step-daughter and have a charge over her house. At present, on your death, the loan would form part of your estate. As the total value of the estate of yourself and your wife is Pounds 140,000, this loan would bring the estate just over the nil rate band of Pounds 150,000; thus, Pounds 10,000 would be taxable on the death of the survivor, giving rise to an IHT charge of Pounds 4,000. Since you and your wife each have a nil rate band of Pounds 150,000, why not divide your assets in such a way that you each make a gift of half the loan on your respective deaths. Then, no IHT would be chargeable as the total gifts would be covered by the nil rate bands. If your estate was divided appropriately so that, together with the gift of the loan to your daughter, your individual assets still fell below the nil rate band of Pounds 150,000, no IHT would be paid. Unless action is taken, though, the executors of your estate could force the loan to be repaid on your death. This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of accountants Stoy Hayward.

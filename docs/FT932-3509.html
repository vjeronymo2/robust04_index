			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: Blackpool leisure project WATSON STEEL has won a Pounds 5.7m contract to supply steel for what is believed to be the world's highest rollercoaster, due to be built in Blackpool, Lancashire. Working for Blackpool Pleasure Beach, Watson will supply and erect a total of 2,000 tonnes of structural steel. Also to be installed under the contract is a further 250 tonnes of tubular steel running track. Fabrication will take place at Watson's Bolton factory during the summer months, with erection scheduled for a 10-week period commencing at the beginning of November, during BPB's close season. The steel work is to be erected on foundations completed at the beginning of the year by Shepherd Construction. At its highest point, the rollercoaster will stand 235ft high, 65ft taller than London's Nelson's column. From here, the drop has an angle of 65 degrees, which will allow cars to reach speeds of 85mph. The rollercoaster will run around BPB's 42-acre promenade site for just over a mile, and will be above all the existing rides.</p>

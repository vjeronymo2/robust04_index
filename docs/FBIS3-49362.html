			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Karvina, North Moravia Jan 6 (CTK) -- Czech  Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde today said that the life of the  Polish and Slovak minorities in the Karvina area is not  accompanied by any "aching problems that would require an  immediate solution."    At a press conference at the close of his two-day working  visit to North Moravia and Silesia, Uhde said he had very good  feelings from his meeting today with teachers from a Karvina  basic school where Slovak is a teaching language. He said he  saw no reasons for keeping its existence secret.    However, he said the existence of this school, the only one  in the Czech Republic, will not lead parliament to start  considering the expansion of this sort of school into other  cities in the republic.    Uhde described his talks with members of the Polish council  in Cesky Tesin, which represents the interests of more than  50,000 ethnic Poles living in the Czech Republic, as  stimulating. In the Karvina area alone there are currently  about 23,350 citizens claiming to be of Polish origin and 23,550  citizens describing themselves as ethnic Slovaks.    Asked about a possible return of property confiscated from  the ethnic Poles under the communist regime (toppled in  Czechoslovakia in November 1989), Uhde said that it is  impossible to extend the date further back beyond February 1948  (when the communists seized power in the former Czechoslovakia).  He recalled that the property was confiscated not only after  1945 but also before and in the course of the Second World War.</p>

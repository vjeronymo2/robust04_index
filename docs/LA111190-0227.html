			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ARTS FOR AMATEURS;  </P> <P> BRUSH WITH WOOD-PAINTING, UKRAINIAN CULTURE  </P> <P> During the long, freezing winters, the Ukrainian people used to huddle around  the stove that traditionally warmed the family living room and take cheer from  the brightly painted furniture that seemed to warm the bleak and cheerless  days.  </P> <P> This traditional Ukrainian art, known as petrykivka, or wood painting, will be  taught by artist Zenovia Wrzesniewski from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Nov. 25 and Dec.  15 at the Ukrainian Art Center in Los Angeles, 4315 Melrose Ave., Director  Daria Chaikovsky said.  </P> <P> "You don't need any particular skills and all the materials will be furnished,"  said Wrzesniewski, adding that the only thing participants need is a little  patience.  </P> <P> "The classes will be very small so that I can work with each person  individually, and we will begin by painting a medallion that you can either  wear around your neck, or put on your Christmas tree."  </P> <P> Wrzesniewski said there are a few brush strokes that she will teach and then  she will show how to work on the wood that she will have already prepared for  the students. The technique, also known as tole painting, can be used to make  decorations as basic or elaborate as the individual artist wishes, she said.  </P> <P> "In the Ukraine, we used to paint our furniture, our walls, the floors and all  other wood surfaces, as well as plates, bread boxes, gift boxes, cups and our  shelves, in order to bring vivid color and brightness into our lives," she  said.  </P> <P> As the former Zenovia Iwanchuk, born 63 years ago in the Ukrainian town of  Lviev, near the Polish border, she and her parents left during World War II on  an odyssey that took them to displaced-persons camps in Germany, Switzerland  and England, and eventually to Canada.  </P> <P> "Ukrainians love bright colors because they make a bold, affirmative statement  and we are a positive people," said Wrzesniewski, who met her husband,  Bohuslav, now an Orange County aerospace engineer, in a Ukrainian youth group  in Toronto. Since the couple came to Southern California in the late '60s,  Zenovia Wrzesniewski has tried to perpetuate the skills her artist mother  taught her, most recently by teaching at the Ukrainian Art Center.  </P> <P> She said that the tole painting will open up a whole new avenue of personalized  Christmas presents for the participants to make. "You can do jewelry or paint  on an appropriate wood surface," she said. "Actually, you can decorate anything  made of wood with the tole technique."  </P> <P> Zenovia Wrzesniewski's daughter, Adriana, plans to take another art center  workshop in which Ukrainian musician Volodymyr Sukhiy will give a beginning  class in the bandura, a 14th-Century instrument with 20 to 60 strings that  Adriana says sounds like a mandolin.  </P> <P> "I have always loved the sound the instrument makes," she said, "and since it  is part of my heritage, I am going to give it a try."  </P> <P> The music class is a four-day session held from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. beginning  Saturday and continuing on Nov. 25 and Dec. 9 and 15.  </P> <P> According to Chaikovsky, who is in charge of the heritage program for the  center, students may either bring their own instrument, if they have one in the  family, or rent one from the center.  </P> <P> In addition to the petrykivka and bandura classes, there will be instruction in  pysanka, the centuries-old Ukrainian wax technique for decorating eggs. The  technique can be used to make Christmas decorations and tree hangings,  Chaikovsky said.  </P> <P> There will also be a two-day class in embroidery that will include  cross-stitching, Chaikovsky said.  </P> <P> For those wishing to learn more about Ukrainian arts and crafts, there will be  an open house from noon to 5 p.m. Dec. 2 at the center. The event will feature  an exhibition of oil paintings and graphics of Ukrainian historical themes by  Vitaliy Lytvyn, who was born in the western Ukraine and lives in Toronto.  Another exhibition will feature the work of doll maker Valentina Solo, who  began creating regional Ukrainian dolls to support herself when she emigrated  from the Ukraine to the United States, Chaikovsky said.  </P> <P>  The petrykivka class will be offered Nov. 25 and Dec. 15 for $25 per session.  The bandura will be taught in four sessions, Saturday, Nov. 25, Dec. 9 and 15  for $45. The embroidery class will be offered in two sessions, Nov. 17 and Dec.  9, for $35. The pysanka class will be offered Nov. 17, Nov. 25, Dec. 9 and Dec.  15 for $25 per session. All classes are held between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. at the  Ukrainian Art Center, 4315 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles. For information, call  (213) 668-0172.  </P></p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: Nikon to cut 450 jobs to maintain profitability NIKON, the Japanese camera and semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker, said yesterday it would cut 450 jobs from the company payroll over the next four years, bringing down the size of the workforce by 6 per cent to 7,000. Nikon said it was forced to cut staff in order to maintain an adequate level of profitability, thus joining a growing list of mainstream Japanese manufacturing companies which have found that the fast pace of growth of recent years has left them dangerously exposed to the economic downturn. Sales of Nikon's semiconductor manufacturing equipment have fallen sharply as electronics companies have responded to the slump in the industry by slashing investment budgets. Sales of cameras, eyeglasses, and measuring equipment are also poor. The company plans to reduce recruitment by natural wastage. About 60 new employees will be inducted into the company next year, compared to 200 last spring. An average of 100 new employees a year are to join the company over the next four years. With about 200 employees leaving the company each year, total employment will decline gradually. Nikon's parent company pre-tax profit fell by 62.4 per cent to Y7.23bn (Dollars 58m) in the year to March. Although the company has yet to revise its forecast for this year, it is thought to be struggling to stay in the black.</p>

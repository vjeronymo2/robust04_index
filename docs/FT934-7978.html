			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAT upset Concern over the US insurance unit of BAT Industries gave investors a chance to take profits following the surge which has taken the share price of the tobacco and insurance conglomerate to an all-time high. News that the California Insurance Commission will investigate BAT's Farmers Insurance Group after it was criticised by a judge sent the shares down 13 to 503p with 8.7m traded. However, BAT said yesterday that it was confident that the Farmers subsidiary would pass any review into its procedures. And analysts said problems related to an agency involved with Farmers, rather than Farmers itself. Paints group Kalon saw unusually high turnover as one big institutional shareholder sold its entire stake in the company via Kalon's broker, Smith New Court. Some 8.2m shares were bought at 164p and placed with a variety of institutions at 166p apiece. The shares represent 6.8 per cent of the company. In August, the leading institutional stakeholders were Prolific Asset Management with 7.8 per cent and 3i with 6.3 per cent. Kalon dipped 4 1/2 to 167p. The oil majors, British Petroleum and Shell Transport, were 'spooked', according to oil sector specialists, by the crude oil market's failure to make any progress during the last week or so and also by suggestions that US funds had turned sellers of BP, having built up holdings in excess of 27 per cent over the past 18 months or so. Talk of heavy selling from the US was viewed as surprising by UK analysts, although BP shares drifted down 9 1/2 to 341 1/2 p. 'BP have come back in line with the US oil majors, nothing more,' said one specialist. Shell, however, was aggressively sold and settled 11 down at 681p after the oil team at Kleinwort Benson published a straight sell recommendation on Shell and Royal Dutch. Downgrading the stocks from 'hold' to 'sell', Kleinwort said both 'offered a safe earnings and dividend stream but the ratings appeared stretched on yield relative grounds'. The sector's exploration and production stocks staged a rally, with Enterprise up 8 to 453p on good turnover of 1.3m and Lasmo 3 harder at 133p, after 135p. Selected property shares continued their rise begun on Monday, with Land Securities again showing a good advance ahead of today's results. Analysts expect little change to last year's Pounds 116m, but a confident statement would help consolidate the shares' recent strength. There was also talk in the market that the group is poised to announce the development of Stag Place in London's West End, with the Department of Environment tipped to pre-let part of it in a Pounds 5m deal. Land rose 13 to 728p. Gambling and hotels group Ladbroke was again under pressure as joint house broker Smith New Court cut its profits forecast. Other brokers followed suit as worries surfaced that the group's DIY business was suffering in the industry's prolonged price war. Smith was said to have cut from Pounds 152m to Pounds 140m. The shares fell 6 to 157p in turnover of 5.3m. Forte was said to be talking to analysts about improving occupancy levels in its London hotels. The shares improved 3 to 234p. Drinks giant Guinness surged as NatWest Securities reaffirmed its positive stance and James Capel was said to have issued a buy note. The stock advanced 13 to 442p. Whitbread 'A' added 10 at 499p on speculation that tomorrow's results will exceed market expectations. VTR shares forged ahead 17 to 99p after the video editing group announced profits up 103 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Irbil -- Regrettably, sporadic armed clashes took  place in some quarters in Irbil on the evening of Sunday, 29 May  1994. As a result of these clashes, a number of people from  both parties [the Kurdistan Democratic Party, KDP, and the  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, PUK] were killed or wounded, some  houses were damaged, and wheat fields in the northern and  eastern quarters of Irbil were set ablaze, inflicting huge  losses on the owners of these fields.    The leadership of both parties, the KDP and PUK, issued a  joint statement in which they called for an immediate  cease-fire. The events were contained thanks to the  intervention and efforts exerted by all parties, including the  Operation Room and the joint security committee in Irbil.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 28 Jun (MENA) -- Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat has issued a decree forming a committee chaired by Yahya  Khalaf, head of the PLO's Cultural Department, to travel to the  Palestinian autonomy region to learn about the situation there  at first hand and prepare a report to be presented to the  Palestinian leadership.    Yahya Khalaf stated that the Palestinian leadership will  study this report in light of which it will make its final  decision on who should return to Gaza and Jericho immediately  and who should wait until special arrangements to return are  made.    He said the committee, which includes Jamil Shihadah,  secretary general of the Palestinian Teachers Union, and Rawhi  Futuhi, secretary of the Palestinian popular organizations, will  travel to Amman later today en route to Jericho and then the  Gaza Strip to prepare the report and present it to the  Palestinian leadership within three days.</p>

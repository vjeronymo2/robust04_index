			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik </F> Botha by announcer Jeremy Dawes in the Johannesburg studio; date  not given; from the "Radio Today" program -- recorded]    [Text] As you are no doubt aware, the price of petrol is to  go up by 8 cents a liter from a minute past midnight tomorrow  night. Earlier, we spoke to the mineral and energy affairs  minister, Pik Botha, who assured us that the government has done  everything in its power to avoid the inevitable.    [Begin recording] [Botha] Actually, the increase should have  been 14 cents per liter, but because of the government's  sensitivity for the consumer and the problem this will cause, we  for weeks worked with the National Economic Forum and the Liquid  Industry Fuels Task Force to achieve this. I am very sorry this  is the case, but it's like the weather--you have no control over  it. I trust that our public will understand this.    [Dawes] Some of the biggest fuel users or petrol users are  the taxi operators. Is government promoting the use of diesel  motor power by taxi operators to minimize fuel usage?    [Botha] Well, this matter, together with a lot of the  fundamental issues surrounding the fuel industry in this  country, will now be thoroughly investigated and examined by the  government in conjunction with and with the assistance of the  National Economic Forum and the Liquid Fuels Industry Task  Force, and I trust that within weeks we will come up, hopefully,  with a new mechanism for determining the petrol price.  Secondly, to look at precisely, aspects like the one you  mentioned.    I am not this morning in a position offhand to say whether  that is feasible, but certainly we are sympathetic--more than  sympathetic to the problems of the taxi industry. They are  carrying almost half, if not more than half, of all passengers  in this country. They are the single largest user and consumer  of petrol, and anything that can alleviate their position we  will support.    [Dawes] Mr. Botha, the Automobile Association is in favor of  deregulation of the whole system. How do you feel about this?    [Botha] I am open-minded. I am open-minded, and I am  prepared to recommend any system that will...that will make  petrol less expensive for our people, for our consumers, but  then it must be thoroughly investigated so that it is not a  temporary...not a temporary, interim reduction that is brought  about, but that, in the long term, the interest of all the  parties involved are served. There are 28,000 pump attendants  spread out through this country. I want to know: Will they lose  their jobs? If there is what they call, you know, vertical  integration. I want to know: What about the small operator, far  away from the major urban areas? Will he survive? We need  small businesses. Small businesses are the entities that employ  people and resolve your employment problem, unemployment  problems, so it is a complicated issue but of course we are  sympathetic to any suggestion that takes into account a balance  of interest.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with S.N. Baburin, State Duma deputy, member of </F> the Russian Way parliamentary group, and leader of the Russian  All-People's Union, by LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA correspondent in  Bulgaria Olga Reshetnikova; in Sofia; date not given: "Sergey  Baburin: 'Drawing on the Experience of History...' The Balkan  Knot and Russia"]    [Text] S.N. Baburin visited Yugoslavia (as a member  of a State Duma delegation) and Bulgaria together with his  colleagues from the Russian Way parliamentary group, S.A. Glotov  and A.A. Dolgopolov. As far as their trip to Bulgaria is  concerned, it is noteworthy in its own right: Figures of the  patriotic movement in Russia of such renown have not visited  here yet; the Bulgarian public has a hazy notion about the  movement itself, whereas the leading Bulgarian mass media, as a  rule, paint it in the "Red-and-Brownshirt" tones and invariably  associate it with the name of V.V. Zhirinovskiy. In Sofia, S.N.  Baburin gave an interview to this correspondent.    [Reshetnikova] Sergey Nikolayevich, what was the purpose of  your trip to Yugoslavia?    [Baburin] Contrary to the commonplace view of a "brilliant"  foreign policy victory of Russia which has succeeded in  forestalling the bombing of Serbian positions in Bosnia by NATO  forces, we believe that on the whole, the current leaders of the  foreign policy establishment are proceeding within the framework  of the U.S. strategic plan in resolution of the Yugoslav crisis,  having in particular played along with the United States in  forming a Croatian-Muslim state association. In the course of  developing its specific proposals for the settlement of the  Yugoslav conflict, it became necessary for the ROS [Russian  All-People's Union], of which I am a leader, to verify the  correctness of the analysis of the situation existing there  locally, to examine the position of the Russian military  contingent in Yugoslavia and the conditions and nature of its  activities, and to analyze the consequences of the introduction  of Turkish "blue helmets" to Bosnia. We took advantage of a  long-standing invitation to visit Yugoslavia which had been  confirmed at a recent meeting with R. Karadzic in Moscow. The  trip turned out to be very useful. We accumulated many  observations, and listened to our Serbian friends and Russian  servicemen. All of this has yet to be analyzed and the requisite  conclusions have yet to be drawn. Therefore at present it is  premature to discuss specific results. However, I can note one  point right now: Serious adjustments should be made in the  policy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia with regard  to the Yugoslav crisis.    [Reshetnikova] Do you think that now, when Yugoslavia is the  focus of attention for reasons that are easy to understand,  other countries of the Balkan region, primarily our traditional  partner Bulgaria, have been left out of the field of vision of  Russian politicians? Meanwhile, the leadership of Bulgaria has  declared the country to be a francophone state to which the  imperial ambitions of Russia allegedly pose the main threat.  Sofia, the sworn brother of Tel Aviv and Ankara, is knocking on  the doors of NATO, and on the day of the national holiday they  fly the flag of the European Community here....    [Baburin] While both interested parties share the blame for  the current state of Russian-Bulgarian relations, I cannot but  acknowledge a serious omission in the foreign policy of Russia.  This state of affairs ought to be rectified as soon as possible.  This is why we eagerly accepted the invitation to come to  Bulgaria issued by deputies of the Bulgarian parliament from the  Fatherland Party of Labor, as well as the Zora Political Circle,  whose approach to quite a number of key problems is close to  that of the ROS: We are in favor of traditionalism, a reverent  attitude toward the past, an original national path of  development for each country, major economic reforms on the  basis of a mixed economy, but without the total annihilation of  all things that have proven to be viable and useful. We have  come to Bulgaria in order to establish direct interparty and  interparliamentary links, to consult, and to discuss problems  which are immediate for both Russia and Bulgaria. The spectrum  of such problems is very broad: Prospects for the resumption of  economic cooperation between our two countries, the role of  Russia and Bulgaria in settlement of the Yugoslav crisis and  keeping the peace in the Balkans in general, the problem of  integration of East European countries in NATO, and so on. A  conversation with, for example, Chairman of the National  Assembly of Bulgaria A. Yordanov indicated that we do not have  mutual understanding on all these problems. We believe that NATO  in the form in which it continues to exist is aimed against  Russia even now. Yes, we are in favor of a partnership for  peace, but a genuine partnership on an equal footing. For now,  an attempt to make our states fit its political, economic,  military, and cultural standards is obvious in the approach of  the United States; meanwhile, both Russia and Bulgaria have  paths of their own. We can accomplish a genuine revival only by  drawing on our national traditions and our experience of  history. We differed with the chairman of the Bulgarian  parliament in our assessment of Bulgarian-Soviet relations in  the past. Certainly, the imitation of friendship and the  uncritical attitude toward each other harmed relations between  our peoples. However, it would be incorrect to discard outright  the existence of sincere friendly feelings which the Bulgarian  people had during those years and, as I have ascertained, retain  to this day. Just because we are from Russia, we were very  warmly greeted both in Sofia and in the cities of Kazanluk,  Shipka, and Kurdzhali.    [Reshetnikova] You visited areas which are densely settled  by  the Turkish and Bulgarian Muslim population in the immediate  proximity of Turkey. It is little known in our country that  certain external forces are attempting to fuel interethnic and  religious conflicts in Bulgaria and encourage pro-Turkish and  pro-Macedonian separatist organizations. The American ambassador  to Bulgaria openly states that the Bulgarian Constitution which  bans the creation of parties and political organizations on an  ethnic basis is "imperfect." To your mind, how grave is the  danger of the Bosnian scenario being replicated in Bulgaria?    [Baburin] This is a very serious problem, and I am  profoundly  convinced that the leadership of Bulgaria underestimates it,  however, like the leadership of Russia. The state must guarantee  the rights and liberties of all its citizens; in turn, any  attempt to acquire special rights merely along ethnic or  religious lines represents a step toward the destruction of not  just democracy but also the state itself. At a meeting with the  public of the city of Kurdzhali I said frankly: "Look at what is  happening in Russia; may this be a warning to you against  experiments involving the demand to make your area autonomous."  The activities of separatist organizations may result in the  splitting up of Bulgaria along ethnic and religious lines, which  is tantamount to the death of the Bulgarian state. The  separation of the Rhodope [Mountains], which are populated by  the Turkish and Bulgarian-Muslim element, will directly connect  Turkey to Macedonia (where the proportion of Muslims is growing  continuously), and subsequently to Albania and Bosnia.    [Reshetnikova] Indeed, the actions of Washington and Ankara  in the Balkans reveal an aspiration to create a "Muslim arc"  here that will pass through the north of Greece, the south of  Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania, and Bosnia. The creation of this  arc will place an effective means to pressure Europe at the  disposal of Washington and, in addition, will isolate the  Christian states--Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria--from one  another, also separating them from Russia. Bulgarian patriotic  forces are seriously concerned about this prospect, and are  looking to Russia with hope. As we have learned, the "Worldwide  Congress of Slavic Orthodox Christian Nations," of which V.V.  Zhirinovskiy became chairman, has just been held in Moscow; the  ideas of creating an all-Slavic parliament and army have been  voiced. What is your opinion of this?    [Baburin] One should receive the eccentric statements of  V.V.  Zhirinovskiy while keeping it definitely in mind that he is a  young politician; this is why excessive attention to his  declarations is harmful for him, just as is free advertisement.  In general it surprises me that in Bulgaria, Zhirinovskiy is  perceived to be a representative of national-patriotic forces.  There is nothing for Zhirinovskiy to create. The inseparable  bond between Russia and the Balkan nations has been created over  millennia. Russia is historically responsible for the countries  of the Balkan Peninsula; it was and still is a guarantor of  their territorial integrity and independence. We are against the  attempt, foisted on us from the outside, to create a pillar of  Russian policy in the form of one Balkan state at the expense of  others and come out in favor of mutually advantageous relations  on an equal footing between Russia and all Balkan states,  primarily Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Greece, which are  traditionally close to us. To my distress, the chairman of the  Bulgarian parliament characterized this task as "not too  essential." For ages the enemies of Russia and the Orthodox  faith have set the task of the Balkan nations quarreling among  themselves. A patriotic Russia sets the task of achieving mutual  understanding and cooperation among these nations. We are  against the creation of military blocs in this region, including  blocs of a pan-Slavic nature. Our victory is not in achieving  military superiority but in the victory of the spirit and  economics. So far a Russian foreign policy concept for the  Balkans has not been apparent. The current leaders of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs operate by the trial-and-error  method. However, this is a dead end: Ill-conceived steps cause  problems whose resolution produces illusory victories, but  nobody is held responsible in the process. I am convinced that  for Russia it was a mistake to vote in favor of sanctions  against Serbia and Montenegro and agree to the Turkish military  presence in the Balkans under the guise of the "blue helmets."  This will unavoidably encourage separatist trends in the  Muslim-populated areas of Greece, Bulgaria, and Macedonia, and  boost the pressure of Turkey, the United States, and NATO on  Belgrade, Sofia, and Athens, which will be unable to effectively  resist it, given the unpredictable and inconsistent policy of  Russia. However, I believe that the situation will change;  Russia will finally follow a far-sighted foreign policy course  based first of all on its national-state interests. For this to  happen, truly democratic, patriotic forces with a statesmanlike  frame of mind, for whom serving the Motherland is above all,  should come to power in our country.</p>

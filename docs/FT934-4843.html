			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / MMC recommends curbs on Stagecoach The Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruled yesterday that the acquisition by Stagecoach Holdings, the fast-growing bus company, of a bus depot in Lancaster could operate against the public interest. It recommended that Stagecoach should give undertakings limiting its ability to retaliate against new bus operators entering the market. Perth-based Stagecoach said the commission had not found evidence that it had restricted competition, and it would be happy to hold discussions with the Office of Fair Trading. The operations affected by the report produced revenues of less than Pounds 2m out of the company's total Pounds 175m turnover. The reference to the monopolies commission arose after Stagecoach bought a bus depot and 12 buses from Lancaster City Transport in August for Pounds 700,000. Stagecoach, which feared that a bid for the entire company would prompt a monopolies reference, offered more for the depot than other bidders had offered for the entire company, and the municipally owned bus company subsequently went into voluntary liquidation. The OFT will seek undertakings from Stagecoach that if it reduces fares or increases its bus frequencies to fight off competition, it will not subsequently raise fares or reduce services if the competitor withdraws. It will also attempt to gain an agreement that it will not introduce a more frequent service than a new competitor on any route. Mr Derek Scott, Stagecoach finance director, said: 'We are very frustrated at the inquiry because we have been investing and we have not put up fares. The undertakings they want are for the most part not unreasonable. 'We are unhappy about not being able to run a more frequent service than competitors. That seems to be re-regulating what has been de-regulated.' The Monopolies and Mergers Commission report is the fourth on Stagecoach in three years and OFT is also investigating allegations of anti-competitive behaviour by the company's Fife Scottish Omnibuses subsidiary. Mr Scott said: 'It seems a lot, but there are 400 bus company complaints a year to the OFT. We have 6 per cent of the bus market and regard it as an occupational hazard.'</p>

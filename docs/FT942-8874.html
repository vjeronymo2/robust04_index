			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Toronto SE urges greater boardroom independence The Toronto stock exchange has urged publicly-traded companies to have a majority of independent outside directors on their boards. The report of the TSE Committee on Corporate Governance suggested such companies should report annually on the make-up of their boards, detailing any directors' connections with controlling shareholders and management. It called for penalties for directors of companies that provided improper information to shareholders. Allegations would be subject to a due diligence defence. The committee said outside directors should meet regularly to review board performance and co-operation and take steps to ensure boards operate independently from management. The report was drafted in response to a rash of corporate failures since 1990 and shareholder complaints of lack of information. About 70 per cent of the companies traded on the TSE have controlling shareholders who usually want the make-up of boards to reflect their interests.</p>

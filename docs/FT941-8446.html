			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Markets Report: D-Mark firmer The trend of European interest rate cuts continued yesterday with Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Spain following the example set by Germany on Thursday, writes Philip Gawith. Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy had already cut rates on Thursday. After weakening on Thursday, the D-Mark yesterday made up ground against most European currencies as other countries cut rates. The market appeared to be rewarding the easing of policy as being good for growth. Elsewhere, sterling traded lower after disappointing lending figures prompted concern about the strength of economic recovery, raising the prospect of a further rate-cut. In Europe the Danish central bank cut its discount and key deposit rate to 5.50 per cent from 5.75 per cent; Sweden cut its key marginal rate to 7.25 from 7.50 per cent; the Bank of Finland's money market tender rate fell to 4.75 from 4.95 per cent and the Bank of Spain reduced its daily intervention rate by about 0.25 to around 8.55 per cent. The Spanish cut surprised domestic money markets. Some analysts saw the easing as a possible gesture to help Spain's fragile economic recovery. The Danish Central Bank governor Mr Erik Hoffmeyer told Reuters in an interview that having brought Danish key rates down to the same level as in other European countries, Denmark would probably now follow the general European downward trend in interest rates. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, said the stronger D-Mark was a case of markets 'rewarding pro-growth policy initiatives.' Mr Chris Turner, currency analyst at BZW, cautioned however against D-Mark appreciation because of reflex pessimism about the likely pace of monetary easing. 'If the D-Mark is going up because another cut is not seen for another 4 months, then it's on dodgy ground.' Mr Turner said Germany looked to be 'firmly back on the easing path.' A feature of the European scene yesterday was the failure of the French central bank to cut rates despite the depressed state of its economy. Mr MacKinnon said a 'very significant' relaxation was required to ensure economic recovery. With the Bundesbank, however, expected to concentrate on steadying market expectations rather than pursuing a path of dramatic cuts, he predicted rates might not fall 'fast enough or to levels that are to the liking of the French.' Sterling closed yesterday at DM2.5406, down from DM2.5559 on Thursday. Part of the weakness can be attributed to the the release of M4 bank and building society figures - lending rose Pounds 200m in January compared to market forecasts of a Pounds 2.5bn increase - suggesting that the private sector remains unwilling to take on new debt. A further factor weighing on sterling is the perception that UK rates may well fall faster than those in Germany, following the Bundesbank's cautious easing of policy on Thursday. Sterling also finished stronger against the weak US dollar, closing in London at Dollars 1.4788 from Dollars 1.474 on Thursday. The Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 900m of assistance yesterday afternoon after not operating in the market in the morning. This assistance matched a forecast liquidity shortage of around Pounds 900m, revised up from an earlier estimate of about Pounds 700m.</p>

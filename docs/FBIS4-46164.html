			<p>BFN     [Text] Any unexpected actions or movements by the  terrorists who seized the bus carrying passengers could also  affect Stavropol Kray's neighbour, Krasnodar Kray, as was the  case very recently during similar events in Rostov. The  Krasnodar Kray militia has therefore been placed on full combat  readiness, an ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from the kray  interior affairs directorate.    A telephone conference was held with chiefs from town and  rayon militia departments, which also is heightening the  readiness of personnel in case there were unexpected  developments in the operational situation.    Preparations were made for a helicopter carrying special  purpose subunits to fly to Mineralnyye Vodiy, but its departure  was postponed after special purpose troops from Moscow arrived  there.</p>

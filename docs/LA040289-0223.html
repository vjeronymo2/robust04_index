			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IDENTITY OF BIRDS IN PHOTOS HARD TO SWALLOW  </P> <P> Your recent article on the swallows returning to Capistrano included a photo  showing some pigeons and another bird, supposedly a swallow, sitting on a bell  tower.  </P> <P> That was no swallow. It had the unmistakable silhouette of a starling. Also,  from my experience, swallows seldom perch in places like this, preferring a  power line or twig of a tree.  </P> <P> R.E.

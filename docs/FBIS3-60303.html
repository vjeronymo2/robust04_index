Over the past 40-plus years more than 1,000,000 curies of  radio-nuclides have accumulated here on the industrial site of  one of Russia's major defense complexes in water reservoirs and  special technological storage facilities. They present a  serious threat not just to the Urals region but the whole planet.    [Academician N.P. Laverov, vice president of the Russian  Academy of Sciences, identified by caption] This is a very  complex problem. There has been nothing like this in the  history of mankind. There has never been such an accumulation  of radioactive waste. Therefore any step which is taken now  demands careful scientific substantiation.    [Sergeyev] The Russian Government has adopted a program for  the rehabilitation of the contaminated areas in the southern  Urals. Scientists have been assigned an important role in its  implementation. A session of the scientific and technical  council has been held at Chelyabinsk-65, where specialists  discussed the results of the steps taken in the year that is  ending and elaborated tactics for combatting the dangerous  radio-nuclides for the coming year.

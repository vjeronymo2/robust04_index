			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Islamic demonstrators call for Youssef dismissal More than 5,000 Islamic supporters, some armed, marched through Gaza City yesterday calling for the dismissal of the Palestinian military chief in a continuing upsurge of tension in the Palestinian controlled area, reports Julian Ozanne. The march followed riots earlier in the day by angry students demonstrating against an internal Palestinian crack down on the extremist Hamas movement responsible for the kidnapping and killing of an Israeli soldier last week. Hamas has demanded that Mr Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, sack Gen Nasr Youssef who last week headed the operation to arrest and question Hamas activists believed to have information on the kidnapped Israeli. During yesterday's march organised by Hamas some activists fired guns in the air in defiance of last week's PLO decision to ban unlicensed firearms. The disturbances reveal the bitter divide which has emerged between the PLO and Hamas since the kidnapping crisis. In an effort to calm the tension Mr Arafat yesterday began releasing some of the 300 Hamas activists he arrested last week and detained a PLO general who ordered his troops to fire in the air during a Hamas demonstration at the Gaza central prison on Saturday. Mr Arafat's advisers have warned the PLO leader against giving in to Israeli and western pressure.</p>

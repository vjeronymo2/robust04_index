			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Warm welcome for Halifax floating-rate notes The eurobond market remained mired in summer torpor yesterday, and only a handful of new issues saw the light of day. However, against the backdrop of rising US interest rates, a Dollars 500m five-year floating-rate issue for the UK's Halifax Building Society received a warm welcome. The notes, which pay a coupon of three-month Libor, were issued at 99.645 where they yield 8 basis points over Libor. While some traders felt the pricing was on the tight side, most said the issue met good demand. 'With interest rates rising, people's appetite for floating-rate paper is growing,' said a syndicate manager. According to an official at HSBC, which led the deal jointly with Lehman Brothers, the Halifax's debut in the dollar floating-rate sector 'went better than expected,' attracting demand from banks, institutions, building societies and money market funds. Dealers said the deal was also supported by a recent dearth of supply in the FRN sector, which had caused yield spreads in the secondary market to narrow sharply. Elsewhere, General Electric Capital Canada issued CDollars 100m of 8 7/8 per cent five-year notes via Merrill Lynch. The bonds were priced to yield 10 basis points over the corresponding Canadian benchmark, which most dealers considered appropriate given that previous Canadian dollar issues for GECC trade at even tighter spreads. Aegon NV, the Dutch life insurance and pension management company, made its debut in the US domestic bond market with Dollars 400m of 12-year subordinated bonds. Despite the bonds' unusual maturity and subordinated status, the deal met strong demand, said lead manager J. P. Morgan. Although issuance is expected to remain thin this week, there was some talk that Denmark might tap the euroyen sector with some structured issues targeted at Japanese retail investors. There was also talk that Japanese government-backed agencies might tap the 10-year dollar sector soon. Barclays Overseas Investment Company BV announced the early repayment of all its DM250m 8 1/8 per cent bearer bonds due 1998. Repayment of the bonds, which were issued in 1983, will take place on December 1 at 101 per cent of par value.</p>

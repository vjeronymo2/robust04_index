The main  theme of the draft government work report is to comprehensively  and vigorously advance the modernization process in line with  the socialist market economic framework formulated by the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. However, the  20 characters, "seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open wider  to the outside world, promote development, and maintain  stability," which was put forward by General Secretary Jiang  Zemin and endorsed by the CPC Central Committee, will be taken  as the principle for overall work in 1994.    It was learned that the draft government work report for the  solicitation of opinions is divided into seven parts. The  contents include a review of work in 1993 and stress the need to  maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang  2170 4958, 1816 6643, 0256 1660] growth in the national economy,  vigorously advance reform of the economic structure, establish a  new socialist market economic structure, strive to create and  preserve a harmonious and stable environment for social life,  and promote the reunification cause of the motherland and  diplomatic work.    The authoritative person said: On striving to create and  preserve a harmonious and stable environment for social life,  the report especially maintains that, in strengthening public  order, it is necessary to crack down hard on criminal offenders,  continuously investigate and deal with major and important  cases, resolutely wipe out pornography and eliminate the "six  vices," and quickly strengthen the ranks of public security, the  procuratorate, and the judiciary. This part also deals with  such issues as nationality unity, the development of democracy  and the legal system, and stepping up the modernization of  national defense. The authoritative person said: In the draft  government work report, promoting the cause of reunifying the  motherland is treated as a special section, which touches on the  issues of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. On the Hong Kong issue,  it especially stresses that attention should be paid to doing a  good job of work in the transition period and the transfer of  power in 1997.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: Keller shows 29% advance to Pounds 8m Keller Group, the specialist engineering company which is coming to the market this month in a Pounds 70m flotation, last year lifted profits by 29 per cent. Strong order books and rising demand in Germany helped the underground foundations business, acquired from GKN three years ago in a Pounds 26m management buy-out, contribute to pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.96m (Pounds 6.2m) for the year to December 31. The outcome was enhanced by an exceptional pre-tax credit of Pounds 919,000 linked to an Iraqi contract, which had earlier been written off because of the Gulf war. Overseas subsidiaries, meanwhile, underpinned increased operating profits of Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 7.3m) and represented the bulk of total turnover of Pounds 147.8m (Pounds 131.9m). In the UK, benefits of a significant rationalisation pushed operating profits up from Pounds 291,000 to Pounds 492,000, but strong competition saw turnover fall 17 per cent to Pounds 24.1m. Faced with difficult trading conditions at home, the group said in its pathfinder prospectus that proceeds from the flotation would be used for further expansion overseas, where the group makes more than 80 per cent of its sales. The dominance of turnover and profits earned outside the UK has also persuaded the group to adopt foreign income dividends to pay shareholders. The FID scheme, set out in last November's budget, allows companies to pay dividends out of foreign income, which they must remit to the UK, and in effect avoid paying advance corporation tax on the dividend. Funds raised from the placing and intermediaries offer will also be used to repay debt, which rose sharply earlier this year with the Dollars 9m (Pounds 6.1m) acquisition of Case International, the Chicago-based foundation engineer.</p>

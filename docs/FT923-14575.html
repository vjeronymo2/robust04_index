			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Expansionist talk nudged off the agenda - Munich Notebook ALL THIS loose talk, inspired by President George Bush, over whether Russia should become an honorary member of an expanded G8 has officialdom worried. How do you say 'forget it' to the Russians in a way which will not upset President Boris Yeltsin, and correct the unscripted remarks of the US president without actually saying he got it wrong? The answer is to say it is all rather 'premature'. That is clearly the unanimous twist of the media manipulators in trying to kill a story which was never supposed to run. Mr Dieter Vogel, the wry German spokesman, said it was obvious 'from many reactions, not only in Germany, that this (G8) might be a bit premature. . . I have no doubt that at some point in the future Russia might be in a position to join the then G8. At present this is not the case.' That's clear enough. The obvious candidate to be number eight in the G8 has clearly emerged in Munich, however. It is the Free State of Bavaria. For this is not a German summit, it's a Bavarian one. For a start, six out of eight world leaders attending arrived at the royal Residenz in Munich in Bavarian cars - BMW and Audi. The only exceptions were Mr Bush, unreconstructed in a Cadillac, and for some reason President Francois Mitterrand, who appeared in a rather ancient Mercedes 600 (from neighbouring Baden-Wurttemberg). There are strange examples of Bavarian culture all round the Residenz to entertain hangers-on at the summit. So there are dancing men, dancing girls, organ grinders in straw hats, and the inevitable lederhosen-clad knee-slapping gentlemen doing something related to British Morris dancing. Some people seem still to think there are two groups - a G1 and a G6. At least that is the conclusion one might draw from the US information exercise, which takes place in glorious isolation in the Sheraton Hotel, a good 20 minutes from the summit headquarters and press centre. It means it is physically impossible for most correspondents to cover US briefings and those of its partners. Back in the Sheraton, the White House press corps is spoon-fed the national line, undiluted by any hint that the world is somewhat larger. A US information official tried to explain it by saying the US had been refused a briefing room in the palace. When it became obvious that this was untrue, she suggested it was because 'the White House press corps pays for it all'. So let's blame the press again. Meanwhile, down the road in the City Kino, something called Toes is taking place - The Other Economic Summit. It is largely an environmental counter-event, to remind world leaders of their commitments, or lack of, at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Delegates question the whole ethos of a G7 meeting, too, which seeks to set the economic agenda for the rest of the world. They seem to have picked up a surprising ally in Mr John Major, the British prime minister, who sought to brush up his environmental credentials with a letter to his colleagues reminding them of just what they promised to do. It appears to be one of those letters more important in the sending (or the reporting of it) than in the response, from a government with a pretty thin record on the environmental front. And finally to the question of costs. Given that this is an economic summit, an anxious German Finance Ministry insists that it is well within its budget  -some DM35m (Pounds 12m). A mischievous German newspaper (the Welt am Sonntag) calculated that meant DM8,000 a minute of summit time.</p>

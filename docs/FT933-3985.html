			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: ERM turmoil behind fall at Woodchester to IPounds 16.4m WOODCHESTER Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and banking group, which is 49 per cent owned by the Credit Lyonnais Group, has reported a 6.2 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to IPounds 16.4m (Pounds 15.3m) for the six months to June 30. The fall reflects the turmoil in the ERM early in the year, prior to the devaluation of the punt, which caused interest rates to soar and is estimated to have cost Woodchester about IPounds 2.5m, similar to the final quarter of 1992. Mr Craig McKinney, chairman and chief executive, said 'If it hadn't been for the ERM crisis profits would have been up on last year'. He explained that most of the group's lending is on fixed rates, with 90 per cent of the portfolio hedged against interest rate movements on the three-to-six month Dublin interbank market. When short-term rates soared, Woodchester therefore had to absorb the cost. The result includes a first-time contribution from CLLE, the European leasing arm of Credit Lyonnais, in which Woodchester took a 30 per cent stake in November 1992, and which boosted profits from associated companies by 140 per cent to IPounds 2.8m. Mr McKinney, said, however, that new business volumes and net interest income in CLLE's operations were below budget by 21 and 12 per cent respectively, 'due to the generally poor economic climate throughout Europe'. CLLE is a strategic area for Woodchester's future development plans, by building on its success in the UK and Irish small and middle-ticket leasing markets, to expand throughout Europe. Market analysts in Dublin expect CLLE's contribution to improve in 1994, and pointed to the continuing strength of Woodchester's car leasing business in both Ireland and the UK, where new business is up 5 per cant and 30 per cent respectively. In Ireland this has been achieved against a backdrop of a 6 per cent decline in car registrations. Earnings fell by 15 per cent to 6.37p (7.47p), reflecting both the fall in pre-tax profits and a 6 per cent increase in shares in issue since 1992. A 15 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 2.08p (1.81p) has been declared, which brokers said was indicative of Woodchester's confidence for the year. A full-year result of about IPounds 37m pre-tax and earnings of about 15.5p are being forecast.</p>

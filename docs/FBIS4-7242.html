			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 27 (YONHAP) -- The sudden homecoming  Tuesday of Han Tok-su, chairman of the pro-Pyongyang  organization Chochongnyon [General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan], has triggered speculation that Han was  forced to return to North Korea permanently because he rejected  orders to sell Chochongnyon's assets and send the proceeds to  the Kim Il-song regime, North Korea watchers say.    The 87-year-old Han, who has controlled Chochongnyon for the  past 39 years, was reluctant to go to Pyongyang because he  thought he might not be able to return to Japan after meeting  North Korean leader Kim Il-song and his son and heir-apparent,  Chong-il, Chochongnyon insiders say.    The homecoming was related to North Korea's intentions to  change the leadership of Chochongnyon, making it easier to  collect money from the pro-Pyongyang organization in Japan, the  insiders say.    Han reportedly failed to comply with the North's request  that  Chochongnyon sell its assets in Japan for remittance to  Pyongyang, insisting the assets were obtained by the  organization itself.    To facilitate the transfer of proceeds from selling the  group's assets, Pyongyang tried to dispatch former Chochongnyon  Vice Chairman Kim Pyong-sik to Tokyo but was thwarted by  Chochongnyon leaders, according to the insiders.    Kim was named vice president of the North Korean Government  last December, 22 years after disappearing from public view.    Pyongyang has repeatedly asked Han to return since last year  and even sent Han's eldest son, U-chol, as a special envoy to  persuade him early this year, the insiders say.    According to the SANKEI SHIMBUN, Japanese security  authorities see Han's return to Pyongyang as a prelude to  measures facilitating money transfers to Pyongyang from Tokyo if  international sanctions are imposed on North Korea for its  suspected nuclear weapons program.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yinchuan, April 9 (XINHUA) -- The remote Ningxia Hui  Autonomous Region in Northwest China has kept up its tradition  of caring for the environment and made great achievements in  controlling industrial pollution in cities and preserving the  good ecological environment.    Located in the arid and semi-arid area, Ningxia has a  population of 4.9 million, one third being of the Hui  nationality.    The Hui people are well known for personal hygiene and like  to grow flowers, lawns and trees.    "It is their good habit and tradition that have made it easy  for the regional government to push through its environment  protection measures," said Sun Ningzhang, director of the  Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regional Environment Protection Agency.    Sun noted that the rapid economic development has inevitably  caused pollution. To control it, the regional government has  worked out a package of rules and regulations while building a  number of pollution prevention and control facilities.    All these have got enthusiastic support from the local  people.    A survey shows that the regional capacity of treating waste  water has doubled, and that of treating waste gas increased by  45 percent.    So far the region has transformed 267,000 hectares of sandy  land and 8,390 square kilometers of areas suffering from soil  erosion.    In addition, the region has planted trees on 267,000  hectares  of hilly areas and set up some nature reserves of animals and  plants.</p>

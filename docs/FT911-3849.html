			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Ratners Judging by the reaction to yesterday's figures, investors think Ratners has turned some kind of corner. The shares have underperformed the market by a third in a year and by a half over three years, so a change was overdue. Last year's small rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 112m was a reasonable performance, especially when measured against other retailers. But there was no hiding the dilutive effect of the undigested Kay Jewelers acquisition in the US. Worryingly, too, costs in the UK rose much faster than sales. Ratners is trying to persuade investors that it has grown up. Out has gone the image of the mindless pursuit of sales. In its place is a sober management culture in which costs must be contained to protect the bottom line from the effects of flattening turnover. It all looks appropriate, comes perhaps six months late and is arguably inevitable at such a low point in the economic cycle. In the medium term, Ratners will push ahead with the integration of Kay in the US and try to grow organically towards 50 per cent market share in the UK. Less expansionist shareholders might prefer to see the company exploiting its UK leadership by forcing immediate price increases on a sector where volume growth has tailed off. On forecast profits of Pounds 125m, the shares at 177p are on a prospective p/e of nine, backed by a solid yield of 8 per cent. If Ratners can prove that it has cracked the US market, its shares will doubtless more than make up lost ground. The rating seems fair until then.</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMENIAN AID  </P> <P> It was gratifying to read the two reports on after-earthquake activities in  Armenia -- the comprehensive roundup by Michael Parks, "Armenia Aid Gets Back  to the Basics," and "L.A.'s Armenia Quake Relief Stuck in Pipeline," by Esther  Schrader (Part I, July 23). The problems and setback alluded to in both pieces  continue to be covered at length in the Armenian-American press. I am grateful  to see that your coverage will make them widely known and that credit is  acknowledged to all the countries throughout the world that have rushed to  Armenia's aid in her desperate hours of need.  </P> <P> It is to be hoped that the logistic problems which seem to be inherent in any  organizational structure are now being overcome and that the massive attempts  for much-needed assistance are bearing fruitful results. Certainly, despite  dissension among some of the leadership, it is obvious that the heartfelt  dedication will prevail.  </P> <P> Many Armenian-Americans have made several trips since Dec. 7, 1988, among them  Dr. Armen Goenjian, a Long Beach psychiatrist, who has led a group of mental  health specialists. Incidentally, the tug of the Armenian heritage is so strong  that it affects and puts into action those of Armenian background who don't  necessarily have "some connection to someone affected by the tragedy," as  Schrader states. It is the least we can do and want to do in the name of  humanity.  </P> <P> SHERRY TERZIAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Losses deepen at Groupe Bull GROUPE Bull, the troubled French computer manufacturer, suffered a fall in sales and a rise in losses in the first half of 1992, the company said yesterday. The state-owned company reported net losses of FFr1.98bn (Dollars 341m) on sales of FFr12.5bn for the first six months of 1993, compared with losses of FFr1.69bn and sales of FFr13.8bn in the same period last year. The company, which is negotiating a restructuring plan with the French government, has accumulated losses of over FFr15bn in the past 3 1/2 years. Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, has said that the state cannot continue to subsidise losses on this scale and has come under pressure from the EC to reduce its financial support for the group. Bull said that its first-half results reflected 'persistently unfavourable economic conditions' and an 'acceleration of general price pressures in the computer market'. Zenith Data Systems, its personal computer division which is the single biggest source of the group's losses, suffered a continued fall in profit margins. The company said that this fall in margins more than offset a rise in sales of PCs by ZDS. Bull said it planned to return to profit in 1995. To achieve this it announced measures to reduce costs and form alliances with other international computer manufacturers. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to reduce its workforce by 6,500 people, about 18 per cent of the total, by the end of 1994. Last month, the company formed a PC design and manufacturing alliance with Packard Bell.</p>

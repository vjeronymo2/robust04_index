			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: European prices hit by French rate rises A heavy calendar of supply weighed on European government bonds yesterday amid concern that the markets would have difficulty in absorbing the large amounts on offer. Bond prices were dealt a further blow late in the day when leading French commercial banks said they planned to raise their base rates by 25 basis points to 7.95 per cent from tomorrow. French 10-year government bonds fell around a half-point on the news. Analysts interpreted the banks' action, which was independent of the Bank of France and designed to counter their own rising cost of funding, as a further confirmation that European interest rates are heading upwards. They added, however, that the banks obviously felt that demand from the private sector was sufficiently robust to cope with higher interest rates. Investors were also sidelined ahead of the Bundesbank meeting tomorrow and the US employment report on Friday. Some analysts expect the German central bank to return to a variable rate repo, but the market does not expect a change in official interest rates. Mr Kit Juckes at S. G. Warburg said the Bundesbank had to show that it could manage the trough in interest rates better than the central banks in Italy and Sweden, which stunned the markets with the timing of their rate rises recently. 'Inflation is in a trough, the economy is recovering so the Bundesbank can only make cosmetic adjustments,' Mr Juckes said. On Liffe, the September bund future was barely changed in the late afternoon, down 0.04 points at 92.00. UK gilts had a disappointing day, given their potential to outperform in the near term. On Liffe, the September long gilt future fell  5/8 to 101 3/4 . Dealers said the weakness reflected professional selling following the narrowing of the yield spread between 10-year gilts and bunds to less than 150 basis points late last week. There is some debate on whether the spread can narrow further. Salomon Brothers believes the spread will drop to 125 basis points by year-end, but Hoare Govett says such a tightening will require further gains from sterling. US Treasury bonds were finishing moderately higher yesterday afternoon after a quiet session highlighted by mixed economic news. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year bond was  13/32 better at 100 7/16 , with the yield slipping to 7.457 per cent, and the two-year note was up 1/16 at 100 5/32 , yielding 6.149 per cent. Activity remained lacklustre as traders awaited guidance on the direction on the economy. Yesterday brought good news and bad. On the negative side, the Commerce Department reported an 8.3 per cent increase in July sales of new homes, higher than expected. But traders chose to focus on the Conference Board's consumer confidence index coming in well under forecast. The data suggested a slowdown in consumer spending in the first half, a favourable development for inflation-sensitive bonds.</p>

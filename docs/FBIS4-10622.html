			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential </F> candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, following  President Guillermo Endara's message to the nation, at the  Riande Continental Hotel in Panama City--live relay]    [Text] [Crowd chants: "Toro, Toro, Toro"] Thank you.    Fellow countrymen: Please excuse my voice. I was in Pacora  and had scheduled a news conference because I thought the  president of the Republic was going to make an announcement that  would be very important for the nation.    I will confess, quite honestly, that I feel truly  embarrassed. It embarrasses me to see a man go back on his word,  especially when that man represents the majesty of the homeland,  a man who, before the diplomatic corps and the whole nation,  signed this document which he now seems to have forgotten. It  is a document which, among other things, states--Mr. President,  please allow me to remind you of it--: We cannot use our  authority and influence to serve the interests of those who are  running for office. The president did not keep his word. The  president has involved himself in party politics. I would like  to say this does not mean we will change the tone of our  national proposal. [applause]    Under no circumstances will we be provoked by this  despicable  intervention in party politics by the head of the Panamanian  state. I now call on my supporters, friends, and fellow party  members to remain calm and maintain peace following this brief  period of instability that Mr. Endara's words have created.    I would like to reiterate what I have said in the past: No  one, and at no time, can think of returning to those days of  improvised presidents, economic sanctions, and of suffering for  all Panamanians. [applause]    We want to begin the 21st century with a new concept of  homeland, with a united Panama, with our political differences  discussed as the democratic nations do, without intervention  from governments, with our own autonomy, our proposals for  solutions to the country's problems.    Fellow countrymen, after we win on 8 May we will celebrate,  without revenge, and without looking back to the past, not even  to this day. We will introduce what must be a government of  reconciliation for which most Panamanians are hoping. [applause]    In conclusion, I hope this will be an isolated incident,  that  we will maintain the dignity of the office the Panamanian people  gave us. Mr. President Endara, do not shame the people again  by not keeping your word. [applause] [crowd chants: "Toro,  Toro, Toro"]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi by Nidal </F> Mansur; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Mansur] Is the Muslim  Brotherhood involved in terrorist activities?    [Al-Alfi] Charges have been brought against some of them and  are being investigated.    [Mansur] Arab and Western intelligence services are said to  have helped Egypt contain what you call fundamentalist and  terror movements. Can you confirm this?    [Al-Alfi] There are no intelligence services working  alongside us. However, we coordinate and cooperate through the  international police or the Egyptian Foreign Ministry with some  countries insofar as those who are wanted and those sentenced in  their absence are concerned. [passage omitted]    [Mansur] The Muslim Brotherhood are excluded from the  mainstream of national dialogue. Don't you think that,  considering the group makes up quite a segment of the community,  this detracts from the value of the dialogue?    [Al-Alfi] You say Muslim Brotherhood; are we a blasphemous  brotherhood?    [Mansur] We are talking about a party with a political  ideology.    [Al-Alfi] I am absolutely against the labels Muslim and  non-Muslim; Egypt is an Islamic state where the sharia is the  prime source for legislation. Do you regard millions as  non-Muslim and restrict the adjective to those? This is  unacceptable.    [Mansur] We are talking about a political party.    [Al-Alfi] These are not a party. The party is an  organization described by the Constitution and law. If they  want to be regarded as such, why not join the political party  fold. We can engage in dialogue only legal and legitimate  parties.    More to the point, it is wrong to found a political party on  religious grounds, since all religions will then demand that  they have their own parties.    [Mansur] You referred to Arab and Islamic repercussions on  Islamic Egyptian groups. Have you documented proof to support  your contention that terrorism in Egypt receives backing from  Arab regimes or Arab Islamic groups?    [Al-Alfi] The matter is under investigation by the state  prosecution. It does not serve our interests to name  governments. However, obviously there are foreign hands  involved.    [Mansur] You have hinted at the involvement of Sudan and  Islamic groups in Algeria, but you ignored the role of certain  Gulf states and Usamah Bin-Ladin, for example?    [Al-Alfi] I do not want to name names. The investigations  are ongoing. It serves no one's interests for me to disclose  our line of investigation. All facts will come to light when  all the defendants stand trial in public.    [Mansur] How are the interests of the nations that you do  not want to name served by such an involvement?    [Al-Alfi] We are the target of a ferocious onslaught waged  not only by the misguided but also by vested interests who have  joined forces with the former. They want to hurt Egypt as a  superior economic force. By thus hurting Egypt they would  intimidate the other Arab states. In any case, they will not  succeed; the Egyptian people will spurn misleading ideas.  [passage omitted]    [Mansur] The Islamists in Egypt maintain links with Afghan  Islamists, who, in their turn, had links with the United  Staters. Do you see American involvement there aiming to drag  Egypt into sectarian conflicts so as to weaken your country?    [Al-Alfi] The United States supported Afghanistan not by  virtue of the fact that it is an Islamic state, but did that  within the context of an anti-communist effort. That support  has now served its purpose. Let me here warn about what is  happening in Bosnia and Herzegovina lest it be used to promote  the same end.    [Mansur] Do you think Western powers, including the United  States, have a stake in instability in Egypt?    [Al-Alfi] I will not name names. But there are those with  an interest in a weakened Egypt on account of its strategic  location, standing, and role. The aim also is to strike at  tourism and lead the young section of Egyptian society into  thinking tourism is a bad thing an anti-religious. Indeed,  there are those who want to hurt us in any way possible and are  using Islamists to advance that end.</p>

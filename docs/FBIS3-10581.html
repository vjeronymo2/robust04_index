Employees were forced to leave the Legislative Palace  by a group of armed men who did not hesitate to beat them to  compel them to leave the premises. The following is a report by  Jean Luckenson.    [Begin Luckenson recording, in Creole] There was much  tension  at the office of the Senate of the Republic on Tuesday, 8  February [date as heard]. Both high level employees as well as  lower-level ones were obliged to clear out, to run away because  of threats by 18 January Senator Osny Eugene, the quaestor of  the unofficial Senate office who was very angry and took off his  jacket so he could drive employees out. He was accompanied by  policemen and armed civilians who were jostling employees and  who even used their weapons to hit the employees. An employee,  who told us what was going on, said that the employees have  nothing to do with the running battle within the Senate of the  Republic. So, they will not budge an inch, they will wait for  Senate President Firmin Jean-Louis. We must tell you that even  the secretary general of the Senate shared the fate of the  employees. [passage omitted]    Sen. Osny Eugene, quaestor of the unofficial office,  asserted that he had sent a press release to the radio stations  asking employees to stay home. This is why he drove employees  out on the morning of 8 March. The controversial 18 January  senator went on to say there must be a meeting of the 26  senators so they can reach a compromise. [passage omitted]    For his part, Sen. Bernard Sansaricq described what happened  at the Senate office on 8 March -- when Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis,  legitimate president of the Senate of the Republic, came back to  his office -- as an impertinence. The president of the  unofficial office stated that the situation (?is back to  normal), that he will sit normally, that he has a mild  temperament, but that he can become extremely violent, and that  this is what explained his silence on 8 March. [passage omitted]    Until 1500 this afternoon, we noted the presence of the  senators of the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion, the  controversial 18 January senators, but no National Front for  Change and Democracy Parliamentary Bloc senators were present.  So, sessions could not be held by the legitimate office led by  Firmin Jean-Louis. We must tell you that many arrests were made  by armed civilians who injured a young man with a gun before  taking him away. Members of the press who were on the scene  received threats from armed civilians who prevented them from  coming near the scene to see the disturbances and mayhem.  Jean-Luckenson for Signal FM.

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Tories dismiss prediction on single currency Sir Leon Brittan, European Union commissioner, yesterday predicted that the the EU would back a single European currency and warned that the issue would not go away. His comments were immediately contradicted by Conservative Central Office and Sir Christopher Prout, leader of the Conservative MEPs. Mr John Major's advisers were irritated by the intervention of Sir Leon, the former Conservative trade and industry secretary, in the middle of the European elections. The prime minister said last week he did not believe that a single currency would come in his lifetime. In an interview with BBC radio, Sir Leon, external economic affairs commissioner, said: 'Where people in Britain would make a great mistake is if they think that it (a single currency) is not going to happen. 'It is going to happen and since the collapse of the exchange rate mechanism in its old form, the fact is that most of the countries of continental Europe are keener than ever to go ahead with a single currency.' Sir Christopher dismissed Sir Leon's predictions, saying the moment for a single currency had come and gone. He made clear that while the government was not opposed to the principle of a single currency it was up to the British parliament to decide if it wanted one. However, he added: 'There would be difficulty in getting one through parliament because of the deep-seated opposition to it in the country.' The Liberal Democrats accused the Tories of being split over the issue, pointing out that many Conservative MEPs had voted in favour of federalism in the European parliament. Sir Christopher pointed out that the Single European Act 1986 had legalised 'super-nationalism' and therefore there was nothing odd that all MEPs had voted at some stage in favour of federalism 'of one sort or the other'. Sir Leon said the fact that the rest of the EU was moving towards a single currency did not mean that Britain had to follow suit. 'But it is important that we do not think it is going to go away and not happen.' He denied that there was a need for concern because Britain had the option of a single currency but not the obligation. 'Britain can decide when it wants whether to join or not join. This is a genuinely free choice,' he said. Sir Leon said he was in favour of joining, although this was not a decision that had to be taken now. The Conservatives yesterday published a document detailing the support of Labour MEPs for 'leftwing causes'. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said: 'Socialists in Europe are a threat to British interests, to free enterprise and to jobs in Britain.' No sympathy, Page 12</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / International Company News: Philippine government takes control of airline PHILIPPINE Airlines is back under government control, just over a year after it was auctioned in the country's biggest privatisation. Mr Gabriel Singson, president of the state-run Philippine National Bank, has been elected chairman and president of PR Holdings, a consortium of private and government-owned groups that acquired 67 per cent of PAL in January 1992. He replaces Mr Antonio Cojuangco, who is also president of Philippine Long Distance Telephone. Meanwhile, at PAL, Mr Cojuangco is to step down today as chairman and president in favour of Mr Carlos Dominguez, a former banker and agriculture secretary. The appointment of two government nominees to the top positions at PR Holdings and PAL results from a compromise reached between two rival groups of businessmen that have fought for control of the two companies over the past couple of months. One group is lead by Mr Lucio Tan, a Chinese-Filipino businessman with cigarette and banking interests who holds 40 per cent of PR Holdings. The other group is led by Mr Cojuangco who with his allies also holds 40 per cent. A dispute arose over whether to purchase Dollars 1.2bn of new aircraft. The row became increasingly bitter until Mr Fidel Ramos, the Philippine president, intervened early last month and asked Mr Singson to work out a scheme acceptable to the two groups. The compromise came after Mr Andres Soriano, an ally of Mr Cojuangco, sold his stake in PR Holdings to International Container Terminal Services which then sided with Mr Tan. It is not clear whether the changes represent a victory for Mr Tan. At today's PAL board meeting to formalise the new management team, an announcement is also expected that the airline will continue to pursue the controversial aircraft acquisition plan.</p>

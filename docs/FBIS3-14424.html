The IDF officers said it was the irresponsibility  and lack of discipline shown by the SLA officers who, on their  own initiative, shelled al-Nabatiyah and the outskirts of Sidon,  which led to the firing of Katyusha rockets at the Galilee this  week. Four Lebanese citizens were killed and 30 were wounded in  the shelling, most of them schoolchildren from al-Nabatiyah.    Our correspondent in the north Yo'av Aviv reports that last  night, the terrorists sneaked out of the SLA outpost they had  seized in the Jazzin enclave. The body of a missing SLA soldier  was later found at the scene. South Lebanon was quiet last  night.</p>

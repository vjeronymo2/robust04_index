			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Postal staff vote on shifts offer STRIKING POSTAL workers in Cardiff will vote today on whether to end the dispute that has disrupted mail in the Welsh capital for two weeks. Officials of the UCW communication union yesterday told a meeting of the 900 postal workers of a framework agreement on shift patterns that was negotiated last week between the union and Royal Mail. But the ballot on calling off the strike was postponed until today. The ballot will carry a recommendation from both national and branch officials to accept the agreement. Mr Steve Bell, Cardiff branch secretary of the UCW, said after yesterday's meeting: 'Branch officers believe that the agreement represents a substantial concession - a victory for the workforce. However, the workforce will make the final decision itself. 'Whatever the decision is, we have demonstrated that attempts by an unaccountable management to impose antisocial working patterns upon the Cardiff workforce have been defeated.' Royal Mail welcomed the ballot and hoped that the outcome would be favourable. It said that if there was a return to work today, it would take about a week to clear the backlog of 1m items of mail.</p>

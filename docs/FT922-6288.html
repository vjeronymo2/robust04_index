			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Survey of Tohoku Region of Japan (6): A home for research institutes - Interview, Toru Ishii, mayor of Sendai MR TORU Ishii, Mayor of Sendai, came to office eight years ago, just after the high-speed Shinkansen train was built, connecting Sendai to Tokyo. The line opened the way for rapid growth of the city. Mr Ishii, a native of Hokkaido, came to Sendai after a career in the ministry of home affairs. As a graduate of Tokyo University law school, he is part of an elite that has played a crucial role in the reconstruction of Japan. The following are excepts from Steven Butler's interview with Mr Ishii. Q: Sendai has made big efforts to attract high-technology investments to the region. How successful do you think it is? A: The industrial complex focusing on high-technology industry is located in the very north of Sendai city, Izumi-ku. There, such companies as Tohoku Semiconductor and another five or six companies are operating. However, as the land price within the Sendai city is comparatively high, the surrounding area of the city has become a focus for industry. In future, this kind of investment is expected in the suburbs of Sendai City, rather than in the centre of the city. Related to this is a Tohoku Intelligent Cosmos idea, which is backed by the national universities of Tohoku region, together with private companies and local government bodies. We are trying to establish research institutes for development of new industrial technology. In Sendai, we already have five institutes. We are making efforts to establish new institutes or to invite national institutes from other region to Sendai. And in future we would like to invite institutes and personnel from overseas also. Through the promotion of activities by such institutes, we can expect the relocation to Tohoku of various industries from new fields. Q: How long do you think you may have to wait for commercial results? A: Perhaps we will have to wait 10 or 20 years. Q: What do you think are Sendai's main attractions for investors? A: Primarily, there is comparatively abundant technological know-how at Tohoku University and elsewhere. We have a number of educational facilities and universities here. As a result, we have technical specialists and human resources. In addition, transportation is becoming more convenient. We are expanding Sendai port and airport. The runway of Sendai airport will be extended to 2,500 metres within this year, and to 3,000m within the next five years. As for the Sendai port, we have started the operations to construct an offshore pier at the existing port, so that we can accept overseas ships. Now, both the Shinkansen (express train) and Tohoku Expressway extend to the region. We are constructing another expressway along the seashore. Thus, the transportation infrastructure is being developed gradually. So I think the possibility of advanced technology industry moving into the region is very high. We do not necessarily expect new industries to establish factories in Sendai, but in the whole Tohoku region. Then, for sure, Sendai wil come to play a central role. Q: What accounts for the recent industrial growth in Sendai? A: Development of the existing industrial area of Japan, located in Tokyo and to the west, has almost come to an end, and the region is excessively crowded. So the conditions for the establishment of new factories are not very good. Compared with this, Tohoku region is more advantageous from the viewpoint of land availability, land price and labour supply. Until recent years, transportation was a key constraint on the development. However, with the gradual development of the basic infrastructure, such as the Shinkansen, expressway networks, airport and ports, there appears more possibility for companies to establish factories in the region. (But) we do not want what happened in Tokyo and Osaka to happen in Sendai or the Tohoku region. What we aim is to have more space and comfort. In a local city like Sendai, we do not expect new factories within the city except where we established an industrial complex many years ago. We want the new industries to be located in the whole Tohoku region in a well-balanced way. In Sendai, we want to develop the infrastructure in order to attract research institutes or universities rather than to attract factories. Of course, we are not placing restrictions on factories, but factories can be established in places where conditions are far better. Q: Is Sendai likely to become a second capital in Japan? A: I think the sole concentration of capital functions in Tokyo must be changed. If we could disperse various functions of Tokyo to local places it would be welcomed. Sendai is a candidate as a second capital, or rather as a city to receive part of Tokyo's capital function. However, I don't want Sendai to be a city like Tokyo. It is quite unrealistic and difficult to discuss (moving) the diet or the government to other local cities. But ideas to move schools out of Tokyo or to transfer research institutes and factories are much more realistic. Q: What are the biggest issues facing Sendai? A: One is the establishment of a comprehensive transportation system. That is the primary thing. Three years ago, Sendai completed its subway network, which goes from north to south of the city, and now we are planning to have a subway network from east to west. The second thing is the (plan) to construct five orbital roads. In most of the cities of Japan, roads usually radiate from the centre of the city. As a result, it leads to the concentration of people and functions in the centre of the city. In connection with the orbital roads, we are planning sub-cities in four different directions, where orbital roads and radiated roads meet. One of the examples is the new business centre in Izumi-ku, north of Sendai, from where the subway will start operation very soon. As the population of Sendai is growing rapidly, we are putting emphasis on the establishment of cultural facilities. We are discussing whether to construct an art museum, and are researching whether to establish a large concert hall. There is a general museum and a new science museum for children, and cultural centres for youth already. I think the numbers of libraries are not enough, so we are planning to have one library for each ward. We are also making efforts to establish sports facilities and are promoting a plan to construct a domed stadium so people can enjoy sports in rain or snow.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Joint news conference by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and </F> Russian President Boris Yeltsin with unidentified foreign and  domestic correspondents in Bonn and short statement by German  Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt; Yeltsin speaks in Russian  with superimposed German translation -- live; broadcast in  progress]    [Text] [Kohl] ...Another key subject in our talks -- they  will of course be continued tomorrow -- is the subject of  security and stability in Europe. I have once again discussed  with President Yeltsin the goals of the NATO partners as  expressed at the NATO summit in January this year. We Germans  are interested in Russia supporting and participating in the  proposed NATO Partnership for Peace program.    We also discussed the most acute threat to European security  and stability, namely the conflict in former Yugoslavia. We  both agreed -- this also applies to the talks held on this  matter by our two foreign ministers in particular -- that after  the most recent escalation, a solution to the conflict in Bosnia  is particularly urgent. Our two countries and the ministers  responsible are playing an active part in the so-called contact  group consisting of representatives of the United Nations, the  European Union [EU], Russia, the United States, and France,  Great Britain, and Germany. The goal of these joint efforts is  to achieve a comprehensive cease-fire in Bosnia as soon as  possible, and to work resolutely toward enabling the parties to  the conflict to achieve a peace plan.    The day after tomorrow, a meeting will take place between  the  five foreign ministers from the contact group. I hope that this  discussion too, will lead further in this direction.    Ladies and gentlemen, in bilateral terms German-Russian  relations are free of the strains and problems we have  unfortunately known so often in the past. We have discussed a  number of matters of particular common interest. These covered,  among other things, the establishment of a joint historical  commission for research into recent German-Soviet,  German-Russian history. Both President Yeltsin and myself are  most interested in this, and will bring our influence to bear  here to ensure that this commission begins its activities very  soon -- and we have agreed that very soon means by the end of  June.    We also discussed the repatriation of cultural artifacts  removed during circumstances of war. You are aware of the legal  basis for this enshrined in the German-Russian cultural  agreement. We have received a report from the first session,  which took place recently. One or two matters have still to be  clarified. Again, both of us are very keen to see this work  make very swift progress. We also agreed that the next meeting  -- which I expect to produce quite concrete results -- will take  place by mid-June, that is four weeks from now. Then, ladies  and gentlemen, we talked about a subject that is currently  coming in for a great deal of discussion -- here in Germany and  also in Russia -- that is, the farewell ceremony for the Russian  soldiers leaving Germany. President Yeltsin and I will jointly  conduct this farewell ceremony on 31 August. I attach  particular importance to the farewell for the Russian soldiers  in Germany taking place in a worthy, respectful manner, and in a  spirit of friendship. We have agreed that the whole event will  take place in Berlin. In that context we agreed that we intend  to see to the details personally, to do justice to the aims I  explained before.    I would like to add a second matter, which resulted in  misunderstandings that I in some respects found  incomprehensible. I will now examine why. You are aware that  in the original proposal, I presented the idea that we should  meet in Weimar on that day. The underlying idea was and is that  in addition to the farewell to the soldiers -- who were at the  head of the military and martial part of our history -- we  should express appreciation for the long, common cultural  experience of our nations, and not least go to Weimar, where the  cradle of modern democracy in Germany -- the adoption of the  first democratic Reich constitution [Weimar Constitution of 11  August 1919] -- took place.    Since this idea met with incomprehension, and since I would  like to avoid further misunderstandings here, we both agreed  today that at a later date -- but not postponed until an  indefinite time -- at a foreseeable time, we will meet in Weimar  and take the opportunity to invite men and women who have played  a major part in the cultural life of our nations to a joint  event, to bring to life and make clear for everyone the great  common cultural traditions of our nations.    I pointed out again earlier in our talks that we share a  lengthy common chapter in a great common culture, be it in  philosophy, painting, or music, and not least literature and  poetry and much else besides. It is our joint desire -- and I  am very grateful to President Yeltsin that he thinks as I do --  it is our joint desire that this great, respectful tradition in  the two countries will become evident here.    Of course, bilateral economic relations have also played a  great role in this connection. I want to express my desire once  again to German industry that we hope that as many German  companies as possible will invest in Russia. President Yeltsin  will take the opportunity to talk to major German business  representatives about this subject during his visit to Stuttgart  on Friday [13 May], above all about the conditions -- which are  repeatedly discussed in Germany -- for foreign investors so that  these conditions also improve in Russia.    We also discussed the relations that have evolved between  eastern German enterprises and Russian partner enterprises.  These contacts have been very much to our disadvantage [word  indistinct] due to the problems of adapting over the last few  years. This was discussed, also successfully -- my colleague  [Economics Minister] Rexrodt will announce some details of this  afterward in the discussion.    In a word, ladies and gentlemen, it is only the first stage  of the visit, but this is an opportunity to open a new chapter  in the history of our nations, continually improving  German-Russian relations. Russia is, from the German point of  view, our most important neighbor. In the ups and downs of  history we have shared many experiences and did each other a  great deal of harm. I think it is now very important not to  forget history, to try and learn from it, both now and in the  future -- the future means the 21st century in six years -- to  set the right signals for the coming generations of our nations.  Mr. President, may I ask you to take the floor?    [Yeltsin] Federal Chancellor, Ladies and Gentlemen: The  first few hours of my stay on the hospitable soil of Germany  have been very intense. I am pleased with the results of the  talks that took place today with President Richard von  Weizsaecker and with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The talks  with Herr Kohl were conducted in an open and friendly  atmosphere, and this has already become a good tradition with  him, and this reflects the special character that has marked the  relations between our two states in recent years. The results  of the talks have demonstrated the unity of our views and of  German-Russian relations. With the federal chancellor, we  agreed that in recent years we have come a long way toward each  other. We have succeeded in overcoming the overwhelming  majority of the problems that have burdened us since the war.    The agreements (?reached at our previous meetings) are  working, and in particular after my official visit two years  ago. Already 38 large joint projects are being realized.    Federal Chancellor Kohl and I discussed at length the  conclusion in August this year of the stay of Russian troops in  Germany. We agreed that the Russian troops should be sent off  in a dignified fashion and to give this event a ceremonial  character, in Berlin, and this farewell should be a symbol of  the end of a certain stage of history and the entry of our two  states and Europe as a whole into a new era of relations and a  new era of reconciliation. Also, this will be a prologue to  what will take place on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of  the end of World War II.    At the same time Russia and Germany have declared themselves  in favor of this anniversary being given a common impulse, and  so we are proposing that in the political declaration that is  planned for December 1994 for the meeting of the heads of state  of the CSCE states in Budapest, some special statements should  be adopted dedicated to the end of World War II 50 years ago.  These sentences should reflect the principles of the world  order and the relations with which the participating states of  the CSCE approach the third millenium.    We also touched on the problems of human rights and  democracy. Life has brought us in different ways to these  objectives. Russia now also finds itself on the road to  upholding democratization. This process cannot be described as  painless. On this road various speeds can be (?adopted),  various ways of progressing, and various methods of  democratization appropriate to the state of society.    But there is no turning back, nor will there be. We are  not giving up on progress, nor will we do so. This is  demonstrated by the development of events following the  Russians' vote for the new constitution and the parliamentary  elections. The recent signing by Russia's leading political  forces -- which number several hundred -- of a Treaty on Public  Accord reiterated that the majority of Russians continue to  support the implementation of peaceful transformations and  political changes in society.    Economic cooperation between our two countries likewise  featured prominently in our talks today. Germany remains  Russia's largest trading partner. Given the problems currently  facing Russia in the period of restructuring, it is virtually  impossible to avoid certain shortcomings. There are temporary  difficulties, but I am sure that we will be capable of  surmounting these difficulties. We agreed to devote the  greatest attention to such fields of cooperation as energy,  conversion of the defense industry, mechanical engineering, and  support for small and medium-sized businesses, especially on the  operational side. We also proposed using such effective  mechanisms for economic relations as interest-free commercial  credit or the swing, to use its other name. Our discussions of  economic problems and the problems of economic relations will  continue tomorrow.    Our exchange of views on international issues was very  intensive. The new nature of German-Soviet [as heard] relations  and the atmosphere of trust that marks my present contacts with  Chancellor Kohl dictate our countries' actions on international  issues. Now that we have embarked on the path of democratic  development, Russia wants to develop side by side with the whole  democratic world. The maintenance of peace and security in the  face of new global problems demands comprehensive development of  the processes of integration. Russia does not view itself as  standing aside from these processes, and this explains our  desire to take part in all international involvements, in the  G-7 industrial countries, and in cooperation in the NATO  Partnership for Peace program, taking account of Russia's  importance.    The federal chancellor reiterated Germany's previously  expressed view that it is necessary for Russia to play a weighty  part -- and he spoke about Russia joining the G-7 -- about  cooperation between Russia and the EU, and about Russia's  involvement from the outset in the new post-Cocom [Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] export regime. I  expressed our continued support for Germany at the United  Nations. Russia regards Germany as a worthy candidate for  permanent membership of the UN Security Council when such a  decision is made. We agree that it is necessary to strengthen  the NPT [nuclear nonproliferation treaty]: This treaty must be  made unlimited in duration, and a situation must be created that  will make it possible to conclude an agreement on a universal  test ban throughout the whole world.    Finally, we also discussed in detail with Chancellor Kohl  the  question of the development of the situation in Bosnia and  agreed that we will do everything to bring this war in Bosnia to  an end, so that the settling of the problems of former  Yugoslavia can be achieved. In this direction also, we must  work more closely and on the basis of the resolutions of the  United Nations and the CSCE. Thank you for your attention, and I  am ready to answer your questions.    [German Economics Minister Rexrodt] Mr. President, ladies  and  gentlemen. My colleague Aleksandr Shokhin and I have held  talks, among other things about the order for the DWA plane in  Annendorf. As you know, without Russian orders this plant would  not, for the foreseeable future, be used to full capacity.    After thorough preparation, in which retired State Secretary  Koehler was involved, but also Mr. Shokhin and myself, we have  today agreed that for 1994 the Russian side will place an order  worth 500 million marks [DM] for passenger trains with  Halle-Annendorf. We will again be making an exception and  guaranteeing this order with special conditions.    For 1995 there will be other orders, but on a smaller scale,  and the whole thing will be replaced -- and here German and  Russian interests meet -- by comprehensive cooperation in the  field of the manufacture of passenger trains. This means that  the DWA, but quite possibly other firms as well, will work  closely in Russia on the extension and the setting up of Russian  passenger train construction plants. This close cooperation  will incidentally extend to other economic fields, in particular  in the area of high technology.    I am very pleased that with this we are able to give a very  positive signal to the new laender -- for Saxony-Anhalt, for  Halle, and for the passenger train makers in Halle-Annendorf.  Thank you.    [Yeltsin] We have agreed on DM500 million for 1994, and the  Russian Government will make a decision to this effect. Second,  for 1995, the task has been assigned to draw up a separate  agreement between the two sides and to lay down precisely the  scope of this order.    [Interfax correspondent] Boris Nikolayevich, I would like to  ask you the following question. After everything you have said  here about your talks with the chancellor, to what extent has  Europe come closer to a lasting and just peace? This question  is above all asking about a just peace, since that is  particularly important for Russia.    [Yeltsin] Of course, you understand very well that the  securing of a comprehensive peace and comprehensive security in  Europe does not depend on bilateral agreements alone. But the  fact that two very important states are in agreement, one of 150  million people, the other of 80 million -- Germany is the second  largest country in Europe after Russia -- this suggests that we  will also find it easier in relations with other states with  regard to a unified security system in Europe.    [Correspondent] Chancellor Kohl, you have both already  touched on the role and the goals of NATO. Did you also discuss  the question of whether a special relationship with NATO could  be found for Russia -- that is, a system of relations that could  go beyond the Partnership for Peace? Thank you.    [Yeltsin] You are absolutely right. You have formulated the  question very precisely. Of course, we cannot simply sign the  document on Partnership for Peace -- which we basically agree  with --and sign it without a special protocol with NATO. That  means there will have to be a further document with NATO, in  which a number of concrete questions on Russia's special  features are laid down. Special features in the sense that, for  example, an army of 3 million men is there, with the attendant  technical equipment, and that, for example, there is equipment  there that does not match NATO's unified standards.    There is a whole series of questions, but we are already  starting this May to lay down work on this protocol together  with NATO. After the protocol with NATO has been signed -- and  I don't think there will be any major insoluble questions for  NATO on this -- then we will also sign the document on the  Partnership for Peace.    [Correspondent] Boris Nikolayevich, Mr. Chancellor, a  question to you both: You have already addressed this to some  extent -- Russia's cooperation with international organizations.  I would like to ask more specifically about the G-7. Boris  Nikolayevich and you, Mr. Chancellor, how do you assess the  transformation of the G-7 into a G-8, and how do you regard the  issue generally?    [Kohl] Clearly, in the time ahead -- I am not referring to  the meeting in Naples in a few weeks but in the years to come --  a G-8 will come about [word indistinct]. This is not something  I alone can determine; it is a matter for talks, and like the  agreements in the G-7 sphere, it is a procedure whereby the  party doing the inviting, that is, the host, must have a say,  but of course with the relevant feedback. We will no doubt  discuss the issue in connection with overall developments at our  Naples meeting, but as I said -- I am repeating my first  sentence -- developments are quite clearly heading in this  direction, and from the German point of view this is desirable.    [Yeltsin] I would like to add a few words. This question is  topical; it is no longer the same Russia as three, five, or 10  years ago. Russia is taking a democratic path, Russia is going  over to a market economy. Half of the companies in Russia are  currently already private companies. It is a Russia that from  1917 to 1989 did not even know what private ownership meant.  Russia is a big country, a superpower. For that reason it has  the moral right to take part in the tackling of international  issues that are addressed by the politicians of the seven  leading states, that is, Russia should become the eighth  country. However, at the same time we understand that this  issue cannot be settled at once in one step. We therefore  discussed with Helmut Kohl that the first stage must be  concluded, that we should participate in the preparatory  drafting of the political issues and their discussion. The same  applies to security issues, and that in a second stage after  Naples we should also be involved in economic questions and that  there should then be a G8 next year, but not yet now in Naples.    [Correspondent] President, Colonel General Burlakov  [commander in chief of Russian forces in Germany] and the  leadership of the Red Army has always insisted that there should  be a joint farewell parade of the troops of all four allies from  Germany. Your statement now and your agreement with Helmut Kohl  -- how do you think this can be harmonized with feelings in the  Red Army and the leadership of the Red Army?    [Yeltsin] Well, I don't think I quite understand. To start  with, there is no Red Army any more, and the question is not  very comprehensible either. There was a Red Army in 1917.    [Correspondent from Russian TV station NTV] Boris  Nikolayevich, I would like to return to the question of the  farewell ceremony for the Russian soldiers. You know very well  that this question has met with a very sensitive reaction in  Russia -- one could go so far as to use the word discontent.  What can you say to us about this problem; what have you  discussed with the chancellor in this respect?    [Yeltsin] I am very content that my friend Helmut Kohl has  sensed the mood in our society and the mood of the president as  well. One cannot of course do things in such a way that might  destabilize the political situation in Russia. For this reason  he very rapidly came forward with the proposal that we should  perform all the ceremonies in Berlin but separately, without the  Allies.    [Correspondent] One question for the chancellor, one  question  to President Yeltsin. Chancellor, the G-7 has until now been  defined as an association of the strongest economic states of  --to use an earlier term -- the free world, in other words the  six Western states plus Japan. So how does the future role of  Russia, which is certainly a large, powerful, respected country,  fit in? [passage indistinct]    [Correspondent] A question to President Yeltsin. People in  Germany have a lot of trust in you, but there are concerns in  Germany about nationalist developments in Russia. What would  you say to those citizens who are concerned about extremist  nationalist tendencies in parts of Russia?    [Yeltsin] Please understand that there have been  conflagrations in many countries of the CIS, that wars are in  progress there, and, among other things, these are  nationalist-based wars. One nation is fighting another, one  region is fighting another. In Russia alone, in which there are  21 national republics, 88 components of the federation, no blood  has yet been shed for those reasons.    Yes, it is true that some extremists are shouting -- it is  not much different in your own country. But we have no fear of  Zhirinovskiy. No, no, we don't fear him. No, he has no power  base and he won't have any in the future either, since Russia,  which went through the 1941-1945 war, knows what nationalism  means.    [Correspondent from Russian TV] Boris Nikolayevich, could  you  explain to us the essence of Russian policy on the ethnic German  Russians?    [Yeltsin] As we had agreed, there is a commission that  started its work two years ago. As you know, there are already  national districts. We naturally do not by any means want to  lose the Germans in our regions. We do not want them all to  emigrate, not by any means. We want them to live in our country  -- that they work in our country so they can live well in our  country -- and our work is channelled in that direction. This  work is being done at the moment.    [Correspondent] Boris Nikolayevich, here there is a lot of  polemicizing about the repatriation of works of art that came to  Russia during World War II. What is the Russian president's  opinion on this?    [Yeltsin] What would you think if an officer here stole  books  in a library and took them with him to Russia? How should we  actually judge that? What should we think of it? That is to  say, this question is extremely complicated, and cannot be  resolved at one go. We cannot say it must be resolved in the  course of repatriation and that the Germans have also taken  things from Russia, and various objects have gone here and  there. In any case, we cannot work out where more artifacts  have ended up, and so we have set up a joint commission to work  on this, involving the Russian minister for cultural affairs,  and the minister from Germany. They have been working, but they  have been working poorly and slowly. What is that, one meeting  a year? But they have of course already resolved some of the  questions. They have decided that there are many of our  cultural artifacts here that will have to be given back; there  is the Gotha library, which will have to be returned. That is  the situation. But today we decided with the chancellor that  the work of this commission will have to be speeded up--that is  the first thing. The next point is that the second meeting will  have to take place by 15 June. Third, by the end of this year,  Helmut Kohl and I will agree on and sign a schedule for the  further meetings of this commission. But we will clearly not  intervene in what the experts, the professionals, have to do.  We will naturally bow to the decisions made by the commission,  the professionals.    [Voice, in Russian] That is enough -- the last question.    [Correspondent] How do you see Russia's prospects for  accession? In the EU there is some movement on this question.  How do you see it?    [Kohl] I do not think this question is topical in the sense  of the agenda. You know that we in the EU have just undergone a  very difficult process in the parliament last week and agreed on  an EU enlargement involving Austria, Sweden, Finland, and  Norway. These countries now have to pursue this path in their  own referenda. The definition of the EU with regard to Central,  East, and southeastern Europe is still entirely unresolved. I  am firmly of the opinion that we should now do what is most  important with respect to the EU and Russia. That is, we should  actively address the questions of association, of working  together, particularly in the economic sphere. A number of  questions still have to be solved, but I very much hope that it  will be possible to sign the texts now available in the very  foreseeable future. Everything else is a development in the  distant future. That involves two kinds of decision -- those who  wish it, and the others who [word indistinct]. I regard it as  entirely out of the question for us to make a statement at this  time.    [Yeltsin] My position on this: Federal Chancellor Helmut  Kohl has assured me that when Germany holds the EU presidency it  will very emphatically support the conclusion of the agreement  between Russia and the EU so that this takes place within a  month if possible. That means that everything must be agreed  upon, the quotas, the cargoes, the goods, the market, and so on.  There are hundreds of issues. We still have to overcome this  final stage and then everything will develop in this way. We  must not, of course, forget that Russia is a European country  even though we are also in Asia. But one has to consider then  that Russia should belong to the Council of Europe.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Serbian atrocities under fire from US SERBIAN forces in Bosnia are conducting a campaign of calculated cruelty against Moslems that 'dwarfs anything seen in Europe since Nazi times,' the US State Department claimed yesterday, AP reports from Washington. Civilians are the primary targets of military action in the former Yugoslav republic, making a mockery of the Geneva Convention, the department said in its annual human rights report to Congress. By the end of 1992, more than 1.5m people were displaced by the war, including an estimated one-half of the Moslem population, the report said. All sides in the former Yugoslav republic are guilty of atrocities, but 'the atrocities of the Croats and Bosnian Moslems pale in comparison to the sheer scale and calculated cruelty of the killings and other abuses committed by Serbian and Bosnian Serbian forces against Bosnian Moslems', the report said. 'The policy of driving out innocent civilians of a different ethnic or religious group from their homes, so-called ethnic cleansing, was practiced by Serbian forces in Bosnia on a scale that dwarfs anything seen in Europe since Nazi times,' it said.</p>

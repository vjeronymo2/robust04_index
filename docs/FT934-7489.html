			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Chancellor should end food VAT anomaly Sir, In his article, 'Food industry split on VAT lobbying aims' (November 17), Guy de Jonquieres lists many of the anomalies which exist between those food products which are subject to VAT and those which are not. He rightly observers that new product development has made a nonsense of the original decision to exempt all essential foodstuffs from VAT and only charge it on luxury goods. But he concludes that, given political sensitivities and contradictory lobbying from powerful manufacturers, the present all or nothing (zero or 17.5 per cent) system 'for all its faults' will survive. However, in Britain we already have, in effect, an intermediary rate of VAT on food. In 1992, the VAT contributions of Kwik Save - Britain's leading food discounter, not a purveyor of luxury or inessential goods - amounted to more than 7 per cent of its VAT-inclusive food and drink turnover. On food alone, it is in the region of 5 to 6 per cent. Most British consumers fail to realise that they are paying VAT on any, let alone many, of their food purchases. The chancellor should remove the anomalies and impose a single rate. He may well be tempted, in so doing, to set it one or two points higher than the effective current rate but it should be uniform. To suggest that this would harm the less well-off is unproven; why should Kwik Save's customers or, indeed, those who shop at Fortnum's, pay 17.5 per cent more for their chocolate biscuits than for their chocolate cakes? With a uniform rate of VAT on food we would also be more in harmony with the rest of Europe. In France, for example, the standard rate on all food items is 5.5 per cent. Now that the pace of European food retailers' cross-border moves has begun to quicken - Tesco into France: Aldi, Netto, Erteco, Rewe and Lidl into the UK - such harmonisation makes more sense than ever.

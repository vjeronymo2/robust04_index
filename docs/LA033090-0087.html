			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 STATE CANDIDATES' BALLOT DESIGNATIONS DENIED  </P> <P> In a blow to two candidacies for statewide office, a Sacramento judge ruled  Thursday that Democrat Walter Zelman, running for insurance commissioner, and  Republican Angela Buchanan, running for treasurer, could not refer specifically  to their former employers in identifying themselves on the June ballot.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge James T. Ford decided that Zelman could not use the ballot  designation, "director, Common Cause" and that Buchanan could not use "retired  U.S. Treasurer."  </P> <P> Polls have shown that both candidates' support among those surveyed in their  respective races was materially increased when they were identified with their  well-known and often well-thought-of former employers.  </P> <P> The judge said it is what a candidate does or has done for a living that  counts, rather than whom he or she has worked for. He said it clearly would not  be proper for someone working for IBM to be allowed to use "IBM technician" on  the ballot, rather than "technician."  </P> <P> The ruling reversed a decade-old policy of the secretary of state's office that  allowed candidates to list their former jobs by employer, in some instances, if  they had just left them to run for an office. Under this policy, the secretary  of state had ruled that Zelman could use his preferred designation because he  had only recently resigned. But the policy held that Buchanan could not,  because she had held her post more than a decade ago.  </P> <P> The judge struck down both requests.  </P> <P> No other candidates are immediately affected by the ruling.  </P> <P> Later Thursday, Zelman said he had notified election officials that he would  run under the more general designation, "director, consumer's organization."  Buchanan, meanwhile, settled for "chief financial officer."  </P> <P> Although Thursday was supposedly the deadline for settling on ballot  designations, another candidate, Republican Tom Skornia, running for insurance  commissioner, won a court order delaying a decision in his case until an April  4 hearing. Skornia wants to describe himself as a "legal reform advocate," but  election officials have balked on grounds that this is a position on the issues  rather than an occupation.  </P></p>

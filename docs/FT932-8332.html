			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Electrolux income falls by 20% ELECTROLUX, the Swedish white goods manufacturer, yesterday blamed a drop in European demand and high one-off costs in North America for a 20 per cent fall in first-quarter profits. Income after financial items fell to SKr202m (Dollars 27.5m) from SKr253m, which was towards the lower end of stock-market expectations. Sales, benefiting from the weaker krona, advanced 23 per cent to SKr24bn from SKr19.5bn. The group said the downturn in demand was particularly sharp in Sweden and Spain, while there was no upturn in the UK and Germany. While demand in North America continued to rise, one-off costs for product launches, production transfers and the recall of a dishwasher series meant operating income fell. Operating income after depreciation rose 4 per cent to SKr643m from SKr618m. The group said its competitive position was stronger, following restructuring and changes in currency rates, and operating income had risen in most countries apart from North America and Spain. In both household appliances and commercial appliances, operating income was down, while there was an upturn in the group's other main divisions, outdoor products and industrial products. The household appliance result was dragged down by a SKr300m drop in income from North America and Spain. Electrolux blamed the situation in Spain on a weak market and an inflexible labour market. Nevertheless, volumes rose in both Europe and the US in the household appliances sector, with sales rising to SKr13.15bn from SKr10.98bn. Sales in the outdoor products division rose to SKr3.96bn from SKr2.74bn and in industrial products to SKr4.37bn from SKr3.49bn. Both units improved their operating result thanks to restructuring and an improving performance in North America. Commercial appliances lifted sales to SKr2.29bn from SKr2.02bn but operating income fell because of weak market conditions.</p>

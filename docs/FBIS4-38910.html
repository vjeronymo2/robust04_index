			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 02, BNS -- Conclusion of a troop  withdrawal agreement between Estonia and Russia would be very  harmful to Estonia, Academician Endel Lippmaa, a member of the  Assembly Party council, said at a press conference today.    In his words, such agreements contain reciprocal obligations  which make Estonia very vulnerable.    "Since the Russian side is very reluctant to withdraw its  troops, it would be a simple matter for it to accuse us of  violating the stipulations of the treaty after it's been signed.  There are previous instances of such stupid pacts. For  example, Russia didn't delay taking advantage of the 1939  military bases pact, accusing the Baltic states of violating the  agreement, and that served as a pretext for bringing in more  troops," Lippmaa pointed out.    Lippmaa said "unfortunately both Foreign Minister Juri Luik  and President Lennart Meri" are for concluding a troop  withdrawal agreement.    Russia wants to link the troop pullout treaty to signing an  agreement also on social guarantees for its military retirees.  This has become the main stumbling block in relations between  the two countries because the Estonian side has so far rejected  Russia's demand.    In Lippmaa's words, the Assembly Party isn't optimistic  about  Russian troop withdrawal being completed by Aug. 31. If  Russian military presence in Estonia continues in September, the  country's leaders must be prepared for "two essential  demarches," he said.    "We must lodge a complaint (against Russia) at the U.N.  Security Council. Under the U.N. charter, a major power loses  its veto right when it's the accused party. Also, Estonia must  take a more active part with regard to the NATO in the context  of the Partnership for Peace program. NATO has no idea how to  evaluate the continued presence of Russian troops in Estonia, so  it's not interested in the emergence of the need for this and  wants the troops to pull out," was Lippmaa's opinion.</p>

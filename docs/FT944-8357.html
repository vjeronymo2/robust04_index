			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / UK Navy welcomes wider Bosnia role: Bruce Clark gets a taste of the gruelling schedule aboard HMS Invincible Fighter pilots on the Invincible, the British Navy's 20,000 tonne aircraft carrier on patrol in the Adriatic yesterday added a strip of Serb-held territory in Croatia to their potential theatre of operations after receiving instructions from Nato. Capt Richard Hastilow, the ship's commander, welcomed the prospect of playing a wider role in policing the skies over the embattled north Bosnian enclave of Bihac. The captain hoped it would be possible to deter Serb aircraft from making further air attacks on Bihac from Croatian territory. As the crisis in Bihac has unfolded over the last few days, the rise in adrenalin levels among the 1,200-strong crew of the Invincible has been perceptible but not dramatic, perhaps because they are already working so near the limits of their capacity. Ever since the carrier was deployed in the Adriatic three months ago, its nine fighter pilots have been committed to a gruelling work schedule, with pairs of Sea Harrier aircraft policing the Bosnian skies every few hours. Engineers work eight hours on, eight hours off to maintain the Sea Harriers and Sea King helicopters. In the rare moments when there are no duties over Bosnia, pilots and seamen test one another's skills by staging mock battles in which Harriers swoop towards the ship, and the crew go through the motions of defending themselves by unleashing Sea Dart missiles. Their tasks, routinely assigned by Nato, include enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia - which could mean shooting down any aircraft which refuses to leave - preparing for possible air raids in support of UN ground troops, and old fashioned aerial reconnaissance. Aircraft based on the Invincible also play some part in enforcing the arms embargo against the former Yugoslav republics; and officers on board are confident that the ban on arms deliveries to Bosnia can still be enforced, despite the recent change of US policy. The US is continuing to provide its allies with basic information against sea traffic in the Adriatic, although its own ships will not stop arms going to Bosnia if they find any. Both the Invincible and the Sea Harriers were designed for very different roles in cold war times. The carrier was intended for air defence in the Atlantic, with its helicopters engaging in anti-submarine warfare and early warning tasks. But the carrier has adapted well to the newly discovered art of 'off-shore peace-keeping'. The tactics of Gen Sir Michael Rose, the British army officer who is head of UN ground forces in Bosnia - and his insistence is on making only sparing use of air power - are very well understood on board the Invincible. 'We are not gung-ho about this,' says Capt Hastilow. Thanks to a continuous exchange of liaison officers between land and shore, the peace-keeping doctrine evolved by British forces in Bosnia - which favours consensus over constraint, wherever possible - is as staunchly professed by seamen and pilots as it is by ground troops. To use one of the favourite metaphors of Gen Rose, soldiers sailors and airmen are 'singing from the same hymn sheet'. Ironically enough the carrier was not deployed in the Adriatic with the intention of becoming more deeply embroilled in the Bosnian conflict. If anything the opposite is true. While the ship is currently providing services to Nato, officers on the Invincible are highly conscious of the 'national task' of pulling out British ground forces which would be their top priority in any dramatic deterioration of the Bosnian crisis. But the insistence with which officers on the Invincible discuss the moment when 'national tasks' might take over is a reminder of how quickly the alliance solidarity could unscramble if its members continue to disagree over Bosnia.</p>

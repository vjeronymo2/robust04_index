			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Snags in cutting red tape Sir, In so far as your leader, 'Cutting red tape' (October 11), refers to industrial health and safety legislation, you misconceive the problem. The 'radical idea' of government setting out general regulatory objectives instead of detail has governed our whole approach for 20 years, but now needs applying in other regulatory areas, together with more risk assessment and a cost-based approach - of which we are also the main regulatory pioneer in the UK. But there are three snags. First, much new EC-based legislation has been unnecessarily prescriptive despite our best efforts in negotiation. Second, industry demands guidance from the regulator, both on good practice and on what general provisions mean. Such guidance obviously includes detail, which is often given unduly prescriptive weight in civil litigation, or paraded as 'law' by safety contractors or less reputable safety consultants. Finally, many small businesses express a clear wish for detailed as opposed to general guidance. All of these issues are being addressed in the Health and Safety Commission's current fundamental review of health and safety regulations.

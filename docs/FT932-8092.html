			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Two Hungarian banks said to be technically insolvent HUNGARY'S two largest commercial banks are technically insolvent and require big injections of capital, according to a World Bank paper. The two banks, both state-owned, are Magyar Hitel Bank, heavily exposed to Hungary's troubled engineering industry, and Kereskedelmi Bank, main lender to the country's drought-stricken farms. Some of their problems stem from debts inherited from the communist period, but others are more recent. Both banks have suffered from bad debts caused by the three-year Hungarian recession and a collapse in industry's sales to former Comecon countries. Magyar Hitel Bank has Ft34.6bn (Pounds 253.2m) of loans classified as bad, doubtful or substandard, according to the study. Taking these loans into account, the bank has negative capital of Ft19bn, equivalent to 7.9 per cent of its risk-weighted assets. Kereskedelmi Bank has Ft26.3bn in classified loans, with negative capital of Ft13.7bn, 8.5 per cent of assets. The report, a World Bank internal aide-memoire obtained by the Financial Times, says: 'At present, most of the banks are technically insolvent according to internationally accepted accounting standards.' An infusion of Ft100bn of new capital is required to bring the banking sector's capital up to 4 per cent of lending, the target the World Bank recommends. Half of the new capital is needed for the two big banks. The plight of the banks came as little surprise to Budapest's close-knit financial community, which believes the two banks are 'too big to fail' and will therefore be rescued by the authorities. 'A bank which enjoys the umbrella of the state cannot fail,' said Mr Gyorgy Suranyi, managing director of Central-European International Bank. Mr Istvan Szalkai, president of Hitel Bank, expected little market reaction. 'The market has taken into consideration the bad results,' he said. Interbank money market facilities available to the bank had shrunk by about 10 per cent, he said, reflecting lenders' unease. Central bankers at the National Bank of Hungary professed confidence that depositors, knowing the banks were liquid and would be recapitalised, would not panic. Bankers and officials also stressed that Credit Suisse First Boston, leader of the task force on bank privatisation and source of much of the data in the report, used conservative international accounting standards. Hungarian rules are more flattering. Under Hungarian accounting principles, the two banks still have positive capital. Hitel Bank said its 1992 results would be substantially better than CSFB estimates.</p>

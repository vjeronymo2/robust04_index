			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Italy rebounds on hopes of a recovery IN a week shortened by the Easter holiday break, Italy emerged with strong gains as investors reacted to comments by the governor of the Bank of Italy that the economy was showing signs of recovery. Japan was another significant feature with the Nikkei average breaking through the 20,000 barrier during trading on Thursday before closing slightly below, but still at a new year's high. The gains in Italy were also encouraged by the government's restatement, towards the end of the week, of its determination to press ahead with its privatisation programme, together with final cabinet approval of the law on private pensions. But it was the growing belief that economic recovery was under way which really provided buying stimulus, at least among domestic investors. Some analysts noted that foreign institutions remained absent last week as they awaited this weekend's referendum on constitutional changes. Cautioning against too much optimism, Goldman Sachs in its regular monthly strategy note comments that 'on earnings the Italian equity market (short-term) still looks overvalued by about 27 per cent and faces a difficult reporting season'. On a longer perspective, Goldman says that 'the upside largely depends on how long it takes to build a perceived stable political equilibrium through new elections. Great emphasis should also be put on the 1994 budget law and (the government's) ability to sustain the fiscal discipline recently introduced'. While Spain was not a feature last week, the decision by Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, on Monday to call a snap election for June 6 could provide a short-term boost for equities. Mr Victor Galliano of Baring Securities comments that pressure on the peseta may lead to lower interest rates, even before polling day.</p>

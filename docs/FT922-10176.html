			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y may overhaul Dollars 12bn debt plan - Developer in new efforts to stave off financial collapse OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the international property group, is considering a complete overhaul of its plan to reorganise Dollars 12bn in debt in an effort to ward off the threat of bankruptcy filings. Sources close to O&amp;Y's bank talks said it had called a meeting of its 12 biggest lenders for Monday to discuss whether all 100 of its banks should contribute to a Dollars 700m 'global' loan.  The banks are led by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Citicorp of the US and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Until now, it has tried to raise new money from banks with an exposure to its Canadian operations and to its Canary Wharf property development in east London. Negotiations on a global loan would replace these attempts. O&amp;Y had originally hoped to put a 'ring fence' behind those properties in North America whose rents are sufficient to meet borrowing costs. Lenders to these more profitable properties would have been asked to make only limited sacrifices in the debt restructuring. However, lenders to Canary Wharf and the Canadian operations have only been prepared to provide small sums to keep O&amp;Y afloat for a few days at a time. O&amp;Y has decided it may be better to involve all its banks in the refinancing. The 11 lenders to the Canary Wharf project are due to meet again on Monday to discuss whether to provide Pounds 33m (Dollars 58.4m) of new loans to meet the construction project's needs for a month, or whether to press for the project to be put into administration under UK insolvency procedures. The possibility that other banks would participate in the refinancing is likely to encourage the 11 to provide a more modest amount of new money.</p>

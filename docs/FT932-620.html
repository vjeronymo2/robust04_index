			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Management: The battle of Warsaw - Michael Skapinker visits the Hotel Bristol, which has fought to turn local companies into good suppliers When Michael Goerdt arrived at his new Warsaw office two years ago, he asked his secretary to buy 10 files. She returned with the local shop's entire stock of three. He contacted the Polish file manufacturer directly and ordered 300. It would take time, the company said. The order represented a full week's production. While waiting, Goerdt painted his office - a Portakabin in the grounds of the Hotel Bristol. Once Warsaw's grandest hotel, the Bristol was a crumbling hulk when Goerdt arrived from Forte Germany to be its general manager. Last April, the hotel, complete with new marble bathrooms, glass lifts and a basement swimming pool, was formally reopened by Baroness Thatcher. Forte, the UK company that runs the hotel, markets the Bristol as part of its Exclusive Portfolio, which includes the Grosvenor House in London, the Plaza Athenee in New York and the George V in Paris. After its meticulous refurbishment under Forte's supervision, the 92-year-old Bristol can hold its head up in such company. Forte owns 55 per cent of the hotel, with the remainder held by Orbis, the Polish tourist agency. Forte's stake came cheap; it only put up Pounds 4m of the Pounds 25m spent on the refurbishment, with the rest coming from the International Finance Corporation and other funding agencies. The drawback to investing in an exclusive hotel in eastern Europe is the constant struggle to find reliable builders, staff and suppliers in countries unused to the demands of a market economy. These difficulties were explored on this page in an article about the Moscow Aerostar Hotel, a joint venture between the airline Aeroflot and IMP, a Canadian company (December 7 1992). While managers at the Aerostar and the Bristol tell some of the same stories, running hotels in Poland and Russia are substantially different experiences. Both hotels have a large number of university graduates on the staff, taking calls at the reception desk, making beds and serving in restaurants. In Warsaw, as in Moscow, international hotel employees earn far more than doctors or teachers. Both hotels encountered problems training staff, who grew up under the communist system. Ingrid Eras, the Bristol's Dutch-born personnel manager, recounts how difficult it was to get passing staff to pick up a ringing telephone if the telephonist was away from the desk. In both hotels, however, managers said their employees' long experience of formal education made them quick learners. As islands of affluence in the former communist world, both hotels have suffered from staff theft. The Bristol's bath plugs have been a favoured target. All Bristol employees, from managers down, have to pass a traffic light, installed at the staff exit, on their way home. When the light turns red, the employee leaving at the time is searched. Eras says the overall level of theft has been far less than feared. Staff at both hotels appear more attentive and enthusiastic than their counterparts in western Europe. They have all mastered the art of being pleasant to guests, even if - as one Bristol employee notes - not all western guests have mastered the art of being pleasant to staff. The difference between Warsaw and Moscow is that foreign investors say they find Warsaw a more hospitable business environment, although not everyone will feel that way. My own welcome was dented by a taunt of 'Zyd]' (Jew) from a passer-by in a street near the Bristol. The Bristol has had far more success than the Moscow Aerostar in finding competent local suppliers. The Aerostar made some efforts to buy wine, fruit and other products locally but ended up importing all its food, drink, cleaning materials and office equipment. Local suppliers did not have the experience or capital to provide the quality and reliability needed. Hans Gemmer, Forte's central European vice-president, says the Bristol has to import beef and seafood. But the company has managed to buy vegetables in Poland. To be on the safe side the hotel simply puts 'vegetables' on the menu, rather than promising a specific item. Gemmer says the Bristol's food store has to carry up to 3 1/2 times as much food as a west European hotel. Toiletry inventories are 10 times as high as in the west. He says, however, that Polish suppliers' ability to deliver has improved enormously over the past two years. Goerdt persuaded some companies to move into new businesses specifically to supply the hotel. He found a Polish farmer with excess supplies of strawberries and cherries, bought him bottles and sugar and taught him how to make jam. He discovered the hotel would have to put down a Dollars 1m deposit for a licence to import wine. Instead, he persuaded a Polish trading company to go into the wine importing business. The arrangement has worked well, except that the company is only prepared to import in bulk. This means that, instead of replenishing stocks as they are consumed, the Bristol has to use up most of its available wine before ordering more. Guests sometimes have to be told some wines are not available. The hotel's greatest success was getting all the bedroom furniture made in Poland. Olga Polizzi, Forte's building and design managing director, says the group gave a sample bedside table to 10 companies and asked them to manufacture one. A Warsaw company, PKZ, came up with a better table than the British, Italian and German companies. The PKZ factory looked chaotic, but Clare Knapp-Fisher, Forte's design director, says her instincts told her the company would cope. 'They were very straight. They were very honest about their own misgivings about being able to fulfil the contract.' The company made all the bedroom furniture to Forte's satisfaction. Polizzi and Knapp-Fisher say they now realise they could have used Polish sub-contractors more than they did. The reconstruction of Warsaw's old town and palaces has left the city with a substantial group of skilled craftsmen. Despite the improvements of the past few years, Polish companies still have to learn to market themselves. To Forte's surprise, PKZ has not followed up its success by asking to do more work for the group.</p>

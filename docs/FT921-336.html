			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Letter: Share ownership has varying incentives Sir, Your survey on employee ownership ('Poised at the crossroads', March 24) remarked on growth in employee share-ownership programmes (Esop) during the 1980s. Research by the London School of Economics Business Performance Group shows that the incentive effect of employee ownership varies considerably. While individual employees are typically motivated by incentive pay, introducing incentives to those with more collective values may be totally ineffective in promoting higher levels of effort. In this case resources would be better applied elsewhere. The blanket introduction of an Esop is no substitute for sensitive design in pay systems.

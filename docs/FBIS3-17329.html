Due to the prolonged tense situation along its  border with Ingushetia and incessant attacks on factories,  plants, military units and police posts by armed bandit gangs,  the parliament resolved to request the president of the Russian  Federation and the Federal Assembly to extend the emergency  situation in the Mozdo, Pravoberezhnoy and Prigorodnoy districts  and part of the settlements near the city of Vladikavkaz.    Addressing the session, North Ossetian President Akhsarbek  Galazov, said that in particular, Russia has already spent over  100 billion roubles to support the emergency situation. But the  situation in the zone of conflict is complicated, there are  conditions which lead to its further aggravation, the refugee  and hostage problems remain unresolved and the local population  in the region possesses a lot of arms. Currently Russian  peacekeeping forces are the guarantor of security in the zone of  conflict.    Akhsarbek Galazov reaffirmed his initiative to hold a  meeting  with Ingusetian President Ruslan Aushev aimed at discussing a  settlement between their two republics. But this meeting must  be well-prepared, he emphasised.</p>

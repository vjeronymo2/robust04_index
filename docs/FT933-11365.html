Mr Chuan Leekpai, Thailand's prime minister, said yesterday that the government would return the assets only if a court ordered it to do so. Mr Chatichai Choonhavan, the former prime minister and now leader of the opposition, had Bt226.5m seized; Mr Subin Pinkhayan, the former commerce minister, had Bt608m taken away.

But the politicians are still chasing their assets, as the government's constitutional arbiter, the juridical council, ruled that the wealth was government property. The finance ministry - which holds the assets - has said it has no authority to release any money.

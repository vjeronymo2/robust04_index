			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / People: Pastures new for Quest-Ritson Charles Quest-Ritson, a solicitor whose private passion for gardens recently found expression in a highly-acclaimed book The English Country Garden Abroad, has joined Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management to head up its financial planning arm, Capel-Cure Myers Financial Services. His move from a private law practice in the West Country to the private client stockbroking and fund management group by way of two years at an independent financial adviser, Advisory &amp; Brokerage Services, was occasioned by a growing disenchantment with the legal world. 'The law is not changing very fast. When you reach a certain age and have learnt the job, it is difficult to see where the challenge and excitement is supposed to come from in doing the same thing for the next 20 years. The courageous thing to do is to move on.' The task at Capel-Cure Myers, where Quest-Ritson, 45, is in charge of a team of eight, consists less in discussing specific investment vehicles with clients than in developing an overall strategy for them. He regards it as providing 'a brain-box that works on an individual's personal circumstances, and touches on things that would normally be covered by accountants, lawyers, tax experts and so on'. Meanwhile, his latest literary success took two years to research and write and grew out of a life-long love of gardening kindled at the age of nine when he first collected the school gardening prize - a trophy he carried off every subsequent term until he left. ***** Ian Grant, a non-executive director of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, has joined the board of Banco Santander. The decision to add a second Royal Bank director to Santander's board - Royal Bank chairman Lord Younger has been a director for two years - follows growing rumours that the Spanish bank was contemplating selling its 9.9 per cent stake in the Scottish bank. Santander used the occasion of Grant's appointment to its board last month to reaffirm its commitment to the alliance with the Royal Bank which has a 1.5 per cent stake in Santander. A Santander spokesman described recent stock market speculation that the links might be broken as 'complete nonsense' and said that the cross shareholdings are 'long-term investments which are central to the unique alliance of our institutions'. However, one analyst noted that if the Royal Bank were really intent on developing the relationship it should have put one of its executives on the Santander board. ***** Victor Beamish, formerly managing director of WI Carr (Far East), a subsidiary of France's Banque Indosuez, has been appointed managing director of HG Asia Securities in London. For Beamish the move means re-joining a team he left in September 1987 when HG Asia was part of the UK-based stockbroker Hoare Govett. HG Asia, though, was bought out from Hoare's then American owner Security Pacific last June and is now owned by its employees, Hong Kong holding company Guoco, and American broker Smith Barney, which has 20 per cent. Beamish, 39, a member of a distinguished Irish rugby-playing family who has lived for spells in Hong Kong and Singapore, will be responsible for the continued development of HK Asia's European, UK and North American business.</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> A $2.5-million movie that was to be actor Hal Holbrook's directing debut has  shut down before filming began because its producers ran out of money. "There's  nothing much I can do about it," Holbrook told the Associated Press Saturday as  he left Fayetteville, Ark., for New York. "I'm the director of this film and  I'm out of a job." Filming of "Staggerwing," the story of a real-life bandit,  was supposed to have begun Wednesday in Bentonville. Filmtrust, a Little  Rock-based group, was producing the movie. Earl Bond, a co-founder of  Filmtrust, said Sunday that the principal investor, whom he declined to  identify, had backed out after committing to spend $1.5 million.Claudia Puig  </P></p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Local Elections (Nottingham): Steering well clear of the capital - Ivo Dawnay reports from his first port of call on the campaign trail FOR MORE than 2 1/2 years the political control of Nottingham City Council has depended on the antique mechanics of a 10-year-old, scarlet Ford Escort. In that time, its owner - 68-year-old councillor John Peck, DFC - has successfully waged his campaigns while negotiating uncounted traffic hazards and the potential pitfalls of holding the balance of power between 27 Labour and 27 Tory colleagues. Mr Peck's tireless travelling and exhaustive grassroots activism in Bulwell ward have earned him his seat, whether as a communist he was, or a Green as he is today. But what of the others? Earthquakes permitting, Labour will at last gain the firm control over the council denied it by two elections in 1983 and 1987 when the Tories were flying high nationally. But if the poll tax factor could be stripped out, how then would the parties lie? On economic grounds, at least, Nottingham appears to be weathering the recession in surprisingly good health. The city still has an old fashioned central square, bustling shopping centres, a diversified business base and a prize-winning polytechnic. Moneywise Magazine judges it the best city for 'quality of life' in Britain and, what is more, Nottingham Forest are in the final of the FA Cup. Its biggest difficulty is now a shortage of land to develop. Local development needs - a new Light Rapid Transport system and electrification of the railway line from London St Pancras - enjoy all-party support. So, too, does the desire to win back to the city the powers granted to the county council in the 1974 re-organisation. Penny-pinching London - birthplace of the ruinous poll tax - is widely seen as the stumbling block. Indeed, one understandably anonymous local businessman conceded that many of his colleagues were as happy to see Labour in the magnificent 1929 Council House as the Tories. 'Both lots agree on the main issue of fighting to develop Nottingham,' he said. 'The headline-grabbing issues are always peripheral.' That commonly-held view is fiercely contested by the two main parties - both aware that with three marginal Westminster seats (one Labour, two Tory) at stake, Nottingham is a weathervane for the general election. To make it more central still, the city's battles are being fought on propaganda and ideological territory strongly similar to that mapped-out in national party headquarters. In consequence, Mr Bill Bradbury, the no-nonsense Tory leader, concedes that Labour has so far successfully sold its 'modern' image. But he goes on to warn of a hidden agenda of irresponsible high-spending and 'loony' leftism which surfaced once in what he describes as a 'world first' of gay swimming sessions at city pools. Mr John Taylor, Labour's bearded deputy leader, counters that his party is now the champion of 'enabling local government' in partnership with the private sector, while the Tories inhabit an out-dated Thatcherite past of ineffective market forces. Pointing to a number of development schemes for vacant land, he says constructive intervention in the local economy is the only alternative to leaving Nottingham's future simply to the ebbs and flows of the national economy. Bounce that claim back off councillor Bradbury and he will reply that several of the projects were actually initiated by the Tories. But how much does the ordinary voter notice these nuances, or care? The message from Nottingham is that in many voters' minds there is little to distinguish between the two parties - a reflection in microcosm, perhaps, of the national picture. Both parties are wrestling for the centre ground on platforms of sound management based on private and public sector partnerships. With the poll tax fiasco and the Tories' high previous votes, Labour surely must win outright control. But whether the margin will be adequate to augur a general election victory is doubtful. As one neutral city leader put it: 'If interest rates drop to 10 per cent and inflation is down to five per cent, that is also pretty persuasive.' Whatever the parties' national computers say on May 3, the 'feel-good' factor will still play its part when the general election comes.</p>

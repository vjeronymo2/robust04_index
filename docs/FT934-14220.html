			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: Apple looks to next generation - The US computer group's latest boardroom shuffle MR JOHN Sculley, who had hoped to orchestrate a graceful departure from Apple Computer after 10 years at the helm of the personal computer company, was last week forced into an abrupt resignation. The move by Apple's board to replace Mr Sculley, one of the better known and more articulate executives in the US, came as the company ended one of the most troubled years in its history. Last week, Apple reported a meagre Dollars 2.7m fourth-quarter profit, down 97 per cent on the same period last year. Struggling to maintain its share of the PC market, Apple has repeatedly cut prices over the past year, paring gross profit margins from 43 per cent to less than 26 per cent in the process. For Mr Sculley, the timing could not have been worse. A year ago, he might have left Apple as a hero who had led the company to record sales and profits and steered it toward emerging technologies. Instead, as Apple's financial problems deepened, he became the target of intense criticism, blamed for the company's woes. Mr Sculley's desire to move on to new challenges has become increasingly apparent over the past two years. He seemed to be losing interest in the price and market-share battles of the PC market, enthusing instead about the new opportunities to be found in the confluence of computer, communications and consumer electronics technology, which he predicted would create a Dollars 3,500bn industry. Speculation was rife that Mr Sculley would, before long, leave Apple - perhaps for a post in the Clinton administration or to form his own high-tech company, a move that he acknowledges is his dream. Earlier this year, he made an unsuccessful bid for the top job at International Business Machines by proposing an audacious merger plan - combining Apple with the most profitable portions of IBM's business. Most of IBM's directors were too short-sighted to recognise the potential of his proposal, he later complained. Few, however, had foreseen such an ignominious end to Mr Sculley's career at Apple. Even when, four months ago, he handed over the role of chief executive to his second in command, Mr Michael Spindler, Apple was at pains to deny that Mr Sculley was being forced to relinquish power. It now appears, however, that Mr Sculley, like his predecessor Mr Steve Jobs, fell victim to a boardroom dispute. Indeed, there are uncanny parallels between the circumstances, in 1985, when Mr Jobs was forced out of the company he co-founded, and Mr Sculley's untimely departure. Mr Jobs was ousted when Apple, as it is today, was facing a financial crisis and its first Macintosh personal computer was failing to live up to expectations. Similarly, Mr Sculley's departure coincides with disappointment over the performance of the Newton Messagepad, his pet project. Mr Sculley turned 'Steve's machine' into a huge commercial success, increasing Apple's revenues over his 10-year tenure from Dollars 600m to almost Dollars 8bn. However, he always seemed to harbour a desire to prove himself the equal of the young man he had displaced at Apple by creating his own technology breakthrough and becoming, like Mr Jobs, recognised for his 'technology vision'. It will now be up to Mr Sculley's successors - Mr Michael Spindler, the new chief executive, and Mr Mike Markkula, Apple's new chairman - to determine whether Mr Sculley's Newton can become Apple's most important product technology for the 1990s. Mr Sculley's legacy at Apple will also be judged, however, on the success of the technology alliances that he formed with IBM two years ago to develop microprocessor and software technology for the next generation of Apple personal computers. The first of these 'PowerPC' products is expected to be ready for market next year. That will be none too soon for Apple's new management team.</p>

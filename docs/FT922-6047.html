			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Arts: Philadelphia Orchestra For the London stopover on their European tour the Philadelphia Orchestra brought a refreshingly unhackneyed programme to the Festival Hall. There was none of box-office-safe Beethoven or Brahms with which visiting orchestras too often shore up their concerts - the big romantic symphony was Skryabin's Second, and the orchestral showpieces placed before it were Elgar's concert overture In the South and Casella's Paganiniana. The current tour is the last the orchestra will undertake with Riccardo Muti as Music Director; he leaves at the end of the current season to be replaced by Wolfgang Sawallisch. On the evidence of Monday's concert Muti will bequeath to his successor an ensemble as fine as any in the world at present. There are no detectable faults in any department of the orchestra; the sound is supple and refined, founded upon a wonderfully homogeneous string section, with wind principals, brass as much as woodwind, of limpid phrasing and elegant individuality. The personality of the orchestra is never intrusive; it offers carte blanche to a conductor who knows his stuff to apply his own characterisations and nuances. The sound world on offer, though, is not one to suit precisely every part of the orchestral repertory. In this particular programme that mattered not at all, particularly with Muti's bracing attacks on rhythms and dynamics to add contours and life to the immaculate surfaces. Casella's four-movement suite was an innocuous start. Commissioned to celebrate the centenary of the Vienna Philharmonic in 1942, it was hardly born under a lucky star, and does little but run the departments of the orchestra through some showy neoclassical paces. In the South has long been a Muti party-piece; he conducted it in London during his years with the Philharmonia, and has preserved the freshness and vigour of his approach intact. There was a real Mediterranean tang to its flavours, intense theatricality in its extraordinary depiction of the might of the Roman empire, a daring sweep and thrust to the phrasing. It is the most (Richard) Straussian of all Elgar's works, and delivered without English pastoral preconceptions becomes a thrilling piece of orchestral description. The longueurs of Skryabin's Second are less easy to transmute; a work which never says anything in eight bars which could profitably be extended to 80 needs all the care and attention a conductor can provide. Muti gave the impression of believing in every one of its blasts of rhetoric; even the C major finale, piling banality upon banality, was given its full measure. Earlier the langourous melodies and queasy modulations had been sifted and coloured most beautifully by the Philadelphia strings; a better case for the work could not have been made. After such a peerless demonstration of orchestral virtuosity, an encore was inevitable - an orchestral arrangement of a piano Notturno by Giuseppe Martucci, a favourite piece of Toscanini as Muti told us from the rostrum, and played here with hushed eloquence and burnished tone.</p>

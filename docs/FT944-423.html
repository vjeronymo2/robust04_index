			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Year-old Saudi 'parliament' is a quiet affair: Mark Nicholson assesses the role of the 60-member, royal-appointed Consultative Council Saudi Arabia's Consultative Council, a body optimistically hailed by some in the west as a step towards democracy in the secretive monarchy, is a year old. However, since King Fahd ceremonially inaugurated the council on December 29 last year and its 60 royal appointees set about their task of 'advising' the Saudi ruler, it has almost vanished from public view. Information about council affairs is scant. Newspapers report that the council meets but not what it discusses. Saudi TV recently broadcast images of a plenary session, without sound or comment. Mr Abdulla Nasseef, the council's vice-chairman, insists the lack of publicity does not mask a lack of accomplishment on the part of its members, each on stipends of SR20,000 (Dollars 5,333) a month plus car. 'We're in the beginning and we're a conservative society,' explains Mr Nasseef, a geologist and former head of the World Moslem League. 'So, in the beginning, it's better that we deliberate in exclusion. But, in the future, there will be the ability to bring in people - we have public galleries, and galleries for the press.' The assembly has, he says, studied more than 50 of Saudi Arabia's international agreements and passed them to the Council of Ministers for approval. It has - backed by continuous work from eight committees 'who do the basic work' - drafted laws on intellectual property rights, and environmental and wildlife protection, both of which were passed unaltered by the cabinet. It is reviewing all Saudi Arabia's by-laws, drawing in experts and academics. Members are studying possible fees and service charges for public utilities and recently called in the finance minister for a six-hour debriefing. 'The time will come when we have to discuss things ministry by ministry, though we are not charged to put them on trial or criticise them,' he says, but adds: 'It's a sort of positive competition - they have to be more careful now.' The council is charged, in essence, to advise King Fahd who, in appointing it last year, kept a long-standing promise to revive the more informal Majlis a-Shura of courtiers and tribal sheikhs which, almost 40 years ago, used to advise Saudi Arabia's founding monarch. But King Fahd impressed most Saudis with his appointees, who were not the expected tribal or religious leaders, but a low-profile selection of diligent, professional technocrats. Half hold doctorates from western universities. Diplomats and locals believe that, had the council been elected, Saudi voters would have returned fewer technocrats and more sheikhs and Islamic leaders. But, if the council's creation was, in Saudi terms, a leap in increasing participation in government, the council is far from a proto-parliament. Its plenary session and committees - which embrace information, finance, foreign policy, security, religion, health, utilities and legal affairs - address only matters directed by the king. After review, it then posts its recommendations back to the king, who passes them on to the Council of Ministers for approval. If the cabinet disagrees with the Majlis findings (which they have not yet), King Fahd arbitrates. The council has a modicum of legislative power. A minimum of 10 members may propose legal reforms to the king. Mr Nasseef says five such recommendations await royal assent to proceed, including proposals to modernise school curriculums. He would not say how. Debate, says Mr Nasseef, has been 'lively' in the small assembly room for plenary sessions; members have forsaken as 'too large' the centrepiece 456-seat hall, complete with electronic voting equipment, rows of comfortable chairs and an ornate dome of 48m diameter. 'The podium was too big - members couldn't see the chairman,' says Mr Nasseef. Members are formally permitted 10-minute speeches, but routinely take 20 or 30 minutes to make their points, he says. Voting is by majority. 'There can be big arguments: sometimes it takes days and nights to come to agreement. But, generally speaking, people are enjoying this.' So too, it seems, are government ministries, which now have to open their work to the council. 'Whatever comes out of the Shura is generally more realistic than what we have done before,' says Mr Abdul Rahman al-Zamil, deputy minister of commerce. 'Laws used to be passed from one bureaucrat to another, and these people have no experience of the outside world. It's a tremendous advance.' But Saudi Arabia's new Consultative Council is making its tremendous - and, in Saudi terms, experimental - advances cautiously. The body is not, stresses Mr Nasseef, a prospective new centre of political power. In part, he explains, this is because its job is to implement Islamic law, which is Saudi Arabia's formal constitution. 'It's a bit different from a parliament because a parliament has a secular point of view and has to implement the people's will, regardless of religion. But we have to implement the law of God.' Also, he says, council members do not see their role as political. 'It's a question of improving the country's performance, not a question of power,' he says. Decision-making in the kingdom remains absolutely the realm of the king. That said, Mr Nasseef leaves the clear impression that the council still has some way to evolve. He does not rule out, for instance, that King Fahd might decide to enlarge the body in two years' time, when half the present council members must be replaced. 'Of course, the king makes the decision. But the possibility is there,' he says. 'We have 450 seats in our assembly hall, after all.'</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Owners Abroad renews its attack on Airtours' bid OWNERS ABROAD yesterday launched its most robust defence against the hostile Pounds 215m bid from rival Airtours, claiming the smaller group was exaggerating the quality of its management. Owners Abroad said that not only did the Airtours shares included in the offer undervalue the group, they would also leave Owners Abroad shareholders with an interest in a group that was facing fundamental problems with its own business. The latest defence, delivered in a letter to shareholders, comes days before the Office of Fair Trading is to recommend to the trade and industry secretary whether the Airtours bid should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Owners focuses particularly on Airtours' relatively new Airtours International aircraft operation. It accuses Airtours of choosing a September end for its financial year in order to inflate profits. It asked whether Airtours chose its year end just before 'empty legs' are flown - the flights at the end of the holiday season when aircraft pick up passengers from resorts but carry none out. In this way Airtours was able to take the profit from the holidays sold but defer the cost of the empty legs as long as it was adding passengers year on year. Owners Abroad also said that part of the huge increase in Airtours' profits resulted from additions to the aircraft fleet. As long as Airtours was adding aircraft to its fleet just before the summer  -as it has been doing - it would each year take the benefit of a greater number of profitable summer aircraft than loss-making winter aircraft. Owners asked what would happen once Airtours' fleet size had stabilised. The document asked whether Airtours was trying to buy its way out of trouble. It questioned whether recent Airtours' approaches to other tour operators such as Cosmos, Aspro, Iberotravel, and Unijet, represented a clearly defined strategy for growth 'or just a desperate need to buy almost anything with a meaningful market share in an attempt to bolster volume'. Owners Abroad also released its annual report and accounts, which revealed that net asset value had risen only Pounds 700,000 in the year to October, in spite of pre-tax profits of Pounds 25.5m. The difference was the result of a more conservative treatment of goodwill in connection with the 1991 acquisition of Olympic Holidays. The accounts also revealed that the highest paid Owners Abroad executive earned Pounds 418,000 and the chairman earned Pounds 364,000 during the year, some of it in respect of the two previous financial years.</p>

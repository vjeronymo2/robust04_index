			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / The City Bombing: Challenge to sustain commercial heartbeat PROTECTING the image of London's commercial heart was the Corporation of London's toughest challenge after the explosion that damaged 200 buildings. The bombing of the Stock Exchange a year ago made it clear to the Corporation that faith in the City as a place to do business could be shaken by a terrorist attack. Within 60 hours of Friday's bomb it had contacted nearly all the 36 companies known to be affected and helped arrange relocation. Yesterday at 9.30am most were operating. The clubbiness for which the Square Mile is often criticised worked to its advantage. Mr Peter Tudball, chairman of the Baltic Exchange, could visit his friend Sir Brian Jenkins, the lord mayor, and brief him over a gin and tonic. Sir Brian was able to put him in touch with another friend, Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, the insurance market, to talk about alternative accommodation for the Baltic Exchange. Sir Brian said: 'That's what the City is all about.' Sir Brian was at dinner when police contacted him about the explosion. He went to the scene where he met another old friend, Mr Owen Kelly, commissioner of the City police, who had a list of businesses affected. The lord mayor passed this to Mr Ted Harthill, the City surveyor, who was able to put displaced businesses in touch with surveyors who had office space.</p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Scottish ferry line sell-off 'rejected' The government is believed to have rejected the idea of privatising the shipping line Caledonian MacBrayne, which operates ferries on Scotland's west coast. The decision, to be announced in the next few weeks, follows a study of CalMac by KPMG Management Consulting, which examined a range of options for private-sector participation in the running of the services, including privatisation. The decision to review CalMac's operations only a few years after a study in 1988 rejected privatisation produced strong protests in the Western Isles and along the west coast, with islanders fearing that the services would be cut or stopped. It is believed that the holding of a review was insisted on by the Treasury. CalMac argued strongly to be left intact and retain its structure, which involves a small number of profitable routes helping to subsidise the larger number of loss-making ones, and requiring a Scottish Office grant which last year was Pounds 6m. KPMG is widely believed to have recommended against privatisation and the government is thought to have accepted that. It may make some recommendations on improved efficiency. The Scottish Office refused to comment on suggestions that CalMac was not to be privatised. Mr Colin Paterson, CalMac managing director, said: 'I haven't had any official confirmation, but if the leak is true I'm absolutely delighted for the company, staff and islanders.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 28 KYODO -- North Korea is capable of  delivering chemical weapons with SCUD missiles and has already  targeted missiles at Okinawa and Guam, a defector from North  Korea's armed forces said Thursday.    Sgt. Yi Chong-kok, who defected to South Korea on March 18,  told a news conference that North Korea has the technology to  mount chemical weapons onto SCUD missiles though it is not  capable of mounting nuclear weapons.    "Missile bases located in Myongchon and Hwadae of North  Hamkyong province have Okinawa and Guam within its shooting  range," said Yi, who served in the nuclear and Chemical Defense  Bureau in the Korean People's Army General Staff.    Yi also said missiles at a base in Jagang Province, which  borders China, are aimed at China.    North Korean Leader Kim Chong-il, Kim Il-song's son and  heir-  apparent, does not appear to hold the reins in the military  although he is supreme commander of the armed forces, he said.    "Kim Pyong-il, Kim Chong-il's stepbrother and ambassador to  Finland, is more popular among North Korean people because he is  handsome and is believed to have good personality," Yi said.    North Korean Vice Premier Kim Pok-sin, after inspecting  frontline military units in March 1992, told President Kim  Il-song soldiers had little rice and clothing and wore shoes  made of bark, according to Yi.    Upon receiving the report, the president sacked an official  involved in supplying food, and ordered the Administration  Council to provide rice and 400,000 pairs of military shoes, Yi  said.    "North Korea's food shortage is even worse in the  countryside  and I heard old men and children have died of starvation in  Yanggang Province and South Hamkyong Province," he said.    Yi also said he heard that North Koreans in Yomjoo and  Tongrim in the North Pyongan Province rioted to protest food  shortages last August and September.    "Even if North Koreans want to see their country adopt  Chinese- style open-door policies, they realize their country is  becoming more and more isolated, and communism can no longer  survive with the collapse of the Soviet Union," Yi said.    "North Korean Leader Kim Il-song seems worried about the  possible fall of his regime," he added.</p>

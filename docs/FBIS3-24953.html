			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Swing Vote To Ensure Election Democracy -- Referring to the  findings of a Market and Media Research poll commissioned by THE  STAR, Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 4 February in a  page-10 editorial welcomes the fact that "a quarter of the  voters are undecided." This means the outcome of the election  "is not pre- determined, that the campaign, the election issues  and the arguments and counter-arguments are more than the ritual  din of electioneering." The undecided voters will ensure "there  will be an element of unpredictability and excitement." THE  STAR believes that "democracy depends on the swing vote."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Economic Policy Taking Shape -- "While the constitutional  negotiations stumble on, the policy negotiations are having far  more success," remarks a page-6 editorial in Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 4 February. The "public spats" about  the ANC attitudes to mines and banks are but the latest examples  of this process, "which is proving hugely beneficial and is the  best reason we have to hope for economic prosperity." "The ANC  [African National Congress], like the NP [National Party], is  considering new ways of achieving an unchanged goal. The NP  switched from domination to negotiation to secure white  survival, and Afrikaner survival in particular. The ANC wants  to redress apartheid's ills, ending the economic focus on white  businesses and individuals spreading economic empowerment and  tangible benefits to blacks while using state resources to  attack poverty, disease, illiteracy, homelessness and  unemployment." The country has "come a long way since 1990,"  and its politics "may be in a mess but, draft by draft and  argument by argument, an acceptable economic policy is taking  shape."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   ANC Can Afford Double-Ballot Elections -- "As the party that  is likely to get most of the support in the coming elections,  the ANC can be magnanimous and accept some of the demands made  by the Freedom Alliance," declares Johannesburg SOWETAN in  English on 4 February in a page-10 editorial. This would "call  the bluff of those in the alliance who refuse to go into the  elections as they know they will be voted out. Apart from  anything else double-ballot elections which will have  credibility might even expose those homeland leaders who have no  support in their own areas."    Black Economic Empowerment -- A second editorial on the same  page welcomes the pending takeover of African Life by a  coalition of black business people and community organizations.  It is "a great step towards black economic empowerment."  <H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>   Poll Predictions Fit NP, DP Agenda -- "Beware of the opinion  polls," cautions a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL  &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 4-10 February. "Predictions of an  ANC  landslide in April have the effect of lulling ANC activists and  supporters into complacency and promoting the view among  doubters that they should vote for a strong opposition. The  poll that predicts an ANC landslide fits a National or  Democratic Party agenda. The ANC's own polls give it only a  little more than 50 percent. That's a more realistic figure,  all things considered."</p>

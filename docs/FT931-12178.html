			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): Not quite as safe as houses - The Tax Deadline 4, The Business Expansion Scheme / Property is likely to make most sense. But take independent advice, and be sure the BES suits your overall tax plan and investment philosophy NO INVESTMENT is quite so tightly tied to the end of the tax year as the Business Expansion Scheme. Each year at about this time, a rash of glossy prospectuses offers opportunities for the wealthy to reclaim some of their tax. That is not going to change. But much else connected with the scheme has changed utterly since it was first introduced as the Business Start-up Scheme in 1981. Last year's budget set a definite timetable for its demise - it will end on December 31 this year. The idea is to encourage higher-rate (or to a lesser extent basic-rate) taxpayers to invest in high-risk speculative ventures, and in residential property which is available for assured-tenancy letting. The latter has come to dominate the sector almost totally, because the risk involved is lower. If a sponsor wants to attract investment through the BES, it is necessary to set up a company. Tax relief at the investor's top marginal rate is then payable on investment in shares in the company. The maximum which can be raised through a property BES is Pounds 5m, and for trading companies the figure is only Pounds 750,000. Each investor may put a maximum of Pounds 40,000 per tax year into the BES. This can be spread over any number of companies. The company should then send out BES3 forms, with which tax relief can be claimed from the Inland Revenue. So, having invested Pounds 40,000, a top-rate taxpayer would receive 40 per cent of this, Pounds 16,000, back from the Revenue, making an effective investment of only Pounds 24,000. Tax relief is forfeited if the shares are sold within five years, or if the company fails to continue a business which qualifies for BES relief during this time. This most often happens if the company collapses altogether, but could also occur if a property company breached assured tenancy rules. The idea is that you are locked in for five years. This is extremely tax-efficient. But tax-efficiency, while desirable, is not a sufficient reason to make an investment. Early BES companies had a distressing habit of going bust, leaving investors with a stiff loss. The fact that it was tax-efficient was of little consolation. An 'entrepreneurial' BES could make big profits. But a decision to invest in one would be far beyond the normal bounds of personal finance. If you know and trust the management, or believe the company has a particularly strong chance of success, then it is a good home for 'risk' money you are prepared to lose. For the majority, the lowest-risk schemes are the most appealing. And the sponsors who put these packages together have now managed to squeeze most of the risk out of them. First came the 'buy-back'. A BES company would buy property on behalf of a university or housing association, which would then covenant to buy it back at a fixed price at the end of the five-year period. Initially, prices of Pounds 1.40 at the end of five years for every Pounds 1 share were on offer  -a great deal given that the shares would effectively have cost 60p each. However, the 'guarantees' on offer were flimsy, as they were only as strong as the guarantor bodies. Neither universities nor housing associations could be regarded as fiscally strong. But last year, sponsors at last found clearing banks prepared to underwrite the guarantees. This cuts the amount of money on offer - following the latest round of base rate cuts, the price from some companies has been only Pounds 1.08 after five years - but reduces the risk. Now, the banks are also prepared to offer 'non-recourse loans' after six months. These are secured only on the value of the BES shares themselves - they have no right to pursue any of your other assets, meaning that you can effectively walk away from the investment after six months. Thanks to the gearing provided by the tax relief you can do so for a big profit. The standard rate from schemes so far has been 72p for every Pounds 1 spent. On an after-tax investment of 60p, after only six months, this is impressive, and interest in non-recourse schemes has been intense. As the tax-year end approaches, the sales pressure will intensify. How do you handle it? The golden rules are to use independent advice, and make sure that the BES fits with your overall tax plans and investment philosophy. Unless you can genuinely afford to take risks, the various forms of guaranteed property scheme must make the most sense. If liquidity is important, and many people do not want to lock in for five years, then the non-recourse loans are attractive. However, those who can wait for five years will get better value. As Allenbridge Group points out, the cost of funds on a non-recourse loan is about 9.8 per cent. In other words, you will only gain on this option, compared with staying in for the five years, if you can reinvest the money somewhere which will earn 9.8 per cent - a slightly optimistic assumption. The highest rates over five years may come from companies which do not offer non-recourse loans. Always look at the strength of the covenant, and avoid operators new to the market. Several companies now have extensive experience of the market. Once you have worked out what you want, try to invest in a scheme which provides it. BES companies tend to sell out in an unseemly rush, but the heavy supply provided by the UK's housing market should ensure that all those for whom the BES is an appropriate investment can find an adequate scheme.</p>

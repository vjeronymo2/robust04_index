			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLACIER TRIPS, BOAT RIDES  </P> <P> Glacier basics: With the exception of the Glacier Bay cruises, you can schedule  most glacier trips and boat rides while in Alaska.  </P> <P> Unless you want full-scale cruise ship amenities with loungers on deck, look  for companies offering more maneuverable "yacht-sized" boats. This is one  situation in which there is no point to looking for off-the-beaten-track  companies. Most tours end by Sept. 30.  </P> <P> For more information: Brochures are readily available from travel agents and  Alaska tourism centers: Alaska State Division of Tourism, Box E-101, Juneau,  Alaska 99811, (907) 465-2010, or the Anchorage Visitor Information Center, 546  W. Fourth Ave., Anchorage, Alaska 99501, (907) 274-3531. Laurie Becklund  </P></p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Banks active Banks' traders were yesterday examining the implications for the sector, and the market, of the potential merger between SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley of the US. Some analysts were pointing out that the initial implications of the Warburg situation were discouraging for the sector. BZW's Mr Philip Gibbs said the sketchy details implied the UK's leading merchant bank would be prepared to surrender control at no premium to net asset value. That would suggest a share price of below 700p. However, he acknowledged that the share movement was assuming some form of rival interest. The market sees the situation as little more than an opening gambit and most believe that even Pounds 10 a share would be a low price to pay for Warburg. Yesterday, the soggy market and a bout of profit taking saw the shares, up 47 at best, close 8 lower at 783p. Schroders also dipped back 25 to 1435p. Kleinwort Benson and Smith New Court, however, were still attracting bid premium. The former closed 15 higher at 537p while the latter ended the day 24 up at 420p. Retail group Great Universal Stores stood out in a poor market and a retail sector beset by worries of reduced Christmas trading. The shares advanced 9 to 503p, on turnover of 3m as the market continued to celebrate Thursday's surprise Pounds 300m special dividend. A clutch of brokers' recommendations boosted sentiment and analysts also said the group had the lowest exposure to the retail market of all the stocks in the sector. Doom and gloom continued to overhang the rest of the retail stocks. Kingfisher tumbled 11 to 416p, in busy trade of 5.4m shares as Smith New Court joined the long list of brokers downgrading profit expectations. Smith reduced current year profit expectations by Pounds 20m to Pounds 310m, and reduced the following year's figure by Pounds 25m to 340m. Boots continued to slide and gave up another 15 to 464p, as it quashed market rumours suggesting 4 of the Do it All stores, jointly owned with WH Smith, had been sold. Smith hardened 2 to 429p. Bid speculation, together with hopes for a good set of interim figures on Monday, saw Northern Electricity advance 13 to 881p though political worries continued to cast a shadow over several stocks among the utilities. East Midlands relinquished 12 to 711p, and among water stocks Severn Trent gave up 16 to 502p. Satellite television group BSkyB lost most of the premium achieved at its unofficial debut on Thursday and closed 8 lower at 260 1/2 with 11.7m shares dealt. Britannic Assurance jumped 8 to 408p as Hoare Govett told clients the shares were cheap against fundamentals and 10 per cent dividend growth could support a share price that was some 25 per cent higher. Legal &amp; General firmed a penny to 429p as some analysts started to calculate the disparity between net asset value and the underlying share price. One said: 'Regardless of difficult trading conditions it is offering value.' Worries over margins at Unigate saw the shares slump 10 to 319p. A buy recommendation lifted Hillsdown and the shares closed 3 ahead at 173p. Fare war fears among US airlines after fourth-quarter profit warnings from Continental and Southwest Airlines washed over on to British Airways, pushing the shares down 10 to 351p in 3.6m turnover. Thanks to a no-frills, low-cost strategy, Southwest is one of the more profitable US airlines. In contrast, USAir, in which BA has a 25 per cent stake, is a lossmaker and widely believed in danger of being forced out of business. BA has underperformed the market by 3 per cent in the past three months, partly on worries about heavy provisions against its Dollars 400m investment in USAir. Electronic giant GEC dipped 4 1/2 to 270 1/2 p after the interim results warn of a more even profits distribution between the two halves of this year plus the prospect of an early return to pension fund contributions. Up 5 per cent at Pounds 378m, the six-month profits were broadly in line with market expectations but the pragmatic tone of the group's statement led some securities houses to shade full-year estimates. Turnover in the shares was relatively modest at 3.9m. Racal clawed back 7 of Thursday's interim results-led decline of 13, rising to 210p in 1.5m trades. Car parts group Lucas ended 7 lower at 195p in 3.6m turnover after a placing of 29m news shares at 193p aimed at financing a recent US acquisition. The new shares (a 4 per cent addition to the group's equity base) went through smoothly, helped by Lucas's recent outperformance. The shares have risen 12 per cent relative to the market during the past three months. A number of housebuilders were actively traded by the recent standards of volume in the construction sector, with both Barratt and Bryant tumbling sharply in turnover of more than 1m shares. This week's interest rate increase was seen as the catalyst for the selloffs, with Barratt falling 7 1/2 to 151p in 1.2m trades and Bryant easing 7 to 122p in turnover of 1.1m.</p>

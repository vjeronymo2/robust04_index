Doe  resigns, rebel observers said. The leader of the government delegation,  however, said he expects a settlement. "We have come to make peace, and that is  going to happen," Information Minister J. Emmanuel Bowier said. Meanwhile, the  government said it captured 79 rebels at the Firestone rubber plantation.  </P></p>

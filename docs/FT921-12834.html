			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market closes well below best levels THE UK equity market managed to stay in positive territory throughout a busy trading session but was looking decidedly ragged towards the close of trading ahead of a dreadful set of figures from Lonrho, one of the Footsie constituents - announced, most unusually, after the close of the market. Also upsetting the market's equilibrium at the close of business in London was a deterioration in sentiment on Wall Street, which was looking decidedly unhappy after a relatively steady opening. Closing well below its best levels, the FT-SE 100-share index settled a net 3.3 higher at 2,525.3. At its highest yesterday, the index was some 15.2 points ahead at 2,537.2. Its lowest point came in mid-afternoon when it dropped to show an overall gain of just 0.6 at 2,536.5. Turnover yesterday reached 573.4m shares, and was substantially boosted by a substantial placing of stock in Burton, the retailing group, by Cazenove, the stockbroker. Trading in London yesterday started with marketmakers pushing prices higher in response to a good rally on Wall Street overnight - after two negative sessions - and a solid showing by Tokyo. The market's mood quickly shifted, however, with ICI shares tumbling and dragging many stocks with it. Some dealers mistakenly picked up hints that Hanson was about to unload the 2.8 per cent stake in ICI it acquired in the early part of last year. It later transpired that the weakness in ICI had been triggered by two leading UK brokers issuing a bearish circulars on the company. Fisons, another of the big drug companies, dropped sharply after a broker's profits downgrade and accompanying sell recommendation. Activity from mid-session onwards tended to fade away, special situations apart, and dealers reported a generally disappointing level of business. 'The market hasn't performed as well as some people had expected, and there has been stock coming in with every bounce,' said one senior trader. He also mentioned selling connected with the end of the two-week trading account. In its latest Equity Strategy note Kleinwort Benson, the UK investment bank, adopted a cautious line on the market: 'We are not expecting a major run in the next week or so; there are too many uncertainties for that.' Kleinwort did say, however, that it would be a net buyer of UK equities at current levels, concentrating on the strongest cyclicals and US-exposed companies. County NatWest, meanwhile, said it saw no reason to change its view that the Footsie will make little progress short term. Mr Bob Semple, County's equity strategist, said the March 10 budget, 'will provide the basis for a Tory manifesto promising jam tomorrow but, before then, investors will have to struggle through a results season in which maintained or cut dividends will be a feature.' The troubled British Aerospace group surged higher as the market responded to whispers that the UK's GEC or possibly General Electric of the US may be taking a hard look at the company with a view to buying a significant stake. Lonrho shares dived after-hours, and were quoted a good 40p below the official closing level after the poor results. Dealers expect some heavy action in Lonrho when market opens this morning.</p>

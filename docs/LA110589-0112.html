			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE HUMAN RIGHTS ORDINANCE IN IRVINE  </P> <P> Amid all the hateful rhetoric about the Human Rights Ordinance, one fact seems  to have been obscured: This ordinance has been in place for more than a year.  None of the terrifying things the Irvine Values Coalition predicted has  happened. We do not have quotas for any group listed in the ordinance; we have  not had huge numbers of gays move to Irvine; we have not changed any laws  regarding public or consensual sexual activities. Just like the state of  Wisconsin and numerous cities throughout the nation, all we have done is to  state clearly that we will not tolerate discrimination in housing or the  workplace.  </P> <P> It appears that since the facts will not support its position, the Irvine  Values Coalition has resorted to evoking every possible fear in order to tear  apart the Human Rights Ordinance. This is contrary to a Scripture passage that  they seem to have forgotten: "Perfect love casts out fear." I encourage the  citizens of Irvine to embrace love and tolerance and to reject the tactics of  fear and hatred.  </P> <P> The ordinance is in effect now. It protects all people and is a symbol of what  we want Irvine to be: a tolerant, loving community that will not stand for  hatred. Keep the symbol alive. Vote no on Measure N.  </P> <P> DAVID HOOVER  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

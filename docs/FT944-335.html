			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Topdanmark changes articles of association Topdanmark, the Danish insurance group, has resolved a serious debt refinancing problem after changing its articles of association to give shareholders greater influence, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The group must repay debts totalling about DKr1.5bn (Dollars 242m) in 1995. Attempts earlier this year to solve the financing problems were blocked by Danish shareholders, who said they would not subscribe to a new share issue until a system of one vote per shareholder was changed to one vote per share held. The voting change means large shareholders have agreed to support a DKr175m share issue next year, Topdanmark said. The two biggest shareholders are Eureko BV (an alliance between insurance companies in Sweden, the Netherlands, Portugal, the UK and Denmark) with 30 per cent, and Tryg, the Danish insurer, with 19 per cent. The group is also in the process of completing arrangements to raise a new DKr800m loan, while Top Insurance will pay a dividend of DKr300m to Topdanmark, the group holding company, for 1994.</p>

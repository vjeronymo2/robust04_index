			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Costa Rica earthquake kills 74 AT least 74 people have been killed and over 800 injured in an earthquake which shook the Caribbean coasts of Costa Rica and Panama on Monday evening. Rescuers were yesterday struggling to free more victims trapped under rubble. The epicentre of the tremor, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, was 40km south-east of the Costa Rican banana-exporting port of Puerto Limon. Banana production is the main economic activity in the region and is thought to have been badly disrupted. Scores of buildings in Puerto Limon were destroyed, and fires broke out at the state-run oil refinery close to the port. Communications have been disrupted, as have water and sewage systems. Tidal waves hit the islands around Bocas del Toro in Panama. The Panama-based Union Of Banana Exporting Countries (UPEB) said: 'We know there has been serious damage to the roads and infrastructure, but we do not yet know the full extent of the damage to the plantations.' The main producers in the region, United Brands, Standard Fruit and Del Monte, all have plantations in the earthquake zone.</p>

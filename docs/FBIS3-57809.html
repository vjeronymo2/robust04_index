			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on 31 </F> December; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] Good evening and a happy New Year to everyone. In  this encounter, which has become traditional for the head of  state, who has the honor, the honor to pass his greetings on to  the citizens, best wishes to everyone, to each person. Best  wishes to those who are citizens of Italy in their homeland, and  to those who live abroad, to those immigrants who are in this  country for work, in particular to immigrants, hoping that they  come to regard Italy as their second homeland and that they  forget certain uncivil episodes. The Italian people are all  hospitable. Best wishes to those who are guests for reasons of  study or work, or are passing through, and are starting 1994  with us. Happy New Year to everyone and happy New Year to Italy.    A year has gone by. It seemed almost impossible: the  precarious political situation, the explosion that has already  started and is increasing with regard to the penal emergency,  with the widespread involvement of the political and  economic-financial area. Then, [a year ago] in this room, I was  holding meetings so that the first government could be formed.  At that time, economic reality was delicate, not to say  serious, with heavy repercussions for employment, and the  instability of the currency, which had already been devalued,  and the incredible succession of ministers resigning -- seven --  with immediate replacements and sometimes repeated, and above  all the face of Italy before Europe and the rest of the world.  There were many worries, perhaps even fears. How difficult it  was to find a glimmer of optimism anywhere. How difficult it  was to try to find hope.    Then there were the bombs, almost to prevent us from hoping.  I found myself thinking of the spes desperantium, the hope of  the desperate. I was interior minister when I went on a visit  to Yugoslavia to sign anti-terrorist agreements. My guide was a  professor who set great store in showing me that he had nothing  to do with the regime, Tito had already been dead for some time.  Suddenly he said, come with me, and took me into a church,  leading me up to a beautiful sculpture of the Madonna, but above  all he pointed out to me what was written underneath: Spes  desperantium, the hope of the desperate, of those who cannot  find hope. Many times I thought of this: The bombs in  Florence, Milan, Rome, and the victims, and the desperation of  relatives and work colleagues, and the terror. It was almost  like an anxious expectation of further violence, and people had  one inexpressible or unexpressed question: Who wants to  destabilize, who wants to destroy the strong spirit of this, our  people, who and why? The judges at work with the judicial  police, were involved without respite in a search for the  motives and the guilty, to restore security to citizens, so that  citizens could feel safe. Sufficient thanks will never be said  to those who carry out this work.    Yet the year has ended, with the efforts of parliament, and  what efforts, and of the Constitutional Court and of the  magistrature, with the initiatives of the Amato and the Ciampi  governments. Allow me for a moment to remember: It was my  responsibility and honor to ask Giuliano Amato last year and  Carlo Azeglio Ciampi eight months ago to form and lead a  government. In the first instance, the political moment was  very delicate, and the second was devoid of every valid  indication from parliament, when I telephoned Prime Minister  Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the then governor of the Bank of Italy,  and I said to him: Governor, be prepared. These were choices,  which among other things have done much to markedly increase  Italy's standing, and not only in Europe.    There were the unstinting efforts of the forces of order and  of the Armed Forces both inside and outside Italy, even in far  off places, to serve peace efforts. There were the efforts of  the public administration. How disappointed I am when I hear  someone condemning the whole public administration for being  useless, badly prepared, and inefficient. Why must we speak  destructively, without thinking of how many people known to each  one of us give their lives to their work. With the efforts of  many, very many private sector operatives, the year has ended.    Our currency has been strengthened. The economy is showing  signs of recovery. The fight against crime has known great  successes. The year has ended because of the strength of  Italians. The year has ended because of the courage and the  active patience of Italians. Think of the admirable rebuilding  and the perfect restoration in Florence. Think of the calm  firmness of the Milanese, of the immediate recovery of Rome,  whose art and faith had been wounded, and of the ever-present  volunteers who are versatile and untiring, and of the admirable  fire fighters who were present everywhere. Over all of this  ruled the determination of those in charge of fine arts, to  stubbornly restore everything to the way they were, as though  nothing had happened. This is the Italian miracle that repeats  itself from time to time.    Many people fought and hoped for this tiring recovery in  every field. Many people paid, even with their lives.  Recently, many people have fallen in the world of work. Many  people have paid with their health. Who could ever forget those  of us who have died for peace and solidarity, right up to the  latest, innocent, and very young Red Cross volunteer whose  generosity was only surpassed by her desire for privacy. What a  vocation and what an example. Many people have prayed in  Catholic churches, in all the other Christian churches, in  synagogues, and in mosques. Many people have hoped, believed,  and acted, spurred on only by an invincible and admirable faith  in man. The year has ended.    Some observations are of comfort. The first is that  Italians, we Italians, have a great love for this our homeland,  and we are ready to pay the price for its rebirth. The year  that is about to end has brought much evidence of this, a great  deal of evidence. Furthermore, I want to say it again, the  certainty that democracy has largely entered the veins of  Italians and has become the life of this our people. Thus it is  a strong and conscious guarantee against every possible folly.  While the world is still bloodied from wars and crimes, by  merchants of death, drugs, and arms, whose only concern is  wealth at all costs, the European and international communities  have acknowledged our strong will to recover and are increasing  faith in our future.    A year is beginning that can and must be decisive for our  recovery. The whole world is watching us and is expecting  composure and wisdom from us in the upcoming general election,  so that in each one of our choices, in the differences in the  way we think and plan, we can place the good of Italy above all  else. The world is watching us because it knows that Italy's  presence is before all else essential for peace, for peace in  the world, how important its presence is for Europe, which has  been and always remains our primary political future, aiming  with a strong will at a substantial and efficient political  community. Italy's presence is essential for the peoples who,  after the winter of the Soviet dictatorship, with their  fledgling democracy are moving toward collaboration and their  desired participation in the community of the free world. The  world is watching us and is confident that Italy's role and  responsibility in the Mediterranean and for peace in former  Yugoslavia and the Middle East is being carried out.    In the last few days, two lights have been lit for the hopes  of peace, following a great deal of work: The meeting between  Israel and the Palestinians, and the relations between the  Vatican and Israel. This is a great page of new life in the  history of thousands of years. It is an exceptional testimony  to peace, in this church of John Paul II's, to whom our  heartfelt thanks go.    For this New Year the Italian people want one thing above  all  else: That a new leaf is turned. This was expressed  unequivocally in the April referendum, they want a new leaf to  be turned over a past of abuses, illegal behavior in public and  economic life, without ever throwing away all that which is  vital and essential for the freedom of the Italian people, all  that is constructive and has been used from the Liberation to  today. We must make sure that we never forget all those who  have saved the life and freedom of man in our homeland. The  first new page is opening. No one can deny the courage that was  involved in the unveiling of the wounds and in the desire for  justice and transparency. There must continue to be courage and  willpower until this chapter is closed, with the pronouncement  of the responsibility of the guilty and of the innocence of  those who are found to be without guilt, with the recognition of  the delicate and essential work being carried out by the  magistrature. Citizens must also rediscover a constant  serenity, must not be fearful but must have faith in justice,  citizens must be at peace, whether they be accused or injured  parties. Justice must be defended from a kind of politics that  seems to want to contaminate it or exploit it, it must be  defended from those who only grasp its spectacular aspect, and  justice must be freed from those who have had -- it hurts to say  this -- moments that were not peaceful as a result of the  contagious desire for the guillotine or the pillory. As far as  justice is concerned, these are two evil manifestations.  Justice has the right to be universally respected and believed.  We have a great need for calm and serenity, so that political  life and economic activity can regain their indispensable  efficiency and normal way of working. This goes for all of us.    Here is the second important page: The reforms. It is  necessary that everything that has been elaborated since the  very first parliamentary debates at the bicameral committee of  this legislature, rather than being lost contributes to study  and experience, so that the new parliament can make our  Constitution better able to answer the more pressing needs of  our people. We must not lose sight of those ideas that are real  and alive, which will not die if those who say that they believe  in them, instead of exploiting them, serve them with humility  and disinterest. We must put into effect the great humanitarian  principles that endure our personal limitations and give us the  certainty that many dishonest people will never trample over  those who are not dishonest and do not want to be. We must all  work to rediscover and restore the richness of ideas, values,  and history of our homeland. We will then see the strength and  vitality of this immense richness and how it is greater than our  poverty and our failings. I place my optimism, my stubborn  optimism, in this and only this: It is in the existence of this  cultural and spiritual richness, it is in the firm conviction  that with everyone's goodwill, and the sacrifices of each one of  us, every obstacle will certainly be overcome.    Then there is the social page, which is important, of  complete importance for a state that is truly fit for man. We  need the human issue of work to reduce and cancel the wounds of  unemployment and the tremendous fears connected with  uncertainties about one's job. It is an issue of civilization  and is not an issue that disappears easily, especially when  faced with a marked world crisis that is also hitting  economically strong countries, and which requires above all,  that it is truly believed that the respect of the right to work  is the first sign of a people's civilization. Here we must  acknowledge that the government and parliament have already made  significant efforts. But we are fully aware of the issue, the  issue worries us: The issue must not and cannot leave us in  peace. When we have done or think that we have truly done all  that is possible, let us think: Of course, we can do more if we  believe in the rights of man.    At this point we come across the always burning issue of  youth, school, and a first job. These issues are connected,  which means that space must be given to the voice of the young,  or rather the young are responsible protagonists. Without  including parties, it is easier to stray into speculation or to  make it suspected than to give advice and valid help. I have  met and spoken to thousands of young people, even while  president of the republic, and I am convinced that dialogue is  the serious, useful, and valid way. I know that many times it  has been held. It is necessary to make young people  responsible. It is useless to discuss whether we can trust them  to drive a car at 16 if no serious thought is given to their  cultural and human formation, which can prepare them for more  essential and important responsibilities in life. We ask the  young to have faith in ideals and human values, we ask them for  the enthusiasm to overcome many problems, we ask them to be  generous toward those who are less intellectually gifted, are  less physically or materially able. We ask them for solidarity  for those who need it and for those who are suffering, and this  is right. But we must give young people opportunities to live.  We must give them motivation and possibilities to plan their  futures. We must never take away their hope. But first and  foremost we want to provide young people with our example, which  we have lived and paid for, of hard work, honesty, and  sacrifice, of faith in essential values. This is our most  important duty, of each one of us, mine first and foremost.  Once again I want to say: Young people, never surrender, do  not think that it is easy to tell you this when we know the  difficulties that you must overcome. Never let yourselves be  pessimists, even when faced with tiring and unfair situations,  do not be pessimists. You educators, have faith that the daily  provision of your life to young people will never be lost,  never. Happy New Year to young people.    Happy New Year to happy children, and above all to those who  are not, and perhaps will never be. Happy New Year to the  parents that live with them, and happy New Year to all those who  sacrifice themselves specially for these unhappy children,  without being parents. Happy New Year to old people, to those  old people who think that they are a burden and an encumbrance  because they do not have anyone able to make themselves rich  with their experience. Happy New Year to everyone: To happy  families and to ones that are suffering, because the family is  the heart of a people's life. Happy New Year to people who are  alone in the hope that someone realizes that they are alone, to  those in hospital, in prison, to those who watch over the  suffering and prisoners, to those who hope for health -- and we  hope that it can be recovered quickly, and to those who hope for  freedom, because once justice has been suspended the target of  freedom is not reachable, it would not be human. Happy New Year  to those who feel marginalized, in the hope that they experience  the gift and warmth of community. Italy needs solidarity and  fraternity, a little more love, but also a great need to know  how to give solidarity, fraternity and love, only those who know  how to give it are truly capable of human sensitivity.    Unfortunately we are faced with a serious evil that is  trying  to tear and destroy our tissue of human society. It is the  terrible climate of suspicion, the climate of insinuation, of  making people feel bad, of the evil that is insinuated: The  worst problem in the life of a people. This is the typical evil  of dictatorships, which should not exist in a free and  democratic country because dictatorships have always been made  stronger by these evils that divide people of every human faith,  dictatorships have depended on fear, not only of the dictator,  but the fear that suddenly appears between men and breaks every  link and creates the constant anguish of not knowing what will  happen tomorrow. There is a great thirst for truth and loyalty,  for cleanliness, reciprocal respect, there is a thirst for  humanity. The Italian people have a great wealth of this. It  is the thirst of a humanity that replaces and sweeps away  forever the climate of cohabitation, omerta [Mafia code of  silence], lies, craftiness. Let us relieve ourselves of these  evils that have caused and will cause much damage to our  community.    Before ending, let us look for a moment at how many good  people there are: Everyone of you will know some of the many  people who are satisfied with their lot, who have many  difficulties to overcome and face them calmly, without  complaining, many sick people -- I know many, many write to me  -- ill people without hope who spread hope and even joy, because  hope and joy is inside us. It can be helped by events, episodes  and meetings outside, but it is inside us. Many people who lack  all solidarity are always ready to give it to others. Many  people are devoted to this need without anyone ever thanking  them. Not many evenings ago I went to speak to a caravan [as  heard] where ex-drug addicts spend much of the night near the  Rome railway station waiting in case some others suffering from  the same evil problem need them. The team's doctor is the only  one who is not a former addict. The others think of nothing  except the giving of themselves. Many people are devoted in  this way: Hidden unknown heroes, of solidarity and love, which  is the richest and most human kind of heroism. Unfortunately,  we all share this vocation. [sentence as heard] It is the  heroism that holds its doors open to each one of us. Each one  of us can walk down that path.    To the people, and they are many, who this year have been  an example to me and my life, to those who have given me a gift  of comfort, help, prayers and support, I offer a big heartfelt  thank you. Everyone reminds us that we are at a delicate and  dangerous crossroads and it is true, but beware, for we are not  being asked to do anything, absolutely anything that is  exceptional, nothing heroic. Let us not assume heroic tones.  We are only being asked to do our duty well, absolutely nothing  else. We are not being asked to save our homeland, but to serve  our homeland, yes, and with love. If we do this, one day,  turning back, we will see that the crossroads has been passed.  The important thing is that the whole Italian population passes  it on foot, everyone, and that everyone wants to and can walk  together. It depends on all of us. It depends on all of us, to  walk and help those who cannot, to walk because the whole  population must walk.    Last year I said that Italy would rise again, and it was a  wish from my heart. Now I feel able to say that Italy is rising  again: and so, best wishes to Italy.</p>

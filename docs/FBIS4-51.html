			<p>In      the wake of the Hebron massacre and the resultant disruption  to the Arab-Israeli peace talks, the Russians launched a carefully  orchestrated diplomatic blitz with the apparent goals both of  getting Israel and the PLO to continue their negotiations and of  restoring Russia's role as a major player in Middle Eastern and  international diplomacy.  A pair of high-level foreign ministry  officials and a presidential representative shuttled to Israel and  Tunisia to bring the parties back together. Fully supporting the  PLO's request for an international presence to protect Palestinians  in the occupied territories, the Russians pressed hard for a UN  resolution, eventually adopted, condemning the massacre and calling  for an international presence.  Additionally, seeking in large part  to increase Russia's role in Middle Eastern diplomacy, the Moscow  envoys proposed convening of a second international conference in  Madrid to discuss new directions in the peace process.      After the violent murders of reportedly more than 50 Palestinians  worshipping in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque by Israeli settler Dr. Barukh  Goldstein on 25 February, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev,  First Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, and presidential envoy  Viktor Posuvalyuk were dispatched on shuttle diplomacy missions to  the Middle East at--it was pointedly noted in each case--President  Boris Yeltsin's instructions.      In announcing Ivanov's dispatch to the Middle East, the Foreign  Ministry declared Russia's support for measures to ensure the  security of Palestinians in the territories, and, in a major  initiative, called for a renewal of the Madrid conference to get the  peace process back on track.  Radio Rossii broadcast a Foreign  Ministry statement reporting that Ivanov had been sent to the Middle  East to meet with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli leaders "at  the personal instruction of the President of the Russian Federation"  and that "Russia believes it necessary for the UN Security Council  to adopt an effective resolution with a view to ensuring security on  the occupied territories.  The idea of international protection for  the civilian population on the occupied territories deserves most  serious attention."  The statement also proclaimed that "a new  international impetus is needed for the cause of reconciliation  between Arabs and Israelis to proceed further.  A second plenary  meeting of the Madrid conference on the Middle East at the foreign  minister level could be this impetus" (Moscow Radio Rossii Network  in Russian 1100 GMT 2 Mar 94).  Russian media reported that Ivanov  delivered a personal message to 'Arafat from Yeltsin who expressed  "Russia's firm intention to promote the attainment of comprehensive  peace and security in the Middle East in every way."  Upon his  return, Ivanov reported that the issues of ensuring the safety of  the Palestinian population in the occupied territories, the PLO  proposal to send international observers to the territories, and the  holding of a second Madrid conference on Middle East peace at the  foreign minister level were discussed "during intensive talks in  both Tunisia and Israel" (Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0921 GMT 6 Mar  94).      Kozyrev Mission      Although Ivanov was the first diplomat to engage in shuttle  diplomacy, Kozyrev reported on 1 March that "at the president's  instructions" he made contact with 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres and asserted that both the PLO and Israel had  requested active Russian participation to get the negotiations back  on track.  Kozyrev stated that "the important thing is to provide  for both sides a maximum political, and if necessary, material  assistance, if you like, so that they can not only rescue the peace  process but could also move onwards after this shock, this tragedy.  This is because we want peace to prevail in the Middle East, and we  cannot allow a bandit, or even a group of bandits, to disrupt this  process."  Kozyrev observed that while Russia is not repudiating  cooperation with the United States, its co-sponsor in the Middle  East peace process, "it is clear that without an active Russian  participation--both 'Arafat and the Israeli leaders have asked for  that--this process cannot be saved" (Moscow Ostankino Television  First Channel Network in Russian 2015 GMT 1 Mar 94).      Kozyrev left for Israel and Tunisia on 11 March, bearing "a  personal message from the Russian president on the problems of  ensuring a lasting peace in the region" (Moscow ITAR-TASS in English  1217 GMT 10 Mar 94).  In a conversation with ITAR-TASS correspondent  Aleksandr Zhudro, Kozyrev expressed satisfaction with his discussion  with Israeli leaders and observed that "Russia is making unorthodox  efforts for the sake of saving the peace process in this region."  After the Hebron incident, Kozyrev said "it was necessary to take  extraordinary measures for saving the agreements reached between  Israel and the PLO earlier.  This visit, which is aimed at  persuading the Israelis and the Palestinians to return to the  negotiations table, was one of such measures" (Moscow ITAR-TASS  World Service in Russian 1740 GMT 11 Mar 94).      While in Tunis, Kozyrev indicated strong Russian support for the  PLO's position and optimistically predicted that talks would  promptly resume if the UN approved the resolution condemning the  massacre and providing for international protection.  Kozyrev  reported on 12 March that 'Arafat "confirmed the PLO's firm  adherence to the peace process" and expressed PLO commitment to  resume talks with Israel, contingent upon the adoption of the UNSC  Hebron resolution condemning the murders and calling for  international protection in the occupied territories.  Kozyrev  commented that "the decision of the Palestinian side demanded great  political courage on the part of the PLO and of Yasir 'Arafat  personally" (Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 0640 GMT 12  Mar 94).  In a 12 March statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry  reiterated Kozyrev's observation about 'Arafat and welcomed the PLO  decision to resume negotiations.  In reference to the UNSC draft  resolution on Hebron, the statement made an appeal "to all sides to  make the necessary efforts to have this resolution urgently approved  by the Security Council.  This step would clear the way for a prompt  resumption of talks aimed at concluding an agreement on Gaza and  Jericho, and on other issues on the basis of the Declaration of  Principles" (Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 1518 GMT 12  Mar 94).      Posuvalyuk Mission      Posuvalyuk, Yeltsin's special representative and director of the  Russian Foreign Ministry's Near East and North Africa Department,  began his  diplomacy mission on 7 March even before Kozyrev's  arrival and remained after his departure.  Posuvalyuk had a number  of meetings with 'Arafat in Tunis and reportedly delivered "an  important message from Moscow addressed to the PLO leader and  related to Russo-Palestinian consultations held in connection with  the aggravation of the situation in the Middle East following the  al-Khalil (Hebron) massacre" (Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0857 GMT  14 Mar 94).      Implying that Russian diplomacy was playing a central role in  resolving the crisis, Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin  reported that the PLO-Israeli agreement on continuing peace talks  and a final agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho had been  formulated during Posuvalyuk's contacts "with the PLO leadership,  the Israeli delegation, and U.S. and Norwegian high-ranking  diplomats in Tunis."  Karasin stated that Posuvalyuk conveyed a  personal message from Kozyrev to 'Arafat calling for the renewal of  peace talks and confirming Russia's intention to assist in the  implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 904, which was  approved on 18 March (Moscow INTERFAX in English 1739 GMT 22 Mar  94).      Results and Prospects      A 19 March Foreign Ministry statement hailed the adoption of UNSC  Resolution 904 and the potential for successful continuation of the  talks, attributing the success in large part to Russia's concerted  diplomatic efforts:  "The initiating steps taken by the Russian co-  sponsor--personal address by President Boris Yeltsin to the leaders  of Israel and the PLO, a trip by the foreign minister to Israel and  Tunisia, a series of contacts by Russian special representatives in  the region and energetic efforts in the Security Council--not only  facilitated the adoption of an effective resolution, but also laid  the foundation for further progress in the Middle East peace  process" (Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 1343 GMT 19 Mar 94).      Posuvalyuk emphasized that Russia intends to continue playing a  large role in Middle East diplomacy.  He also stressed Russia's  claim to a major role in the Mideast:  "Russia occupies its own  ample niche in the Middle East region, to which, by virtue of its  distinctiveness, primarily historical and spiritual, no one else can  lay claim."  He asserted that Russian diplomacy intends to play "an  essential role" not only in the Middle East, but also in other areas  of international turmoil, increasing its efforts to resolve conflict  situations (Moscow SEGODNYA in Russian 12 Mar 94 p 5).  In an early  April statement he also promised that "the Middle East theme will  continue to dominate our foreign policy" (Moscow ITAR-TASS in  English 1543 GMT 7 Apr 94).      While making clear their desire to reclaim a major role, Russian  officials have at the same time pledged to continue cooperation with  the United States.  The 12 March Foreign Ministry statement  expressed such intent:  "Russia will continue to coordinate its own  efforts with all interested parties.  We attach special importance  to close interaction with the United States, which along with  Russia, is a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process."  In the 7  April ITAR-TASS report, Posuvalyuk denied that the peace process  "has acquired some element of competitiveness with the United  States."  Although he admitted to "disruptions" in the co-sponsors'  work on the peace process, he noted that "they were not caused by  malicious intent on either side" and that both participants "must  act extremely carefully while looking for ways of reaching peace  between Arabs and Israelis."  Acknowledging that the United States  and Russia pursue their separate interests in the region, Posuvalyuk  commented that "this should not affect their efforts to help restore  peace in the Middle East" and noted that future consultations  between Russian and American officials in Washington are intended  "to attain a greater degree of coordination in their joint work."     Madrid Revisited      Revival of the Madrid Conference forum is apparently one of  Moscow's strategies for enlarging its role in regional diplomacy.  Ivanov, who first raised the idea during his shuttle mission, said  that 'Arafat was immediately supportive, but Israeli Foreign  Minister Peres and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Thomas Pickering were  not.  Peres and Pickering, he said, had to be persuaded that  "Moscow's initiative does not mean giving up the achievements and  formulas agreed upon at the Madrid Conference in October 1991, but  is an attempt to find a new approach to Middle East realities which  have changed in the past two years" (Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 11  Mar 94 p 3).  Admitting that the U.S. and Israeli initial reactions  to the conference proposal were "cool," Ivanov emphasized that  Russia sought to establish new objectives for ensuring continuance  of the peace process.  "We are confident that the present  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are close to completion and that we  need to be thinking even  today about the future.  Stage one has  been negotiated, and definite experience--both negative and  positive--has been accumulated.  We now need to meet and think about  how to further advance the peace process in all directions," said  Ivanov (Moscow MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI in Russian No 10, 6-13 Mar 94 p  5A).      Other Russian Foreign Ministry officials nevertheless  subsequently played down the proposal for a "Madrid-2," suggesting  that convening the conference is a long-term rather than immediate  goal.  After his Vladivostok meeting with U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher, Kozyrev appeared to reduce Russian emphasis on  the initiative, stating that "Russia is no longer insisting on the  immediate holding of a second international conference on the Middle  East," and that "the most important thing now was to complete work  on the implementation of the agreement on Gaza and Jericho" (Moscow  Radiostantsiya Moskvy in Russian 1605 GMT 14 Mar 94).  However, it  appears likely that the issue may resurface in the future, since  Viktor Gogitidze, deputy director of the MFA's Near East and North  Africa Department, stated that "Russia's call for holding another  international conference on the Middle East in Madrid remains in  force."  Gogitidze asserted:  "This is a long-term proposal.  The  first stage of the peace process is almost concluded.  It is  necessary to pass to the second stage, since, in addition to 'the  Palestinian direction,' there are the 'Jordanian,' 'Syrian,' and  other ones.  There is a need to work in all these directions, and  the Madrid-2 conference could play a positive role in this" (Moscow  INTERFAX in English 1559 GMT 16 Mar 94).   (AUTHOR:  KENSKI.

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Unexpected shortfall at Data General DATA GENERAL, the US minicomputer manufacturer, reported unexpected losses for the second quarter as its struggle to achieve sustained profitability faltered, despite increased sales of its new open systems products. Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 7.6m, or 22 cents per share, compared with losses of Dollars 55.3m, or Dollars 1.69 per share, in the same period last year when the company took a restructuring charge of Dollars 48m. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 267.4m, compared with Dollars 273.8m. The company said that without the unfavourable impact of foreign exchange rate changes, revenue would have been slightly higher than last year. 'We are not satisfied with the overall results, primarily in the revenue area,' said Mr Ronald Skates, president and chief executive, 'but we are encouraged by the continued success of our open systems computers.' Data General is in the midst of a transition from its traditional proprietary minicomputer products to open systems based upon industry standards. Revenues for these open systems showed significant growth in the quarter, Mr Skates said. Wall Street analysts had been expecting Data General to report profits of around 4 cents per share. The company's stock closed at Dollars 9 1/2 in New York yesterday, down from Tuesday's close of Dollars 10 1/4 . For the first six months of fiscal 1993, the company reported a net loss of Dollars 6.8m, or 20 cents per share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 51.3m, or Dollars 1.58 per share, including the restructuring charge. Revenues for the first half were Dollars 547.1m, down from Dollars 568.6m in the same period last year. 'We are confident that our open-systems strategy is in line with the needs of the marketplace,' said Mr Skates. 'However, we continue to be very cautious for the short-term in light of the continuing weak worldwide economy and because we see no evidence that industry-wide pricing pressures will abate in the near future.'</p>

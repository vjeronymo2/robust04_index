			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["r"-signed report: "In May, 52 Percent of Citizens Would </F> Definitely Participate in Elections"]    [Text] Bratislava -- Questions ascertaining citizens'  interest in participating in elections to the National Council  of the Slovak Republic, as well as their electoral preferences,  were part of a survey conducted by the Slovak Statistical Office  from 2 to 10 May 1994.    The survey's results confirm citizens' unceasingly high  degree of interest in participating in the elections. Three out  of four respondents said that they would definitely or probably  go to the polls. The percentage of voters who are not sure  about their own participation in the elections has stabilized  over the last three months at a level of 6 to 7 percent.  <H5>  Interest of Slovak Republic Citizens in Participating in </H5> Early Parliamentary Elections, If They Were Held Today (in  percent)    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Will definitely take part             |52                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Will probably take part               |26                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Will probably not take part           |9                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Will definitely not take part         |6                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Does not yet know                     |6                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

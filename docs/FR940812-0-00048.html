Safety zones are being established for two events during the weekend: for the tall ships parade on Friday, August 12, 1994, and for the fireworks display the evening of August 13, 1994. These safety zones are needed to promote the safe navigation of vessels in Mount Hope Bay in anticipation of an increased volume of vessel traffic due to spectator craft attending the events. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The safety zone for the tall ships parade will be in effect from 4:45 p.m. until 6:15 p.m. on August 12, 1994, or until each parade vessel is safely moored.

Publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and delaying the events would be contrary to the public interest since the tall ships parade and the fireworks display are important public events which coincide with the Fall River Celebrates America festival. Immediate action is necessary to respond to any potential hazards associated with the conduct of these events.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fall River Celebrates America is a festival held annually in Fall River, MA, which entails several events throughout the entire weekend. This year's celebration will be held August 11&hyph;14, 1994. The regulated events include a parade of tall ships through Mount Hope Bay to the Fall River State Pier and a fireworks display in Mount Hope Bay. The celebration is an important event for the town of Fall River as it draws numerous people to the area for the weekend, increasing tourism and economically benefiting the town.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard is establishing temporary safety zone regulations in Mount Hope Bay for the period August 12&hyph;13, 1994. These safety zones are necessary to control vessel movements during the various events in order to ensure the safety of event participants, spectator craft, and other vessels transiting the waterway. They are necessary in light of the limited size of the affected waterway and the expected number of spectator craft (more that 200 for each event), which will greatly increase the congestion in the waterway and create a larger potential for marine accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chronologically, the events planned for this period relevant to this rule are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Tall ships parade, August 12, 1994. The parade of tall ships provides the kickoff for the Fall River Celebrates America festival. The parade is significant because it allows the public to view the tall ships under sail before they moor in Fall River for the weekend, and is intended to heighten the public interest in the upcoming weekend of events. Approximately six tall ships are expected to participate in the parade. These ships will muster just north of the Mount Hope Bridge and will transit the Mount Hope Bay Channel, from the Mount Hope Bay Junction Lighted Gong Buoy ``MH'' to the Fall River State Pier. The parade is scheduled to take place between 4:45 p.m. and 6:15 p.m. The Coast Guard is establishing a moving safety zone, from 200 yards ahead of the lead vessel in the parade, to 100 yards astern of the last vessel in the parade, and 200 yards abeam of each parading vessel. This safety zone will be in effect for the duration of the parade until each vessel is safely moored. This zone is needed to protect the tall ships, recreational boaters, spectators, and other vessel traffic from the hazards posed by tall ships maneuvering among other vessels in constricted waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of this zone will close the affected portions of Mount Hope Bay to navigation by deep draft vessels while the zone is in effect. Entry into the moving safety zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Providence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Fireworks, August 13, 1994. On the evening of August 13, 1994, Fall River Celebrates America will be sponsoring a fireworks display that will take place in Mount Hope Bay, in the vicinity of Mount Hope Bay Channel Buoy 17. Two fireworks barges will be anchored in approximate positions (41 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;&hyph;42 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;&hyph;42 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;N, 071 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;&hyph;09 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;&hyph;52 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;W) and (41 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;&hyph;42 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;&hyph;38 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;N, 071 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;&hyph;09 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;&hyph;55 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;W), from which the fireworks will be initiated. The fireworks are scheduled to take place between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. The Coast Guard is establishing safety zones in Mount Hope Bay to encompass the area of water within a three hundred (300) yard radius around each fireworks barge. These safety zones will be in effect between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. for the duration of the fireworks display. These safety zones are needed to protect the fireworks barges and attending tugs, spectator craft, and other vessels or personnel in the area, from the hazards associated with explosive laden barges and the display itself. Implementation of these zones will close the affected portion of the Mount Hope Bay Channel to navigation by deep draft vessels while the zones are in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

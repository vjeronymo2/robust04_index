			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ihor Nykorovych report: "A Deputy Minister Heads the </F> Inspection"]    [Text] Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy was  expected to arrive in Ivano-Frankivsk. However, perhaps, in  connection with the beginning of work of the new parliament, his  visit had been postponed, and the team of Ukraine's Ministry of  Defense was headed by Deputy Minister Colonel General Ivan  Bizhan.    On 10 May, two aircraft with the commission on board touched  down at the military airfield in Ivano-Frankivsk. It was met by  Major General Anatoliy Kalashnykov, commander of the formation;  Colonel Mykola Moroz, military commissioner of the oblast;  Zinoviy Shkutyak, first deputy chairman of the Oblast State  Administration; and Yaroslav Taylikh, chairman of the  Ivano-Frankivsk City Council and of the Executive Committee.    "It is an ordinary working trip," pointed out I. Bizhan  answering the journalists' question about the purpose of the  visit.    True, the representatives of the Defense Ministry arrived  here to inspect the troops and check the work of the Oblast  Military Commissariat, following which some of its recruitment  resources may be mobilized. However, after all, such measures  are implemented once every six to 10 years. Besides, it is not  so often that top officials of Ukraine's Defense Ministry visit  our oblast.    An improvised news conference was held at the airfield, and  the deputy defense minister answered the journalists' questions.  In particular, touching upon the situation in the Crimea, I.  Bizhan pointed out that the Crimea is a constituent part of  Ukraine. However, the negotiations on the division of the Black  Sea Fleet in which I. Bizhan has been taking part for two years  proceed with great difficulty.    The colonel general openly stated that he would like to talk  about professional military matters, rather than politics.  However, how can these two be separated? For example,  questions arise on why the Ukrainian Army does not stand up to a  comparison with the Russian Army. It is a matter of material  provision for the armed forces, remuneration of the work of its  officers, and everything that has to do with raising the  prestige of the military service in society.    "You should not forget that the Ukrainian Army is being  created in a blank space," pointed out the general. "Whereas  the Russian Army used the structure of the former Soviet Army.  In Russia, there have remained both the General Staff and the  military academies. Of course, we would like our officers to  get higher salaries. However, we understand that the state  allocates as much funds for the armed forces as it presently  can."    I. Bizhan told the audience that a new program "Serving the  People of Ukraine" will soon be started by the Ukrainian  Television at the initiative of the defense minister in order to  popularize the military service and to acquaint the public with  army problems and daily life.</p>

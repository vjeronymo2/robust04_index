			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Kerkorian ends bid for seat on Chrysler board MYSTERY surrounds yesterday's decision by Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire investor, to withdraw his request for representation on Chrysler's board. The reversal comes less than a week after Mr Kerkorian indicated that he was no longer willing to remain a passive investor in Chrysler. Neither Chrysler nor Mr Kerkorian are revealing enough details to account for Mr Kerkorian's change of heart after his meeting this week with Chrysler executives, including chairman and chief executive Mr Lee Iacocca, his designated successor Mr Robert Eaton, and Mr Malcolm Stamper, chairman of the nominating committee of Chrysler's board. Mr Kerkorian, who holds a 9.8 per cent stake in the car maker, had initially cited concern about Mr Iacocca's future role at Chrysler as his reason for pressing for stronger board representation. Mr Iacocca said in March that he would step down at the end of this year. Mr Kerkorian, a friend of Mr Iacocca's, said the recent discussions had convinced him that the interests of Chrysler's shareholders are well represented by its current board. He added that he was comfortable with Mr Iacocca's plans to continue as a director of Chrysler and chairman of the company's powerful executive committee after the end of the year. Mr Iacocca, for his part, reiterated his confidence in Mr Eaton. 'I expect to remain active in Chrysler's future and plan to continue to serve the best interests of its shareholders,' he added. Mr Iacocca's reluctance to abdicate at Chrysler has been no secret. He has reportedly been unhappy with the company's board since it blocked his attempts to extend his tenure as chairman and chief executive beyond the end of this year. Yesterday's announcement leaves the question of whether this was a storm in a tea cup or whether more was decided during the discussions than either party is willing to reveal.</p>

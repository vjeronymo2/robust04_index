			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Room for geo-centric Germany Sir, Mr Waigel, Germany's Finance Minister, makes some valid points in his Personal View (October 12). But he tries to show Germany is not responsible for high interest rates and slow economic growth by ignoring the linkages between the German economy and the rest of Europe. Economic pressures in one country are transmitted to other countries if their exchange rates are fixed. The exchange rate mechanism eliminated the one way countries could keep their economic policies separate: an adjustment in the exchange rate. If one economically powerful nation, such as Germany, raises interest rates for very domestic considerations, the effect will be felt in other countries, since the exchange rate cannot be changed. Widening the ERM bands to 15 per cent will allow Germany to pursue a more geo-centric policy with much less effect on other countries.

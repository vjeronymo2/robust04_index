			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Government close to retreat on plans for single-tier councils The government is preparing a retreat from its insistence that reform of local government should lead to the virtual abolition of the present two-tier system. Amid growing Tory unrest over plans for a radical reshaping of the local government map by setting up single all-purpose authorities, ministers are considering a more pragmatic approach to the proposals being drawn up by a commission headed by Sir John Banham. The government may decide also not to appeal against a High Court ruling last week which said that Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, had acted unlawfully in calling for the two-tier structure of county and district councils to be abandoned in all but 'exceptional' circumstances. Ministers said that even if an appeal was lodged - and proved successful - the lesson of the past few weeks was that the government would have to take a more flexible approach. When Mr Gummer moved to the environment department last July he proposed privately that the government should slow down local government changes. But Mr John Major, on the advice of the Downing Street policy unit, insisted that the government should press ahead with the drive for unitary authorities. Mr Gummer then gave new guidance to the commission, saying the preservation of the two-tier structure should be 'the exception', stressing he wanted a substantial increase in the number of unitary authorities in urban and rural areas. The present review aims to produce plans for restructuring all non-metropolitan England by the end of this year. But ministers now believe that fierce opposition from many Conservative authorities and concern among Tory MPs will persuade the prime minister that the political costs of radical change are too high.

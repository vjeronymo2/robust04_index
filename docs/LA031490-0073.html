			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 GERMANYS ARE ALREADY LINKED BY POLITICS AS ELECTION NEARS IN EAST;  </P> <P> REUNIFICATION: CAMPAIGN SUPPLIES AND VOLUNTEERS CROSS THE BORDER. WESTERN  PARTIES HAVE A STAKE IN THE OUTCOME.  </P> <P> In the office of the East German political group Democratic Awakening, Ulrich  Bente helps to design and market political ideas as part of the country's first  free election campaign in its 40-year history.  </P> <P> What makes Bente unusual is that he's a West German, a graduate student from  Goettingen University, recruited by a West German businessmen's group to help  Democratic Awakening push its free-market platform.  </P> <P> He is one of thousands of West Germans who have been thrown into a campaign  that has far more to do with the eventual shape of a future united Germany than  with who leads a democratic East Germany.  </P> <P> As an anxious Continent debates the conditions of German reunification, the  present campaign stands as a striking example of just how close the two  Germanys have already become. Five days before polling day, one of the more  popular political statements remains a ubiquitous bumper sticker declaring, "We  Are One People."  </P> <P> On Monday, Ibrahim Boehme, the East German Social Democrat who could become  prime minister, decided that his best media exposure was a news conference in  Bonn. The same day, the deputy leader of West Germany's Social Democrats  campaigned in the East German city of Jena.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the leader of West Germany's Free Democrats, Otto Graff Lambsdorff,  spoke at a public rally north of Berlin, while West German Chancellor Helmut  Kohl addressed an election rally in the mining city of Cottbus, barely 15 miles  from the Polish border, which has triggered such controversy in recent weeks.  </P> <P> Kohl's remarks Tuesday contained a startling change of tone on the issue as he  repeatedly spoke of German respect for all international borders.  </P> <P> "We want Poland to live within secure borders," he said. "That is the wish of  the German people."  </P> <P> Kohl also said he favored a one-for-one exchange rate for East German savings,  bringing the two Germanys into agreement on a crucial question for the merging  of their economies.  </P> <P> "We want savers to know that when the change in the currency comes, it will be  at one to one for them," he told the crowd.  </P> <P> Kohl and other leading West German politicians consistently draw top advance  billing and crowds of up to 100,000. They campaign here because the results are  as important for them as for the East Germans.  </P> <P> Political analysts believe success in East Germany for the sister parties of  either the Social Democrats or Kohl's Christian Democrats could easily  influence West Germany's own elections, scheduled for December.  </P> <P> According to recent opinion polls, East Germany's Social Democrats and the  Alliance for Germany backed by Kohl's Christian Democrats both seem to have 25%  to 35% of voter support, although many voters remain undecided.  </P> <P> Kohl's liberal-right coalition must also negotiate unification with the  winners.  </P> <P> "You will elect those whom we will negotiate (unity) with," Kohl told East  German voters Tuesday.  </P> <P> The power of West German politicians is not just that they know the game of  campaign politics and can play to a political rally so much better than their  long-oppressed East German counterparts. Long years of exposure to millions of  East German television viewers have given them a celebrity status as useful as  that of a movie star in an American campaign.  </P> <P> East Germany's Social Democrats may be one of the leading parties in recent  polls, but voters are hard-pressed to recall anything of significance that  their leader, one-time bricklayer Boehme, has said. What they remember is the  West's Willy Brandt, a former Social Democratic chancellor, in an emotional  appearance on a balcony in Leipzig before a cheering crowd of more than  100,000, or his election as the East German party's honorary chairman.  </P> <P> Kohl and West Germany's Free Democratic foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich  Genscher, who was born in the East German city of Halle, play equally vital  roles for their sister parties in the East.  </P> <P> But West German involvement goes far beyond the candidates.  </P> <P> Mathias Gey, a Free Democrat candidate running in Frankfurt an der Oder, ran  through the list of services provided from West Germany's Free Democrats that  included placards, a big photocopier, paper on which to print news releases and  volunteers.  </P> <P> "It goes down to the smallest possible thing, like the frames for election  posters," noted Martin Lucius, a West German Social Democrat helping in the  East.  </P> <P> The Communists, who have no such Western partner, have produced one poster that  proudly proclaims, "NOT Made in West Germany."  </P> <P> Among the most valuable assets from West German parties is a liberal supply of  young volunteers with cars to carry election material to villages.  </P> <P> Graduate student Bente, for example, helps with press relations, packages ideas  and organizes distribution of information for Democratic Awakening, part of a  three-party alliance supported by Kohl's Christian Democrats.  </P> <P> Such liberal use of West Germans in the campaign has drawn criticism and added  to the East Germans' sense of being swamped by their rich Western cousins. The  resentment occasionally boils into anger among East Germans over the fact they  seem to have lost control over their first free vote.  </P> <P> The impact of all this assistance is easy to see.  </P> <P> The Social Democrats and the recently forged Alliance for Germany are by far  the two strongest of the 24 parties registered for Sunday's election. New  Forum, the coalition of interests that led last November's successful East  German revolution against the Communists but has no West German political  partner in the election campaign, has about 1% of voter support and says it can  afford only four paid employees in the capital.  </P> <P> The Social Democrats have between 35 and 40.  </P> <P> "It's not just a question of money or technology, it's a question of reaching  the villages," said New Forum election worker Eva Reich. "They've got cars to  get there and speakers to say the right things."  </P> <P> Reich, wife of New Forum leader Jens Reich, admitted that it has been  discouraging to see the group's support dwindle from the heady days of  November.  </P> <P> "They aren't voting Ebeling, Boehme or De Maiziere," she said of East Germany's  voters, noting the last names of three major party leaders. "They are voting  Brandt, Kohl and Genscher, and we've got nothing to compare with that."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Minister Is Unclothed!"] </F>   [Text] President Yeltsin has refused to approve the new  Russian army uniform sported by Pavel Grachev and the entire  Defense Ministry. Grachev's service jacket has been deemed  reminiscent of a Latin American dictator's outfit. It is  noteworthy that Pavel Grachev has worn his uniform illegally.  Being part of the Russian state trappings, it is subject to  approval by a special legislative enactment.    Several hundred billion rubles has been spent on designing  the "Grachev-style" uniform. Under the orders of the USSR  Defense Ministry still in effect, a new uniform, just like any  other innovation, should have been first tested in a particular  military unit in what is called "experimental wearing" so as to  identify and take into account all the shortfalls and wishes by  the military and then have it approved. This has not been done:  The new uniform was simply presented to the top brass.  Emulating their bosses, lower-ranking Defense Ministry  apparatchiks also donned it. At present yet another new uniform  is hastily being designed, based on Russian national traditions.    Interestingly, the designers of the "Grachev" uniform seem  to  have vanished into thin air: no one knows who they are. As  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned, Colonel Ivan Prekhno, chief  of the Uniform Design Department, is about to resign.</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Kirch raises holding in Springer MR LEO Kirch, the media magnate, has paid DM220m (Dollars 132m) to increase to 29 per cent his shareholding in Axel Springer, the large German publishing group which counts Bild and Die Welt among its newspaper titles. He has acquired the 10 per cent stake in Springer sold last week by Poligrafici Editoriale, the Italian publishing company. Before the purchase, Mr Kirch already had around 25 per cent of the Springer voting rights. The deal stems from a cross-shareholding agreement between Springer and Poligrafici under which both companies have ended their involvement with each other. Springer has sold its 10 per cent stake, or 13.2m shares, in Poligrafici to the Monti Group, the Italian publisher which holds the majority stake in Poligrafici. The selling cost is reported to be L4,650 (Dollars 2.95) a share. Springer's decision to sell its stake ends its short involvement in the Italian media market. But it also means that the group, which publishes Bild, the mass circulation daily, and Die Welt, a more serious daily, is likely to spend more time improving sales, distribution and circulation in eastern Germany. German newspapers are attempting to increase their share of the expanding eastern German market. In particular, two new weeklies, Focus and Die Woche, are aiming for a younger, up-market readership.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS: NO 'STUFFY' SYMPHONY  </P> <P> It's billed as a symphony that won't be on the "stuffy" side, and it takes  place Saturday evening in Camarillo.  </P> <P> The Camarillo Arts Council will present Woolf Philips, director of the  Camarillo Symphony, in a free concert of music from around the world.  </P> <P> The evening's program, titled "Harmony Around the World," starts out in the  Grand Canyon and ends up on the River Kwai.  </P> <P> Included in the program will be music by Giuseppe Verdi and Ferde Grofe, and  original compositions by Philips, including his overture from "Childrens' Fairy  Tales."  </P> <P> "It's not what you'd call a stuffy concert," Philips said. "It's something  everybody should enjoy."  </P> <P> The symphony, with more than 60 musicians, made its debut last year at a  Camarillo Arts Council free concert to an audience of more than 1,200.  </P> <P> The concert will begin at 6 p.m. Saturday in Constitution Park, next to  Camarillo City Hall, 601 N. Carmen Drive. It will be free.  </P> <P> "People can bring a picnic, tea, lunch or whatever, and find a spot under a  tree, and they'll be quite happy," Philips said.  </P> <P> For information, call the Camarillo Arts Council Arts Hot Line at 987-7847.  </P></p>

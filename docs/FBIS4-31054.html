			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Geneva, 2 Jun -- Special UN envoy Yasushi Akashi  had two hours of talks behind closed doors this evening in  Geneva's Hotel Intercontinental with the delegation of the  Bosnian Serb Republic. The delegation consisted of President  Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, commander in chief of  the armed forces. TANJUG learned of the meeting from its sources  in the Serb republic. Also attending the meeting was General  Michael Rose, commander of the blue helmets in Bosnia, .    The topic of the talks was the question of the withdrawal of  Serb forces from the 3-km zone around Gorazde, something which  is being insisted upon by the Muslim side as a condition for  participation in the Geneva conference. The continued presence  of Serbs in the zone, as claimed by UN officials in Geneva is  the reason for the fact that the Haris Silajdzic-led delegation  failed to turn up for the opening of the conference on a  comprehensive cease-fire, which had been scheduled to open today  in Geneva.    According to Serb republic sources, Karadzic and Gen. Rose  should inform Akashi late this evening whether the Serbs have  withdrawn, as Karadzic has promised.    According to a statement of the Serb Republic Foreign  Minister Buha given earlier this evening to TANJUG, there are  prospects that the negotiations initiated by Akashi might  nevertheless begin tomorrow. According to Buha, the Muslim  delegation has arrived in Geneva and is having talks with the  Croat delegation on the territorial division of the cantons in  the newly-formed federation.

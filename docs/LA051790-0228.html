			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> EX-MONTOYA AIDE PLEADS GUILTY  </P> <P> A former top aide to ex-Sen. Joseph Montoya pleaded guilty today to one felony  count of lying on a home loan application, as prosecutors dismissed four  corruption charges stemming from the FBI's undercover probe of the Capitol.  </P> <P> Amiel Jaramillo, 36, entered the plea before U.S. District Judge Milton  Schwartz, who set sentencing for July 26.  </P> <P> Jaramillo pleaded guilty to concealing debts totaling $18,000 in outstanding  student loans in a February, 1987, home loan application to the Veterans  Administration. The loan was later approved.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said the count on which Jaramillo pleaded guilty was a new charge  not related to the Montoya case. It carries a penalty of up to five years in  prison and a $250,000 fine.  </P></p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Taiwan to slice bond programme TAIWAN is cutting sharply its programme of government bond issues as its six-year, Dollars 300bn economic development plan runs into difficulties, Reuter reports from Taipei. The government intended to increase new bond issues by at least 140 per cent in the fiscal year to June 1992, to pay for the ambitious development plan, originally scheduled to end in mid-1997. In November it reformed its issuing system, auctioning bonds instead of allocating them at fixed prices, to ease pressure on state finances and create a secondary bond market able to absorb the large number of new issues. However with many projects in the six-year plan plagued by delays, the government is now cutting bond issues because it is unable to spend the money on schedule, said Mr John Shueh, head of the Treasury department in Taiwan's central bank. 'Delays in construction projects are the major factor in our scaling back issues,' he said. The government cancelled a bond issue due in May and will only issue about TDollars 230bn (USDollars 9.1bn) in the current fiscal year, against the original target of at least TDollars 250bn. In the next fiscal year, to June 1993, the government will issue TDollars 230bn of bonds instead of the TDollars 300bn which was originally planned, Mr Shueh said.</p>

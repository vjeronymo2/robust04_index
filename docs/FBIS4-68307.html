			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Defense Enterprise Assistance League </F> President A. Shulunov: "Conversion: New Approaches"]    [Text] According to the experts, 7-10 years and  approximately $150 billion and purposeful management of this  process by the government were needed for the current  conversion. Actually, 117 billion rubles (in 1992 prices) were  allocated for conversion during the last two years. The matter  is also being complicated by the absence of precise prospects in  the sphere of production of defense products and any plans for  the production of needed civilian products, the mechanism for  financing conversion and the appropriate normative documents.    In fairness, I must note that the foundation of conversion  was laid in 1989 already within the framework of the USSR. The  increase of the volumes of production of complex appliances and  consumer goods in 1993 is largely not only the consequence of  the initiative of the labor collectives of converted enterprises  but also of the stockpile of unfinished products created based  upon the plans for 1989-1990. Furthermore, approximately 1,000  conversion programs, including 14 federal programs like  "Vozrozhdeniye rossiyskogo flota" [Rebirth of the Russian Navy],  "Razvitiye grazhdanskoy aviatsionnoy tekhniki" [Development of  Civilian Aircraft] and "Razrabotki i proizvodstva novykh vidov  meditsinskoy tekhniki" [Development and Production of New Types  of Medical Equipment], were fundamentally produced, have  undergone an examination by experts and have partially begun to  be realized during the last two years. A number of regional  conversion programs have been developed and are being  implemented in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Udmurtiya, and in  Sverdlovsk and Rostov Oblasts.    Three are quite a few positive examples of financing and the  realization of some conversion programs by the state, domestic  and foreign commercial structures and banks, but there are many  more shortcomings. Perhaps the most substantial is the  inadequate level and discontinuity of financing. In 1994, they  planned to allocate approximately R4.4 trillion to complete work  begun on 1992 programs and on programs that were approved by the  RF Government in 1993. However, a total of R900 billion remained  in the 1994 draft federal budget. Not a single federal targeted  conversion program was financed normally.    Furthermore, the incorrect scheme for financing conversion  projects under which both the customer and the executor, as a  rule, act as one person of the converted enterprise and  financing of conversion projects is carried out through  commercial banks without the required monitoring is a  fundamental error. Parallelism in the development of a new  conversion product that is not needed by anyone is a consequence  of this scheme. For example, 12 plants simultaneously set up the  production of oil-producing bellcranks. Up to 70-80 percent of  conversion resources didn't reach converted enterprises or were  placed at their disposal at the end of the year. Essentially,  conversion credits went for the formation and consolidation of  commercial banks.    In our opinion, conversion money must be allocated only to  the customer of the civilian product (to those customers  involved with transportation, gas, oil, and agriculture), who  themselves select conversion program executors on a competitive  basis. Under this variant of financing, the customer is capable  of finding additional resources if he is interested in carrying  out his project.    For example, today the RF Ministry of Fuel and Energy  annually spends up to $7 billion on the purchase of spare parts  and new equipment for petroleum extraction and transportation of  energy resources. The enormous production capacity of the  missile builders, aircraft builders and engine builders that has  been freed up is standing idle or is producing "frying pans".  The slogan about hard currency replacement technologies has been  proclaimed in state conversion programs but it practically  doesn't work for the time being.    We have not been able to completely utilize the already  created production capacity for the production of civilian  products due to the serious financial situation of converted  enterprises, the reduction of consumer solvency, and the  systematic delay and reduction of the amount of state resources  being allocated to the defense complex. But under these extreme  conditions, the defense industry is increasing the output of  civilian products by 1.5-2% per year. And the main issue  remains--financing conversion and effective utilization of  limited resources.    In our opinion, the state is obligated to assume  responsibility for retooling defense enterprises to develop  import replacement production; to introduce effective energy and  resource-conserving equipment and technologies; to transfer  dual-use technologies to the civilian sector of the economy that  were previously developed in the military industrial complex; to  develop export opportunities for converted enterprises; and, to  render support to those defense enterprises whose conversion  programs are not part of federal programs but are effective and  directed at saturating the market with goods.    But regional conversion programs must pursue the goal of  offering the opportunity to combine freed-up incomplete  scientific production capacity to the region's enterprises of  various sectors of industry and to integrate them in  sufficiently long technological chains for the production of an  end product. Therefore, regional management (through financing  of conversion) of the process of the formation of new  cooperative production ties between converted enterprises and  also civilian sector enterprises can turn out to be an important  factor for increasing the operating effectiveness of Russian  industry.    Conversion cannot be successful without the state's  substantial support. But the experience of recent years attests  that super-preferential credits indiscriminately allocated to  everyone provokes enterprises to knowingly submit unrealistic  conversion projects.    We think that the enterprise conversion projects must have  serious technical-economic substantiation, undergo an  examination by experts and be financed on a competitive basis.  Commercial banks can be involved in the dissemination of  conversion credits only under the following conditions:  Prevention of the diversion of allocated resources for  commercial credits to third parties; precise determination of  the time periods for the completion of documents associated with  obtaining credits; strict sanctions with regard to commercial  banks for the violation of credit granting terms; and, Russian  Central Bank monitoring of the activities of commercial banks  that are financing conversion projects.    We need to intensively utilize the finances of various stock  companies and banks and attract foreign capital for the  successful resolution of conversion problems under stingy state  financing. Foreign investments of not only the MVF  [International Monetary Fund] and EBRR [European Reconstruction  and Development Bank], but also of companies that are interested  in our products and scientific-technical achievements could  render enormous assistance in the implementation of conversion.  However, the absence of guarantees and the instability of the  legislative and tax base is restraining foreign investors.    Many managers of regions and major enterprises have  understood that without the creation of outside-budget  conversion assistance funds [several words unreadable] which is  the most rational form for the accumulation of resources  designated to finance conversion at the regional level is the  creation of the appropriate--oblast, kray, republic--conversion  assistance fund. Its income portion must be formed through  deductions from the local budget, payments of interested  commercial structures of any form of property, and payments of  founders. We can also recommend to the local authorities such  steps as the allocation of raw materials to provide guarantees  to foreign investors, the transfer of the primary funds of  enterprises to leasing, and the direction of resources from the  privatization of defense enterprises for their conversion. State  support of these funds could be carried out by granting them  various types of tax and other financial benefits. And, in my  opinion, we need to develop and approve a typical charter of a  regional conversion assistance fund on the governmental level in  order to move this work off of dead center.    It is also advisable to grant conversion credits to  enterprises under the deposit of property with the completion of  the appropriate documents stipulated by tax legislation or  through the obligations of insurance companies. The Russian  Ministry of the Economy has developed and approved the  appropriate statute.</p>

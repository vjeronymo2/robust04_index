			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Pounds 40m regional telecoms network planned A FURTHER boost to tele-communications competition in England is imminent with the launch of a regional telecoms company by Yorkshire Electricity and Kingston Communications. The two companies intend to build a fibre-optic network covering Yorkshire and Humberside, using Yorkshire Electricity's pylons and Kingston's expertise and local network covering the city of Hull. The new Pounds 40m joint-venture company, to be called Torch Communications, will be set up in the next few weeks if the boards of the parent companies give approval and if a full telecommunications operating licence is granted by the Department of Trade and Industry. Torch plans to enter the market next summer, shortly after the launch of a third national fibre-optic network by Energis, a subsidiary of the National Grid. Energis will also use pylons for most of its network. Torch will focus on the business market, offering trunking and switched services to companies and other large users. It will also act as a wholesaler, leasing lines to companies and selling services to other telecommunications operators. An inter-connection agreement with British Telecommunications is under negotiation. The venture marks a significant broadening of horizons for Kingston Communications, the only municipally owned public telecommunications operator in the UK. Operationally independent of Hull council, the company is keen to expand its market following the abolition of the BT/Mercury national duopoly. Torch marks a further significant investment in telecommunications for Yorkshire Electricity, one of the privatised distribution companies. Yorkshire also has a stake in Ionica, the Cambridge-based company building a radio-based national network for launch in early 1995. Mr Malcolm Chatwin, Yorkshire Electricity's chief executive, said: 'We want to take advantage of the full range of opportunities in the growing telecommunications business. 'This is very much a long-term affair, but we will be interested in talking to other operators to see if there are joint opportunities.' It may soon become the first regional electricity company to expand its core businesses of distribution and supply outside the UK. Last month it announced discussions with the city of Turku, Finland, about the possible acquisition of its electricity distribution business. In June the company reported a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 156.3m and a 15 per cent rise in total dividends.</p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Bank of Spain to control monetary policy THE BANK of Spain will take control of the country's monetary policy under a draft statute of autonomy - modelled on that of the German Bundesbank - approved by the cabinet yesterday. It will go before parliament early in the new year. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the economy minister, who has been determined to establish the central bank's autonomy before next year's general election, said the draft bill reflected Spain's commitment to the 'philosophy of Maastricht'. By ensuring the autonomy of the central bank, Spain was meeting an important condition for its future presence in the European Community's planned economic and monetary union at the end of the decade. The development was hailed by analysts as a vital structural change that would force the government to control its spending and that should ensure a low and stable rate of inflation. 'We have taken a very important step forward on the road to Emu,' said Mr Jaime de Pinies, head of research at Banco Santander de Negocios. 'We can probably trust in a firmer peseta in the future.' The government's decision to introduce such legislation well ahead of the schedule laid down last year at Maastricht was viewed as a significant gesture that provided a much-needed boost to Spain's Emu convergence plan. In the course of this year the government has failed to meet the convergence targets it had set itself on reducing the public deficit, and the peseta has undergone two devaluations in order to remain within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Under the draft legislation the Bank of Spain is alone empowered with 'defining' monetary policy, and the bill states that the 'prime end' of such a policy is to 'ensure price stability'. Until now monetary policy has been defined by the government and executed by the Bank of Spain. Echoing the Bundesbank's own statutes, the Bank of Spain will in future 'support the government's general economic policy' as long as such support is 'not in detriment' of price stability. Additionally the Bank of Spain is expressly forbidden from funding government deficits. Under the current system the treasury can temporarily borrow from the bank to cover spending overshoots although all such loans have to be repaid to the bank within the fiscal year. Earlier this year direct government borrowing from the Bank of Spain to cover emergency expenditure items was independently reckoned to have been more than Pta1,000bn (Pounds 5.7bn). The legislation also sets a six-year single term for the governor of the Bank of Spain, instead of the current four years renewable, and states that the governor, who is named by the government, will choose his deputy instead of the Economy Ministry as at present. The present governor is Mr Luis Angel Rojo, who is likely to continue in the post.</p>

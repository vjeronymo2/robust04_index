			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 16 March Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], had dinner with Hirotaro Yamazaki, chairman of  the Japan New Party [JNP] general conference of Diet members of  both houses, and seven other JNP Diet members at a hotel in  Tokyo on the evening of 15 March. He exchanged views with them  on the realignment of the political world.    According to a participant in the gathering, Ozawa said:  "Prime Minister Hosokawa is a great man who knows his  priorities. The JNP should also be confident in its support of  the administration."    Also present at this meeting were Diet members Toshio  Yamaguchi and Naoto Kitamura. Ozawa had also met with other JNP  Diet members on 7 and 10 March.    On the other hand, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura  (head of Sakigake [Harbinger]) attended a study group of  Sakigake and JNP members on information and communications on  the morning of 15 March. He said in his speech, "While I will  not attend the general meeting of Sakigake Diet members, I  intend to deal actively with party affairs," thus impressing his  listeners with his enthusiasm for party affairs.    Because Ozawa has been actively approaching JNP Diet  members,  Takemura apparently feels that it is not enough for him to  "concentrate on administrative affairs." The tug-of-war between  the two men to form an alliance with the JNP is expected to grow  in intensity.</p>

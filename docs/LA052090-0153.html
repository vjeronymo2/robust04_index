			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PASTOR'S DRUG ARREST  </P> <P> I want to thank the Los Angeles Times for reporting the arrest of Pastor Gary  Kinzer for drug possession.  </P> <P> Because the parishioners were told the "very-ill-and-needs-rest" story, I think  it's fair to say the diocese would not have shared the allegations with the  Catholic community.  </P> <P> It is not fair for the Diocese of Orange to treat this drug scandal as an  internal personnel problem. This type of alleged criminal activity corrupting  the priesthood must be purged publicly. Anything less seriously undermines the  trust all people have in our church and its moral authority.  </P> <P> SANDRA A. PECK  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

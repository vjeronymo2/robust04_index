According to these agreements and  memorandums, the German Government will grant Jordan soft loans  and grants to finance several development projects in Jordan.  Planning Minister Dr. Ziyad Fariz signed the agreements for the  Jordanian Government, while the German ambassador in Amman  signed for Germany.    Dr. Fariz spoke to our correspondent 'Atif Nusur after the  signing of the agreements, saying:    [Begin Fariz recording] The agreements concern a very  important project, namely, the establishment of water networks  and two water purification stations in the southern part of the  city of Irbid and neighboring villages. The project will  benefit 15 villages in the governorate. The loan agreement that  was signed to implement this project stipulates that the German  Government will grant Jordan a soft loan totaling some 76  million German marks. This loan will contribute to financing the  projects implemented by the Water Authority.    The Bank [not further identified] also granted Jordan a  grant  of 2 million marks to implement the greater Amman water project.  This grant will finance studies on this project. Besides, both  sides signed memorandums on grants, rather than loans.  According to these memorandums, the German agencies will  provide technical training to hospital personnel. The Royal  Medical Services Corps will be the main beneficiary from such  training. The competent German agencies will provide this  medical institution with modern medical technology. Its  personnel will be provided with training. Moreover, the German  agencies will provide maintenance at hospitals in general, and  at the Husayn Medical Center in particular. This grant totals  some 2.7 million marks. The agreements are also meant to  finance energy research and development projects, particularly  those pertaining to renewable energy resources. These projects  are being implemented by the Royal Scientific Society. They are  primarily aimed at developing solar geysers and fans, and  launching laboratories devoted to energy development and other  scientific research that could promote Jordan's capabilities in  this regard. The cost of these projects total some 2 million  marks, 1.8 million, to be exact. The German Government has,  from the outset, aided Jordan's endeavors in this regard. [end  recording]</p>

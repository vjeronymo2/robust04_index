			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The mixed response among commenters suggests that there may be facilities or portions of facilities that are operated or used by correctional systems to provide psychiatric care to inmates or that have levels of security appropriate for the restraint and confinement of persons determined to be criminally insane. ADAAG 6 would not adequately cover these areas since issues of security are addressed in ADAAG 12. While psychiatric facilities are subject to ADAAG 6, certain facilities or areas within them may require higher levels of security and thus more closely approximate the definition of detention and correction facilities of ADAAG 12.1 than the definition of medical care facilities of ADAAG 6.1. In such instances, ADAAG 12 may be used for those specific areas or portions of a facility. This is consistent with the use of other special application sections where facilities contain areas subject to different sections. For example, a hotel is subject to ADAAG 9 (Accessible Transient Lodging) but may also contain retail space subject to ADAAG 7 (Business, Mercantile and Civic) and dining areas covered by ADAAG 5 (Restaurants and Cafeterias).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ADAAG 12.1 notes that public and common use areas are to be accessible. A corresponding appendix note clarifies the application of ``common use'' areas to detention and correctional facilities by listing various examples, such as exercise yards and recreation areas, workshops and areas of instruction and vocational training, counseling centers, cafeterias, commissaries, and medical facilities. Although this list was meant to be illustrative and not exhaustive, the NPRM asked whether further clarification was needed on this subject and if there were other types of common use areas that should be specifically addressed in the appendix note. A slight majority of the comments recommended further clarification, usually by naming certain specific types of rooms or spaces that should be considered ``common use areas.'' Most of these recommendations fall within the types listed in the appendix note. For example, comments recommended specifying classrooms, work areas and job sites, which would fall under the term ``areas of instruction or vocational training'' or recommended day rooms, television rooms, libraries, and multi-purpose rooms which would be covered by ``exercise yards and recreation areas.'' The Board sought to list more generalized and inclusive terms. Areas recommended by comments but not referenced in the proposed list include areas for finger-printing and booking, intake and release, questioning and hearing or meeting rooms; laundry facilities; religious areas, such as chapels; and barber or beauty shops.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Various administrative areas, such as those used for intake and release, are common areas used by inmates. However, only that portion of such areas used by inmates would be considered common use space as defined in this section. In many cases these areas are comprised primarily of employee work areas. In view of this, areas of this type have not been specifically listed as common use areas although spaces within them may be commonly used by inmates and thus be required to be accessible. Many of the other areas recommended for inclusion in the list but not originally covered in the appendix note should be considered common use areas. Since an almost equal number of commenters felt that further clarification was not necessary, these areas have been addressed by including a reference to ``any other rooms, spaces, or elements that are made available for the use of a group of inmates or detainees.'' This language is derived from the existing ADAAG definition of ``common use.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Typical prison design often includes some common use areas, such as dayrooms, that in the restricted and secured environment serve a specific group of cells and are used only by the inmates of those cells. Thus, the proposed requirement for the accessibility of common use areas was limited to those ``serving accessible cells or rooms.'' Several comments supported this provision as proposed but almost an equal number expressed concern about visitors or staff members, such as social workers or clergy, who may need access to such areas, including those serving inaccessible cells or rooms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ADAAG 4.1.1(3) requires that areas used only by employees as work areas be accessible to the extent a person with a disability can ``approach, enter, and exit the areas.'' Detention and correctional facilities are not exempt from this provision. Thus, common use areas that contain work areas would have to be on an accessible route. This requirement also applies to common use areas that do not serve accessible cells or rooms. For example, a counseling center serving a portion of a facility with no accessible cells would have to be on an accessible route so that the area used by counselors as a work area can be approached, entered, and exited by persons with disabilities. Language has been added to the appendix note to 12.1 emphasizing that common use areas that contain or function as work areas or public use areas are still subject to applicable ADAAG requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Areas that serve members of the public, such as waiting rooms and contact and non-contact visiting areas, are considered public use areas and are subject to the requirements for accessibility. This provision has been clarified so that the reference to ``areas serving accessible cells or rooms'' applies only to common use areas and not public use areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters were concerned about the applicability of certain existing ADAAG requirements to detention and correctional facilities. Corrections officials recommended an exemption to the requirement for areas of rescue assistance in ADAAG 4.1.3(9) since inmates do not evacuate the facility independently. Further, areas of rescue assistance may also compromise security. Several commenters noted that signage, particularly that which is raised and brailled, can pose a security risk since it can be removed from walls. Consequently, it was recommended that the requirements for signage apply only to public use areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An exception to the requirement for areas of rescue assistance has been provided. This exception references both scoping requirements in ADAAG 4.1.3(9) and technical requirements in ADAAG 4.3.10 and 4.3.11 for areas of rescue assistance. This exception applies only to the requirement for areas of rescue assistance in ADAAG 4.1.3(9) and not to the requirement for accessible means of egress. With respect to signage, the exception clarifies that the scoping requirements for accessible signage in ADAAG 4.1.3(16) apply only to public use areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The American Public Communications Council, a trade association representing the manufacturers, distributors, and operators of pay telephone equipment, expressed concerns about requirements applicable to inmate-use telephones. Such telephones are typically provided in common use areas and must be properly secured to withstand vandalism and removal. Additional features, such as a volume control, which is highly vulnerable to vandalism, can dramatically increase the cost, perhaps up to 66 percent. The Council correctly assumed that general scoping requirements for telephones in ADAAG 4.1.3(17) would apply only to those common use areas serving accessible cells. The Council also raised concern about ADAAG technical requirements for telephones. Specifically, ADAAG 4.31.2 requires sufficient clear floor space at telephones, and ADAAG 4.31.8 requires handset cords to be at least 29 inches long. However, according to the Council, phones for inmate use may be located near cell bars and thus not provide adequate clear floor space. In addition, security requires that the length of handset cords not exceed 15 inches. Thus, the Council recommended that the guidelines allow other alternatives, such as providing phones that are accessible at supervised locations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requirements for accessible telephones and volume control in ADAAG 4.1.3(17) would apply only to public use areas and to those common use areas serving accessible cells or rooms. Certain security considerations, such as short phone cord lengths, underscore the request for allowable alternatives to ADAAG scoping and technical requirements for telephones. Under ADAAG 2.2 (Equivalent Facilitation) alternatives to ADAAG requirements are allowed as long as greater or equal access is provided. This provision may allow flexibility in providing access to inmate-use telephones.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12.2&blank;Entrances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ADAAG 4.1.3(8) primarily addresses those entrances serving the public. Other entrances not intended for public use are not required to be accessible under ADAAG in most cases. Correctional and detention facilities may contain entrances that inmates or detainees must use for security purposes and that are not open to the public. In order to ensure facility access to inmates with disabilities, this section contains, as originally proposed, a requirement that at least one such entrance be accessible. The proposed requirement had referred to these entrances as ``secured entrances'' defined as ``those entrances used only by inmates or detainees and security personnel and not the general public.'' This was intended to distinguish such entrances from public entrances already addressed by ADAAG. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

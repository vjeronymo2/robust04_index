			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "SAR": "Spring Meeting of European Parliament </F> Members--Poland Willing To Support Russia"]    [Text] A three-day spring meeting of the Council of  Europe [CE] Parliamentary Assembly began in Warsaw on 16 May.  On behalf of Poland, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy suggested that a  CE regional office be established in Warsaw, which would be  designed to suit the needs of Central and East European  countries. The issue of accepting Russia as a CE member was one  of the main topics of a meeting of the CE Commission for  Political Affairs.    Miguel Martinez, chairman of the CE Parliamentary Assembly,  stated during a meeting with Polish President Lech Walesa that  it is precisely Poland from which the CE expects an opinion  concerning the incorporation of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine,  among others, into European structures. Ernst Muehlemann, the  commission's rapporteur, told journalists that there will be no  preferential treatment or a less rigid application for Russia.  He stressed that Russia's joining CE is possible "after the  necessary, democratic reforms are implemented. We have no more  than a year's time to come to a decision on this issue," he  added. The commission has also considered the possibility of  accepting eight other countries that have been striving for  membership, among them Ukraine, Moldova, Latvia, and Albania.  Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy said that "involving Russia in  European structures is in the interest of Poland and Europe; it  is beneficial from the standpoint of the stability of the entire  continent. Poland is leaning toward accepting Russia's  application for membership."    While suggesting on behalf of Poland that a regional CE  office be established in Warsaw, which would be especially  oriented toward the needs of Central and East European  countries, Jozef Oleksy said that "these needs require a better  than heretofore knowledge of them and an improved meeting of  them." Poland has extensive knowledge of the realities of the  region, as well as experience in reforming an economy and the  state. Commenting on the proposal, E. Muehlemann said that the  issue will definitely be a subject of debate. Because it would  mean major expenditures, it is only the CE Committee of  Ministers that is authorized to make a final decision.    The CE, a political intergovernmental organization that has  been active for the sake of European unification, was  established in 1949. It comprises 32 European pluralistic  democracies, including nine Central and East European countries.  Right now, the candidacies of eight other countries are being  debated, among them Russia, Latvia, and Estonia. Poland became  the 26th member of the CE on 26 November 1991. The CE  Parliamentary Assembly holds plenary sessions four times a year  at its Strasbourg headquarters, and it also holds a fifth  session--the spring meetings--in one of the member countries.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TOP 2 MUSHERS SEPARATED BY MINUTE IN RACE  </P> <P> Joe Runyan overtook Susan Butcher and Martin Buser early today as the  half-dozen leaders in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race moved from the Yukon  River to the Bering Sea Coast, setting up the final sprint to Nome.  </P> <P> Runyan, a musher from Nenana, checked into this Norton Sound community just a  minute ahead of Butcher. He logged in at 6:45 a.m. local time Monday, with the  three-time champion in at 6:46 a.m., and Buser, from Big Lake, reporting in at  7:14 a.m.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 9-Minute Stay  </P> <P> Butcher of Manley had left the Yukon River village of Kaltag at 6:55 p.m.  Sunday, with Buser a minute behind her. Runyan, running 16 dogs to Butcher's 12  and Buser's 11, pulled out at 7:45 p.m.  </P> <P> Then came Dee Dee Jonrowe of Willow, logging out at 9:13 p.m., four-time  champion Rick Swenson of Manley, 9:14 p.m., and Lavon Barve of Wasilla leaving  at 10:19 p.m.  </P> <P> From Unalakleet, the mushers race 38 miles up one of the windiest stretches of  the trail to Shaktoolik.  </P> <P> Waiting for the first musher into Nome is $50,000 of a $250,000 jackpot.  </P> <P> The leaders -- Butcher, Buser, Runyan, Swenson, Barve and Jonrowe -- have been  out front of the pack since they left the gold mining ghost town of Iditarod,  558 miles into the race and its half-way point.  </P></p>

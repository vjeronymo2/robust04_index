			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (32): A story of niche markets - Expert Systems, great expectations and disappointments WHEN recruitment expert Mr Nigel Schollick retires in 1995, the knowledge gained in 30 years of interviewing and recruitment will keep working. His judgments on skills and personality, from 'tactless' to 'shy on the phone', will be delivered on people he will never meet, through the medium of a software product called STARS II. It is an expert system which performs preliminary interviewing and delivers some guideline judgments to the human interviewer. This is a typical example of what expert systems are supposed to do - distill the expertise of individuals and deliver them in rule-based systems. Five years ago, there were predictions that expert systems would be a good area for software sales, comparable with spreadsheets in the 1980s. By drawing on the advice of expert systems, not-so-expert people would be enabled to perform skilled tasks with the minimum of training, a process described as de-skilling. In fact, the expectations have been largely disappointed: some of the most vaunted expert systems pioneers have collapsed in the shake-out of the last couple of years. From the Japanese, who so publicly waved the banner of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research as a platform for government investment, very little has emerged. Expert systems are nevertheless the most visible of all the AI techniques to have surfaced in commerce. Expert systems have become the domain of a few small specialised companies, working in niche markets, rather than a recognisable market sector. However, they have penetrated various unrelated niche markets, not by presenting any mystique-laden breakthrough, but by integrating with software that users know and understand. The story of the STARS product is typical of niche usage, because it uses an expert front-end to accepted psychometric testing techniques. The system is for use by in-house interviewers, and has been designed to help non-experts (rather than personnel specialists) through the first tricky and time-consuming steps of staff interviewing. Mr Schollick, of European Personnel Counsellors based in Buckinghamshire, has built his interviewing skills into STARS II. His expertise is packaged in the wording of the questions, and in the expert rules which dictate which questions the system asks. STARS II chooses its own path through the labyrinth of up to 300 questions per interview, selecting the questions in the light of the previous answers. It delivers judgments from a possible 2,000 descriptions - along with carefully-worded suggested questions to probe sensitive areas. These help the human interviewer prepare for the face-to-face interview that no computer can emulate or replace. STARS supplies a consistency of decision making, and a short cut in assessing applicants. This is typical of the niche approach. Expert systems seem to be winning acceptance largely as an extension of other applications, and particularly in industries which are comfortable with advanced technology. The best known examples come from finance and industry. One Australian bank uses an expert system to judge credit card applications. In the UK, ICI uses the technique to assist paint analysis. The Financial Times Business Information report on Successful Expert Systems, published in 1989, cited 20 large UK organisations using expert systems, including a few in mainstream areas. Mr Tim Johnson, director of London-based research company Ovum, points to the commercial basis which is necessary to win wide acceptance of any AI techniques. 'A lot of systems are for diagnostics - problem tracking of some sort, or providing consultancy, everything in fact from diagnosing medical conditions to finding errors in the production process for gas turbines. Another interesting usage is as a front end to access text databases, to help find the way through the maze of what information is available,' says Mr Johnson. Ovum's report on the European market for expert systems, Knowledge Based Systems: Markets, Suppliers and Products, puts the total for product revenues in expert systems at Dollars 70m in 1990 with US revenues of Dollars 128m: excluding expenditure on consultancy and customisation. Mr Johnson notes that the UK, once a hotbed of development, no longer provides Ovum with ready examples of advanced technology. In part, he blames the dissolution of the UK Alvey programme, which funded a number of AI research projects, although there are some signs of life in the AI community, and Ovum is about to publish a new report on Natural Language, the first update since 1985. 'Since Alvey declined, we've had to travel to France or the US to find the latest technology, there seem to be fewer people in the UK to talk to. The US in particular has progressed more rapidly because US companies were quick to adapt when they realised that the early products of research were not quite what people wanted,' he explains. Neuron Data, the US company Ovum cites as having the largest share of the expert systems market in Europe, has just opened a UK direct sales operation in London, a sign of its confidence in the future. Neuron Data sells Nexpert Object, an expert 'shell' which puts the emphasis on integration. This means working with existing databases, on over 30 different platforms, including Macintosh, PCs, workstations, minis, and IBM mainframes, and with different graphical user-interfaces for ease of use. 'Expert systems are just another software technology,' says Mr Richard Stow, Neuron Data's UK sales and marketing manager who would like to distance expert systems from the AI tag. 'To customers it's just one technology among many others. The old world of AI - to which Neuron Data never subscribed - was about specialist hardware, very complex software needing esoteric programing skills, systems with guru-level intelligence which learn from experience - no mention of integration or portability. The old world has gone: what predominates is now a view of expert systems from the developer's perspective,' says Mr Stow. He divides Neuron Data users into three categories; the end users, the providers of packaged software, and systems integrators such as Andersen Consulting. Among notable US Nexpert users are Manufacturers Hanover Trust, which has built a system called Inspector, for monitoring fraudulent or high-risk deals, and computer manufacturer Tandem, which uses online expert diagnostics for its Integrity S2 system. Mr Stow believes the UK market is probably 12-18 months behind the US in terms of take-up of expert system technology, but it will catch up. Andersen Consulting has about 25 users worldwide, including four UK sites for its Expert Configurator which is built on to the MAC-PAC manufacturing (MRP II) package on IBM AS400s. The expert front end allows the user to match up a specific task needing certain machines with existing tasks and schedules. 'We'd like to think that expert systems are becoming a mainstream technology,' concludes Mr Stow. 'In the future you might see companies amassing knowledge-bases - with PC networks and shared information, you might even be able to put a value on knowledge as a corporate asset.'</p>

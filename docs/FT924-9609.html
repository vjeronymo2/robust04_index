			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Government a mere two votes away from defeat THE narrowness of the government victory last night is highlighted by a breakdown of the results. If an extra two Tories had switched sides and voted against the government on its motion, or a handful more had abstained, Mr Major would be contemplating defeat this morning. Both the Labour and Conservative parties achieved a full turnout of members  -267 and 332 MPs respectively. In the first vote - on Labour's amendment to the government motion - there were 10 abstentions by Tory MPs and 23 who voted against the government. But in the second vote, on the government's motion, three more Conservative MPs - Mr David Porter (Waveney), Mr Michael Lord (Suffolk Central) and Mr John Carlisle (Luton North) - joined the Conservative rebellion. In addition there were seven abstentions, cutting the government majority to just three. Four speakers and deputy speakers, plus the two tellers for each side, do not count in the final voting figures. A total of 319 members voted for the government motion to proceed with ratification. They included 299 Conservatives, 19 Liberal Democrats and one Ulster Populist Unionist MP. A total of 316 members voted against the government motion, consisting of 267 Labour, 26 Conservatives, one Liberal Democrat, four SDLP, three Scottish Nationalists, four Welsh Nationalists, eight Ulster Unionists and three Democratic Unionists. The 26 Tories who voted against the government motion were Mr John Biffen (Shropshire N), Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston), Mr Nicholas Budgen (Woverhampton SW), Mr John Butcher (Coventry SW), Mr John Carlisle (Luton N), Mr Bill Cash (Stafford), Dr Michael Clark (Rochford), Mr James Cran (Beverley), Mr Iain Duncan-Smith (Chingford), Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow), Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay), Mr Toby Jessel (Twickenham), Mr Roger Knapman (Stroud), Mr Barry Legg (Milton Keynes SW), Mr Michael Lord (Suffolk C), Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton N), Mr David Porter (Waveney), Mr Richard Shepherd (Aldridge Brownhills), Sir Trevor Skeet (Bedfordshire N), Mr Michael Spicer (Worcestershire S), Sir Peter Tapsell (Lindsey E), Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend E), Mr Bill Walker (Tayside N), Mr John Wilkinson (Ruislip Northwood), Mrs Ann Winterton (Congleton), Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield).</p>

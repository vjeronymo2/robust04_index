			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Pollution level on the increase AIR POLLUTION has been worsening recently, although levels are generally better than a decade ago, details in the Department of the Environment's 15th annual digest of environmental statistics show. The UK's emissions of carbon dioxide, a contributor to global warming, were 3 per cent higher in 1991 than in 1990, although they have fallen by a fifth in the past decade. Environmentalists fear the recent rise could jeopardise Britain's ability to meet international targets on global warming. Traffic emissions of nitrogen oxide rose by 73 per cent between 1981 and 1991, and emissions of black smoke by 86 per cent. The report adds: 'Poor air quality was recorded at all urban monitoring sites in 1991.' The number of UK beaches complying with European Community bacteria standards rose by 3.4 per cent to 328 last year, according to the National River Authority's annual report on bathing water, published yesterday.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TIME'S 2ND-QUARTER INCOME UP 12% OVER SAME PERIOD IN '88  </P> <P> Time Inc.'s second-quarter net income rose 12% to $94 million, or $1.61 a  share, compared to $84 million, or $1.45 a share, in the corresponding 1988  period, the company reported today.  </P> <P> The company, which is battling to complete an offer to acquire Warner  Communications Inc., valued at $14 billion, said increased second-quarter  earnings reflected operating gains in its four divisions -- magazines, books,  television programming and cable television -- and the inclusion of a  $12-million pretax annual dividend from the company's investment in  Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System.  </P> <P> Time's performance, however, was off slightly for the first half of 1989  because of first-quarter expenses relating to its business combination with  Warner, a Time spokesman said. The company earned $143 million, or $2.49 a  share, a 5% dip from $150 million, or $2.58 a share, in the first half of 1988.  </P></p>

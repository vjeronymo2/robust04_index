			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Iraqis to put case before UN delegates AN Iraqi delegation led by Mr Tariq Aziz, the country's deputy prime-minister will come to New York next week to speak to the UN Security Council on March 11 about scrapping Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction, UN diplomats said yesterday. The Security Council said last week Baghdad had less than two weeks to explain its position and comply with ceasefire accords mandating the scrapping of all weapons of mass destruction. President Saddam Hussein would otherwise face undetermined 'serious consequences,' the council said. British officials said the meeting would show Iraq that anger at its prevarication over the UN resolutions is shared across the 15-member council and 'that it's not just the case that the whole show is being run by the US, backed by Britain and France'. Iraqi is expected to argue that the economic embargo against Baghdad should be lifted in parallel with compliance with the UN resolutions. The Security Council will insist, however, that the embargo must remain in force until Iraq has complied in full with its orders. In Baghdad, Mr Aziz said Iraq had pursued the 'objective, accurate implementation of (UN) measures'. He said he would tell the council Iraq would approve if the UN aimed to implement Resolution 687. 'But if your objective is to annihilate Iraqi industry and deny Iraq the chance of becoming a prosperous industrial country, that would be a different matter.' Baker acted on loans, Page 7</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON THE MIDDLE EAST;  </P> <P> IRAQ IS NOT THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS;  </P> <P> WHILE THE WEST PERSISTS IN WISHFUL THINKING, SADDAM HUSSEIN IS POSITIONING  HIMSELF TO BE THE NO. 1 ARAB POWER.  </P> <P> The West is once more in danger of misreading the nature of Iraq's president,  Saddam Hussein, and his ambitions for his country. Unless there is a  clear-sighted view of his intentions and an effective response to them, Western  interests in the Persian Gulf will be in deep jeopardy.  </P> <P> The record of Western misapprehension about Hussein's regime is extensive,  going back to 1980, when Iraq invaded Iran. Ignoring a raft of evidence,  Western analysts and policy-makers attributed Iraqi aggression to fear of Iran  and its revolution, rather than to Iraq's ambitions to become the dominant  power in the Persian Gulf and the Arab world.  </P> <P> These analysts made their next serious mistake by interpreting Hussein's  downshifts in rhetoric, necessitated by war needs, as indicating deep and  long-lasting ideological and institutional transformation of Iraqi politics and  society. This misreading led to Western expectations about Iraqi behavior that  could only be characterized as wishful thinking. For example, it was generally  expected that Iraq would liberalize its political system and play a positive  role in resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Perhaps it would even join Egypt  and Jordan in an Arab coalition willing to make peace with Israel. The pay-off:  total Western support for Iraq in the Persian Gulf war.  </P> <P> Because of this sort of analysis, the West -- the United States and Europe --  helped Iraq economically and militarily far beyond what was necessary to  contain Iran. Simultaneously, by weakening Iran more than was necessary to keep  it from dominating the Persian Gulf, the West helped to create a disequilibrium  in the regional balance, which Saddam Hussein has exploited ever since.  </P> <P> After the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, and despite the obvious shift in the  regional military balance, the West persisted in viewing Iran as the greater  threat and refused to force Iraq to live up to its commitments under U.N.  Security Council Resolution 598, the basis for the cease-fire.  </P> <P> The West also continued to turn a blind eye to Iraq's massive human-rights  violations and was years late in condemning Iraq's use of chemical weapons, the  most extensive since the World War I. The Western attitude toward Iraq's drive  for nuclear capability has also been muted.  </P> <P> Last week, Iraq's threat to Kuwait's security and territorial integrity was  seen by many Western analysts as mere posturing in order to boost oil prices at  the OPEC meeting in Geneva. As usual, they cautioned against antagonizing  Hussein.  </P> <P> This analysis is seriously in error. There can be no doubt that Iraq wants to  become the dominant power in the Persian Gulf, which its own 30 miles of  coastline does not merit. Thus, it must control the Iranian shoreline or that  of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Saddam Hussein is a typical Arab nationalist, in the Nasser mold, who views the  gulf rulers as reactionary Western surrogates and impediments to achievement of  Arab nationalists' goals. Now that he is riding high in popularity among the  Arab masses, and because of Arab frustration over the Palestinian problem, he  is testing to see whether he can supplant these gulf leaders or at least bring  them under his control. Nor would Iraq need to launch a full-scale military  invasion of Kuwait to achieve its goal. It could force Kuwait to surrender or  lease strategic islands or even to unite with Iraq.  </P> <P> If successful, critical Iraqi influence over the West's oil lifeline would lead  Hussein to pressure the West on the Palestinian problem.  </P> <P> Under these circumstances, what is the West to do? It has already narrowed its  options by having indulged Hussein for too long. For example, given Iraq's  current military strength, it would not be easy to mount a U.S. naval operation  similar to the re-flagging and protecting of Kuwaiti tankers that was carried  out at the height of the war in 1987-88.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the West must act before it is too late. First, it must finally  see Hussein for what he really is and stop entertaining false hopes. It must be  more prudent about Iraq's nuclear program, and it must apply economic pressure  while Iraq is still financially vulnerable. Let's hope the U.S. Senate's voting  of economic sanctions Friday marks the start of a long-term policy  re-evaluation. The West, including Europe, must stop new credits and loans to  Baghdad, and if that is not sufficient, an economic boycott, including Iraq's  oil, may be necessary.  </P> <P> The West also must try to restore some balance in the region by helping Iran's  moderates, easing Iran's re-integration in the world community and encouraging  Arab-Iranian reconciliation.  </P> <P> Finally, the West must do all it can to break the deadlock on the Arab-Israeli  peace process and find a solution to the Palestinian problem -- the single most  important rallying cry for frustrated Arabs and the best tool of manipulation  for their ambitious leaders.  </P></p>

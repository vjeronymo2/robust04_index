			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Arts: Momix - Sadler's Wells Theatre A hundred years ago the American performer Loie Fuller took Paris by storm. Her work was a phantasmagoria of lighting, fabric and music; and she, moving at the centre of the picture, seemed to keep transforming herself. She was a butterfly, an orchid, a flame: illusion upon illusion. Several people noted that, strictly speaking, she was not a dancer - but that hardly mattered. She was taken seriously, won high praise from Mallarme and became a living icon of Art Nouveau. The two American groups Pilobolus and Momix look nothing like her or like Art Nouveau but, mutatis mutandis, they are her spiritual heirs. Image succeeds image with happy fecundity. The performers create one illusion after another by means of skilled movement assisted by light, sound and sometimes props. Frequent metamorphosis is a key part of the Pilobolus/Momix experience. The movement of either troupe is a lyrical form of athleticism, and is like little else in dance, mime or theatre. Pilobolus is the parent group, founded over 20 years ago; Momix was launched 10 years later by a founder-Pilobolan, Moses Pendleton, who is still its director. On either side of the Atlantic, both have always polarised critics who on most other subjects are in concord. Audiences, however, have seldom failed to acclaim either company warmly. Of the two troupes, it is Pilobolus that at its best provides the purer and more transporting experience. Momix's current 70-minute show, Passion, is blighted by numerous tacky features and I have never watched work by either company with such conflicting feelings as on this occasion. On the one side there is delight in five superb performers and the streams of changing images that they supply. On the other is resentment at having to watch that through a gauze on which is projected further imagery, often ironic or irrelevant; and my rejection of the muzak. Passion is a misnomer. Its imagery is by turns zoological, botanical, primitive, exotic and even religious. Much of the time we are watching those animal and/or vegetable episodes that have always been the marvel of Pilobolus/Momix theatre. A man squats like an animal and spins his head and neck round in circles like a ball-and-chain. This signal brings on another like-spirited male animal. Now they move like amphibians, now like amoeba - and suddenly from all fours they are jumping high into the air, like crickets. Funny, surprising, supple, yes. But what is finest here and often elsewhere in Passion is the pervasive lyricism of the movement. In the most impassioned scene, one near-nude man hangs in a trapeze, radiantly spreadeagled like a Renaissance diagram of human geometry. Then he starts to fold and fall, hanging now like a sinner at the Last Judgment and calling in silent pain. Two other characters, robed and hooded in scarlet (devils? cardinals?), spin brilliantly on either side as if in waiting. Clasping their hands in prayer, they look sanctimonious; and next they try to catch him; no, next he tries to catch them. A sinner and the prelates of the church? or Faust and a pair of devils? The scene has a marvellous ambiguity. Meanwhile, however, superimposed over the episodes of Passion are pictures of a flower or a brain or a tree or a pearl necklace or a Renaissance lady. The eponymous muzak by Peter Gabriel (now a boys' choir, now pop baroque, now rock-Indian) encourages the impression that Passion is just a druggy dream-trip without coherence. What is good about Momix seems thrillingly natural. But here it has been manipulated by charlatans.</p>

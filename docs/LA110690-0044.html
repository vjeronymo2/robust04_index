			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Building on Past: Convicted Watergate figure Jeb Stuart Magruder has no problem  with the possibility that his past notoriety may have played a role Sunday in  packing the pews for his first sermon as pastor of the First Presbyterian  Church in Lexington, Ky. Whatever reason they come "is just great," he said,  and even touched on Watergate in the 25-minute sermon.  </P> <P> Equal Enforcement: Federal agents and San Jose police have broken up what they  think was the city's first female-owned and operated bookmaking operation with  the arrest Sunday of Kim Snare, 43. Police said they also seized nearly $20,000  in cash and hundreds of betting markers, along with computer disks containing  information on the ring's operations.  </P> <P> Guiding Lights: Glamour magazine Monday honored 10 women who, it said, "lit up  the year with their daring, enterprise and vision." The list included Sarah  Brady for her efforts to restrict handguns and Chinese student dissident Chai  Ling. Others were Madonna; Sen. Barbara Mikulski, (D-Md.); Marian Wright  Edelman, founder and president of the Children's Defense Fund; Wendy Kopp,  founder of the nonprofit organization, "Teach for America"; tennis star Chris  Evert; Elizabeth Glaser, a leader in the fight against AIDS; Rep. Patricia  Schroeder (D-Colo.) and television personality Jane Pauley.  </P> <P> Rags to Riches: Businessman Harry Weinberg's billion-dollar estate will go  primarily to the poor, according to trustees. An elementary school dropout who  made his fortune in real estate and mass transit, Weinberg, 83, died Sunday in  Hawaii after an 8-year battle with cancer. With the exception of about $3  million he left to his grandchildren, the entire estate is going to the Harry  and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, now one of the 12 largest U.S. charitable  organizations.  </P></p>

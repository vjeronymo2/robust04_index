Where applicants certify that they do not have readily available audience share data, they may substitute other information that can serve as a proxy for such data.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See Memorandum Opinion and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  in MM Docket No. 91&hyph;140, 7 FCC Rcd 6387 (1992), 57 FR 42701 (Sept. 16, 1992). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) Overlap between two stations in different services is permissible if neither of those two stations overlaps a third station in the same service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)(i) Where the principal community contours of two radio stations overlap and a party (including all parties under common control) with an attributable ownership interest in one such station brokers more than 15 percent of the broadcast time per week of the other such station, that party shall be treated as if it has an interest in the brokered station subject to the limitations set forth in paragraphs (a) and (e) of this section. This limitation shall apply regardless of the source of the brokered programming supplied by the party to the brokered station. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Every time brokerage agreement of the type described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section shall be undertaken only pursuant to a signed written agreement that shall contain a certification by the licensee or permittee of the brokered station verifying that it maintains ultimate control over the station's facilities, including specifically control over station finances, personnel and programming, and by the brokering station that the agreement complies with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (e)(1) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Any party operating in conflict with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section on September 16, 1992 shall come into compliance within one year thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) For purposes of this paragraph: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The ``principal community contour'' for AM stations is the predicted or measured 5 mV/m groundwave contour computed in accordance with &sect;73.183 or &sect; 73.186 and for FM stations is the predicted 3.16 mV/m contour computed in accordance with &sect;73.313. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The number of stations in a radio market is the number of commercial stations whose principal community contours overlap, in whole or in part, with the principal community contours of the stations in question ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the station for which an authorization is sought and any station in the same service that would be commonly owned whose principal community contour overlaps the principal community contour of that station). In addition, if the area of overlap between the stations in question is overlapped by the principal community contour of a commonly owned station or stations in a different service (AM or FM), the number of stations in the market includes stations whose principal community contours overlap the principal community contours of such commonly owned station or stations in a different service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A station's ``audience share'' is the average number of persons age 12 or older on an average quarter hour basis, Monday-Sunday, 6 a.m.-midnight, who listen to the station, expressed as a percentage of the average number of persons listening to AM and FM stations in that radio metro market or a recognized equivalent, in which a majority of the overlap between the stations in question takes place. The ``combined audience share'' is the total audience share of all AM or FM stations that would be under common ownership or control following a proposed acquisition. In situations where no metro market or recognized equivalent exists, the relevant audience share data are the data for all counties that are within the principal community contours of the stations in question, in whole or in part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) ``Time brokerage'' is the sale by a licensee of discrete blocks of time to a ``broker'' that supplies the programming to fill that time and sells the commercial spot announcements in it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Television contour overlap (duopoly) rule <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . No license for a TV broadcast station shall be granted to any party (including all parties under common control) if the grant of such license will result in overlap of the Grade B contour of that station (computed in accordance with &sect;73.684) and the Grade B contour of any other TV broadcast station directly or indirectly owned, operated, or controlled by the same party. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> One-to-a-market ownership rule <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

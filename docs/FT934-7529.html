			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (7): In the shadow of the recession - Office equipment is feeling the squeeze 'IT'S a slow move out of recession; we're not seeing huge increases in new business,' says Mr Roger Gazzard, managing director of Lloyds Bowmaker, Business Technology Finance. The sector is greatly dependent on small businesses, who in their turn have been particularly heavily hit. Hard information on this market segment is difficult to come by. According to statistics from the Finance &amp; Leasing Association, 6 per cent of the whole leasing market is represented by photocopiers, vending machines and fax machines. Other major categories of office equipment are personal computers and post room equipment. Last year's total for new leasing business in office equipment and computers written by FLA members is Pounds 1.76bn, down from Pounds 2.48bn in 1991. However, included in these totals are sizeable computer installations which cannot really be regarded as office equipment in the same way as personal computers. Business is mainly small ticket with consequent diseconomies of scale. These are partly overcome by lessors dealing with lessees through equipment suppliers, hence the tag 'sales aid leasing'. According to Mr Gazzard, 'negotiating direct with the customer would put up the cost considerably'. Careful management is crucial. 'While it's asset-based finance, the underlying depreciation is high on the assets so there isn't very much by way of security covering you if a contract goes wrong,' he explains. Schroder Leasing has been in the market for 33 years, with around 60 per cent of turnover coming from office equipment. 'It is a profitable market for lessors as long as they play the game properly,' says Mr Jeff Addison, managing director. His company has minimised costs by developing sophisticated transaction processing and support systems - he calls it 'the lifeblood of a small ticket sales aid leasing company'. Photocopiers have one of the biggest market shares, with around 160,000 UK installations each year and leasing a popular method of acquisition. But this area of the business has been embroiled in controversy for the last couple of years. There are stories of small businesses driven under by the onerous lease requirements. The sector may be soon due for tighter regulation. The Office of Fair Trading has conducted an inquiry and will publish a report in the near future. Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general, is unhappy with what he describes as 'misplaced ingenuity' on the part of a number of dealers and finance houses. The Finance &amp; Leasing Association, which represents around 80 per cent of the industry, took its own steps to try and solve the problems some time ago. Guidance notes on sales aid leasing were issued to members in April 1992. The intention of the notes is to ensure that lease documentation is clear and that the customer is fully aware of the financial obligations under a lease. 'While I wouldn't say that the practices of all the lessors were of a reasonable enough standard they certainly have moved forward dramatically,' says Lloyds Bowmaker's Mr Gazzard, who is also chairman of the FLA's small ticket leasing group. 'The sorts of contracts you see now are clear, are unequivocal.' Mr Charlie Blacklock, manager of the Campaign to Clean Up Copier Contracts, launched in February last year, agrees that the industry has made progress. . 'The cost-per-copy contract is disappearing, people have realised that it is open to abuse,' says Mr Blacklock. Cost-per-copy contracts have frequently overestimated a lessee's likely use of a machine and pushed up costs accordingly. 'My own company will only write cost-per-copy contracts for customers of a reasonable size and with a constant copying requirement,' says Mr Gazzard. He adds that throughout the industry cost-per-copy contracts are now generally used only for larger customers, and comprise less than 20 per cent of all contracts. However, Mr Blacklock still receives an average of three calls a day from people who have fallen foul of copier contracts, some of which were signed with FLA members after the guidance notes were introduced. 'There has been improvement but we still feel that there is a long way to go,' he says. Mr John Chapman, assistant director of the OFT's consumer affairs division, says that the report is likely to highlight continuing areas of concern. As well as photocopier contracts, to a lesser extent agreements for faxes, franking machines and vending machines are also causing disquiet. 'We've got about eight different areas where we still think there's quite a bit more to be done,' he says. These include price escalation clauses, lengths of contracts, settlement conditions, cost-per-copy contracts and upgrading Clauses. The OFT is also likely to call for greater overall transparency in contracts. The OFT also has a consultation document out exploring the possibility of changes of the relationship of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to businesses. At present it applies to sole traders and partnerships. One option is to extend its protection to companies, though removing businesses from its scope altogether is also being considered. In addition, a wider review of the content of the Act itself is in progress, with one prospect being to raise the limit on transactions within its remit from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 30,000. Lessors are not keen on extending the Act to cover companies. 'I think that would be extremely bad for the small business user because it's going to put leasing companies in a very difficult position,' says Mr Addison of Schroder Leasing. 'It's going to take a huge amount of finance out of the market.' The FLA says some of the clauses would reduce the extent of finance available to businesses from its members, notably for small ticket leasing. For example, a borrower has the right to settle a regulated credit agreement early and some regulated hire agreements can be terminated after 18 months. Others see some advantages. Mr Blacklock of the Campaign to Clean Up Copier Contracts thinks the 'cooling off' period under the Act would be of benefit to businesses. The FLA, for its part, says that this could prevent businesses getting vital equipment quickly since lessors would be reluctant to supply until after the cooling off period. In the meantime, included in the FLA sales aid guidance notes available from lessors is a check list for lessees which is well worth reviewing before entering into office equipment leases.</p>

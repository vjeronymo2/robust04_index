			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AZTECS HAVE PROVEN THAT THEY ARE WORTHY OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT  </P> <P> Congratulations to Coach Al Luginbill and the San Diego State Aztecs, who  proved this season that they are capable of scoring on quality defenses from  anywhere on the field. I look forward to games at home against Wyoming, BYU,  Hawaii, Utah, Air Force and Colorado State, who are traditional WAC opponents.  </P> <P> Non-conference foes such as UCLA, Cal, Miami and USC in '92 sweeten our  schedule in the year to come.  </P> <P> In my way of thinking there is no better way to spend a Saturday evening or  afternoon than watching the Aztecs at our beautiful San Diego Jack Murphy  Stadium.  </P> <P> Those in this community who continue to complain about the Aztecs do so from  the comfort of a chair of inactivity. If they did venture to the Aztec games,  they would be drowned out by the roar of San Diegans who have found a quality  team to support.  </P> <P> FRANK A. CUENCA  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

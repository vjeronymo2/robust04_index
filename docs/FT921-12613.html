			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Redland/Steetley Not surprisingly, the market was confused by yesterday's news that the UK authorities want to take their own look at the Tarmac-Steetley joint venture. Either the secretary of state cannot resist an opportunity to score a few points off Brussels, or he is taking a pot shot at the whole UK building materials industry. Both, after all, are familiar targets. Assuming the latter, the implications go well beyond the likely referral of Redland's bid for Steetley over competition in UK bricks and tiles. With the whole sector flat on its back - and still showing no sign of recovery - the joint venture proposal and the Redland bid look like deliberate attempts to begin rationalisation with the least possible disruption to corporate balance sheets. If these are now to be frustrated by a government already suspicious about cartels in ready mixed concrete and the like, the major players will presumably have to get rid of the excess capacity on their own. That would almost certainly be a slower process, presumably involving bigger write-downs in the absence of acquisition accounting. Of course, it may not come to that. If both the bid and the joint venture end up being investigated, much may depend on whether the OFT looks at national or regional market shares. In the Steetley-Tarmac case, moreover, Brussels could yet refuse to cede its authority back to the UK. Until the politics become clearer, the Steetley shares are probably best left to the speculators.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Outdoors: Massacre of the males - Beekeeping About a week after the local sheepdog trials, we begin to look for signs of another rural ritual of subjugation - the massacre of the drones. It comes around as regularly as autumn, bringing brutality and death to the gentle world of the apiarist in a public display of gender atrocity. By the time it becomes apparent to the onlooker, it is almost too late to save the wretched victims from their fate. Inside the hives, the worker bees have been deliberately keeping the drones away from the stores of honey. The males are becoming desperate for food and, although they are bigger than their sisters, they are heavily outnumbered and starvation has weakened them to the point of only feeble resistance. They know their time is up. One by one they are led out into the daylight, and marched to the edge of the entrance-board to be banished. The more fortunate are cast out close to nightfall and die quickly of exposure. Others go on starving slowly for many hours until the cold finishes them off. Almost all of them put up a struggle, turning back repeatedly to the warmth of the hive. They plough into the cluster of worker guards filling the entrance, the drones using their size to retake lost ground. But the cluster casually absorbs them and edges them out again until, exhausted, the drones give up and fly away to their solitary deaths. The guards then bring out their next victim and the ritual is repeated. Eventually all the drones, perhaps 100 or 200, are driven out. The spectacle of their extinction is made all the more pitiful by its slow pace and total silence. Inside, the rest of the colony is buzzing energetically over combs of strongly-scented honey which they have just filled from the heather. The slaughter is not part of an obvious battle for survival. The drones are not killed while out raiding a strange hive for stores of honey. Drones cannot be bothered to go robbing. The killing-field for them is merely the ordained end of their life-cycle, their form of death by natural causes. By early autumn, drones are redundant to the active workforce. The sole purpose of their short lives has been to wait around throughout the summer in case one of them is needed to mate a new queen. This is the only function in the complex life of the hive not undertaken by its tens of thousands of worker bees, the only one at which they cannot excel, since they are all female. But this makes a dull life for drones. Untroubled by any useful tasks, they mooch about the face of the combs getting in the way. Occasionally they go out for a short fly-around, and visit a so-called Drone Congregation Area, a spot high in the air which by some mysterious instinct is known to local virgin queens. Now and then a virgin drops by looking for a stray drone to join her in a mating-flight. Drone Congregation Areas have defied scientific investigation. They seem to be the honeybee equivalent of the cafe-bar in The Wild One where Marlon Brando hangs out with the boys. But these boys know their place, although such is the abundance of nature that only a tiny number ever mates a queen. For the rest, a few months of pointless existence leads only to a slow death once the hive decides it is too late in the year for a new queen. But there is a limit to this feeling of sympathy. Beekeepers generally regard drones as a waste of space. We see through the eyes of our workers - and they look like expensive luxuries in the struggle for survival. Indolent passengers with big appetites. So as the executions roll on, it is time to ease the top off a hive, shake a honeycomb free of bees and head for the dining table with a grateful cheer of 'up the workers'.</p>

He stated this to justify that fact  that several of these opponents were barred from flying out to  Paris from Libreville yesterday evening.    In an interview published today in the government daily  L'UNION, the head of state added that the "government has  decided that everyone should remain here. We shall see. There  is no need to flee. They have visited France enough," Mr. Bongo  said. "We have said that all those who want to sow disorder in  the country will face the rigors of the law. Nobody has the  monopoly of street demonstrations and fisticuffs...If because  some people have lost an election they decide to set up a  parallel government and a High Council of the Republic [HCR],  that means provocation...They should even be jailed but we feel  there is no need to do so," the head of state added.    Following the first round of the 5 December presidential  election which saw the reelection of Mr. Bongo, the opposition  candidates proclaimed the victory of one of their members,  Father Paul Mba Abessole, who placed second according to  official results. Mr. Abessole subsequently set up his  "government" and an HCR.    "When the opponents travel to Paris they call Bruno Delaye,"  President Francois Mitterrand's adviser on African affairs, and  afterwards "they go to Boulevard Saint Honore and then say they  are from the Elysee Palace," the Gabonese head of state stated,  adding that "they go to France to tell stories to the  newspapers."    On Tuesday evening, an opposition delegation which had  planned an "explanation tour" to France and the United States,  was barred from leaving the country at Libreville airport.  Scuffles broke out at the airport between policemen, who fired  teargas, and the bodyguards of these opponents among whom were  four candidates in the presidential election, namely  Jules-Aristide Bourdes Ogouliguende, Alexandre Sambat,  Jean-Pierre Lemboumba, and Pierre-Claver Maganga-Moussavou. The  opposition condemned this as an "obstacle to freedom of movement  and an unacceptable violation of human rights."</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Hosiery helps Hartstone to Pounds 10m HARTSTONE, the hosiery and leather goods group, raised pre-tax profits by 28 per cent from Pounds 8.17m to Pounds 10.5m in the six months to September 30, reflecting the acquisition of two companies last year and a continued strong performance from the US. The group also officially announced its intention to take on the European lingerie market, by exercising its option to buy Aznar Industriel, the Spanish underwear company. Hartstone will pay Pounds 9m in cash and shares for the group, which was linked to the hosiery manufacturer, Aznar, acquired last year. Mr Stephen Barker, chairman, stressed the organic growth achieved in the half year, with like-for-like leather goods sales up by 14 per cent in the US and 7 per cent in Europe. In hosiery, the overall comparable advance was just 1 per cent. Group sales overall expanded to Pounds 162m (Pounds 92.8m). Hartstone, which suffered a sharp decline in its share price over the summer, came under some scrutiny earlier this year as a result of its acquisitive nature. 'All we have done to the businesses since acquiring them is improve them,' Mr Barker said yesterday. 'We will just plod on and prove to everyone that we have a group where growth can be sustained.' The interim dividend is raised by nearly 50 per cent to 2.8p (1.875p) 'reflecting our confidence in the future,' Mr Barker said. The shares closed 1p up at 197p. The hosiery division benefited by Pounds 3m at the operating level due to the inclusion of Cogetex in France and Aznar. This represented the bulk of the operating profit improvement from Pounds 829,000 to Pounds 4.5m, with trading in the UK continuing to be difficult. Leather goods increased operating profits to Pounds 9.28m (Pounds 8.47m). Most of that was earned in the US, where Hartstone had seen definite signs of an increase in confidence. However, Mr Barker stressed that it was not yet clear 'whether that is short-term, as it was in the UK following the Tory victory.' Interest charges rose from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 3.3m. Debt of about Pounds 67m left gearing higher than last year at about 80 per cent. This was due partly to seasonal factors, with most hosiery sales in the second half. Hartstone expected year-end gearing to be less than 1991's 51 per cent. Earnings were depressed by the 28m shares issued to purchase Aznar and Cogetex in December. They fell from 7.7p to 6.7p.</p>

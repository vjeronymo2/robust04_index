			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Warsaw shifts policy on state enterprises THE Polish prime minister, Ms Hanna Suchocka, yesterday unveiled plans to involve the trade unions and workers in a new social pact aimed at restructuring and privatising state enterprises. The initiative follows industrial unrest in the coal and copper mines in August and a continuing stoppage at the FSM car plant in southern Poland. The strikes, which were partly fomented by inter-union rivalries, highlighted labour disenchantment with falling real incomes and uncertainty about the future of their industries. The FSM strike, now in its sixth week, has stopped production of the new Fiat Cinquecento model, delayed the company's takeover by Fiat and damaged Poland's image among foreign investors. The pact signals a new approach by the government towards state industries which have been left to fend for themselves. This has led to rising indebtedness and a sharp drop in output and investment. The new policies will ease central wage controls and link wages more closely to profits and productivity. Workers and management will be given three months to choose their own privatisation plans from five alternative models. These range from selling the enterprise to a foreign investor to privatisation by worker or management buyout. The main responsibility for implementing the pact lies with Mr Jacek Kuron, the labour minister and former Solidarity activist.</p>

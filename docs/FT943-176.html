			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Promise in the pipeline British Gas mouthed all the right words at its strategy presentation yesterday. After years of moaning that unfair treatment by its regulator was undermining its business, Gas set out a plan to increase earnings and cash flow. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, said the group was at the start of a 'complete and radical transformation'. He also promised an 'aggressive' dividend policy, reversing earlier threats to cut the pay-out. Nevertheless, Gas's shares fell by over 3 per cent. Investors appear to like the change in language but are waiting to see whether Gas can deliver the goods. There can be no guarantee. Gas is looking to exploration in the UK continental shelf and overseas investments as the source of profits growth. But it has yet to prove it has the skills to succeed in these markets. The group's exploration and development costs of Pounds 5 per barrel of oil equivalent are higher than those of world leaders. There are also doubts over what Gas brings to overseas investments. The group claims its competitive advantage comes from experience in all parts of the gas chain - from the 'drill bit right the way through to the burner tip'. But one wonders how well managers who have grown up in a monopoly culture will cope in free-wheeling third world markets. Mr Richard Giordano, Gas's relatively new chairman, was candid enough to admit that 'our commercial skills are limited' and promised to recruit two new executive directors from outside the group. Investing in Gas is now largely a bet on how successful he will be in changing its culture.</p>

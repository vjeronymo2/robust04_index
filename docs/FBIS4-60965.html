There will be no obstacles, such as customs barriers, double  taxation. Currency exchange points will be opened. Steps taken  by the governments to improve goods turnover and goods exchange  as well as regulation of labor inflow and outflow between the  states will positively influence the economic situation in the  region. Further enhancement of economic cooperation will lead  to a better mechanism, which will facilitate constructive  interaction and help resolve a number of political problems that  are common in the region as well. It concerns efficient,  mutually beneficial and peaceful co-habitation of different  ethnic groups in Central Asia, which will become a stabilizing  factor of the ethnic situation in the region.

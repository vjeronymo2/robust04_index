			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / EC says Russia must take UK beef RUSSIA will have to accept British beef as part of European Community aid if emergency food deliveries are to continue as planned, European Commission officials said yesterday, writes our foreign staff. One official said Russia's rejection of the free UK beef - because of fears it might be contaminated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy or 'mad cow disease' - could have been prompted by rival EC beef producers seeking orders from the former Soviet republics, which will get EC food credits to pay for them. The Commission's agriculture management committee decides tomorrow on aid deliveries and 'it goes without saying that there will be further consignments of British beef', a Commission official said. Britain expressed irritation at the delays in obtaining Russian clearance for British beef sent as part of EC aid, and a Foreign Office minister hinted that food aid policy to Russia might have to be reconsidered. Mrs Lynda Chalker, overseas development minister, said: 'If they are going to react like this we have lots of other things to do, not only with our beef but with our time.' Brussels is concerned that Russia's initial refusal of a 120-tonne consignment of UK beef could lead to a disastrous new consumer scare over meat safety. The British beef came from intervention stockpiles, financed by the EC to keep meat prices up, and last night had arrived in Murmansk, where it was to be canned. Editorial comment, Page 16</p>

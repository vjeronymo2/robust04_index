			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ray Hartley] </F>   [Excerpt] The first cracks in the DP's [Democratic Party]  traditional big-business support base appeared this week when  Anglo American directors Clem Sunter and Michael O'Dowd placed  their support for Frances Kendall's Federal Party [FP] on the  record. Anglo American and De Beers have for years been regarded  as the DP's most important business backers. Mr O'Dowd is  chairman of the Anglo and De Beers Chairman's Fund, while Mr  Sunter is the head of Anglo's Scenario Planning Department.    DP leader Zach de Beer said he would not comment on whether  or not Anglo and De Beers continued to back his party. "That is  for them to say," he added. And DP Transvaal leader Tony Leon  dismissed the Federal Party, saying it would have as much effect  as "a sneeze in a thunderstorm".    Mr Sunter, whose "high road, low road" scenario sketch  largely coincided with the views of the DP and its predecessor,  the Progressive Federal Party, said he was in favour of the FP's  policy of decentralisation of power. "I haven't seen the (FP's)  manifesto, but I'm betting on the lady. Frances is an  outstanding person with a lot of spunk," he said.    In a statement released through the FP, Mr O'Dowd said: "I  firmly support the constitutional proposals of the new FP. They  are not wildly idealistic, as their critics will claim, but are  based on the long experience of some very successful countries.  Although the FP is obviously not going to form a government, I  believe it is well worth voting for."    Miss Kendal said this week her party was aiming for five  percent of the April vote.

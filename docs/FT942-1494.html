			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / The Corfu Summit: EU leaders at mercy of hijacked agenda The European summit which opens today on the Greek island of Corfu will produce stunning scenery and snapshots for the photo-album. President Boris Yeltsin of Russia has made a flying visit. The prime ministers of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway will officially sign their accession treaties to the European Union. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy makes his first appearance at an international summit since his rightist coalition, Forza Italia, swept to power. Mr Berlusconi is a new leader with some questionable political allies in search of respectability which the EU family offers. The Alpine and Nordic leaders are on the brink of entry into an expanded Union of 16 members, though only Austria has passed the popular test of a referendum on membership. Mr Yeltsin, who was dining with the Twelve last night, will today sign a new 'partnership' accord. Viewed alongside Moscow's agreement this week to join Nato's Partnership for Peace, the EU pact suggests that Russia is starting to find its place in a wider Europe after the collapse of the former Soviet Union. The question is whether the Corfu summit will produce much more than a few snapshots and a siesta for the ailing Greek prime minister, Mr Andreas Papandreou. At first sight, the omens do not look especially promising. To their dismay, EU leaders have allowed the two-day meeting to be hijacked by the struggle over the successor to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. Efforts to cool tempers have met with limited success; but there is still no sign of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister backed by France and Germany, or Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, dropping out of the race. Tonight's dinner discussion among the 12 prime ministers is sure to produce sparks. Yet it would be misleading to focus on the 'horse race' to succeed Mr Delors. Several other items are on the Corfu agenda which, though they may not produce immediate decisions, are still important. Among the chief topics are: The European Commission's White Paper on growth and employment. Mr Delors will urge EU leaders not to be seduced by the incipient economic recovery, but to renew efforts to improve labour market flexibility and lower employers' costs in order to tackle unemployment in Europe, nearing the 20m mark. Leaders will also discuss revised macro-economic guidelines which propose strict budget and wage discipline in order to prepare for the planned single European currency. Trans-European networks. EU leaders are likely to give the go-ahead for 11 priority road and rail projects designed to improve west-east transport links. But Mr Delors is unlikely to persuade the prime ministers to approve extra funding for the projects through fresh European Commission borrowing. The UK, Germany and the Netherlands argue that the European Investment Bank has plenty of credit available. Restructuring of the Ukrainian nuclear industry, including the closure of Chernobyl. Leaders want to prepare for a joint EU position at the G7 summit in Naples next month. The 1996 inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty. Leaders are expected to set up a working group to study constitutional issues and streamlined decision-making to prepare for a Union of up to 25 members. Germany and the Benelux countries want the European Parliament to be represented in the working group; but the UK and France are opposed. Italian milk. The row over the way Italy exceeds its milk production quota seems certain to resurface in Corfu. Brussels says Italy has not cut its output in line with commitments two years ago. Italy wants higher quotas and the end to UK-led court action to reverse a Commission decision to cut fines against Rome. The dispute could block an increase in EU spending on regional aid from next year. Greece is likely to push for an early start to EU accession negotiations with Cyprus; but her partners seem unlikely to commit themselves to the Greek target date of January 1, 1995. One of the least contentious items appears to a Franco-German proposition to tackle racism and xenophobia, through education programmes and cultural exchange. The German chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, is keen to use the Union statement as political cover for cracking down on right-wing racism at home; but Italy may interpret the declaration as an indirect attack on neo-fascists in the Berlusconi government.</p>

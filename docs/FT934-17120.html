			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: ICL UK chief to step down next year MR JOHN Gardner, chairman of ICL UK and one of the Japanese-owned computer company's top four executives, is stepping down from his responsibilities and moving to a part time role early next year. The move, which had not been expected, will fuel speculation over a successor to Mr Peter Bonfield, ICL's chairman and chief executive, who has been in charge of the company since 1984. Mr Bonfield, 49, has been given much of the credit for transforming a crisis-ridden lame duck into Europe's most consistently profitable computer manufacturer. He began his career with Texas Instruments, however, and is known to want to work again in the US. He has given assurances that he will not leave ICL until it is floated on the UK stock market. At the beginning of the year ICL appointed three group executive directors to take charge of the main business sectors. Mr Gardner, 51, was given services including manufacturing and outsourcing. Mr Ninian Eadie, 56, has charge of volume products including personal computers and Mr Richard Livesey-Haworth, 47, manages industry solutions including retail and financial systems. It had been anticipated that Mr Bonfield's successor would be chosen from this group. Mr Gardner said that he had planned for some years to move to a part time role after the age of 50. His chief objective, which he had achieved, had been to make a success of ICL UK and he had no ambition to run the whole of ICL. He would remain associated with the company and work with Mr Bonfield on special projects. He would also work directly with Fujitsu. Mr Gardner's role as head of services and as a member of the executive director's group will be taken by Mr Paul Whitwam, 48, who has been responsible for ICL's operations outside western Europe and the Americas. No date has been set for the flotation though financial advisers have been appointed. If market conditions improve, it could be within two years.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Scottish Amicable Scottish Amicable is not the first UK life insurer to see continental Europe as a land of opportunity. Changes in European law mean that its new Dublin-based company will be able to sell the same products in Naples as in Nether Wallop. The flowering of independent financial advisers in countries such as Germany is especially to its liking. Others such as Commercial Union and J. Rothschild Assurance, in which Scottish Amicable has an equity interest, favour building ties with overseas banks. Whichever approach proves more successful, the reasoning behind overseas expansion is not difficult to fathom. With around 250 life insurance companies operating in the UK, the domestic market looks hopelessly overcrowded. The emergence of banc - assurance - and the steady erosion of ties with banks and building societies that comes with it - is making matters worse. Since only a quarter of the Pounds 100m raised from the bond market in December has been sunk into the European venture, Scottish Amicable can afford an initiative closer to home. The company has set its face against building a sales force of its own, on the grounds that such investment is rarely profitable. Buying an unquoted competitor, slashing overheads and running off its existing business - the approach being explored by Sir Mark Weinberg - might yield a decent profit. Unless the move really strengthened Scottish Amicable's competitive position, though, such opportunism holds little appeal.</p>

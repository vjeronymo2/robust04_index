			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Tiny Rowland names joint chief executive Tiny Rowland and Dieter Bock explained yesterday how a new joint chief executive arrangement between the two men would operate at Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate. Mr Rowland, who has run the company for the past 31 years, is likely to spend more time in Africa, while German financier Mr Bock will focus on financing. The main aim was to continue to cut borrowings, he said. Although Mr Rowland named Mr Bock as his successor, he said he intended to continue as joint chief executive for at least three years.

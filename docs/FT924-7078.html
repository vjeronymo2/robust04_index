			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: BA's globalisation plan on target BRITISH Airways yesterday issued a veiled profits warning for the second half of this year while insisting that its longer term plan to become a global carrier through partnerships and acquisitions remained on course. After reporting a 22.7 per cent fall to Pounds 136m in pre-tax profits in its second quarter, Lord King, chairman, said trading conditions were likely to stay 'uncertain' for the rest of the year ending March 1993. But he said the company had made 'significant headway' in its efforts to become a global carrier during the last six months. Projects included the proposed Dollars 750m (Pounds 497m) investment in USAir, the Dan-Air takeover , the setting up of a new German subsidiary, Deutsche BA, the acquisition of a large minority stake in the French regional carrier TAT, and the planned launch next summer of Air Russia, a joint venture with Aeroflot, with a few services from Moscow to other large European cities. BA is also considering bidding for a stake in Qantas, the Australian carrier which Canberra plans to privatise. But this global expansion strategy faces a number of hurdles. The biggest undoubtedly involves BA's proposed acquisition of a 44 per cent stake in USAir, which is still being fiercely opposed by the three largest US carriers (American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines) unless they can secure greater access into the UK market. Both Lord King and Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, remained confident yesterday that the USAir deal would win US government approval by the transaction's deadline of December 24. Lord King said Mr Andrew Card, the US Transportation Secretary, had recently promised a decision by Christmas Eve. 'We are co-operating fully with the proceeding and remain confident that we will achieve a positive decision,' he added. But the deal is still bogged down over US demands for open access for US carriers into London's Heathrow airport, BA's home base. So far, UK government negotiators have offered the US a gradual process of greater liberalisation in air services between the two countries in return for US approval of the BA-USAir deal. US airline executives said in London this week that there were no signs of progress in these negotiations. Without a breakthrough, it is difficult to see the US government clearing the deal. This in turn would represent a setback for BA since the alliance with USAir is the single biggest component in its globalisation strategy. Lord King would not be drawn yesterday on the possible consequences of US government rejection of the USAir deal. 'If there is no approval, the next day will be Christmas day; we will see where we are and have a look inside our stocking,' he said. BA is also still awaiting approval from the French and European Commission regulatory authorities for its Pounds 17.3m acquisition of a 49.9 per cent stake in TAT, which would give BA a strong foothold in the French domestic market. Air France is leading a lobbying campaign to block the deal but Sir Colin said BA expected to receive regulatory clearance by the beginning of 1993.</p>

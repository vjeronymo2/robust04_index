I. Kryukov, V. A. Tolstoy, and G. V. </F> Dolgopolova, Division of Protection and Rational Utilization of  Natural Resources, Academy of Sciences of Tadjikistan, under the  rubric: BRIEF COMMUNICATIONS; UDC 575.11:502.7(575.3)]    [Text] The Vakhsh River valley is a region of intense  agricultural production, the base of which is cotton  cultivation. The cultivation of the cotton plant over the last  three decades has been accompanied by the intensive use of  pesticides and mineral fertilizers. Some of the toxic agents  have been carried away from the fields into natural ecosystems.  Two large chemical enterprises are operating in the Vakhsh River  basin, the Tadzhikkhimprom production association (TKP PA) and  the Vakhsh nitrogenous fertilizer plant (VNFP), as well as many  other industrial enterprises, the exhausts and effluents of  whose production enter the environment. The level of chemical  pollution of the Vakhsh River valley ecosystems has been studied  quite actively; however, studies devoted to the real ecological  consequences of pollution have been studied considerably less.  The genetic aspects of chemical pollution of the Vakhsh River  Valley ecosystems remain essentially unstudied. Some of the  results obtained at the first stage of the resolution of this  problem are presented in this paper.    In all, 102 mice (Mus musculus) from 13 samples  were studied. The number of animals in the samples ranged from  three to eleven; the average size of the samples was eight. The  sites the mice were trapped with indication of the sample  number, corresponding to the number on the map (see figure), the  number of animals trapped, the sex ratio (females : males), and  the date of trapping are presented below.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-98A>      Diagrammatic map of trapping sites of animals.

The cytogenetic preparations were made up from bone marrow  cells (Lee, 1969), and stained with Romanowskys azure-eosin.  Chromosome injuries were recorded in accordance with  recommendations set forth in methodological studies (Nemtseva,  1970; Methods of Analysis..., 1975; Human ChromosomesS, 1985;  Evans, 1976). The frequencies of chromosomal aberrations in the  mice from natural populations were compared with the spontaneous  frequency of aberrations in intact, random-bred laboratory mice.  The statistical analysis of the data was carried out using the  one-factor analysis of variance method (Glotov, et al., 1982).  The investigation results are presented in the table.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-99A>      Chromosomal Aberrations in House Mice in Samples from Natural Populations of the Vakhsh Valley </FIG>     A large proportion of the samples of the wild mice was taken  in agricultural fields. The statistical analysis of the results  obtained suggests a high level of chromosomal disorders in the  majority of these. In 11 samples out of 13 the frequency of  chromosomal aberrations was statistically significantly higher  than in the control at a significance level of 0.001, and in  one, at 0.01.    The chromosomal disorders in mice inhabiting the zone of the  influence of the industrial discharges of the TKP PA were  investigated in greater detail. This association produces  caustic soda, liquid chlorine, hydrogen chloride and fluoride,  calcium hypochlorite powder, and chlorinated lime. Seven sample  were studied in this region (Nos. 1-7). In only one of these did  the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in the somatic cells  not exceed the control value; in the remaining cases the number  of chromosomal aberrations was statistically significantly  higher than in the control sample.    Six samples were taken south of the Yavan region. In five of  these the frequency of chromosomal aberrations was significantly  higher than in the control. The sewer effluents from the cotton  fields are discharged into many oxbow lakes located on the lower  courses of Vakhsh. The sewer waters contain pesticides which are  found in the water, the bottom deposits, and aquatic and  near-shore vegetation in large quantities. It is entirely  probable that the high frequency of chromosomal aberrations in  the mice of samples nos. 8-10 is the result of intense pollution  of the near-shore biotopes with pesticides. The fish-protective  measures at the Kuybyshev fish farm have evidently also been  reflected to some degree in the aberrations in the mice living  along the shores of ponds; it is lower than in other samples,  but at the same time statistically significantly higher than the  spontaneous level of aberrations in the control. The animals of  samples Nos. 12 and 13 were trapped in cotton fields after a  period of intensive chemical treatments. Therefore the high  frequency of aberrations in the mice is entirely understandable.  In this context, the low frequency of aberrations in sample No.  11, also taken in a cotton field, is somewhat unexpected. We  were unable to establish the intensity of the chemical  treatments of the latter. It is possible that the low frequency  of aberrations is the consequence of the introduction in  particular farms of integrated and biological methods of  combating cotton pests. The low frequency of disorders in sample  No. 11 is probably the result of its small size. We were unable  to increase the size of this sample.    The data we obtained suggest that the intensity of the  mutational process is significantly increased in wild rodents at  the existing level of chemical pollution of the Vakhsh valley.  Chromosomal aberrations probably arise with similar intensity in  the cells of other mammals. Extrapolating the information  obtained to the human population of the Vakhsh valley, the  existence of a real danger of an increase in hereditary diseases  among the population must be hypothesized. These data once again  underscore the necessity of conducting constant genetic  monitoring, both of natural populations of plants and animals,  and of human populations as well, in the cotton-sowing regions  of the republic.  iterature Cited    Evans, H.

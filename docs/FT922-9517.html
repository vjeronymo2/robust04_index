			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Major cuts at secrecy by naming MI6 chief MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday foreshadowed a significant shift towards more open government with a pledge to provide a legal framework for Britain's Secret Intelligence Service. His public acknowledgement of the existence of the SIS, the first by any prime minister since the forerunner of the country's spy establishment was set up in 1909, came as he presented his legislative programme in the Queen's Speech. The programme includes bills to pave the way for the privatisation of British Coal and parts of British Rail, as well as to implement the Maastricht treaties on European union. A finance bill, due within the next 10 days, will reintroduce those measures in Mr Norman Lamont's Budget which were dropped because of the general election. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Major said one of his most immediate aims was 'to sweep away some of the cobwebs of secrecy which needlessly veil too much of government business'. He confirmed that among the first steps would be publication of the details of the cabinet committees which make most important government decisions and of the guidance issued to ministers on their personal financial interests. Mr William Waldegrave, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, had been asked to review other areas where 'excessive secrecy' might be removed. The prime minister then told MPs that it was time to acknowledge officially the existence of the SIS, commonly known as MI6. It was responsible for foreign intelligence designed to support the government's foreign, defence, security and economic policies. He confirmed that the service works directly to the foreign secretary and the prime minister, and that its current chief is Sir Colin McColl. Sir Colin is listed in reference books as a senior official at the Foreign Office. MI5, the domestic counterpart of the SIS, was given a legal basis in 1989. This year, Mr Major broke with tradition by making public the appointment of Mrs Stella Rimmington as its director. Between them the two services have a budget of Pounds 185m for the current financial year. Mr Major insisted that the government would continue to refuse to comment on the activities of the two services because of the risk that would bring to their effectiveness and staff. Senior Whitehall officials said this meant that the legislation to place the SIS on a statutory basis was unlikely to subject it to direct scrutiny by MPs. Instead the legislation is expected to be modelled on that introduced for MI5, which provided for limited rights of redress by the public. Mr Major's first legislative programme as an elected prime minister included a range of bills designed to enhance individual choice and ownership, and to improve the responsiveness to public sector services. Among the most significant measures in a parliamentary session which will last until the autumn of 1993 are bills to push ahead with the government's education reforms, to tighten the law on asylum and to set up an urban regeneration agency.</p>

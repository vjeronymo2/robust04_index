			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / In, out, share the work about: David Goodhart tests how far labour flexibility has reduced UK unemployment The UK labour market is behaving with all the unpredictability of the weather at Wimbledon. As the economy came out of recession, unemployment began falling earlier than most experts had expected. It stopped falling last summer, continued falling in the autumn, and then stopped again in January. At the core of most explanations for this erratic behaviour is the notion that the labour market has experienced a significant change in flexibility. The government says that its policies of promoting flexibility - by, for instance, reducing the power of trade unions - are responsible for the earlier than expected fall in the jobless total. That is the success story Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was parading at the two-day Detroit job summit yesterday. Similarly, businessmen (see below) agree that increased flexibility explains the unexpected fall in unemployment, though they claim the credit for themselves. But critics say that far from being a straight-forward positive development, flexibility has merely allowed full-time jobs to be repackaged as part-time ones, creating an illusion of more work in the economy. Some go further, adding that whatever the advantages of flexibility to individual employers, it has the big disadvantage of increasing employee insecurity, damaging consumer confidence in a fragile economy. Amid the conflicting explanations, there is one certainty: unemployment has been falling. Even using International Labour Organisation figures (which are based on survey evidence and are judged a better indicator than the government's unemployment benefit claimant statistics), the jobless total fell by nearly 100,000 between winter 1992 and winter 1993. Most City analysts expect that trend to continue when the government tomorrow publishes its seasonally-adjusted total for February. The main reason for falling unemployment has been a reduction in the flow of people coming on to the jobs market. Companies have been sacking fewer people and the number of young people coming on to the market is lower than in the early 1980s, thanks to demographic changes and more pupils staying on at school after reaching 16. More debatable is whether many jobs are being created. This does not seem to be the case in manufacturing, where employment has been sliding since 1968, with only a slight upward blip in the late 1980s. In the economy as a whole, there was a small increase of 67,000 in the number of employees in work between January and September 1993, from 21.183m to 21.250m, according to the Labour Force Survey, published by the Department of Employment. But over the same period the number of full-time jobs fell by 40,000 and part-time jobs increased by more than 100,000. Thus, when the figures are calculated in terms of 'full-time equivalent' jobs, the increase is negligible. Further supporting the conclusion that work is being spread around rather than growing, are figures for working hours, which fell from 936m per week in 1992 to 927m in 1993 (the 1990 peak was just over 1bn). The idea that work is being spread may seem beneficial, but many people are being excluded: employment market experts say job losses are concentrated among lower-skilled male workers whose partners do not work (voluntarily or because the welfare system provides a disincentive to enter employment) while new part-time jobs are in general being taken by women whose partners are in work. There is some evidence that the male share of part-time work is starting to rise, as manufacturing follows the service sector in increasing its use of part-time labour, but men still constitute only 15 per cent of the 5.9m part-time workforce. The government says, nevertheless, that growth in part-time employment is a welcome development, shortening the time lag between changes in economic output and unemployment levels. This has some truth to it - but is only part of the story. According to a recent analysis by the US investment bank Goldman Sachs, the main reason why unemployment fell faster after the end of the latest recession than after the 1981-83 downturn was because the working population was growing faster in the early 1980s. Another important part of the improvement, was the result of a 'bounce-back'; over pessimistic employers shed labour too rapidly at the time of the autumn 1992 European Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis and had to increase employment when the impact on the economy turned out to be less detrimental than feared. But it was also, says Goldman Sachs, due to an improvement in labour market flexibility which led to employers taking on more part-time workers instead of increasing overtime. As a result, the average hours worked by full-time employees fell between summer 1992 and summer 1993 from 36.6 hours a week to 36.3. So is Mr Kenneth Clarke right to claim that the current government is responsible for creating that more flexible market? If he is claiming credit for the growth of part-time work, the answer is no. The weakening of union power in the 1980s may have removed an obstacle to the increasing use of part-timers and outside contractors. But many of the legislative and financial incentives for employers to take on part timers - such as exemption from many work-related benefits - have been largely unchanged for 25 years. Moreover, contrary to the view that part-time work has only recently started to accelerate, it increased at a slightly faster rate in the more regulated and union-dominated labour market of the 1970s than in the 1980s. In 1971 the number of part-time employees was 3.3m or 15.3 per cent of all employees, by 1981 the figure had jumped to 4.5m and 21.2 per cent of all employees. By the end of 1991 the total had increased to 5.7m or 26.4 per cent of all employees. This suggests that the rise in part-time work is driven as much by broader business and social trends - such as the growing demand of married women for part-time employment - as by deregulation. For that reason this month's House of Lords ruling, based on European Union law, that part-time workers should have the same rights over redundancy pay and unfair dismissal as full timers, may prove to have relatively little impact on demand for part-timers. However, the government can claim some credit for other factors which may be contributing to job creating flexibility. The growing divergence between the pay of skilled and less skilled workers, encouraged by measures such as the abolition of wages councils, may have prevented demand for low skill labour falling further. The reduction in benefit payments relative to income from employment, may also have encouraged some people to accept jobs which they would not have done in the 1970s. The government is on firmer ground in claiming credit for creating more flexibility among those with jobs. Over the past decade, government-inspired curbs on union power, as well as the shadow of high unemployment, has certainly reduced resistance to moves by employers to take more control over pay and working practices. The corollary of this new flexibility within companies, according to some analysts, is a pervasive insecurity in the British workplace. Mr Eric Salama, joint managing director of the Henley Centre, says that the combination of employment insecurity and the feeling that the state will no longer provide for people is having a strong impact on consumer confidence and savings. Nearly one-fifth of respondents to a recent Henley survey said that concerns about job security had prevented them from making major purchases in the last 12 months. However, worries about greater insecurity in the workforce may be exaggerated. Employment department figures on the number of people in 'atypical work' - casual, temporary, contract or seasonal - show a slight fall over the past 10 years. The total fell from 1.08m in 1984 to 1.05m in 1993, although within that total, contract work has doubled to 600,000. It may be that such statistics are not picking up other aspects of a more flexible and less secure labour market: the increase in the proportion of the working population who fear losing their jobs and the increase in job-hopping. But it may also be that consumer spending, now back at pre-recession levels, can adjust to the new labour market flexibility thanks to the creativity of the consumer finance industry, for example by adapting hire purchase schemes to be more like leasing deals. In any case, recent improvements in labour market flexibility are unlikely to be reversed: as markets and technology change rapidly, the relationship between employers and employees is becoming more fluid. The British experience is that not everyone benefits; the picture is still of some people moving into employment - but others moving out. That suggests flexibility alone is insufficient to make a large dent in the unemployment mountain.</p>

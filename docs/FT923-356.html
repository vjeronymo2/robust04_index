			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Municipal insurer runs for cover: The troubles that are forcing MMI to look for a rescuer LOCAL government leaders are reflecting ruefully on events which led to the possible demise of Municipal Mutual Insurance, the local-authority-owned company. For most of its 89 years Municipal Mutual stuck to the solid but unexciting business of insuring everything from schools to dustcarts - it is the insurer for nine out of 10 metropolitan, district and county councils. Now it is on the brink of insolvency after expansion into other areas of the insurance market in the 1980s - when it frequently undercut its larger rivals to increase market share - and a sharp increase in claims in the last two years. Led by Mr Andrew McLean, who resigned as chief executive earlier this year, it focused its expansion into motor and home insurance. The group also built up a portfolio of high-risk international commercial insurance in the London market. Between 1987 and 1991 premium income increased from Pounds 397m to Pounds 917m. Mr Mike Shaw, director of finance at Gateshead Metropolitan Council, said: 'They should have stuck to basics. There was never any problem until they were allowed to go into all these new areas.' The company had been a victim of the 1980s enthusiasm for 'privatisation'. Local government leaders were also unhappy about changes to the ownership structure which gave individual policyholders similar voting rights to those of the local authorities themselves. The changes diluted local authority control ahead of the 1989 Local Government Act, which forced local government to divest ownership of commercial businesses, giving management more leeway to pursue expansion. The expansion was followed by deterioration in trading conditions in the insurance industry as a whole, following a spate of bad weather, recession and crime-related losses. Municipal Mutual was exposed to rising claims on its liability business - insuring local authorities against the cost of legal claims for negligence. The group paid out several million pounds to relatives of those killed in the Hillsborough football disaster in 1989. Claims to former residents of Staffordshire children's homes psychologically injured by the 'pindown' disciplinary regime will amount to more than Pounds 2m. Schemes designed to protect local authorities with tight budgets against the cost of stand-ins for teachers absent through illness have also led to losses of millions of pounds. Compensation claims from individuals suffering minor injuries after accidents on poorly maintained streets have increased sharply. Mr Henry Croft Baker, a local authority insurance specialist with the brokers Fenchurch, said authorities had been seen as a 'soft target' by claimants, encouraged to claim by the increasing size of court awards. Overall claims increased to Pounds 906m in 1991, more than three times the level in 1987, leaving Municipal Mutual with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 132m. After increasing provisions to pay for future claims, Municipal Mutual's net assets - assets less liabilities - had declined to Pounds 4.9m. This left it with a solvency margin - assets as a percentage of non-premium income - well below minimum levels normally accepted within the industry. Management was tightened last year when company chairman Mr Maurice Stonefrost, former chief executive of the Greater London Council, who took over at the end of 1990, took a more active role. Premium rates were increased sharply, local authorities asked to retain much larger deductibles (the portion of a claim paid by the buyer) and management controls tightened. In April Municipal Mutual sold its commercial risks business and closed its Australian subsidiary. But the acute shortage of capital combined with the uncertain size of future claims has forced more radical measures. Following Mr McLean's departure in May, Mr Brian Wright, the retiring chief executive of Sun Alliance, was invited in to spearhead efforts to find a buyer, while actuaries from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew have been attempting to calculate the size of future liabilities. In the summer a succession of potential companies - including Britain's Sun Alliance and Eagle Star - examined Municipal Mutual's books. Most were scared off by the company's potential future liabilities. One executive said: 'Although there is no black hole, the business is fundamentally unattractive. The liabilities are just unquantifiable.' Talks with Paris-based Garantie Groupe Mutuelle de Fonctionnaires, which since July has pursued an interest in buying Municipal Mutual, are also understood to have found this issue something of a sticking point. Municipal Mutual insisted yesterday that talks would continue this week. In the meantime some local authorities are looking for alternative cover. The Association of Metropolitan Authorities last week advised members whose policies came up for renewal to buy policies from other insurance companies. Mr Croft Baker estimates that Municipal Mutual has lost as many as 5 per cent of its local authority customers over the past five to six months.</p>

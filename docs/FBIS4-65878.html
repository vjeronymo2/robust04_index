			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hans-Joachim Noack: "Ritchie--Each One Half of </F> Him: About the Rivals, Roman Herzog and Johannes Rau"]    [Text] Ever since he has been seeking the office of federal  president, a somewhat bizarre self-description has been attached  to candidate Roman Herzog. It deals with single-cell organisms,  so-called protozoa.    Such a minute thing, explained the chief of the Karlsruhe  Federal Constitutional Court some time ago in conversation with  Richard von Weizsaecker, reminds him of his career planning: "It  lies quietly in the water; but if something happens to swim by,  it will eat it if it appeals."    This crass punch line, resulting from Herzog's love of  mockery, amused the German head of state, but evidently it also  was food for thought for the nobleman who attaches importance to  seriousness. At least the top jurist believes "that after this  remark, the president is not so sure about me." He suspects his  party friend of having leaked the remark to the press.    His opponent, Johannes Rau, learned of it via TV, and he is  also mulling it over. Although the Social Democratic competitor  for the move to Berlin's Bellevue castle avoids derogatory  statements about the Christian Unionist, the "strange remark"  does surprise him a bit.    The North Rhine-Westphalian head of government does not  necessarily wish to question his rival's fitness for office. But  it is "difficult to understand," as he says in his favorite  Wuppertal pub, the general kind of feeling and thinking which  might be concealed behind this comparison: Is a man of  reputation allowed to make it so easy on himself?    These doubts are probably strengthened by the considerable  devotion with which the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]  representative pursues his goal. Apparently cool to the core,  Professor Dr Roman Herzog, 60, talks his candidacy down to an  "attractive possibility;" Johannes Rau, three years older, lives  and suffers it.    Never before in the republic's presidential elections has a  candidate more openly presented his claim than does the  minister-president from Duesseldorf. He considers himself the  man with the necessary power of integration ("I have the gift of  bringing people together"), and the great majority of Germans  sees it the same way.    For weeks now, hardly a day passes that Rau is not planting  these virtues in their heads in interviews (or even at  riflemen's festivals or boat christenings). "I want to be it,"  he summarizes his dream in the simplest sentence possible, then  underpins it with polling figures: One only has to think of the  numbers which the pollsters with great regularity have at the  ready.    The yearning Social Democrat speaks of the "clear signals  that also reach me;" he is inspired by the force of  autosuggestion to which he submits gladly. Can the Federal  Assembly really dare to "pass by" such facts? In the end,  "perhaps the moving van will yet come," he says hopefully at a  spring festival which his local SPD club of Katernberg is  celebrating.    But this confidence is soon followed by a distressing drop  in  mood. He quietly laments the "cemented majority conditions"  among the delegates. The candidate realizes that the ideas of  the people and of people's representatives unfortunately do not  coincide.    He may be especially upset by the supposed callousness with  which the favored rival, Roman Herzog, seems to accept his big  chance. But the widespread impression, that the rustic Bavarian  in this competition plays only the role of an almost indifferent  stoic, is not correct.    Like Johannes Rau, whose tough battle for approval by the  electors goes much further than what his Bonn party headquarters  is doing, in truth the Christian Democrat also strains mightily.  The protozoa metaphor and other self-complacent utterances at  best give information on the specific behavioral technique of  the portly jurist.    Even the conservative FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE believed that  Herzog only pretends "a certain friendly indifference," after  the Union had just dropped its Steffen Heitmann. Perhaps  frustration--that its political favorite had been shot  down--flowed into this harsh portrait, but the newspaper is not  all that far off: For years, the second choice of the CDU/CSU  [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] for a  successor to Richard von Weizsaecker has always felt himself to  be really the first choice.    It is not a chief constitutional judge living in the  Karlsruhe ivory tower who now vies for the highest office in the  country, but a sturdy homo politicus. He knows the world and its  wiles--and above all the laws of a media democracy. Numerous  homey stories are proof of that. For BILD-ZEITUNG ("Washing  dishes relaxes me wonderfully"), the master of the house even  has himself photographed at the kitchen sink.    What does it matter that he reaches into the pile of dirty  plates in a snow-white shirt and starched cuffs: The performance  fulfills the purpose of presenting to the insufficiently  informed public a high performer in the form of a simple,  average citizen.    From the standpoint of psychological condition, he deals in  a  much livelier fashion with his candidacy than the more tired,  formerly merry drinker of Pils [beer] and teller of anecdotes  from North Rhine-Westphalia. And he also says it: If "Rau is  certainly more popular," he "who for years had been parked in  Karlsruhe, is probably less used up."    So a duel has developed subtly, in which the different  personality images have acquired a certain importance--but the  alternatives as to substance much less so. Just as the two  embattled people's parties are beginning to resemble each other  more and more, their candidates for the presidential office  overall represent the same objectives.    In the case of "Brother Johannes," the son of a Pietist  preacher, this transborder impetus is almost a characteristic.  The 1987 candidate for the chancellorship, under the motto  "reconciliation instead of division," cannot help himself. Again  he sees himself as an "offering for all."    Roman Herzog's trend toward the political center, on the  other hand, derives from somewhat more profane drives. Sent to  Bonn as undersecretary by Rhineland-Palatinate  Minister-President Helmut Kohl over two decades ago, the former  university president initially proved to be a strongly  conservative careerist. Later as interior minister in the  Baden-Wuerttemberg cabinet of Lothar Spaeth, he tried to subdue  the peace movement with riot control gas.    But times have changed. The societal counterforce, in the  fall of 1983 holding out in front of the Mutlangen missile site,  has decamped--and the roughneck from Stuttgart has learned his  lesson. Meanwhile, the basic attitude of the Federal  Constitutional Court's president is considered  bourgeois-liberal, albeit not immune to relapses into rigid  law-and-order thinking.    So what choice is there? Are not both--as could be heard  regretfully here and there at the beginning of their  candidacy--protagonists of the old FRG that passed away? Does  the gentle Social Democrat perhaps warm the heart a little more,  while the Christian Unionist offers himself more as the man for  everyday life that has become grayer?    The office of federal president is "something so singular,"  candidate Johannes Rau points out, that basically there is only  one question: "Who is the right one for the next 2,000 days?"    Thus speaks the public favorite who knows his worth.  Encouraged by pollsters, he would like to free the decision from  the tangled mass of tactical dodges and superficial powerplays.  The North Rhine-Westphalian government head insinuates that, if  things are aboveboard, the answer is practically obvious.    That is also the reason why he abstains from substantive  pronouncements. Why should he "artificially puff himself up" and  proclaim political guidelines which everyone already knows? The  old diehard who, after all, has won an absolute majority three  times in the republic's most populated land, believes he has  made a sufficient impression.    And moreover: For many years, has he not embodied those  characteristics which the fathers of the constitution had in  mind when they created this office so limited in power? Even in  hours of doubt, it makes him happy to see this confirmed. "What  is needed," says Rau in a strange mixture of humility and pride,  "is the bonding power which I have."    For the time being, Roman Herzog refrains from circulating  such self-certainties. Naturally, he also sees the essence of  his possible future job in working for a communal spirit--but  somehow with less ardor. There will be days, the judge  phantasizes drily about the work, in which he will live in the  situation of an improviser: "What's coming up? What are you  going to do next week?"    Since the beginning of the complicated nomination procedure,  the Christian Democrat has demonstrated his inclination toward  self-reliance. He is his own man who will no longer move into  Villa Hammerschmidt [in Bonn], but wants to represent the new  Germany in Berlin.    The Bavarian from Landshut drawn toward charismatic types,  sees Italian Sandro Pertini as his model. Just as he, a  socialist with patriarchal bearing, demonstrated fearlessness in  the early 1980's, so Herzog, with conservative values, will "hit  hard if necessary." He proves it impressively when he now,  without many scruples, rejects dual citizenship.    Is this just a sterner version of populism with which he  confronts Rau's subtler stance? Or, to give it a positive spin:  Sometimes it appears as if the two potential heirs of Richard  von Weizsaecker ("Ritchie") personified his virtues, each one  half. The "red" candidate likes himself in the role of patron  and paterfamilias who values consensus above all else; the  "black" candidate loves the aura of the contrary, salutary  troublemaker from whom not even the chancellor may feel safe.    The Duesseldorf head of government eyes this part of his  rival with the distrust of the political professional polished  over decades. In his cautious manner, he says that he has "a  little bit the feeling that the Herzog program is called Herzog"  -- in his opinion, a daring ego trip. Will he be able to last  long in the fragile power structure into which the  constitutional organ of the federal presidency is fitted?    But then he also has other moments. Still grappling with the  fact that he quit school before getting the junior high school  diploma, self-taught Rau is plagued by noticeable inferiority  complexes. They force him into tendential behavior anxiously  rooted in norms. A "German professor" (Herzog on Herzog) is  hardly burdened by that.    But the Social Democrat is yet too perceptive not to know  about the reverse side of his public assessment. "He's nice, a  good Skat player, but offers nothing of substance...an amiable  nonscorer," he bravely summarizes the list of critical remarks.    Naturally, he is hurt by such accusations. It has never been  his business "to pour the gravy of harmony over everything"--and  he immediately offers an example of something that certainly  cannot be reconciled: "American Fruit and the banana pickers!"  the minister president says emotionally. But fortunately, such  contrasts no longer exist in our country.    Thus he reaches energetically into faraway worlds, while the  situation at home worries him only conditionally. Whether the  candidate speaks about genetic technology or nuclear energy, the  role of the Bundeswehr or the republic within the global  scale--he is always concerned with a possibly balanced position,  anchored "between curse and blessing."    His rival Roman Herzog, accused of "liberal  unpredictability"  by such as Edmund Stoiber, dares to go further. Inclined toward  intervention, he thinks out loud about this and that, supports  plebiscites, or advocates a limit on speed. "In politics," he  demands grumpily, one must "speak in much plainer terms."    This creates the impression that the highest German judge,  in  case he is elected, might turn to `res publica' more  directly--an advantage of the more vigorous temperament. For  within the scope of their understanding of the state and  society, the rivals differ only in minor details.    Roman Herzog ("I am a totally undramatic person") might use  more of a shirt-sleeve approach with his fellow citizens than  fine-boned Rau. The Bavarian thinks the fight over the holiday  to be sacrificed for nursing care insurance is "simply  laughable." And he wants to be able to say that, even as federal  president.    The amateur historian trained himself in this provocative  poise through a weakness for historical dimensions, developed  early on. Contemporary man, by immersing himself in the wide  spaces of the respective epochs, learns to calm down--a feeling  which he cultivates. The Protestant likes to relax in one of his  favorite places, the Speyer cathedral. There lie the bones of  Emperor Henry IV, highly esteemed by him; the emperor who went  to Canossa.    Roman Herzog, the highly regarded jurist, at the head of his  class since early youth--but Roman Herzog also in the pose of  one who no longer has to prove it to himself: At age 13, he  taught Latin to his father, an employee in a snuff factory and  later director of a museum; at his riper age, the constitutional  judge after work sits relaxed in front of his TV, watching  commercials. TV chief inspector Derrick is also welcome in his  living room.    In part it is the simple, archaic rules of life from which  the coauthor of the famous Basic Law commentary,  "Maunz-Duerig-Herzog," derives his orientation. The author  headlined his "General Political Science" (1971) with a sentence  from the fairy tale, Rumpelstiltskin: "I am fonder of something  living than of all the treasures of the world!"    However, some of Herzog's general rules--such as his maxim,  "Help yourself and God will help you"--bespeak a rather  rough-and-ready pragmatism permeating even questions of faith.  Thereby the Christian party man probably moves closer to an  increasingly secularized country than the pious Social Democrat.    For Rau is certain that "this world is not living in doom:  There comes something else"--a confidence which he does not  associate with any work of man. That at least is demanded by the  strict Lutheran who still sets the course within him.    But faith can make one strong. The mild revivalist as SPD  functionary has managed to pursue his own cause all the more  purposefully. He has always been determined to conquer leading  party and government offices through embattled candidacies, if  necessary. All these years, the former publishing house  bookseller and journalist has been fascinated by the "political  figure of the mayor."    That he also counts a head of government in this category,  as  its crowning point as it were, explains the remarkable  steadfastness in his present political engagement. As one of the  closest companions of "citizen president" Gustav Heinemann, to  whose second-oldest granddaughter, Christina Delius, Rau is  married, he feels himself additionally predestined.    Thus he would be willing to leave his beloved Wuppertal for  the job of "citizen king" (DIE WOCHE)--and even more: For the  sake of the desired honor, the SPD vice chairman revealed  himself last fall as an astute tactician. "One must stabilize  Heitmann," the candidate urged among his circle of comrades. A  transparent trick to increase his own chances.    All in vain, since it now becomes painfully clearer to him  that his career "is linked to Kohl's fate?" Up to these last  days, Johannes Rau refuses to accept in his heart the probable  defeat.    But no matter whether "the mayor" or the "catalyst" (a  definition of Herzog) will gain the upper hand this coming  Monday [23 May]: The seventh federal president for the first  time in the history of the republic will be a so-called  `later-born.' The two top candidates experienced World War  II--which has again entered the collective consciousness in the  fourth year of the reunited country--as children.    Little Johannes, 12 at that time, learned from his father,  returned from the Soviet Union, about the atrocities by the  Nazis, while the even younger Roman saw the catastrophe with his  own eyes: "An endless line of concentration camp prisoners were  marched by our house." And both experiences still have their  effect.    Thus one of the most convincing assets in the political  balance sheet of Social Democrat Rau is his tireless effort for  reconciliation with the Jews. Because of this engagement, the  University of Haifa bestowed on him an honorary doctorate, and  since then he has been highly welcome, and not only in Israel.  The much-quoted "fisher of men" is one of those who gained  respect abroad as the "good Germans."    Roman Herzog is finding it more difficult when the past is  concerned. He had been education minister under the former naval  judge, Hans Karl Filbinger, and for years served as assistant to  public law specialist Theodor Maunz--a jurist until his old age  incorrigibly tied to the new Nazis.    How does he feel about that? Did nothing ever strike him  when  his father's friend, under whom he did his doctoral work,  maintained closest contacts with Gerhard Frey's German People's  Union?    Well, that's how it is, "...noticed nothing," says the  presidential candidate and mutters a low "perverse" between  clenched teeth; and that is all. To have to talk about the  behavior of his colleagues in the Third Reich (and afterwards)  annoys him visibly.    Does this reflect the stoicism of Roman Herzog who would  rather pursue the larger perception, anyway? He simply likes  "broken personalities"--those of yesterday and today.    The Christian party man with the cool attitude overall wants  "not to get carried away." What will happen, he asks through a  cloud of his cigarillo, if contrary to expectations he is not  elected on 23 May? "Neither Rau nor I can ruin the country."</p>

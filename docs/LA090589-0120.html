			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH READY TO NAME DEMOCRAT AS NON-NUCLEAR ARMS NEGOTIATOR  </P> <P> President Bush is prepared to name James Woolsey Jr., a conservative Democrat  and weapons specialist, as the new American negotiator in 23-nation talks to  reduce non-nuclear forces in Europe, a U.S. official said today.  </P> <P> Security checks have begun on Woolsey, a lawyer who apparently owes his  nomination over two other candidates to his close ties to Brent Scowcroft, the  President's national security adviser, said the official, who spoke on  condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> The two other candidates were Stephen Ledogar, a Foreign Service officer who  now holds the job, and Phil Karber, vice president of BDM Corp. who evidently  had the backing of Vice President Dan Quayle.  </P> <P> Woolsey, 48, was undersecretary of the Navy in the Carter Administration and  has served on the staffs of the National Security Council and the Senate Armed  Services Committee.  </P></p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / The Property Market: Gloom still overwhelms signs of hope HAS the property market hit the bottom? As economic confidence starts to creep back, some of the optimists in the property industry are calling the turn. 'All indicators now point to the bottom of the market having been reached, with the time ripe for institutional investment,' says Edward Erdman, the chartered surveyor. Signs of a revival in confidence are plentiful, if tentative. Property is now so cheap in relation to gilts, that hitherto bearish commentators are recommending that institutions increase their holdings. In fact, yields have risen so far that property is virtually being valued as a fixed-income asset. That has fuelled buying interest from companies and individuals, such as Alan Sugar who sold Pounds 34m of Amstrad shares to go back into the property market. Continental investors, attracted by the reduced currency risk from the UK's entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism are also showing interest. And after two desperately quiet years, cautious buyers have re-emerged for property unit trusts. Appearances, however, may deceive. While certain parts of the property market may have hit bottom, it is far from being a broadly-based recovery. 'Thinly disguised untruths about imminent recovery are very foolish,' comments Mr Rupert Nabarro of Investment Property Databank, which has just conducted an annual review into the investment property market. Moreover, the share market, which has proved a reliable guide to future events, has just pushed property shares relative to the rest of the market to a 22-year low. The reason for caution lies in the divergence between the investment market and the occupiers' market, which has been ravaged by the recession. Concern is focused on the unprecedented problems in the central London office market. Thanks to the overbuilding that followed the deregulation of planning controls and the over-expansion of the financial services industry after Big Bang in 1986, London's office vacancy rate far outstrips the 11 per cent experienced after the 1974 collapse. 'The figures are by any standards - absolute, historical or whatever - awful and imply a collapse in rents in central London,' says Chris Walls of Salomon Brothers. After the 1974 crash, rents fell by 40 per cent from their peak. This time, in Salomon's view, the fall could be just as severe. Some brokers think even this is too optimistic. One believes that rents could fall 60 per cent from their peak. The result is that capital values will probably fall, even if yields partially recover. And a partial recovery is expected even by the bears at Salomon. 'Unfortunately, there is rarely much (if any) correlation between the property market and logic,' says Chris Walls. 'As interest rates fall, the pressure on short-term market operators will ease, and they will no longer find it so urgent to sell at current yield levels.' Another reason for expecting yields to fall is that turnover in much of the market has virtually ground to a halt, thanks to the mismatch between buyers' and sellers' expectations. Once prices do improve, however, the supply of property may vastly increase as institutions and companies resume the rationalisation of their portfolios and banks push more companies into receivership. If so, it is not clear where the demand will come from.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Rental Growth (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------------                     Retail   Office   Industrial   All Properties  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Year to March 91     3.2      0.5        4.9           2.5 Quarter to March 91  0.2     -1.2        0.5          -0.3 Month of March 91    0.0     -0.3        0.1          -0.1  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Investment Property Databank  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

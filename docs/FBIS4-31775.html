			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava June 10 (CTK) -- Premier Jozef Moravcik  told Slovak Radio today he was convinced that Hungarian and  Slovak positions regarding their ethnic minorities would come  closer. "We cannot be indifferent to Slovaks abroad, as the  Hungarian Government cannot be indifferent to Hungarians living  outside Hungary," Moravcik added. The ethnic Hungarians in  Slovakia number about 560,000 people, or 11 percent of  Slovakia's population.    The ethnic minorities issues should be involved in the  Hungarian-Slovak agreement, Moravcik said. This was agreed upon  during his recent meeting with executive deputy chairman of the  Hungarian Socialist Party Imre Szekeres, he added.    Moravcik noted that the present government was ready to  settle the "signpost" law on the bilingual names for towns and  villages in the ethnic language, rejected last week for the  second time in parliament. This time the signpost law should be  submitted as a private member's bill, only on condition that it  will be submitted by a simple majority of Slovak deputies,  Moravcik explained. If the law were rejected for the third  times, it would not be "pleasant" because of domestic and  international situation, he said.</p>

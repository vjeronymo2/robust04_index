			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Experts falter over stock selections / Review of the FT portfolios one year on AT LAST. Proof positive that the 'experts' do not know it all. This time last year the Weekend FT started an experiment. Four portfolios, each holding ten stocks were established. The starting value in every case was almost Pounds 10,000. For one, we asked a selection of ten experts to choose ten stocks each, and bought a portfolio of the ten most popular selections. Against them we pitted three portfolios to model popular theories of investing - one bought shares in companies where directors had recently been buyers, one bought stocks with a high yield (dividend in relation to share price) and one was selected by throwing darts at the FT share price listings. A year on (prices are quoted as of Wednesday's close), the experts are in last place. However, the exercise has also proved that beating the market, or indeed making a profit at all, is a difficult business - all our portfolios lost money, and none of them beat the FT-All Share index. The dartboard portfolio, which almost all neutrals must secretly have wanted to win, finished third, only losing Pounds 112.70 less than the experts did over the year. Bear in mind that prices are quoted mid-price to mid-price and do not include commission - you would not be able to sell these portfolios for the current values shown. So if you want to take on the stock market unaided, it will take a lot of work - simple theories, as this exercise has shown, cannot be guaranteed to work. The results repay examination in closer detail: The Experts' Portfolio How did it happen? The experts can point a finger of blame at the non-executive directors of British Petroleum. Their portfolio lost almost Pounds 400 on BP, one of the bluest of blue chip stocks, and Pounds 95.88 of this went on the day after the news that Robert Horton, the chairman, had been ousted in a boardroom coup. Hindsight also shows why Land Securities, Britain's most powerful property company, was not the best of buys. The property market has underperformed over the last year. Similar factors hit the construction company Tarmac, which has started a disposal programme and in June issued a profits warning. However, Racal Electronics, which split into two companies during the year when Vodafone was floated as a separate entity, repaid faith, as did the unfashionable investment in Associated British Ports. The experts were the only selectors who managed to find ten stocks which all paid out some income during the year. The Directors' Portfolio This bought shares in any company where it was announced that at least three directors had themselves bought shares. This is a crude way to assess directors' activity, and Directus, which produces the Weekend FT's list of directors' share transactions, suggests that the raw data needs to be carefully interpreted. For example, Directus would not have bought Hunterprint, where three directors bought a small amount between them while a fourth disposed of a much larger holding, or ADT, where small purchases followed earlier much larger disposals. But the portfolio still models the idea that directors of a company should know even more about it than City 'experts', and, as the figures show, it has come out in first place. Most of the directors whom the portfolio followed are now sitting on losses, so the system is far from infallible. However, it found some good performers in Barry Wehmiller, the packaging and process machinery manufacturer which reported a Pounds 2.25m pre-tax profit after a loss in the previous year, Manweb one of the newly privatised breed of regional electricity distribution companies and MY Holdings, another packaging company which moved from losses into profit. The High Yield Portfolio Here, performance came closest to what the theory might have predicted. High yielding companies tend to be small, and regarded by marketmakers as risky - hence the need for a high yield before they will buy. A particularly high yield can be corrected either by stopping the dividend, or by raising the share price. So theory would suggest that these stocks will be volatile. If they survive at all, they will outperform. Otherwise they may take a dive. This is exactly what happened. There are very few mediocre performances in this portfolio. Some, like Anglia TV, Bullough, Davis Service, and FKI, maintained their dividends and saw the share price surge. Others, such as Lep Group, Ratners and TVS, cut dividends while the share price dropped. The reasons behind these were well-documented. Ratners, marketing cheap jewellery, was always going to be jeopardised by a consumer recession, and the outspoken comments of its chairman did not help. TVS lost the independent television franchise for south east England in spite of out-bidding its rivals. Meanwhile Bullough is the best-performing stock in all four portfolios, despite announcing a 20 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. The company makes refrigeration and office products, so was vulnerable to the recession, but did not do as badly as the City had feared, or interfere with its dividend - hence the favourable reaction in the share price. Investors throughout the year regarded it as a strong recovery prospect. Overall, the portfolio finished second, and did manage to raise the most income. The Dart Board Portfolio This was the rag-bag which might have been expected. One constituent, the Precious Metals investment trust, was wound up during the year, and replaced by EMAP, which went on to have a good year. TVS, we already know, was not the greatest of picks. Two performances of note came from Morgan Crucible, which rose on the back of increased pre-tax profits (they were up 3 per cent but that was better than many companies managed) and strong sentiment that their exposure to the US market would allow them to benefit from the expected American economic recovery. The share price of Densitron International, the electronics components group, suffered after it reported a 1991 loss of Pounds 377,000.</p>

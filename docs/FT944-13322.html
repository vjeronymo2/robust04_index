			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Renamo withdrawal confuses voters: UN in frantic effort to save elections Mozambicans went to the polls yesterday in the country's first multi-party elections in a state of confusion after the former rebel Renamo movement withdrew only hours before ballot stations opened. A grim-faced Mr Afonso Dhlakama, Renamo leader, flew into the capital Maputo from the central port of Beira last night and announced that 'the elections are false'. The elections had been intended as the culmination of a two-year peace process following the 1992 Rome Accord between Renamo and the Frelimo government which ended Mozambique's 16-year civil war. Just two days ago United Nations officials, who are supervising the exercise, expressed confidence that the Mozambican peace process was on the verge of producing an African success story. Renamo's withdrawal did not prevent hundreds of thousands of Mozambicans from queueing up in order to cast their votes. In Maputo many voters expressed dismay at Renamo's actions, and feared the boycott could lead to violence. Renamo has been alleging for weeks that the Frelimo government was planning to rig the vote, but few expected such drastic action the night before polling stations opened. Renamo officials said Mr Dhlakama had 'come to the conclusion that free and fair elections are not possible until certain technical difficulties are addressed'. In the frantic hours which followed, Mr Aldo Ajello, the head of the 6,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mozambique, as well as the Mr Brazao Mazula, president of the National Election Commission, pleaded with Renamo officials not to withdraw. They failed, and when the polls opened at 7am national radio was announcing Renamo's withdrawal. In Maputo, thousands of people waited to vote in a subdued but calm atmosphere. Mr Mario Machungo, prime minister, described Renamo's actions as 'undemocratic and regrettable'. Voting is due to end today. Reuter adds from Cape Town: South Africa was in touch with all political parties in neighbouring Mozambique to ensure elections there stay on track, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said yesterday. 'What we are trying to do is to ensure that everybody stays in the process and everybody recognises the outcome of the election,' Mr Mbeki told the senate. 'We are hoping that we will succeed in that because clearly as a country, we cannot afford to have another Angola on our doorstep.' In Angola, Unita rebels resumed their civil war two years ago when they lost elections to the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Renamo's Mr Dhlakama maintained, however, that the last-minute boycott by his party did not mean a return to guerrilla war. See Editorial Comment</p>

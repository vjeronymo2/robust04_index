			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's plan to form a policy study group involving all the  ruling coalition partners will be put off to avoid a split in  the coalition, according to political sources. A senior  official of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key member of the  seven-party coalition, said Tuesday night the party must rethink  the proposal but said the basic concept has not changed.    A senior official of Komeito, another coalition party which  backs the plan, also said the study group could not be formed at  the present juncture.    Shinseito, Komeito and the Japan New Party led by Hosokowa  have agreed to establish a policy study group next month with  the aim of ultimately merging all of the coalition parties into  a single party.    But Tomiichi Murayama, leader of the Social Democratic Party  [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest force in the coalition,  Tuesday expressed opposition to the plan. Murayama told  reporters that if joining the study group is a condition to be  selected as a joint candidate under the new electoral system for  the House of Representatives or if the group is designed to  create a new party, he "would not be able to agree" to let SDPJ  legislators participate.    Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Chairman Keigo Ouchi said  Tuesday coalition members should not rush to join the study  group, which he said is based on a scheme to create a new party.    "Joining the group as individuals could lead to a collapse  of  the political party," he said. "There is no chance that the DSP  will participate in the group en masse under the current  circumstances."</p>

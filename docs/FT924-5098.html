			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Accounts changes 'need clearance' COMPANIES ARE to be urged to request clearance for any innovative accounting treatments before using them in their annual accounts. The Financial Reporting Council, the co-ordinating body for Britain's new accounting standards regime, is to ask companies and their auditors to discuss innovative accounting approaches with the Urgent Issues Task Force. The move will bring the work of the task force more in line with its equivalent in the US, where companies regularly ask for expert opinion in a similar way. The British task force tends to be merely reactive, moving to stamp out perceived accounting abuses after they appear in a company's published accounts. The call for pre-approval will come in the council's annual report, which is due in mid-December. It follows discussion of the issue at the board meeting earlier this week. While the Accounting Standards Board has embarked on a lengthy and ambitious programme to overhaul UK financial reporting standards, the task force has acted more quickly on points of dispute. It has issued several controversial guidelines in the past few months, including one on the treatment of the goodwill element of acquisitions when sold and one on transfers between fixed and current assets. The latter ruling was widely seen as a response to the treatment of Trafalgar House's 1991 accounts, which led to the company being forced by the Financial Reporting Review Panel to reduce its pre-tax profits by Pounds 83m. The Accounting Standards Board also told the council board meeting this week that it only expected to issue two new financial reporting standards next year: on off-balance sheet financing and on capital instruments. It said this reflected the intention to consult widely on the issues and to give preparers of accounts and the accountancy profession time to change. The ASB has already issued three standards since it was created just over two years ago, including one in late October on the struc-ture of the profit-and-loss account.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkowski] </F>   [Text] This morning's session of the Supreme Soviet was  held behind closed doors. As I have learned, deputies should  have completed their discussion on the briefings by General  Attorney Shaladonaw, Interior Minister Yegorov, KGB Chairman  Shyrkovskiy, Foreign Minister Kravchanka, and Border Troops  Commander Bacharaw regarding the Lithuanian incident -- the  detention of Lithuanian communists Burokevicius and  Jarmalavicius, who were accused of participating in the bloody  events of 1991. Unfortunately, I was not allowed to listen to  the debate. Therefore, I have to wait for a recess and hope  that someone will show courage and relate to me the course of  the discussion on this issue and its results.    The recess has been called, and deputies are currently  exchanging their opinions on this issue.    [Begin recording] [Rutkowski] My interlocutor is People's  Deputy Aleksandr (Parun). What is your assessment on this  incident?    [(Parun)] As a matter of fact, there has been no incident.  What has really occurred was fulfillment of bilateral agreements  signed between the Republic of Belarus and Lithuania. Another  issue is that, de facto, we lack strong state authority, and due  to that, the law has been violated at different levels. The  Attorney General's Office should have issued a warrant to arrest  the previously mentioned individuals, and it failed to do so,  giving a verbal order by telephone instead. Second, the  Ministry of Internal Affairs, which conducted this operation  along with representatives of the Lithuanian special services,  carried out this job without written permission from the  Attorney General's Office. The reports by the KGB chairman and  the foreign minister, which were requested by numerous deputies,  showed that the very lack of strong authority and the lack of a  system of subordinating these services to state authority is  leading to various violations of the law.    The essential resolution which should be adopted by the  Supreme Council should concern not only this incident, but also  other episodes in which the rights of our citizens on  territories of other republics and citizens of other republics  on our territory were violated. Everything should be done in a  manner enabling us to finally establish a strong state authority.    [Rutkowski] Is it possible that we will wake up one day and  there will be different authorities -- power will be assumed by  a foreigner?    [(Parun)] We should know what is going on in our country,  and we should prevent attempts to violate our Constitution.    [Rutkowski] However, the question of what is hidden behind  this political action still remains unanswered. I have  addressed this question to People's Deputy Yawhen Huskevich.    [Huskevich] In my opinion this is politicizing. The  campaign against the power structures -- the KGB, the Attorney  General's Office, and the Interior Ministry -- establishes the  framework for a coup. I believe so because what has happened  does not deserve two days of discussion behind closed doors.  Today, we have fulfilled this duty and heard those reports.  [end recording]    What will be the final result of this story? I believe we  will find out soon.</p>

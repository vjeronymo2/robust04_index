At least three helicopters and two planes are participating  in the bombings that began in early this morning in a zone  located approximately 4 kms south of San Cristobal de las Casas  and where there are 13 Indian towns with a population of 5,000.  The main towns under attack, where clashes have been held with  scattered guerrillas of the Zapatista National Liberation Army  (EZLN), are: Corralito, San Isidro, El Ocotal, Corazon de Maria,  San Antonio Los Banos, and Pinavetal.    The residents of San Cristobal de las Casas have said the  situation has become "alarming" because the bombings started  behind the mountain ranges and are now continuing on the  outskirts of the city, although sources said that at first  glance one cannot detect the presence of guerrillas. The  sources could not say how many soldiers are involved in the  operation but noted there are 10,000 soldiers just in the  state's capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez, in addition to other  contingents in Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and Ocosingo, where  the fighting continues.    Official reports indicate the bombings and clashes have  ceased, although there is the possibility that the authorities  have refused to give information on the new attacks to keep it  from leaking to other rebel groups and warning them.    This past Tuesday alone, approximately 5,000 soldiers, 27  tanks, two amphibious vehicles, 18 all-terrain vehicles, two  fuel trucks, a repair unit, and 10 troop transport trucks  arrived in San Cristobal de las Casas. Unofficial sources  indicated that the Army had possibly uncovered several rebel  headquarters located in the Lacandona jungle and those were the  objectives being bombed at the moment. According to experts,  the force deployed to Chiapas is greater than any used by  neighboring Central American countries against a particular  guerrilla force. This force has become a genuine military  offensive.    Unofficially it is being said that, despite the Army having  regained near total control of the municipalities of Ocosingo,  the Zapatists continue to harass nearby communities. Ocosingo  as well as the communities of Altamirano, San Cristobal, and La  Margaritas have not yet returned to their daily work or school  activities, neither has potable water, electricity, or gas been  reestablished.    On the other hand, several warnings have appeared written in  red on the walls of buildings in the municipality of Tapachula,  located 12 kms from the Guatemalan border, indicating: "We are  already here, we will continue our struggle," and describe the  population as cowards.    In the meantime, rumors still persist in San Cristobal  related to the alleged capture of "Commander Marco," leader of  the armed uprising that broke out this past Saturday. The  prosecutor general of the republic has scheduled a news  conference in the next few hours to provide details on the  numerous rumors circulating on the situation.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK companies step up Iraq blacklist campaign PRESSURE IS mounting on the US Treasury to issue a revised blacklist of alleged 'front companies and agents' of Iraq, following action on Monday to remove three British names from suspicion. The UK's Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that eight companies and two individuals listed had met officials in attempts to clear their names, and it was speaking with others. A total of 33 British companies were originally named by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) as 'specially designated nationals' on April 1. Contact with them was prohibited under penalty of fines and imprisonment. The US blacklist includes 52 companies and 37 individuals worldwide and has been criticised for inaccuracy. Representations have been made to Washington by DTI officials and at least one MP. PMK, Qudos and Liverpool Polytechnic were granted a Treasury licence to continue trading with companies and individuals under US jurisdiction, pending removal from the blacklist. PMK was set up by Liverpool Polytechnic to provide educational facilities to the University of Technology in Baghdad. Qudos, a designer of specialist microchips based in Cambridge, was to be a subcontractor. However, no contract was signed and no business took place. A spokesman for Liverpool Polytechnic said it was delighted to be removed from the list. 'We would still question why we were ever included. The damage to suppliers, parents and staff is immeasurable.' OFAC said it was reviewing a number of other companies and individuals on the list but was not planning to remove them at this stage.</p>

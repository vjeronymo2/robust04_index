			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 10 (CNA) -- Foreign Affairs Minister  Chien Fu, on behalf of the Republic of China [ROC] Government,  decorated Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, Indonesia's state minister  in charge of research and technology, with the Order of  Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon Friday [10 June] in recognition  of his contribution to promoting substantive ties between Taipei  and Jakarta.    The decoration ceremony was not open to the media because  the  Indonesian Government asked the ROC to keep Habibie's visit low  profile in order not to irritate Beijing, with which Jakarta  maintains diplomatic ties.    After the ceremony, Chien and Habibie exchanged views on  matters of mutual concern. Chien later gave a luncheon in honor  of Habibie, an engineer-turned administrator.    Habibie, heading a large group of Indonesian trade,  technology and agriculture officials as well as business  leaders, arrived in Taipei Thursday evening for a three-day  visit.    Habibie helped arrange president Li Teng-hui's itinerary in  Indonesia when Li made a groundbreaking unofficial visit to the  Southeast Asian nation in February. He accompanied Li to tour  many Indonesian industrial and agricultural institutions.    Habibie told local reporters that although he is not a  member  of the organizing committee for the 1994 summit of the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, he will try his  best to have Li invited to the meeting, slated for November in  Jakarta.    Nevertheless, Habibie said, he cannot at the moment predict  whether Li will be able to attend the meeting.    Because of Beijing's boycott, Li failed to attend the  first-ever APEC leadership meeting held in Seattle last  November. Both Taipei and Beijing are APEC members.    Habibie, the chief architect of Indonesia's aerospace  industry, said he will explore the possibility of Taipei-Jakarta  cooperation in aerospace technology development during his stay  here.    "There is still ample room for our two countries to  cooperate," the Indonesian minister noted.    Habibie will leave Taiwan for Japan Saturday.    Despite the absence of diplomatic ties, substantive  relations  between Taiwan and Indonesia have grown steadily in recent  years. According to statistics released by the Indonesian  Government, aggregate direct Taiwan investment in Indonesia  reached US$8.68 billion at the end of April, making Taiwan the  second largest foreign investor in that country after Japan.</p>

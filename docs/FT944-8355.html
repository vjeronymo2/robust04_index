			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Dole hopes for deal on trade pact Senator Robert Dole, Republican leader in the US Senate, yesterday said he was close to a deal with the administration on passage of the Uruguay Round implementing legislation this year. Mr Dole is considered the key to approval of the Round; some lobbyists say he can bring 12 Republican votes with him. Sixty out of 100 votes are needed for passage of a budget rule, which would clear the legislation for floor action. Even with Mr Dole's support, the vote is expected to be close. Appearing on a television news programme yesterday, he also suggested Congress would not support a renewal of 'fast track' legislation next year. This could kill administration plans to negotiate further trade agreements with Chile and other Latin American nations. The so-called 'fast track' is a promise by Congress that it will vote trade agreements up or down, without attempting to amend them. The administration was unable to get fast track renewal attached to the Uruguay Round implementing legislation this year, even with Democrat control of Congress. Mr Dole met administration officials at the weekend and threw a new demand on the negotiating table. He has asked for 'assurances' from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, which would ease passage of a cut in the capital gains tax rate next year. As a potential candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 Mr Dole is struggling to satisfy the concerns of the Republican right wing that the WTO would mean a loss of US sovereignty.</p>

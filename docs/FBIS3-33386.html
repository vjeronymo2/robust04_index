			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks in Creole] </F>   [Excerpts] The president of the second office of the upper  chamber, Senator Bernard Sansaricq, returned to the country on  20 February after a trip of nearly eight days to Washington. I  did what I could for the country; I have no further comments to  make. These are the words he used while addressing the press.    [Begin recording] [Sansaricq] At least one chance must be  given to the discussions I started while I was out of the  country. We must give these discussions a chance to succeed. We  are going to continue to work not only to find the ideal  solution to get the country out of the crisis but.... This is  all I have to say, I will no longer answer questions.    [Unidentified journalist] You said at the beginning that....    [Unidentified journalist, interrupting] What was the subject  of the discussions you held in Washington?    [Sansaricq] I have no more comments to make; I have no  further comments. [passage omitted]    [Journalist] ...the country has the right to know what its  president went to do in the United States.    [Sansaricq] Listen, I was off on a trip to the United  States.  I did what I could for the country. We have to wait for the  results.    [Journalist] What did you do exactly, Senator?    [Sansaricq] I cannot answer questions. The first secretary  [of the Senate office, Sen. Ebrane Cadet] is there; he heard my  briefing [last word in English] on the results of my trip on 20  February. He can answer the questions. It is a team effort.  [passage omitted] [end recording]    Sen. Cadet did not provide precise information on the  question and contented himself with stating that the country  would experience some surprises within fewer than 24 hours.    Rony Mondestin says he is amazed at the label, intransigent,  attributed to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. This label would  be more suitable for General Raoul Cedras, according to the  senator of the North.    Meanwhile, Dejean Belizaire thinks the Governors Island  agreement is outdated. Sen. Belizaire asks the Haitian head of  state to fill the political vacuum. The following is a report by  Daly Valet:    [Begin recording] [Valet] [passage omitted] "Sen. Mondestin  asserted that he does not have many problems with the plan being  discussed in Washington but he has reservations as to the  sequence of this plan. Like the president of the country, Gen.  Roul Cedras should resign from the Army before the head of state  appoints a new head of government. [sentence as heard] [passage  omitted]    ``Dejean Belizaire, the president of the Alliance for  Parliamentary Cohesion, has a different opinion than that of  Sen. Mondestin. Belizaire thinks the president of the country  should agree to the plan proposed to him and appoint a new head  of government as soon as possible. Contrary to Sen. Mondestin,  Belizaire says he opposes Gen. Cedras' resignation from the  Haitian Army:''    [Belizaire] "If I had agreed with the departure of the  general, I would have already asked for that. I know very well  that the Governors Island agreement is something that has  already been exhausted. We are no longer within the scope of the  Governors Island agreement. But I believe that today an action  must be taken. That action is that President Aristide is  supposed to appoint a prime minister. Let him appoint his prime  minister. Then, after the government is established, we will see  how we will settle the other questions."    [Valet] "Unlike Bernard Sansaricq, the other Senate  president, that is, Firmin Jean-Louis, and the other quaestor,  namely Julio Larosiliere, have not yet entered Port-au-Prince.    ``We can inform you that Robert Malval's resigning  government  has refused to acknowledge both the signature and the authority  of the office headed by Sen. Sansaricq.'' [end recording]</p>

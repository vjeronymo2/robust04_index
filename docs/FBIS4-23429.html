			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By political correspondent Chris Whitfield] </F>   [Text] The sale of old .303 rifles at bargain prices to  defence force members will be probed by Defence Minister Joe  Modise this week. Ministry spokesman Das Herbst told THE STAR  yesterday that the matter had been brought to Modise's attention.    It would be dealt with by Modise and the Chief of the South  African National Defence Force, General George Meiring, he said.    It was reported yesterday that the rifles -- which date back  to World War 2 -- were being sold for as little as R34.10  [rand]. Ammunition for the .303s was being sold for only 28c  [cents] a round.    Those who qualified to buy the cut-rate weapons were members  of the permanent force, citizen force or commandos who had  completed five years of continuous service, and members of the  permanent force who are retiring. World War 2 veterans with a  service certificate could also buy the weapons at cheap rates.    ANC member of Parliament Ronnie Kasrils has slammed the  sales, pointing to the proliferation of firearms in the country.</p>

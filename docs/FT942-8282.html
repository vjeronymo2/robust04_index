			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Bank lays claim to Tapie art collection The tangled fortunes of Mr Bernard Tapie, the flamboyant French entrepreneur whose radical-left party is making waves in the European election campaign, yesterday took another twist when Credit Lyonnais, his bank, terminated the agreement whereby he has five years to repay his FFr1.2bn (Pounds 130m) debts. Credit Lyonnais, which is cleaning up its balance sheet after recently unveiling heavy losses and a FFr44.9bn government-backed rescue package, early yesterday morning sent a baliff to Mr Tapie's opulent townhouse off Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris. The baliff, accompanied by a policeman, served official notice on Mr Tapie and his wife, Dominique, that the bank had terminated the loan repayment agreement and was claiming possession of his furniture and art collections. Mr Tapie, who cites 'furniture and art of the 18th century' as his 'interest' in Who's Who, had offered the collections as security for part of his debts. Mr Tapie later in the day accused the French establishment of 'trying to destroy me'. 'Having tried throwing me into solitary confinement, they're now trying to make me a pauper,' he added. When Mr Tapie earlier this year negotiated the terms of his debt repayment agreement with Credit Lyonnais, he claimed his furniture was worth FFr300m. One of the conditions of the agreement was that he would provide the bank with a full valuation by March 31. But Mr Tapie failed to do so. The bank also yesterday sent a team of art experts to Mr Tapie's home to make an inventory of the contents with a photographer who took a picture of each object. It said it would leave the furniture and art in the house with the Tapies as 'guarantors'. Credit Lyonnais said another reason for terminating the debt agreement was its concern about the recent 'deterioration' in Mr Tapie's finances following the relegation of Olympique-Marseille, his football club, to the second division and reports of investigations into his tax affairs. The bank said it had 'not yet decided' what further action to take regarding the repayment of Mr Tapie's debts.</p>

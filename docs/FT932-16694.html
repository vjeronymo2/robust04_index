			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Clinton commits Dollars 1.6bn in support of Russia reforms: US president urges industrialised nations to stand by Yeltsin in 'hour of challenge' PRESIDENTS Bill Clinton of the US and Boris Yeltsin of Russia declared yesterday they had established the basis for a 'new democratic partnership' between the former cold war rivals. Effusive in his praise of the Russian leader's 'humble roots' and 'heroic deeds', Mr Clinton unveiled a larger than expected Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.01bn) US financial assistance package. He said it was 'the self-interest and high duty of all the world's democracies to stand by Russian reform in its hour of challenge'. Mr Clinton predicted that the other leading industrialised nations and Russia would take 'mutually reinforcing steps' to further Russian reform at a meeting of the Group of Seven foreign and finance ministers in Tokyo in 10 days. Equally complimentary of the US president, Mr Yeltsin said the US assistance would henceforth be known as 'Bill Clinton's package - a large, wise package that will make history'. Questioned about his own political future, he declared that in Russia at present 'there is no alternative to Yeltsin. There will be tomorrow, but not today'. After two days of what Mr Clinton called 'intensely productive' talks, the two leaders also disclosed a number of additional steps. They agreed, pending the acquiescence of other G7 countries, to establish in Moscow a central co-ordinating office to ensure that assistance reached its targets and avoided duplication. A likely candidate to head this operation is Mr Gerald Corrigan, recently retired head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. Mr Yeltsin said it was important that assistance would be delivered according to strict 'monthly' deadlines. Mr Clinton repeated that three-quarters of the US package was earmarked for non-governmental Russian organisations. Mr Clinton also promised to review all outstanding cold war US regulations that Russia felt was hindering its economic development. These include the 20-year-old Jackson-Vanik amendment, aimed at pressing the former Soviet Union into allowing more Jews to emigrate, and the Cocom rules restricting technology sales to the former Soviet bloc. The US president also held out the hope of a second wave of US assistance, saying he would consult Congress over additional measures in the energy, environmental, housing and broader economic reform fields. The Dollars 1.6bn package announced yesterday, of which Dollars 900m in food credits and grants was the largest element, involves only funds already authorised by Congress. The two leaders also discussed a wide range of foreign and security issues, with Mr Clinton again regretting, and promising a review of, the recent submarine collision in the Barents Sea. The Russian president was sharply critical of the treatment by Latvia and Estonia of Russian minorities, threatening to reschedule Russian troop withdrawals if human rights were not respected. But the withdrawal from Lithuania would proceed. Senior officials in Vancouver said the total package of aid from the G7 countries should be approved at the forthcoming Tokyo meeting of foreign and finance ministers. This sum, estimated at between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 20bn, will be available to Mr Yeltsin's government once the west is satisfied that it has control of the main economic levers, crucially the central bank. Mr Clinton particularly emphasised to Mr Yeltsin in talks on Saturday night that the central bank, whose credit expansion is seen as the main motor of the 20 to 25 per cent monthly inflation rate, must be disciplined. The US package followed some good days for the Russian president. He received pledges of assistance of Pounds 120m from Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, in Moscow on Thursday and Dollars 200m from Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, in Vancouver on Friday - a total, with the US package, only just short of Dollars 2bn. In addition, Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy premier, negotiated a debt rescheduling agreement with the Paris Club of debtor nations last Friday which relieves Russia of Dollars 15bn of debt for between five and 10 years. Details emerging in Vancouver at the weekend reveal that Russia has promised to pay Dollars 3.5bn in the first year of the agreement after a six-month grace period during which the paybacks will be worked out with the individual countries and with the London Club of private creditors.

			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / International Company News: Laurentian ahead at CDollars 15.8m LAURENTIAN Group, the Canadian financial services company being merged with the larger Mouvement Desjardins, reported first-half net profit of CDollars 15.8m (USDollars 12m), or 25 cents a share, up from Dollars 14.3m, or 23 cents, a year earlier, on revenues which were little changed at Dollars 1.4bn. Second-quarter profit was equal to 12 cents a share, compared with 10 cents last time. The group's assets rose to Dollars 15.7bn at June 30, with the expansion of the Laurentian Bank. The life and general insurance units improved their results sharply. Imperial Life, Laurentian's biggest single unit, doubled first-half profit to Dollars 14.1m, or Dollars 5.89 a share, on revenues of Dollars 569m, up from Dollars 561m. With the merger due to be completed next month, Laurentian and Desjardins will put their financial services units into a new holding company to be minority-held by the public. The total combined group, including the Desjardins credit union branches, will have assets of nearly Dollars 80bn, including funds under management. It will rank as the sixth-largest banking and financial services group in Canada. Abitibi-Price, Canada's biggest newsprint producer, is raising between CDollars 100m and CDollars 125m with a public offer of common stock next month. The issue is being underwritten by a group led by the brokers Nesbitt Thomson, and will consist of between 8m and 10m shares priced at CDollars 12.75 each. The offer is not being registered in the US. Proceeds will be used to repay short-term debt and bolster working capital. Abitibi already has the lowest debt-equity ratio in the Canadian forest products industry.</p>

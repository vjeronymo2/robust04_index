CASUS BELLI </H5>   Issa Kostoyev, the president of Russia's representative in  the Ingush Republic, returned to Nazran at about midday on 31  October. He had not been able to accomplish in Moscow any of the  things he considered critical and urgent. A Russian procuracy  special affairs investigator and professional analyst, he saw  the inner interconnection of events; he knew where it may all  end, but he had not been able to avert any of it. He had asked  the president for an audience many times--through the audit  administration or in personal cables--but never received a reply.    Meanwhile, he was getting telephone calls from Nazran every  day. And every day the news was increasingly more alarming.    An APC [armored personnel vehicle] speeding along a rural  street ran over and killed an Ingush girl. An investigation  found the driver not at fault. A day later an officer of the  North Ossetian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] shot and  killed two Ingush. The republic procurator released the murderer  from detention. A group of Ossetian militiamen encountered a  crowd of agitated Ingush. Three Ingush and two militiamen were  killed in the clash. The militiamen were given a ceremonial  burial; Galazov himself, as well as members of the government,  were present...    Kostoyev saw that the Ossetian militia had no hesitation in  aggravating the situation, and could guess who needed this and  why.    The Ingush' spontaneous rage had to be stopped; they had to  be prevented from being drawn into an armed conflict that was  doomed. Reckless emotions, or perhaps also the ambition of some  authoritative Ingush figures, were pushing them into a  skillfully set trap. On 24 October at a joint session of three  rayon soviets in Nazran the decision was made to block entry to  and exit from Ingush villages in Prigorodnyy Rayon, and to call  up volunteers to form self-defense brigades and subordinate them  to a headquarters consisting of rayispolkom [rayon executive  committees] leaders and the OVD [Department of Internal Affairs].    When Justice General Issa Kostoyev learned of this, he  realized that the Ossetian leadership had been handed a "casus  belli"--a pretext for war: creation of illegitimate organs of  authority on its territory. The Supreme Soviet of the North  Ossetian SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] convened for an  emergency session and presented an ultimatum: Remove the  roadblocks and surrender the weapons. Otherwise it will be done  by force.    Only the president could stop the swift movement towards the  perilous cliff. Kostoyev passed all the documents to him through  aides. But the president did not meet with him.    Finally, it looked as if he would have some luck. B.N.  Yeltsin scheduled a meeting with his local representatives on 27  October; Kostoyev sent a note: Disaster may strike any day;  please, hear me out. He did not know yet that on that day the  Supreme Soviet of North Ossetian SSR had approved a statute on  the national guard and national volunteer corps. This was a  gross violation of the Constitution, but nobody ever paid any  attention to the Constitution in Russia. On that day the  formation of an independent North Ossetian army was completed.  An army is created in order to fight. The note was the only  one--it was impossible to overlook it; still, no meeting took  place.    A day later Khizha held a meeting in his office, but Georgiy  Khizha, chairman of the North Caucasus Region Security Council,  had only a very vague understanding of the subject of the  conversation. To Khizha's credit, he rather quickly admitted it,  and they agreed to meet the next day so that he could look into  the history of the problem in more detail. Kostoyev showed up,  but this meeting did not take place either. He was told that  Khizha was ill. The next morning--a telephone call from Nazran.  This was 31 October--the day declared by Vladikavkaz as the  beginning of the Ingush aggression.    General Savvin, who was leaving for North Ossetia, gave  Kostoyev a ride on his plane. Straight from Beslan airport  Savvin sent him in a military helicopter to Nazran. It was  there, in the evening, that Kostoyev learned that Khizha was in  Vladikavkaz.  <H5>  VLADIKAVKAZ, 31 OCTOBER 1992 </H5>   Sergey Shoygu and Gennadiy Filatov arrived in Beslan in  their  aircraft late in the evening. Gaydar called Shoygu in the  morning in Yekaterinburg, where the latter made a stopover on  the way to Siberia, and asked him to immediately fly to  Vladikavkaz. An armed conflict had flared up between Ossetians  and Ingush, said the first deputy prime minister; the situation  is complex, and the GKChS [State Committee for Emergency  Situations] chairman should assist Deputy Prime Minister Khizha,  who has already left for the region. Shoygu took with him his  deputy, Colonel General Filatov.    An agitated crowd in the square in front of the Supreme  Soviet building demanded alternately that the North Ossetian  government resign and that the army corps interfere, but more  than anything else they urged that military warehouses be seized  so they could be armed.    All the local and visiting officials gathered in the office  of Chairman A. Galazov. Galazov was briefing Khizha on the  situation. From his report it followed that early in the morning  the Ingush had attacked the Chermen post, disarmed a military  unit, seized several APC's, and were moving in the direction of  Vladikavkaz. Units of Ingush thugs, said Galazov, were well  organized and armed. Serious fighting is going on in Chermen and  other villages. During the day Galazov delivered an address on  local television that alarmed the entire republic. He compared  the current events with the beginning of the Great Patriotic  War. Shoygu got the impression that very few had a grasp of the  situation. There was a lot of confusion, and another thing that  surprised him was that people straight from the street kept  barging into the office--where the entire Ossetian leadership, a  deputy prime minister of Russia, multistar generals that had  flown in, and Minister of Security Bzayev himself were holding a  meeting--yelling that their children had been killed, parents  abducted and taken off, and old people thrown out of their homes.    "Georgiy Stepanovich," Galazov was persuading Khizha, "you  can see for yourself--unless we distribute arms, we will be  smashed."    Khetagurov, chairman of the North Ossetian Council of  Ministers, supported Galazov and said that at least 15,000  submachine guns should be issued to arm the people. It would  come out later that Ossetians had taken hostage the wife and  daughter of the corps chief of staff, Major General Skobelev.    Now Galazov and Khetagurov were directly demanding  armaments.  We, Ossetians, are getting killed, they were saying, while you  are sitting here thinking about whether to give people arms or  not.    On Khizha's order, upon telephone approval by Grachev and  Gaydar, that same night 642 units of firearms were delivered to  military draft offices and distributed: submachine guns, machine  guns, grenade launchers, and ammunition for them. In addition,  18 infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) were also made available.    Khetagurov still was not satisfied. Sergey Shoygu issued  ammunition to meet the needs of the North Ossetian MVD, but that  was not enough--on his orders he also put at their disposal 57  heavy T-72 tanks. He "recalled" this only when confronted during  the investigation with his letter to a military unit commander.  "Somebody had to take responsibility; I had the guts to do it.  They were manned by military crews," Shoygu explained.    Yes, the crews were rented out. Residents of Ingush villages  would see their houses smashed by Russian tanks, driven by  Russians.    Meanwhile, the fluctuations in the behavior of the crowd in  front of the Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers building,  which alternately quieted down and became agitated, were far  from random. It was Colonel General Savvin's observation that  this was organized by someone on purpose, in order to exert  pressure.    Another crowd, led by a procuracy officer who appeared out  of  nowhere, besieged the training center of the military school in  Komgaron; six officers were seized and threatened with  execution, after which the attackers' demands were met. They  forgot, however, to warn the cadets guarding the arms. The  cadets fired warning shots in the air, and when they ran out of  ammunition, the crowd tore into pieces two boys who had only  been in school for half a year. A report was released to the  press that this was Ingush' doing. IZVESTIYA later had to run an  apology.  <H5>  FROM THE IZVESTIYA FILE </H5>   In the fall of 1991 the Prigorodnyy Rayon Administration for  Agriculture purchased 21 BRDM-2 [armored reconnaissance and  patrol vehicle] equipped with night vision devices, radio  transmitters, and filtration and ventilation systems.    On 9 June 1992 in Vladikavkaz, 12 self-propelled artillery  systems (SAU 2S 1) of 122-mm caliber were seized.    On 10 June, a central artillery base was seized, from which  14 KaMAZ trucks with ammunition and more than 14 units of  firearms were stolen. The attack was led by O. Teziyev, chairman  of the South Ossetian Council of Ministers. No legal proceedings  against him have been initiated.    According to unconfirmed data, on the eve of the armed  conflict a train carrying 24 units of APC-80 with full  complement of armaments arrived; the recipient--the North  Ossetian MVD.    According to military counterintelligence data, as of 4  November 1992 the following arms had been stolen: one BRDM, one  85-mm artillery gun, two IFV guns, 307 submachine guns, 788  pistols, 15 machine guns, 93 carbines, and a great quantity of  ammunition.    According to the data of North Ossetian official organs, the  North Ossetian MVD in October 1992 had at its disposal: 1,065  submachine guns, 304 Stechkin automatic pistols, 113 CPG-9  antitank grenade-launchers, 11 antimissile defense systems, 68  large-caliber machine guns, 36 armored personnel vehicles, and  1,016 grenades.    According to the data of North Ossetian official organs, the  national guard and the people's volunteer corps had at their  disposal 826 submachine guns, 23 machine guns and grenade  launchers, 53 units of APC-80, and four units of IFV's. (We  assume that the official data are understated.)    ***    R.Z. Gelikhanova, attorney (former address: 20  Shmulevich Street, Apt. 27, Vladikavkaz; currently lives in  Nazran):    On 30 October there was a seminar at the Ministry of  Justice.  It went as usual. I went to the Leninskiy Rayon OVD. I was  amazed to see sand bags piled up along the entire corridor and  the assembly hall located across it. To my question as what it  was, an OVD officer replied: "We are going to defend ourselves  against the Ingush." I was at the OVD between 1200 and 1230.    On the morning of 31 October my husband and all my Ingush  neighbors were taken somewhere, and about 1200, on the orders of  Experimentmebel [Experimental Furniture] Director Dzutsev, my  apartment was broken into and an OMON [Special Designation  Militia Detachments] officer's family moved in. (Footnote 1)  (About 17,000 Ingush lived in Vladikavkaz, working in the city's  various offices and enterprises.    By the end of the day of 31 October, many of them had  already  been arrested; by the first days of November not a single family  remained. Shaldon, an area of the city with a concentration of  Ingush-owned family homes, had been burned to the ground; about  600 state-owned apartments and all their contents were given to  new tenants.)  <H5>  NAZRAN, 31 OCTOBER 1992 </H5>   By daylight the square in front of the administration  building in Nazran was overflowing with people. Many men brought  arms with them--some hunting, some military type. The price of a  submachine gun at the Nazran city market that day went up from  150,000 [rubles] to 400,000.    People had begun gathering late the night before, when the  first messengers from Oktyabrskoye woke up their relatives. The  previous day, 30 October, a young resident of Dachnyy, Yandiyev,  was killed at a bus stop by a sniper shot from a roof, and in  the evening firing on Ingush quarters began in Kambileyevka and  Oktyabryskoye. The fire was from large-caliber machine guns and  either mortars or some sort of missile systems. It appeared that  the fire came from the roofs of multifamily apartment houses in  the rayon center of Oktyabrskoye.    Crowds of Nazran residents and inhabitants of other Ingush  towns and villages were brought to the square by one and the  same question: They are killing us again; why? Youths were urged  to go and settle the score with the Ossetian militia. But just  as the republic itself was not yet a state, neither was the  crowd in the square a military formation. Experienced people  tried to stop the tidal wave, but nobody listened to them any  longer. In Zhiguli cars, buses, and KaMAZ trucks the crowd  rushed toward Chermen--the nearest village on the territory of  North Ossetia. The Nazran militia closed the traffic-control  barrier on the highway; somebody in a car smashed through the  barrier, after which the militiamen, too, were carried away by  the human stream. By the evening the news came: At the  intersection leading to Chermen the crowd disarmed a patrol  unit, seized six APC's, let the Russian soldiers go, and in the  village proper engaged in a fight with the Ossetian militia;  there were casualties on both sides. It was all there in Chermen  on that horrible day: plundering, arson, and hostage-taking.    The Ingush finally did what they had long been pushed into  doing--they took up arms.    Vladikavkaz television and North Ossetian newspapers  reported: In the early morning of 31 October a column of  well-armed Ingush commandos accompanied by armored vehicles  crossed the border of sovereign North Ossetia near the village  of Chermen and moved on to Vladikavkaz. Simultaneously,  individual gang formations invaded Ossetian villages from the  flanks. Thus began a preplanned perfidious Ingush aggression  against the neighboring republic.    Telephone communications with Vladikavkaz were disrupted on  31 October and restored only the next day. Kostoyev's telephone  conversations with Khizha were full of confusion and as a rule  ended with the deputy prime minister's ominous phrase: "We are  quite serious!.."  <H5>  FROM THE IZVESTIYA FILE </H5>   According to official data, by the beginning of the  conflict the Ingush side had at its disposal 176 submachine  guns, seven machine guns, five grenade launchers, 90 antitank  grenades, and 500 hand grenades. This data apparently does not  take into account privately acquired firearms.    ***    Isa Yunusovich Buzurganov, former resident of  Kambileyevka village (currently living in Nazran):    Even before the 30th, APC's began to canvass our streets,  stopping by Ossetian homes and openly distributing arms. On the  night of 30-31 October we fully realized the hopelessness of our  situation. After 2200, a long siren sounded at the Kambileyevka  chemical plant; alarm signals also sounded at other enterprises.  That is when intensive firing on our houses began. The first  shot came from an APC moving along Mayakovskiy Street in the  direction of five-story apartment buildings. After a long burst  of fire it disappeared; and then shooting started from all sides.    During the night, at about 0400, they started firing at us  with grenade launchers from the direction of the veterinary  clinic on Rechnaya Street; fire from automatic weapons went on  continuously. The grenade launchers accomplished their task--our  homes were in flames.    By the morning of 31 October, shortly after 0700, this hell  subsided. By about 0900 a delegation arrived, headed by General  Savvin's deputy--that is the way he introduced himself--and  Sikoyev, North Ossetia's deputy minister of internal affairs,  and Yakub Kushtov and Ruslan Tatiyev. They inspected the  buildings demolished or damaged by shelling, and talked to the  people. Sikoyev and the general began to apologize, saying that  there would be no more shooting and the guilty ones would be  punished. Precisely at this moment another round of firing  began; Sikoyev became very nervous, rushed about, started  calling somewhere, and shortly afterwards they departed, leaving  us in complete uncertainty.    This was hardly a "delegation." Most likely, all four  arrived  from different directions: General I.I. Kapliyev, the deputy of  [internal troops] commander V.N. Savvin; the commandant of  Vladikavkaz, S.I. Sikoyev; Sunzhenskiy Rayon Soviet Chairman  Ruslan Tatiyev; and member of Ingushetia's People's Council  Yakub Kushtov. Many eyewitnesses to the events recall that a  heated exchange ensued right there between Kapliyev and Sikoyev.    Strange as it seems, the events of that night were not  reported in either the Ossetian or the central press, although  eventually they surfaced in official materials--inaccessible to  some, unrequested by others. A year later A. Shchukin, the chief  of a composite investigative group, replied to an IZVESTIYA  inquiry: There is such a version; we are working on it. Still  working on it! Had it been worked on by the investigative group,  A. Galazov would not be able to continue repeating to this day  the canned version of preplanned aggression by Ingush  national-extremists.</p>

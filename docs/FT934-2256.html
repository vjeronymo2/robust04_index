			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / World Trade News: EU to consider Uruguay draft today EU foreign ministers will today consider whether to give their seal of approval to the draft Uruguay Round accord, a long-awaited decision which depends on resolving French demands for stronger European trade mechanisms. Last night, hints of a compromise emerged in Brussels which raised hopes that the foreign ministers would succeed in their bid for approval of the Gatt world trade deal before the midnight deadline. UK, German and Brussels diplomats suggested yesterday that London and Bonn were ready to soften some of their opposition to French demands which would make it easier for the European Commission to take action against unfair traders through speedier anti-dumping measures. It remained unclear whether the concessions would be enough to satisfy Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, who declared last Monday that Paris would sign a Gatt deal only on condition that trade weapons were strengthened. However, in a TV interview last night, he called the Gatt deal 'a compromise more than honourable' and said France had achieved its objectives on all major issues. The news that Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, had succeeded in removing the culturally-sensitive film and broadcasting industry from the Gatt draft agreement achieved in Geneva yesterday was seen as a major boost. Today Sir Leon is expected to call on EU foreign ministers to consider the merits of the deal in its entirety, rather than raising outstanding points of grievance. Ministers will not vote on the deal today since there is no possibility, either legally or politically, for EU member states to outvote France. Sir Leon has used the formula of 'all for one, and one for all' used by the Three Musketeers. But the final seal of approval appears to rest on France's requests for tougher trade weapons which threaten to overturn the principle that a minority of free-trade countries led by the UK and Germany could use their combined voting weight to thwart trade retaliation. These include acceleration of anti-dumping measures, as well as the invocation of 'safeguard' measures to deal with sudden surges of cheap imports. France would also like to create a new EU instrument similar to the US Section 301 market-opening weapon. A core issue concerns how EU member states can obtain redress if their complaints about unfair trading are upheld by the Multilateral Trade Organisation, the new body which will replace Gatt panels. Some officials said the free-traders might be ready to concede simple majority voting in this area. Other officials said Germany and the UK might give ground on anti-dumping but were reluctant to make it easier to invoke safeguard clauses. Creation of a new European 301 mechanism to achieve 'nuclear balance' with the US remains highly contentious.</p>

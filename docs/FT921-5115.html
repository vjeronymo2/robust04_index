			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes The market appeared a little ungrateful in marking down shares in Cadbury Schweppes yesterday. Despite the recession, Cadbury's annual results were better than even last September's interim figures had hinted. Pre-tax profits rose by 13 per cent although sales were flat. Spending on marketing and advertising was increased to protect its brands, while a series of one-off provisions for management restructurings was easily absorbed. The group's financial position continued to improve; gearing at 40 per cent has fallen by a third since 1989. After capital spending, tax and dividends there was a cash inflow last year of more than Pounds 30m. Given the performance of the typical UK company through this recession, it would be churlish to describe Cadbury as anything other than a class act. Old questions such as how the reliance on UK and Australasia for 60 per cent of trading profit can be reduced still carry some residual weight. The growth of its European operations is not as vigorous, particularly in confectionery, as management would perhaps have hoped, but the group is big enough these days to be patient. The market may occasionally believe that Cadbury's earnings growth rate is too low to justify the premium rating of the shares, but the company is treated as something of a special case. The quality of its earnings and hopes of eventual takeover place the shares squarely in that select category which should only be sold in dire emergency.</p>

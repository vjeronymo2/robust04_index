"Apoyo's"  survey results show that Fujimori currently is behind Javier  Perez de Cuellar in popularity, as the firm Mercadeo &amp;  Opinion  reported on 20 March in an article published by LA REPUBLICA in  its Sunday magazine.    This time "Apoyo" gives Perez de Cuellar a 44 percent  support  rating while Fujimori gets 40 percent. Mercadeo &amp; Opinion  established that 47 percent of eligible voters would support the  former U.N. secretary general while 38 percent would support  Fujimori. Fujimori's support rating is the lowest since he was  sworn in on 28 July 1990.    The survey by "Apoyo," however, obtains different results  when people are asked about the president's performance. A total  of 61 percent of those questioned approve Fujimori's performance  while only 30 percent disapprove it. This means that many of  those who support Fujimori in general terms would choose Perez  de Cuellar as the presidential successor despite the fact that  the illustrious diplomat is staying away from the electoral  infighting and still has not said if he will accept an eventual  nomination for the presidency of the Republic.    The "Apoyo" survey also shows other interesting results in  regards to other possible candidates who might run against  Fujimori if he runs for reelection. Fujimori would defeat  Ricardo Belmont 49 percent to 26 percent; Fernando Belaunte  Terry, 54 percent to 20 percent; and Luis Caceres, 55 percent to  17 percent. If voters have to choose between several candidates  at the same time, Fujimori also will win. "Apoyo" says that in  this case Fujimori would obtain 40 percent; Perez de Cuellar, 30  percent; Belmont, 10 percent; and Belaunte, 6 percent.    All this figures were aired on 20 March during the news  program "Panorama" broadcast by Channel 5. The data probably  will be analyzed and discussed by politicians and the people in  general.</p>

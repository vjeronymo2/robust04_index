			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Auditors to BCCI face Dollars 11bn claims for damages The auditors to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International face claims from the liquidators of up to Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.5bn), according to legal documents updating the original action. Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney, which is now part of Ernst &amp; Young, are alleged to have failed to detect or report financial irregularities at the bank stretching back as far as 1977 and 1979 respectively. The details appear in the statement of claim lodged in the high court which accompanies writs issued by BCCI's liquidators at Touche Ross against the auditors in the course of the last two years. The statement has not been made public. It was previously estimated the claims would be worth about Dollars 8bn. The damages claimed further increase one of the largest ever legal actions. The claims pursue the two firms for damages relating to the overall deficit of the bank discovered when it collapsed, overpaid tax, dividends and charitable grants, and nearly Dollars 4.8m in audit and consultancy fees which the two companies earned between 1985 and 1987. The statement of claim says that the financial position of BCCI was materially misstated in 1985, 1986 and 1987. It does not quantify any differences before this time because claims will not be allowed back beyond 1985. Had the problems been brought to light, the statement claims that 'imprudent conduct' at BCCI would have ended, weaknesses been corrected, management restructured and new capital would not have been needed. It says that for the year ending in December 1985, BCC (Overseas) reported a total capital fund of Dollars 425m and a profit of Dollars 32.2m. The figures estimated by the liquidators were a deficit of Dollars 2.4bn and a loss of Dollars 1.5bn respectively. By 1987, capital funds were, according to the statement, in deficit by nearly Dollars 5bn compared with reported assets of Dollars 532m, and there were losses for the year of Dollars 959m in contrast to the reported profit of Dollars 11.1m. Discrepancies between the reported figures and the liquidators' recalculated figures are analysed for BCCI SA, BCCI Holdings and the BCCI Group overall. The statement of claim alleges that Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney had expressed concerns about deficiencies or weaknesses in parts of the bank for up to 14 years before BCCI was closed by regulators in July 1991. It says the firms were in breach of their duties to the shareholders of BCCI companies for failure to take account of the warning signs or to report weaknesses. Price Waterhouse said last night: 'We are convinced we will be vindicated.'</p>

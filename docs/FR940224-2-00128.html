			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Funds are open-end, diversified management investment companies. Each Fund is a money market fund that maintains a net asset value of $1.00 per share for purchases and redemptions and, pursuant to rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act, uses the amortized cost method of valuing its securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. FNBC is the investment adviser for each of the Funds. FNBC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Chicago Corporation, a registered bank holding company, is a commercial bank offering a range of banking and investment services. The Bank of New York acts as the custodian for each of the Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Cash Management invests in short-term money market obligations, including repurchase agreements with respect to such securities with registered or unregistered securities dealers or banks that have total assets in excess of $1 billion. Money Market is divided into two separate portfolios, the Money Market Series and the Government Series (each of which is referred to as a ``Fund''). The Money Market Series invests in short-term money market obligations, including repurchase agreements with banks or primary government securities dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Government Series invests only in short-term securities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government, and repurchase agreements with respect to such securities with selected registered or unregistered securities dealers or banks that have total assets in excess of $1 billion. Treasury Cash Management invests at least 65% of the value of its net assets in U.S. Treasury securities and repurchase agreements in respect thereof and the remainder of its net assets in other securities guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government and repurchase agreements in respect thereof with registered or unregistered securities dealers or banks that have total assets in excess of $1 billion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Each Fund's shares are purchased primarily by clients of FNBC and its affiliates, including qualified custody, agency, and trust accounts, through their accounts with FNBC and its affiliates. Each Fund's shares may be purchased through automatic investment transactions. In these transactions, FNBC, as agent, follows the standing instructions of such clients and automatically invests excess cash balances in the clients' accounts in shares of one or more of the Funds. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Currently, these ``sweep'' transactions are effected automatically by computer each Fund business day as the next determined net asset value. The machine processing required to tabulate the day's transactions in such clients' accounts and other shareholder accounts, however, is completed later in the day (normally no earlier than 11 p.m., New York time) when the daily processing for FNBC's accounting system is completed (the ``Completion Time''). Therefore, total assets to be invested in each Fund through the ``sweep'' program each day are not known until that evening and are invested in each Fund at the respective net asset values determined on the following day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the standing instructions of FNBC's clients, the computer program also provides for the automatic redemption of Fund shares held in an account as of the next determined net asset value if the cash balance in the account is less than the minimum balance specified by the client. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. The current operation of the ``sweep'' program makes the Funds materially less attractive to FNBC's clients because they lose a day's income on funds invested through the program and, for ``sweeps'' accomplished on a Friday, lose a weekend's income. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. To correct this problem, Money Market and FNBC (the ``original Applicants'') applied for and received an order (the ``Order'') of the SEC under section 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act on January 26, 1993, exempting them from section 17(a) of the Act to permit Money Market to enter into repurchase agreements with FNBC or an affiliate subject to certain conditions. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  To date, however, Money Market has not entered into repurchase agreements with FNBC and therefore is not relying on the Order. The application seeks to amend the Order to: (1) Add additional Funds with investment policies and procedures similar to those of Money Market as applicants; and (2) amend condition seven to the Order. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19185 (Dec. 29, 1992) (notice) and 19240 (Jan. 26, 1993) (order). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The application restates the prior application in its entirety except for changes relating to the requested amendments and minor wording changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Condition seven to the Order provides that, during the operation of the ``sweep'' program, collateral maintained in a subcustodian account in the name of each Fund shall be ``comprised only of U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes or Bonds,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> with remaining maturities of one year or less <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and valued at least equal to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 102% of the Maximum Purchase Amount <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' (emphasis added). The ``Maximum Purchase Amount'' is the amount of a Fund's net assets that may be invested pursuant to the Order. This amount is based on a percentage that may change from time to time, subject to the agreement of the applicants, but may not exceed 15% of a Fund's net assets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Applicants propose to amend condition seven to eliminate the requirement that the securities comprising the collateral have ``remaining maturities of one year or less.'' Applicants believe that the provisions of rule 2a&hyph;7 relating to remaining maturity are not applicable to securities underlying fully collateralized repurchase agreements. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  FNBC's experience is that the Funds will be able to obtain a higher yield on repurchase agreements using collateral with remaining maturities of greater than one year than otherwise would be the case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Investment Company Act Release No. 18005 n.32 (Feb. 20, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

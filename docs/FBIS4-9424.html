			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Srdjan Radulovic: "Babic's Return to Martic's </F> Line"]    [Text] The entry of Milan Babic in the government of  "national unity" is not of crucial importance to the section of  the Krajina political scene that has long reached a party  consensus on the political status of the Republic of Serbian  Krajina. However, the support of the deputies of the SDS  [Serbian Democratic Party] of Krajina to the program and the  government of the new prime minister, Borislav Mikelic, as  thought, will affect party relations in the Krajina assembly and  Babic's future position with regard to both his political rating  in Krajina and the party that he leads.    As stated by Vojislav Seselj, leader of the Serbian  Radicals,  by supporting a government that does not include members of the  SRS [Serbian Radical Party], the second strongest party, Babic  has "unilaterally broken the coalition alliance." The Radicals  voted against Mikelic's program. Tomislav Nikolic, vice  president of the SRS, says that the "Radicals will remain in the  opposition."    Regarding the possibility of the Radicals' entering the  government (the departments whose officials have not been  elected yet) and reaching an agreement with Krajina's new prime  minister, Nikolic said that no agreement has been reached with  Mikelic, and that Mikelic's recent statements on an agreement  with the Radicals do not correspond to the truth. "The  situation in Krajina is becoming increasingly better for the SRS  and we will be ready for elections, when they are called,"  Nikolic said.    What remains to be seen is how the multiparty bloc, which  will play the role of the ruling authorities in the Krajina  assembly, is going to function. The SDS of Krajina has the  largest number of deputies, but without the Radicals, it can no  longer count on the certain "endorsement" of its policies. The  "marriage" of convenience between the two parties that until  yesterday were fierce opponents, the "marriage" in which the SDS  of Krajina won the greatest number of ministries, does not  guarantee harmonious relations in the ranks of the ruling  authorities.    If Babic's entry into the government, as thought, represents  an attempt to resist the pressure on the Krajina's SDS deputies  (and the Radicals) aimed at forcing the political "transfer" of  his deputies and breaking the coalition bloc with the Radicals,  then Babic should explain the reasons for his decision, whose  consequence is indeed the collapse of the coalition with the  Radicals.    The intention to preserve "peace in the house" with a  compromise, at the time when the final stage in the denouement  of the status of the Republic of Serbian Krajina is getting  closer and closer, cannot be ruled out as having been in Babic's  mind, but the fact that Babic has assumed a new post and is  staying in power remains on the surface.    Will this adversely affect his political rating? It has been  unofficially learned that Babic's decision did not enjoy the  unreserved support of all the deputies, and that it surprised  members of the SDS of Krajina in Banija, who were against  Mikelic's nomination for prime minister. According to some  Krajina sources, an uncompromising faction among the deputies of  the SDS of Krajina is led by Lazar Macura, who stated at the  meeting of the party deputy caucus that he would not support  Babic's decision.    In any case, Babic cannot count on the support of the party  membership that he enjoyed in the past, nor the support of the  Radicals, considering the way in which he "paid for" his return  to politics; here, the main creator is Krajina's President Milan  Martic, who now has his men not only at the helm of the  government, but also in the important ministries of defense and  internal affairs.</p>

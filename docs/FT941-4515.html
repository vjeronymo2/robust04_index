			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Office Automation (17): Software gives big productivity boost - Efficient access to data / Linking groupware and database software has given a pensions team simple access to both data and documents Packaging manufacturer Lawson Mardon Group is certainly getting its money's worth out of Lotus Notes, reports John Kavanagh. The company has added the software product to its pensions system to give easier access to its database, put Inland Revenue regulations on-line and provide a forum for discussion and sharing experiences. The results have been big productivity increases, better use of skilled specialists' time, faster response to queries and more detailed records. Lawson Mardon produces packaging ranging from chocolate bar wrappers to cigarette cartons and cans for pet food. In the UK alone it has a dozen largely autonomous manufacturing sites - and across Europe there are 4,500 staff. Last year a new pensions administration system went live at the operations centre in Bristol, produced using software development and database management products from Gupta. Technical manager Mr Nick Burnard says the Gupta products 'made it easy to knock up some screens and prototypes with end-users and then move from the prototype to the final system quite quickly.' The new system handles tasks such as keeping records on 15,000 current and former staff, calculating pensions and making payments. Having got the essential administration functions working, the company started looking at different ways of accessing the data and adding other, unstructured information, typically held as paper documents. The central pensions administrators liaise with local pensions contacts at the many company sites, keeping up-to-date their records, which are held in Bristol, and answering queries on anything from individual staff to Inland Revenue regulations. The department wanted to speed-up the response to queries, partly by giving the local pensions contacts on-line access to their data as far as possible. Nick Burnard's team settled on the Notes software package from Lotus Development, largely because it could both provide a simple way for end-users to access a database and handle unstructured information. Lotus offers a facility for setting up forms on the screen, similar to paper forms. Local pensions people, used to sending paper forms to the central department, can now fill in the details through their personal computers and transmit the forms to the central system. There is no group network, so the local contacts call the central system over dial-up lines. Confidentiality and security concerns have led Mr Burnard's team to deal with each type of request at a time, so not all the electronic forms are handled automatically at the Bristol end yet. But he says every task is being looked at to see if it can be automated. As the forms are received by the Notes system it checks whether a form type is one it can handle. If it is not, it directs the form to a queue of work to be dealt with by the central pensions administrators, who look at the forms on their screens and access the database themselves to retrieve the required information. Forms which can be handled automatically, for example a request for details of a staff member, are recognised by Notes and converted into a format which can be processed by the Gupta database enquiry software. The Gupta software retrieves the data and it is sent back to the remote site. Previously, all enquiries were based on manual procedures, paper forms and largely paper files. 'There were no really tight procedures in place,' says Nick Burnard. 'Bits of paper were passed between people and if a file you needed was on someone's desk, you had to find where it was. 'People can now see who is doing what. Managers have greater control of the workload and can make adjustments to accommodate holidays and sickness, and so on. 'An added benefit is that the system automatically records everything that happens. With a paper system you might not bother to record every step. For example, if a request for a benefits statement came in and some of the information was found to be wrong, you might just put it right and not record the error or why it was wrong, yet this could prove important in the future for this file and for others. The new system keeps a record of all such changes.' Some forms require action which is outside the system, but the pensions administration unit is looking at automation here to pass the job from a pensions specialist to a secretary. One example is the addition of a new staff member. At present a pensions administrator creates a record, prints a letter and prepares a welcoming pack, including company and pension booklets. 'We could use an electronic form, completed by the person's local pensions contact, to create the record and print the letter automatically,' says Nick Burnard. 'A secretary could then put together the welcoming pack.' Confidentiality and security are controlled by checks on the author of each request form. Pensions contacts can search the database using many keywords, such as name, birth date and National Insurance number, but their own identification determines the records they can inspect. Nick Burnard says filling in electronic forms to get at the database is far easier than learning Gupta's more traditional database access languages. 'We have introduced Gupta's Quest language to some of the central end-users and, although it's a good product, they have trouble understanding the formal database structures,' he says. However, ease-of-use was not the only reason for installing Notes. The department also wanted to put unstructured or semi-structured information on-line. The full text of the Inland Revenue's book of regulations has been loaded into Notes (the Inland Revenue supplies it on disc as a computer file, as well as in an A4 binder). Nick Burnard says Lawson Mardon's legal and pensions specialists have 'translated the relevant sections into English' and these translations, too, have been loaded into Notes. In addition, the company's own case histories have been loaded. All these regulations and case histories can be indexed and cross-referenced in many different ways - 'this all means that less-experienced people can deal with more queries without consulting senior specialists, who can make better use of their time,' Mr Burnard says. Leaflets from the Department of Social Security are also stored. These are entered using a hand-operated scanner. The pensions unit is considering scanning on a larger scale so that documents such as letters from pension fund members can be entered and accessed electronically. The bulletin board or conference facilities of Notes are used, to enable the various sites to learn from each others' experiences. 'The local contacts used to meet infrequently to discuss issues but now they can go on-line to the discussion database at any time,' says Nick Burnard. 'This is of particular benefit to the smaller operations, where certain circumstances might only come up very occasionally. They can send a request for help to the discussion database and draw on the experience of the larger operations, where such cases crop up more often. This is turning out to be quite a lively forum, because people are being helpful and responding very well.' Automation has brought significant increases in productivity, which are reflected in improved and faster service, rather than job cuts - 'the staff can handle more pension scheme members and more complicated enquiries,' he says. 'The senior people are finding time for research work: for example they are looking at the quality of the data and at the company's payroll systems.' Taking on a work group and conference package like Notes to do database enquiries demanded some lateral thinking. After all, the administration system was developed using Gupta products and Gupta could provide its own enquiry languages - 'if we had only been running the administration system and not had the unstructured information and the discussion database we might have done things a different way - but even then I'm not so sure,' Nick Burnard says. 'We can certainly knock-up enquiry forms very quickly with Notes.'</p>

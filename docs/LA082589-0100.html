			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAYLE DENIES LOOKING FOR ORANGE COUNTY HOME  </P> <P> During a visit to Orange County, Vice President Dan Quayle scotched rumors  Thursday that he and his wife, Marilyn, are looking for a vacation home in the  county.  </P> <P> "We love to be here, but I don't think it is in the cards right now," Quayle  said, dashing the hopes of the dozens of real estate agents who have called the  White House in recent weeks offering to help the Quayles locate a second home  in California. But he added, "Orange County is a wonderful place to be.  Wonderful weather, wonderful people."  </P> <P> Quayle made the comments as he arrived at a $500-per-person dinner at a Newport  Beach restaurant, the second of two events he attended to help the Orange  County and California Republican Party organizations raise money.  </P> <P> A Quayle adviser said in July that the vice president was considering buying a  home in California as a retreat.  </P></p>

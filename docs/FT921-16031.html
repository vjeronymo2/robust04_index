			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: Listing for Dresden dairy company SACHSENMILCH, a small Dresden dairy concern, today becomes the first east German company to have its shares quoted on the German stock market. It is raising DM60m (Dollars 39m) through a flotation on the unlisted section of the Stuttgart bourse. Sachsenmilch has been brought to the market by its new parent, the Stuttgart-based Sudmilch, which wants to raise money for the subsidiary's future expansion. The Dresden company, which employs 450 people, expects turnover to rise from DM296m to DM525m by 1995, when it hopes to make its first profit of some DM10m and pay its first dividend. The shares of Sachsenmilch have been priced at DM80 each. The proceeds will go towards a new dairy, costing around DM260m. After the flotation, 49 per cent of Sachsenmilch's equity will be held by outside shareholders, with the rest owned jointly by Sachsenmilch and local milk producers in Saxony. Analysts noted that Sachsenmilch's efficiency had been increased by the provision of capital and know-how from Sudmilch. Mr Jorg Walter, general manager of the Berlin Stock Exchange, said one or two more east German companies could be listed this year, and maybe as many as 100 within 10 years. 'We were all more optimistic at the start of 1990 that more companies would be listed - maybe too optimistic,' he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Zhurun and Ni Siyi] </F>   [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese  Government will be "cautious" on futures markets despite an  expected rise in futures trading this year, officials and  experts say.    The current policy calls for "positive but cautious  development of futures trading," said Gao Shangquan, head of a  governmental research institution on economic reform.    To achieve the purpose, he said, the State Council will  launch a number of pilot projects on futures trading while  striving to improve the relevant legislation and supervision  mechanisms.    "The approach is to dig a `canal' first and then divert  water  into it, instead of letting it overflow," added Gao, who was  formerly a vice-minister of the State Commission on Economic  Restructuring.    State-imposed prices are being canceled as part of China's  market-oriented economic reform, "prompting enterprises to  safeguard the value of their products by engaging in futures  trading," Gao said.    Profit returns from futures trading, usually high, may also  help increase its business volume, he added.    However, he said, futures trading involves high risk and is  still in the initial stage of development in China. "Neither  the country's conditions nor the actual demand allow an  immediate boom of the business.    "Laws and government decrees on futures trading will be  published only after repeated experiments under the State  Council," said Gao, now a senior researcher with the commission.    "Even in the future, futures trading should be handled with  care," he said.    Gao said that government officials and experts are drafting  a  set of provisional regulations concerning futures trading and  planning the establishment of official bodies to administer the  futures markets.    Meanwhile, China's first futures law is being formulated, he  said.    Gao said that "tight control" is being imposed over entry of  funds from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao and foreign countries  into futures markets on the Chinese mainland. And the  government also advises Chinese citizens to be "cautious" in  international futures trading.    But Gao said that participation in the world futures market  is the ultimate goal of China. "The problem is that China has  yet to meet some of the basic requirements for taking part in  international futures trading," he said.    In 1990, Zhengzhou in central China established the  country's  first grain and edible oil trading market. The country now has  38 commodity exchanges and wholesale markets, dealing with  petroleum, iron, steel and chemicals as well as food. There are  also some 200 registered futures trading companies.    "The progress has been rapid, but problems are many," Gao  said, noting that the government has had to close down what he  called "underground companies" -- "companies" unlicensed and  failing to qualify for futures trading.    In a nationwide futures craze in 1993, some got quick money  but many went bankrupt overnight, Gao said.    Some profiteering merchants from outside the Chinese  mainland  also took advantage of the confusion to drain off China's  revenue, Gao said.</p>

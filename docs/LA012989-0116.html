			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> FLIGHTS TO ISOLATED TOWNS;  </P> <P> SUBSIDIZED AIR SERVICE MAY BE GROUNDED  </P> <P> A dozen times a week, Flight 3323's engines crank into a throbbing whine and  launch an 18-passenger turboprop out of one of the nation's busiest airports  into one of air travel's loneliest routes.  </P> <P> The federally subsidized flight from Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport  200 miles south to Moultrie averages about one passenger. Often the plane flies  empty of passengers.  </P> <P> As the government looks for some wings to clip, Flight 3323's days may be  numbered.  </P> <P> Moultrie, population 16,000, is one of about 150 rural American towns protected  since airline deregulation in 1978 by the government's Essential Air Service  program.  </P> <P> Many of the towns are in isolated areas where bus and train service has  diminished. While some of the flights are seldom used, they often are the only  link, short of long car trips, between two cities.  </P> <P> Under EAS provisions, the government pays the airlines to keep flying the  routes.  </P> <P> It would cost $31.6 million annually in subsidies to maintain current EAS  flights, but only $25 million has been appropriated this fiscal year, and the  Department of Transportation says cuts must be made.  </P> <P> Eastern Atlantis Express, the Eastern Airlines affiliate that has operated the  Atlanta-Moultrie route since 1983, had 1,248 scheduled departures between the  two cities last year and sold 1,301 one-way tickets, an average of just over  one a flight.  </P> <P> The one-way fare is $104. Flight 3323's subsidies last year were $379,000,  which works out to about $291 per passenger.  </P> <P> On Friday morning, a reporter and Rosalind Johnson, a Moultrie native who lives  in Denver, were the only passengers on the one-hour flight to this southern  Georgia farm town. The amiable co-pilot walked back from the curtained cockpit,  squatted in the aisle and explained the many safety features of the aircraft.  </P> <P> "Any questions?" he asked. "OK, let's go."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Makes Trip Often  </P> <P> "I've been the only passenger on this flight many times," said Johnson, who has  been making the trip often recently because of sick relatives.  </P> <P> The town has no college or major industry. There is no Amtrak service within  130 miles; the bus trip from Atlanta takes 5 1/2 hours.  </P> <P> "It would be a shame not to have it," Johnson said of the airline route. "I  don't know what I'll do if they stop -- fly to Albany and drive, I guess."  Albany, with several daily flights, is a 40-minute drive from Moultrie.  </P> <P> An inaudible message crackled over a loudspeaker. "Usually they just lean back  into the cabin and shout if they want us to know something," she said over the  engine.  </P> <P> On the return to Atlanta, the plane held six passengers. One young woman going  to Atlanta to visit friends said she usually drives. "But it's 3 1/2 hours each  way and that gets long after a while," she said.  </P> <P> In deciding what subsidies may be cut, the Transportation Department is looking  at several factors, including whether air service is available elsewhere in the  area, which routes have high subsidies and which routes have the fewest  passengers.  </P> <P> "We most likely will be targeted," said David Howard, a vice president of the  Florence, S.C.-based Atlantis line. "We did refile last July to keep the  market." He said the subsidy allows a profit of 5%.  </P> <P> The Essential Air Service subsidy program was authorized for 10 years and has  been extended, with modifications, into 1998. David Smallen, a spokesman for  the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, said congressmen from  rural districts are dedicated to keeping it.  </P></p>

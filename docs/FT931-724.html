			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (4): Sprinter at the front of the pack - Behind the vibrant economic successes, frayed nerves are sometimes apparent LAST August, Singapore's Business Times newspaper received an unwelcome visit from officers of the government's Internal Security Department. They questioned journalists, took away notebooks and computer files, and subsequently the paper's editor, Mr Patrick Daniel, was among four people charged under Singapore's official secrets act. His 'crime': publishing a leaked preliminary estimate of the country's second quarter gross domestic product which showed annual growth to be lower than expected at 4.6 to 4.8 per cent. With the trial of those accused still continuing, the precise explanation for this uniquely Singaporean story remains obscure. But the affair has taken its place in the public consciousness as a vivid reminder of the concern in the island state last summer over the economy. Growth was falling after the blow to confidence delivered by the Gulf war in 1990-91, the US economy which is the principal market for Singapore's exports was anaemic, the world consumer electronics industry on which a large chunk of Singaporean manufacturing depends was in a serious recession, and Singapore's attractiveness as a manufacturing location looked threatened by a sharp rise in unit labour costs. To the government it all had an ominous ring: the last time there had been such a combination was in 1985, when Singapore experienced a serious recession - its only one since independence and an event seared into the minds of all Singaporeans. As it turns out, the fears were massively overdone. Growth has continued at a rate that the industrial countries can only envy, manufacturing output has recovered after a drop in the first quarter, exports are surging, the financial services sector has bounced back, the rise in labour and business costs has moderated, and foreign investment is still pouring in. The government now reckons that the economy bottomed out in the third quarter of last year, and grew by 5.8 per cent for the year as a whole - admittedly a slower rate than Singapore has been used to over the past two decades but healthy even by comparison with the other newly industrialising economies such as Hong Kong (5 per cent) and South Korea (4.9 per cent). And the pace is accelerating: the government has just revised upwards its estimate for this year's gdp to show expansion of 6 to 7 per cent. In all seriousness, government ministers call it Singapore's 'soft landing'. The country's success in steering through the threat of a sharp slowdown and putting itself back on the path of more rapid expansion results from a mixture of luck and judgment. In the first place, the contraction in 1991 and the first half of 1992 would have been much worse but for deft deployment of government funds to fuel a domestic construction boom. The construction sector grew by 18 per cent last year, aided by a burst of public spending on infrastructure such as roads, the port, hospitals, schools and housing. Singapore remains in the fortunate position of enjoying a substantial budget surplus, which enables the government to turn the spending taps on or off at will. Externally, strong growth in the south-east Asian neighbourhood also helped carry the Singaporean economy through the first half of 1992, enabling it to capitalise on its traditional role as a transport and communications hub. But the main motors for its subsequent acceleration were twofold: The unexpectedly strong recovery in America: non-oil exports to the US increased by an impressive 12 per cent in the second half. Although ministers do not expect performance to be sustained at quite that level in 1993, the US economy should be strong enough to offset weakness in Singapore's European and Japanese markets. Electronics exports. As maker of around half the world's computer disk drives and of components for a wide range of consumer electronics products, Singapore is uniquely exposed to the international fortunes of these industries. Slowdown in the markets of the industrialised world and the apparent saturation of demand for certain consumer electronics goods spread gloom in the first few months of 1992. Today, whereas computer manufacturers everywhere are bleeding from a savage price war in personal computers, Singapore is benefiting from a resulting surge in demand for disk drives, integrated circuits and computer peripherals. And with new consumer electronics products beginning to pour back on to the market, it is poised to win a healthy slice of that action too. Nevertheless, the worries being expressed last year have not vanished. The government frets constantly about maintaining Singapore's position in the contest for foreign investment, about the dangers of overheating in the labour and property markets, and about achieving a sustainable, as opposed to helter-skelter, rate of growth. It still has some reasons for concern. The most obvious is the unit cost of labour. Just a year ago, it looked as if a damaging gap was opening up between rapidly rising wages and much slower improvements in productivity: nominal wages rose by 9.2 per cent in 1991, productivity by a miserable 1.5 per cent. In the first quarter of last year, productivity actually fell by 0.9 per cent. The picture has improved considerably since then: last year, wages grew by 7.5 per cent and productivity by an average of 3.1 per cent as manufacturing output recovered. Nevertheless, with unemployment below 3 per cent of the workforce, there is precious little slack in the economy. Moreover, with the service sector playing an increasingly important role, it is becoming more difficult all the time to keep productivity rising in line with wages. As Dr Richard Hu, finance minister, put it in his budget speech last month: 'Efforts to improve productivity and restructure the domestic economy to squeeze more out of each unit of resource will face diminishing returns, as we are already starting from a relatively high base.' The government is working hard to keep business costs under control. In the budget, for example, Dr Hu announced a cut in corporate tax next year from 30 to 27 per cent, to be offset by the introduction of a 3 per cent goods and services tax (GST), and proclaimed the government's intention to get corporate taxes down to 25 per cent in due course. But ministers are well aware that Singapore's constraints of space, manpower and resources will for the foreseeable future impose a natural limit on the rate at which they an afford to let the economy grow. 'Our population is not growing, but if we can sustain productivity growth of 3-4 per cent we should be able to sustain 5-6 per cent economic growth,' says Mr Suppiah Dhanabalan, trade and industry minister. 'Anything more would lead to overheating.' The real answer to such problems in the long term - enunciated every time a minister opens his mouth in public these days - lies not in further boosting the domestic economy but in capitalising on opportunities in the wider region. The challenge Singapore faces is to equip itself for a major investment drive into the rapidly growing economies around it in Asia, and in this task it has only just begun.</p>

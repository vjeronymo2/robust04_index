			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sharp decline at Fired Earth Tiles Fired Earth Tiles, the specialist tiles retailer, reported a sharp decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 136,000 to Pounds 6,000 for the six months to July 2 1992, and has omitted its interim dividend. Mr Nicholas Kneale, the chairman, stressed that the protection of the balance sheet was of the utmost importance. Although he said gearing was a modest 17 per cent, this was a deterioration from the previous year's 10 per cent. Net assets per share were currently 40p. The start of the year was particularly depressed with a combined loss of around Pounds 150,000 in January and February, but since then there had been steady, if unimpressive monthly profits, Mr Kneale said. Trading on a monthly basis remained difficult, but the company intended to review the level of final dividend when full year results were available. Last year, a 1.625p interim was followed by a 2.4p final. First-half turnover was static at Pounds 2.46m and there were nil earnings per share (1.79p).</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURNABOUT IN CUBA  </P> <P> Fidel Castro is going all out to make this week's visit to Cuba by Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev look like an upbeat meeting between friends and  allies. But no amount of positive public statements can hide the differences  between the rigid Marxism that Castro imposed on his people and Gorbachev's  more open style of Communism.  </P> <P> The dissonance between appearances and reality began with Gorbachev's arrival  at Havana's airport Sunday. An estimated half million people turned out to  greet the Soviet leader, about a quarter of the capital's population. To some  extent, the large crowds reflect genuine Cuban gratitude for the more than $5  billion a year in economic aid that the Soviet Union provides to Castro. But  the crowds also reflect how disciplined Cuba's Communists are. They have  neighborhood defense committees in every community on the island, and can turn  people out when necessary.  </P> <P> Many Cubans in the crowds also are undoubtedly curious about this new Soviet  leader. While the official Cuban media have limited the amount of information  people on the island get about Gorbachev's efforts at glasnost and reform, many  Cubans are aware that something unusual is afoot in the Soviet Union, and they  certainly know that Castro is not very happy about it. On several recent  occasions the Cuban dictator has publicly voiced his disapproval of Gorbachev's  campaign of perestroika to restructure the Soviet economy, warning audiences  against the danger of using "capitalist mechanisms to build socialism." To  emphasize his own Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy, Castro has even abandoned minimal  economic reforms and other openings recently attempted in Cuba, calling for a  campaign of "rectification."  </P> <P> Gorbachev's challenge in Cuba is to try to get Castro to change his ways  without angering a notoriously volatile ally. Cuba is a drain on the Soviet  Union, so Gorbachev wants Castro to run things more efficiently, if only for  the sake of economy. But Cuba is the Soviet Union's chief outpost in the  Western Hemisphere, and that gives Castro important leverage in dealing with  Gorbachev. The interplay between two such strong and highly visible  personalities will be intriguing to watch. And, if nothing else, there is  historic irony in the reversal of roles being played during the first visit to  Cuba by a Soviet leader in 15 years. Fidel Castro built his international  reputation playing the young, firebrand revolutionary who was willing to  challenge orthodox old men in the Kremlin. Now Castro is the rigid older man  having to deal with a maverick from Moscow.  </P></p>

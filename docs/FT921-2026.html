			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Canadian Air and American near deal THE long-awaited restruct-uring of Canada's airline industry has come a step closer with news that American Airlines, one of the top three US carriers, is at an advanced stage of negotiating a 'comprehensive strategic alliance' with Canadian Airlines International. American and Canadian's parent, PWA Corp of Calgary, said yesterday that detailed talks were being held on an equity investment, joint marketing programmes and other unidentified reciprocal services. Earlier speculation suggested that American was planning to acquire a 49 per cent stake in PWA. Mr Robert Crandall, American's chief executive, said that 'preliminary discussions have established the basis for an agreement which would strengthen the competitive position of both carriers'. In addition to its extensive domestic routes, Canadian operates a highly profitable service from Canada to various Asian cities. It also flies to Europe and Latin America. Canadian lost CDollars 161.7m (USDollars 135.8m) last year on revenues of CDollars 2.9bn. Any deal struck between the two carriers would face a number of hurdles. Canadian law at present limits foreign ownership in the airline industry to 25 per cent, and Canadian's main rival, Air Canada, has lobbied vigorously against any significant foreign involvement in the domestic industry. Supporters of such a deal have noted that the likely alternative, a merger between Canadian and Air Canada, would lead to massive lay-offs, without solving the problem of competition from the emerging global airline groupings.</p>

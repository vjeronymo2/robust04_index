			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO SHOCKED BY MT. SAC -- AGAIN  </P> <P> El Camino College basketball players had a look of disbelief on their faces  Saturday night. For the second time this season, the last-place team in the  five-member South Coast Conference, Mt. San Antonio College, had beaten the  ninth-ranked Warriors, this time 62-55.  </P> <P> "Apparently Mt. SAC has a better team than El Camino," said Warrior Coach Ron  McClurkin. "They've outplayed us twice. They just played better than we did."  </P> <P> The Mounties (6-17, 2-3) made nine free throws in the closing minutes to hand  El Camino its third conference loss. The Warriors fell to 2-3 and 17-7 overall.  </P> <P> "We were ready to play," said Mt. SAC Coach Ralph Osterkamp, whose team  defeated the Warriors, 60-58, in Torrance on Jan. 6. "I think we played very  good. They played well, too, though."  </P> <P> But not well enough. Only two Warriors scored in double figures, David Keeter  and Jamal Ross, who each had 12.  </P> <P> With 12:36 left in the first half, Mt. SAC took 13-12 lead after a  three-pointer by Tony McGee. El Camino managed to break away to a 27-23 lead  with 4:59 to go, but the Mounties surged ahead, 29-27, on Lamont Keller's  10-foot jumper with 1:28 left.  </P> <P> Sophomore forward Steve Leary, who was fouled by Mt. SAC's Scott St. Clair at  the buzzer, sank two free throws to tie the score 29-29 at halftime.  </P> <P> The Warriors fell behind in the opening minutes of the second half. With 6:13  remaining, they trailed by seven after Mt. SAC's John Moses sank a pair of free  throws.  </P> <P> The Warriors cut the deficit to three, 53-50, on a Darius Dubose three-pointer  with 2:30 left to play, but Mt. SAC's McGee drove into the key for a bank shot  with 1:13 left to give the Mounties a five-point edge.  </P> <P> Then Keeter fouled Moses, who sank both free throws with 58 seconds left to  secure the victory.  </P> <P> The Warriors host Pasadena at 8 p.m. Wednesday.  </P></p>

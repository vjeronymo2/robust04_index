			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Management: Mickey Mouse outfit suffers culture shock - Michael Skapinker finds the lights off at Euro Disney / Marketing and Advertising Despite a barrage of publicity which is unlikely to be matched when astronauts set foot on Mars, Euro Disney, Europe's biggest leisure park, has had a rocky start. Attempts to impress financial analysts and journalists in the days leading up to the opening earlier this month were bedevilled by technical failures and long queues. When it became clear that I would barely hear Jose Carreras and see no more than his right ear, I decided to watch the gala opening of Euro Disney on the television set in my hotel room rather than as one of 15,000 invited guests. Which is how I happened to be in Euro Disney's 1,100-room Newport Bay Club hotel when the lights went out. The two-hour power failure was the culmination of a weekend of computer problems which had made checking-in a bad tempered scramble and meant there was no record of guests' phone calls. The analysts, alarmed by high prices and rides that broke down, advised clients to sell Euro Disney shares. Since the day of their visit the shares have fallen 20 per cent on the Paris stock exchange. Mark Feary, Euro Disney's vice president for marketing, acknowledges that now the park is open, the task of selling it changes. The pre-opening publicity included a Dollars 10m Europe-wide television advertising campaign and a two-hour live TV special broadcast to 30 countries. While the company will continue to advertise on television and in magazines, the primary task now is to ensure paying visitors are more impressed than analysts and journalists. Apart from telling their friends and neighbours how marvellous the park is, the company also wants those visitors to come back. Repeat business is an essential part of Disney's success in the US. Feary says that more than 90 per cent of customers filing through the gates of Disney's American parks have been there before. Euro Disney says it is unreasonable to expect a project of this size to escape technical mishaps. 'You don't get it right the second you start,' says Timothy Wolf, senior vice president for human resources and administration. This would be true of any other organisation opening its doors on a FFr22bn (Pounds 2.2bn) project. Disney's problem is that it competes against its own reputation for getting things right. The technical difficulties can be overcome. Whether Euro Disney's staff can achieve the ever-smiling, endlessly helpful standards set by their US counterparts is open to question. The 14,000 'cast members' taken on to work at Euro Disney are, mostly, nice enough. 'Mostly', because even on opening weekend some clearly couldn't care less. My suggestion to one staff member that she investigate why I had received a mild electric shock from a barrier in one of the park's restaurants was greeted with derision. My overwhelming impression of the other employees was that they were out of their depth. There is much more to being a cast member than endlessly saying 'bonjour'. Apart from having a detailed knowledge of the site, Euro Disney staff have the anxiety of not knowing in what language they are going to be addressed. Although most of the staff are supposed to be proficient in English and French, many were struggling. One cast member, who has worked for the company in the US, candidly volunteered that service at Euro Disney falls way short of the standards at the American parks. In fairness, some of the difficulties hampering Euro Disney staff are probably temporary. The most serious of these is that many cannot find accommodation near the site and are commuting for up to two hours to and from work every day. Wolf believes that nearly 4,000 staff have accommodation problems. By building its own flats and renting rooms in local homes, Wolf, who admits the housing problem keeps him awake at night, says the company is providing new accommodation at the rate of 100 beds a week. Housing for employees, he says, was one area where communication with the otherwise co-operative French government broke down. A less severe difficulty is the problem of the disappearing name badges. All cast members have to wear a Mickey Mouse name badge. Several have lost theirs and borrowed one from a colleague, so that you meet Irish cast members called Jean-Luc and Germans called Juan. (Jean-Luc and Juan are not their real false names. In a company where you can be dismissed for failing to maintain 'an appropriate weight and size', wearing the wrong name tag is probably punishable with confinement in Sleeping Beauty's castle with only Goofy for company.) The employees might grow into their jobs but Disney executives say staff turnover at theme parks is high. The Disney style of service is one with which Americans have grown up. There are several styles of service (or lack of it) in Europe; unbridled enthusiasm is not a marked feature of them. Robert from Brighton is at least civil. He is too busy for me to ask him where he worked before Euro Disney. But given the practiced air with which he explains that service on Peter Pan's Flight has been suspended, British Rail seems a likely candidate. One would marvel at Euro Disney's attention to this detail of British life, were Robert not kitted out for an afternoon of yodelling. 'It's Tyrolean,' he says of his costume. Euro Disney has been at pains to point out how European it is. Roy Disney, founder Walt's nephew, told the opening ceremony that the d'Isigny family had lived in France until as recently as the Norman invasion of England - a revelation greeted with regrettable levity by some of the audience. Fantasyland, one of five 'themed' areas, is largely devoted to European tales: Snow White, Pinocchio, Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan. In Adventureland, Katherine from Birmingham is wearing an even more curious creation: a long black and white robe with some sort of shawl. 'It's Tahitian, or something like that,' she explains. Adventureland is a bit of the east, some African-style curios, ship-wrecked Swiss Family Robinson's home and Pirates of the Caribbean. This, clearly, is Disney's collection of exotica. But domes and minarets are a common feature of European cities. Many residents of Europe trace their roots to Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. Perhaps only the high-minded will find Adventureland and Fantasyland insulting. But the unabashedly American nature of areas such as Frontierland and Main Street USA means they are easier to recall. The cultural promiscuity evident in Tyrolean Robert's supervision of Peter Pan's flight and The Chant of the Tom-Toms alongside Egyptian perfume bottles renders this set of attractions curiously unmemorable.</p>

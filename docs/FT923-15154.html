			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nervous platinum market climbs to 13-month high THE PLATINUM price yesterday continued the rise prompted by renewed political tension in South Africa, which accounts for about 70 per cent of world production. Platinum's performance and an unexpected cut in the US discount rate helped push gold through an important technical resistance point, Dollars 345 a troy ounce. Since Monday, fears about possible strikes at the South African mines have lifted platinum in London by Dollars 20.65 an ounce or nearly 6 per cent. Yesterday the metal closed in London up another Dollars 3.90 an ounce at Dollars 387.90, its highest level since May last year. On the New York Commodity Exchange (Nymex) July platinum reached Dollars 400 an ounce yesterday morning. Analysts suggested a South African miners' strike was unlikely but it was too risky to go short of platinum during the present rally. Platinum in the past has moved up Dollars 50 to Dollars 100 an ounce in a matter of weeks, they pointed out. Mr Jeremy Coombes, analyst at Johnson Matthey, the world's largest platinum marketing organisation, said that platinum might move to Dollars 400 an ounce more quickly than he previously expected and a sustained move above Dollars 400 could trigger renewed interest by US investors. However, Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, suggested the market was not taking account of weakening Japanese economic activity.</p>

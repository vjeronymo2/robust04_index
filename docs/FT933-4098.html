			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / TUC plea to Labour body THE TUC has complained to the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation about the British government's new legislation permitting employers to deny pay increases to any employees who refuse to sign personal contracts, thus requiring them to give up their rights of union representation. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said yesterday that this provision of the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act was 'a clear violation of the key ILO convention on the right to organise and collective bargaining'. He acknowledged that the ILO lacked the legal powers to force the government to amend the legislation, but said that the TUC should keep up the pressure and expose how employment rights in Britain did not match up to international labour standards. In recent years the ILO has upheld TUC complaints and criticised the British government for unilaterally abolishing the negotiating rights of the teachers' unions and failing to put an end to the blacklisting of trade unionists by employers.</p>

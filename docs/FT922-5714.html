			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Letter: Reality of pound/franc merger in EMS Sir, Picking up Anthony Harris's reference to my suggestion for a pound/franc merger within the EMS ('When gentlemen prefer bonds', May 26) the immediate question is whether the pound and franc together would be better able than individually to break below the Deutsche mark interest rate barrier. The weighting of the D-Mark in the Ecu is 30.36 per cent. The weighting of the pound/franc would be 12.60 + 19.32 = 31.92 per cent. A window of opportunity has been reopened by the recent strength of the pound - up 2.5 per cent against the franc since the election and only 1.5 per cent away from the magic figure of 10 francs to the pound. All that would initially be required is a declaration of intent from the two governments and a 1.1 per cent adjustment of the pound's central rates within the EMS parity grid (from 9.8939 to 10 in the case of the franc). It could be done at the same time as the government moves to the narrow band. In the medium term the pound/franc would provide an alternative to the D-Mark/Ecu in the move towards Emu - in line with the Treasury's erstwhile preference for competing currencies and an evolutionary approach.

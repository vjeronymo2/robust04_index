			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Pru takes lead on 'accruals accounting' PRUDENTIAL Corporation, Britain's largest life assurance company, yesterday restated its 1991 earnings under the new 'accruals accounting' rules, showing for the first time shareholders' interest in the life funds, valued at Pounds 2.4bn. Under the new method, pre-tax profits for 1991 were restated to Pounds 620m, or 20.3p per share, against the previously declared profit of Pounds 267m, or 7.5p per share. Mr Mike Lawrence, Prudential's group finance director, said the accruals-based earnings were not intended to substitute for the company's cash accounting, but would supplement it. Prudential's share price fell 8p before recovering to close just 2 1/2 lower at 276p, with analysts saying that the Pounds 2.4bn stake attributed to shareholders was at the low end of what they had expected. Analysts said that the value of the new accounting would increase as more companies shifted to its use. Several other companies, including Britannia Life and BAT, are said to be preparing similar accounting reports. Mr Lawrence said that the restated earnings would not result in higher dividends. However, it could bolster the Pru's share price if it encouraged greater understanding of the company's true value. Although the stake is attributable to shareholders, it is not available to them because of regulatory restrictions. However, the new accruals-based system of accounting allows shareholders to see the size of their stake - something they cannot do under present accounting rules. However, insurance industry analysts awarded Prudential high marks for the exercise, the first to be completed by a British insurer since the Association of British Insurers recommended experimenting with accruals accounting. The procedure is currently voluntary although the ABI will consider whether it should become the industry standard after a three-year experiment. For the first time, analysts are able to see the profitability of key portions of Prudential's business. For instance, it recorded a Pounds 15m profit on sales of Pounds 300m single-premium with-profits bonds in 1991, the new figures show. Under accruals accounting, life companies may recognise profits as they occur instead of the current system which does not recognise any product's profitability until it matures. See Lex</p>

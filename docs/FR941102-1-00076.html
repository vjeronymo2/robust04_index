			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On average for the 21 months of data available in the record  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the protein price recommended for adoption in this decision, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $1.6851 per pound of protein, is twice both the $.6379 per pound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average other solids price and the $.8374 per pound average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> butterfat price. Certainly, pricing protein at double the price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the other components in milk gives producers a clear message  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that protein is the component most desired in the marketplace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without over-valuing that component. The significant difference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in prices between protein and the other nonfat solids and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> butterfat components should give producers an incentive to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase protein output.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testimony by several proponents of component pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained that component pricing would be more equitable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handlers than the current skim-butterfat pricing system. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proponents explained that the increased equity would be due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handlers paying for milk based more closely on its economic value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to them. This increased equity is reflected in a narrower spread  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in margins between handlers making cheese from low protein-low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solids milk versus handlers making cheese from high protein-high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solids milk. Several exhibits showed that handlers using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``average'' milk would experience little if any change in their net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> margins. However, handlers using low-testing milk would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience a higher net margin than under the present pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan, while handlers using high-testing milk would experience a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower net margin. This result, the narrowing of handlers' net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> margins when compared to the skim-butterfat pricing system, would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur no matter which of the proposed pricing plans is used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price the components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis of data presented at the hearing, using price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computations based on each of the proposals and averaged over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21 months of data included in exhibits, shows a range of net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing margins for cheese using the recommended pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system of $1.57 per hundredweight compared with the $3.34 range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in cheese manufacturing margins per hundredweight of milk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchased attributable to the current skim-butterfat pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. The three component pricing plans discussed at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing would result in ranges in net cheese manufacturing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> margins of $1.16 per hundredweight for the NAJ proposal, $1.62  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per hundredweight for the CMPC proposal, and $1.70 per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hundredweight for the NCI proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even though the NAJ proposal yielded the smallest spread in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net margins, further analysis of the NAJ results shows that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net margins increase and then start to decline. The decline in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> margins occurs when there is not enough butterfat in the milk to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fully utilize the protein available, thus reducing the increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in cheese yield as protein content continues to increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, if the price of protein is greater than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased return from cheese, the net return will start to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decline in net returns under the NAJ proposal indicates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the NAJ proposal would overprice protein, at least when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is not enough butterfat to fully utilize the protein. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result is that the marginal return using the NAJ proposal peaks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the protein and butterfat range of average milk while the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marginal return using the protein and other solids price as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended in this decision continues to increase, although at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decreasing rate. A mandated pricing system should not set prices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at levels that result in a declining marginal return,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly when the decline occurs at or near average market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component levels. Therefore, the whey protein factor should not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be included in the computation of the protein price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The monthly average price for 40-pound block cheddar cheese  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, Wisconsin, is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate price to use for determining the protein price. Use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the block price results in producers receiving a higher price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for protein than if the barrel price were used without handlers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurring any significantly higher cost for milk. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although the record showed that more cars of barrel cheese were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sold on the Exchange than block cheese, the predominant cheese  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form in which American cheese is manufactured in the five-market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> region is in 40-pound or 640-pound blocks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

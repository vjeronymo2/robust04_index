Fedorov based his decision on the fact that his two  conditions had not been met: first, that Aleksandr Zaveryukha be  removed from the government, and second, that Viktor  Gerashchenko be released from the post of chairman of the  Central Bank of Russia.    Fedorov added that his decision was also explained by his  "disagreement with the program planned by the government."</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Yen's easing against dollar encourages Nikkei index The yen's easing against the dollar encouraged buying by overseas investors, but selling by domestic institutions eroded the gains and the Nikkei index closed marginally higher after moving in a narrow range, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 average rose 46.51 to 20,270.75 after a low of 20,221.04 and a high of 20,360.37. The Topix index of all first section stocks, however, fell 1.36 to 1,643.20. Volume totaled 400m shares against 290.7m. The day's activity rose on trading related to the monthly options settlement yesterday. The Nikkei 300 lost 0.33 to 300.75. Losers led gainers by 499 to 489, with 184 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.93 to 1,345.69. Rumours that the Bank of Japan was buying dollars against the yen prompted some dollar purchases by investors. The yen eased moderately against the dollar, encouraging buying of export-oriented high-technology issues. Hitachi and NEC both hit new highs for the year on active buying. Hitachi rose Y13 to Y995 and NEC gained Y10 to Y1,180. Other electronics stocks were similarly firm, with Fujitsu up Y20 to Y1,050 and Sony rising Y40 to Y5,880. Hopes of a rising market share in the US supported Mazda Motor, which gained Y12 to Y585, and Hino Motors which rose Y49 to Y915. Some banks were lower on profit taking. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y10 to Y3,290 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank lost Y30 to Y1,980. Retailers rose on prospects of a boost in private consumption because of an income tax cut scheduled next month. Ito-Yokado rose Y220 to Y5,640 and Jusco gained Y60 to Y2,340. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 73.25 to 22,446.74. Roundup Thursday's decline in the US producer price index, indicating better inflationary and interest rate expectations, was welcomed in the Pacific Basin. HONG KONG detected new buy orders and fresh short covering from Europe in the late afternoon as the Hang Seng index rose 255.86, or 2.9 per cent to 9,134.72, 6 per cent higher on the week in turnover up from HKDollars 4.62bn to HKDollars 5.02bn. Properties were the main target, the sub-index gaining 4.6 per cent. Cheung Kong, the most active stock, advanced HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 37.75, followed by Sun Hung Kai, up HKDollars 2.00 to HKDollars 49. Henderson Land, described as oversold recently, climbed HKDollars 3.00, or 8 per cent, to HKDollars 40.50. SYDNEY's All Ordinaries index closed up 28.6 at 2,070.0, 3.3 per cent better on the week, lifted by bullish trade in the futures market and renewed confidence in bonds. Rising commodity prices also encouraged buying. Turnover was ADollars 527.7m. Among leading resource stocks, BHP leapt 54 cents to ADollars 17.58 while CRA and Western Mining both rose 20 cents, to ADollars 17.80 and ADollars 7.70 respectively. The oil sector closed nearly 4 per cent stronger on a six-month high in world oil prices. Woodside Petroleum gained 29 cents at ADollars 4.75, Santos jumped 19 at ADollars 4.30 and Ampolex rose 9 at ADollars 4.35. SINGAPORE saw demand for blue chips as the Straits Times Industrial index rose 35.71 to 2,286.12, 1.4 per cent up on the week, in volume of 100.5m shares. BANGKOK rose 2.15 per cent on the day, while its week's gain was 1.5 per cent. The SET index put on 26.45 to 1,259.17 in turnover of Bt4.7bn. The banking sector was strong with Thai Farmers Bank up Bt4 at Bt110 after reporting a jump of 34.7 per cent in net profit to Bt2.1bn for the first quarter. Bangkok Bank gained Bt2 to Bt163. TAIPEI's weighted index rose 57.57 to 6,061.95, 1.8 per cent better on the week, as buying of paper and pulp stocks intensified just before the close. The sector led on continued expectations for an industry recovery and higher product prices. China Petrochemical rose by the daily 7 per cent limit on optimism over its offer of 298m shares this month. WELLINGTON gained on blue chip buying, Telecom on results and Fletcher on the extension of a good run. The NZSE-40 index closed 12.19 higher at 2,105.19, 2.8 per cent up on the week. BOMBAY was lifted by speculative buying in low volume on expectations of concessions for brokers in the Reserve Bank of India's credit policy to be released today. The BSE 30 share index closed 27.40 higher at 3,808.50, up 2.5 per cent on the week. COLOMBO remained short of foreign interest, but domestic buying took the all-share index up 11.70 to 1,006.07, for a week's decline of 3.7 per cent. SEOUL failed to maintain its strength, as consolidation started in reaction to seven straight gains. The composite stock index shed 2.00 to 950.45, still 2.4 per cent higher on the week.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- The fight against unemployment  remains the main goal of the Social Democrats at present. "We  need a national employment pact in Germany," SPD [Social  Democratic Party of Germany] leader Rudolf Scharping stressed at  the 15th DGB [German Trade Union Federation] federal congress in  Berlin today. "Courage and political decisiveness" are needed to  attract available money in Germany to finance jobs and not  unemployment. It is not acceptable that 120 billion German  marks [DM] are spent each year to finance unemployment, he said.  Changed framework conditions for economic and taxation policies  are now required.    Scharping again came out against the solidarity levy [to  finance German unity], which is to be reintroduced next year.  This is "socially unjust" and "economically questionable." If  80 percent of those liable to taxation have to "dig deep into  their pockets," then they will be forced to compensate for this  deficit in the next pay round. The business world should also  be aware of this fact. Instead of a "stream of ever new taxes,"  the government should finally commit itself to an active  campaign against tax evasion and subsidy abuses at the big  companies, the SPD chairman stressed, in light of the recent  scandals at Baederkoenig Zwick or concerning the property  magnate Schneider.    In this connection, the "dangerously high state debt" is  alarming. It would have reached DM2 billion by the end of the  year. That is equivalent to a per capita debt of DM25,000. Not  least for this reason, higher earners should at last be turned  to in order to finance German unity. Scharping was critical of  the low level of state expenditure for research, which only  makes up 1.5 percent of the federal budget. Only by means of a  clearly expanded research and development program can an  ecologically sound economy with international competitive  advantages be achieved.    The SPD emphatically appealed for more rigorous action  against the right-wing and tougher intervention by the police  during violence. "If drunken idiots chase citizens, then the  police must intervene and lock them up instead of releasing them  before the state prosecutor sees them," and the ringleaders must  be held up by the [land] parliaments.    The SPD leader offered the trade union federation close  cooperation in modernizing the social welfare state. Many  things in the public sector are too bureaucratic and too  inflexible. With a view to the imminent postal reforms, he  emphasized that purposeful privatization can definitely be put  into practice more effectively if common responsibility for it  is accepted.</p>

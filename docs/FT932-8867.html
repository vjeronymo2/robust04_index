			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / People: Euromarkets veteran turns to NatWest John Sanders, a familiar figure in the Euromarkets in the mid 1980's, is to resurface at NatWest Markets, where, with the title of managing director, he will be responsible for client marketing and business development on the investment banking side, reporting to chief executive Martin Owen. Sanders, 50, agrees the job, which he starts in July, will be 'very different' from his current assignment as chairman of Royal Bank of Canada Europe, but he also believes he is joining 'an enormously powerful institution in its infancy'. NatWest recently merged its wholesale businesses - treasury, corporate and investment banking - under the one umbrella. He says he is looking forward to working with clients without direct line-management responsibility. After seven years with Royal Bank of Canada he had reached a natural parting point, he adds. John Howland-Jackson, who arrived three months ago from Nomura as senior managing director in charge of investment banking, says he and Sanders will work very closely together. The two already know each other well, 'having both lived in the Euromarkets for the last 20 years.' Howland-Jackson adds: 'This elevates our marketing to a higher level. We have got more technical investment banking skills than some people imagine, but because of our origins in retail banking, we are not blessed with an oversupply of executives experienced in dealing at the most senior level in investment banking matters.'. Having run international capital markets at S G Warburg, and been the first chairman of the International Primary Markets Association, Sanders moved to the Royal Bank of Canada group, initially as chairman and chief executive of Orion Royal Bank. He then entered a phase during which, as he agrees, he 'did alot of closing down' - notably Orion's Eurobond and gilt-edged securities business followed later by stockbrokers Kitkat &amp; Aitken.</p>

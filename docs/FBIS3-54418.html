['Arafat] I went to console my brother President Hafiz  al-Asad after the martyrdom of his son, hero Basil al-Asad. I  stopped over in Cairo on my way here.    [Al-Shahri] What will you say to the custodian of the Two  Holy Mosques?    ['Arafat] I will say a lot of things. I will ask him to  shoulder the responsibility for al-Aqsa Mosque, and I am certain  he is capable of shouldering this responsibility.    [Al-Shahri] What will you say to the Saudi people?    ['Arafat] We will continue to move together until we pray in  al-Aqsa Mosque.    [Al-Shahri] But you were not with this people during the  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait?    ['Arafat] I hope that issue will be brought to a close. I  said that we will pray together in al-Aqsa Mosque.    [Al-Shahri] Fine. You met with Peres in Oslo. Did your  talks with him achieve any progress?    ['Arafat] There has been no progress. However, we agreed to  continue the talks this week in order to bridge the gaps between  us.    [Al-Shahri] Opposition to your policy continues to increase  inside and outside the PLO.    ['Arafat] We are a democratic state, and every person is  entitled to say whatever he likes. We respect others' views.    [Al-Shahri] Kuwaitis say that they have recently discovered  weapons and skulls inside the Palestinian embassy. What is your  opinion?    ['Arafat] Brother, it was a machine gun and a pistol  belonging to the ambassador. They must not say that.    [Al-Shahri] What about the skulls?    ['Arafat] They must not say that. They are dummies made out  of plaster for first aid training.    [Al-Shahri] What will you tell them if they insist these  corpses exist?    ['Arafat] Let them prove it.    [Al-Shahri] Will your Gulf tour be limited to the Kingdom,  or are you going to visit other states like Kuwait, for example?    ['Arafat] If I am invited, I will visit them.    [Al-Shahri] You did not tell me what you are going to say to  the Saudi people?    ['Arafat] Respected brother, I answered your question. I  said we will head for al-Aqsa Mosque together. By the way, why  are you interrogating me? Good-bye.</p>

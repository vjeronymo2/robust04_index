			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris edges down after interest rate cut SENIOR bourses were weaker yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS gave only a second glance to the cut in interest rates by the Bank of France, which had been anticipated. The CAC-40 index closed down 21.96 or 1.1 per cent at 1,920.55. Mr Ian Furnivall, Paris-based analyst at Hoare Govett, commented that real interest rates still remained very high in France, and the rate cuts were happening at a more leisurely pace than the market desired. The real worry, he said was that the government's privatisation plans, while on the one hand an attempt to reduce the budget deficit, were coming about at a time when institutions were overweight in France and the market was overbought. 'There is a risk of the market being swamped in new paper,' he said. 'An imbalance in supply and demand is an issue that will loom large in people's minds over the next few months'. Total eased further following Wednesday's capital increase announcement, the shares ending down FFr5.20 at FFr259.90, but off the day's low of FFr255.20. Accor, which has had to cut prices in some of its hotels in Europe for the first time, also added to its fall of the previous day, slipping FFr21 to FFr625. MILAN eased as it digested the composition of the new cabinet and awaited indications of the new legislative programme. The Comit index fell 4.80 to 539.13. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's broadly-based government and strong economics team have won the broad approval of analysts. However, Mr Michele Pacitti of NatWest Securities in London expected prices to mark time until there was tangible evidence that the new government was ready to tackle the country's economic ills. He thought it encouraging for the privatisation programme that Mr Piero Barucci was remaining as treasury minister. 'The economic reality is that there is no alternative to the privatisations,' he said. Benetton fell L599 or 3.3 per cent to L17,810 as it forecast growth this year in line with 1992 performance. FRANKFURT recouped some early losses on short covering with the DAX index slipping 4.93 to 1,623. Many investors remained on the sidelines after a fall in the domestic bond market and ahead of the strikes in east Germany which may begin next week. Some analysts commented that traders were active in chemical issues which have made dividend payments. Mr Glen Liddy at Kleinwort Benson said that trading in the sector had inflated volumes this week, and the market could slip in lower turnover in the near term. BASF, which announced first quarter earnings yesterday, closed up DM4.1 to DM235.3, but fell in post bourse trading as the stock went ex-dividend. AMSTERDAM featured DSM which closed off Fl 1.00 at Fl 84.30 after a sharp decline in first quarter profits over the same 1992 period. Akzo slipped Fl 1.70 to Fl 150.20. James Capel rates the latter a buy, noting efforts to control costs and improve efficiency, gearing to recovery in the US and its 'lower cyclicality compared to some if its European counterparts'. The CBS Tendency index lost 1.3 to 107.6. BRUSSELS extended its losses for the 10th consecutive session and the Bel-20 index lost 11.72, or 1 per cent, to 1,193.96. Some analysts suggested that institutional investors who had purchased Generale de Banque from a leading shareholder which released its stake earlier this week, had sold off other shares to maintain exposure to the Belgian market. Petrofina plunged BFr280 or 3.2 per cent to BFr 8,540. Speculation of a takeover bid subsided after denials from its leading shareholder that it would not sell its stake. ISTANBUL was again unstoppable, surging 4.3 per cent to this month's 10th all-time high close. The market index rose 325.95 to 7,896.92 on strong demand. Gains over the last four days total 14.2 per cent, in spite of continuing political uncertainty over forthcoming elections. Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders in London noted that many investors appeared to be targeting the 8,000 level. He added that local press reports of bullish comments by the stock exchange chairman and a continuing strong inflow of funds by new, equity based mutual funds continued to fuel the rally. HELSINKI firmed on lower money market rates. The HEX index advanced 21.5, or 1.9 per cent to 1,173.1. OSLO also gained ground as the central bank cut the overnight lending rate to 7.75 per cent. The All-share index rose 1.68 to 471.84.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- April 29                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1146.11    1146.37    1146.79    1145.26 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1201.33    1203.51    1203.60    1201.78  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1145.17    1145.39    1144.37    1143.23 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1202.49    1200.24    1200.84    1199.62  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Apr 28    Apr 27    Apr 26    Apr 23    Apr 22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1154.98   1149.08   1152.81   1156.50   1164.35 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1212.69   1213.85   1218.66   1223.66   1234.50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1147.60; 200 - 1205.14 Low/day: 100 - 1143.23 200 - 1199.01.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

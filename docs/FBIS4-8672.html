			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 17 Apr -- After the return of the  parliamentarian delegation from Japan on Sunday, Sejm Speaker  Jozef Oleksy told journalists that he saw no legal possibility  for the dissolution of parliament by the president.    Oleksy described the president's threat to dissolve  parliament as "harmful" and added that this might cause an  increase of tension in relations between the coalition and the  president. Oleksy described the deputies' initiative to  introduce amendments to the Small Constitution and to limit the  president's competences as a normal legislative initiative to  which you should not react by sulking but by having talks about  it.    "I invariably call on the president and the coalition to  have  talks," Oleksy said and stressed that as a result of  divergencies between the government and the president the image  of Poland on the international arena could be damaged.</p>

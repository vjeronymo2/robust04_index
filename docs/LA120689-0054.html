			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESEDA TO PROTEST PROPOSED SWITCH TO 4-A LEAGUE  </P> <P> Reseda High will protest a recommendation by the City Section's realignment  committee that would force the Regents to switch conferences with Canoga Park  for the two-year releaguing cycle beginning next fall.  </P> <P> The 12-member realignment committee recommended the change after dismissing an  appeal by Reseda on Monday night. The committee also recommended a switch  involving Westchester of the Coastal Conference and Narbonne of the Southern  Pacific Conference. The recommendations will be forwarded to the  Interscholastic Athletics Committee, which will meet Monday. Westchester also  plans to protest.  </P> <P> Reseda would be moved from the Valley Pac-8 Conference, a 3-A Division  conference in most sports, to the Northwest Valley Conference, primarily a 4-A  conference. Joel Schaeffer, the school's football coach, angrily objected to  the proposed move, vowing to take his fight as high as the school board.  </P> <P> "We're not going to sit by and let this happen," he said. "I don't know why we  have to be pinpointed to be the sacrificial lamb."  </P> <P> Schaeffer argued that either Grant or Birmingham of the Valley Pac-8 Conference  would be better suited for the move, citing enrollment and overall strength of  athletics programs. Reseda, with 2,202 students, has a smaller student  population than Grant (3,199) and Birmingham (3,169). All are four-year  schools.  </P> <P> But City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness said that strength of program is the  only criterion used for realignment. Enrollment differences are insignificant,  he said.  </P> <P> "The decision was based on an assessment of the overall programs," he said.  "Why does anyone move up? Because they are successful. It's just Reseda's time  to move up."  </P></p>

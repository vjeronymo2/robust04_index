			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: AGOURA HILLS;  </P> <P> CONSERVANCY FUNDS HELP RIDING CENTER  </P> <P> The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy gave the city of Agoura Hills $600,000  to help it acquire and build a $1.25-million park and equestrian center, a  conservancy spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Only a portion of the project will be funded with the grant, but city officials  said they are optimistic about future money coming from the general fund.  </P> <P> Besides funding, the project is dependent upon the city approving a trade of  the 2.72-acre Agoura Park for a nearby 10.1-acre undeveloped parcel of land  known as the Stroud property, where the Lower Cheeseboro Canyon Equestrian  Center will be built, said Rorie Skei, conservancy project manager.  </P> <P> The Cheeseboro Development Group, which plans to sell the Stroud property to  the city for a $125,000 price differential after it buys the property from  Chuck Stroud, wants to build 62 1,100- to 1,300-square-foot condominiums on the  Agoura Park property, said Dave Carmany, Agoura Hills City Manager.  </P> <P> The sale is in escrow now, but the deal will not go through unless the  Cheeseboro Development Group gets city approval to build on the property,  Carmany said.  </P> <P> If the Lower Cheeseboro Canyon Equestrian Center is built one block away from  the 35-year-old park, it will have baseball fields, playgrounds, basketball  courts, recreation and craft buildings and an equestrian center, said Joe  Donofrio, Agoura Hills director of parks and recreation.  </P> <P> The plan has been approved by the city planning department and the  architectural review board but still needs the approval of the city Planning  Commission and the City Council, Donofrio said.

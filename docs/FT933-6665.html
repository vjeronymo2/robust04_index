			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Perot book plays on job loss fears in anti-Nafta campaign MR ROSS PEROT, the populist US billionaire, is to step up his vigorous national campaign against the North American Free Trade Agreement, threatening its passage through a sceptical Congress. Mr Perot is launching a book - Save Your Job, Save Our Country: Why Nafta Must be Stopped - Now] - on September 6, Labour Day. He intends to promote the book and play on fears of unemployment flowing from Nafta with a series of speeches and television appearances during the next weeks. The political elite may scoff at Mr Perot, but the 150-page book, at an affordable Dollars 6.95, is a well-organised, easy-to-read polemic against the agreement, between the US, Canada and Mexico. The administration has given no sign that it can reply. Legislation to implement Nafta and its recently-completed side-agreements on labour and environment will be sent in September to Congress, where it is already in deep trouble. Both houses have 90 legislative days to hold a yes-or-no vote. Mr Perot, speaking in simple terms which elude trade negotiators, says that the US has been 'out-traded again'. By the deal, Mexico's rickety, unsafe trucks will be able to move into the US before American trucks can carry goods in Mexico, he says. Mexican investors will be able to own US farms, forests and real estate, while US investors will be restricted to owning only 49 per cent of any enterprise that owns agricultural or forest land in Mexico. The same applies to investment in construction. Mr Perot highlights the 'low wages and tame unions' which attract US executives to move production over the border. Mexico keeps wages low and health and safety enforcement lax, Mr Perot says. That produces 'a giant sucking sound', the sound of jobs going south of the border. US negotiators 'gave away' jobs by allowing Mexico to keep most of its motor industry investment and production restrictions for another 10 years. Mexico gets 'unrestricted access' to US and Canadian feed grains (which both countries are competing to sell) to develop massive beef operations which will undercut the US and Canadian industries, he claims. This and more was agreed by negotiators whose motives Mr Perot suspects. 'Mexico's chief legal adviser . . . was a former under-secretary of trade at the US Commerce Department,' he says. 'The US team on the other hand was composed of bureaucrats.'</p>

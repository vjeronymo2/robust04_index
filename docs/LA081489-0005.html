			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KISSINGER'S VIEW OF CHINA CRISIS  </P> <P> Kissinger's Opinion piece reveals once again Kissinger's consistent refusal to  support human rights or promote democracy beyond our own borders. Kissinger's  repeated failure to stand for these principles is only exceeded by his  dependable support for status quo governments, no matter how bloody and  repugnant.  </P> <P> Kissinger praises Deng while obscuring his own past on this issue. Remember, he  was the architect of doing business with Mao. Kissinger defends Deng's bloody  crackdown by claiming, "No Government in the world would have tolerated . . .  (the demonstration)." Perhaps Kissinger has been in the company of totalitarian  dictators so long that he has forgotten the basic principles of democratic  society. One only needs to look in front of the White House, where  demonstrators from various causes have held year-long vigils.  </P> <P> Lastly, Kissinger's support for the "important" relationship with repressive  totalitarian dictators conflicts with what democracy leaders from Beijing to  Moscow and all points around have been telling us: "Stop undermining our  efforts, stop trading and financing with our repressors.  </P> <P> MARTIN COLMAN  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P> <P>  Colman is East/West affairs specialist and coordinator of support programs for  the democracy movements in the Soviet Bloc at the American Foundation for  Resistance International.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev June 3 TASS -- Ukrainian acting prime minister,  parliament member Yukhym Zvyahilskyy today called on the Supreme  Soviet of Ukraine to take the most resolute measures to defend  the national interests of the state. He urged it to investigate  in detail the attempt on the life of parliament member Vladimir  Bortnik, to ensure law and order, and to set up an effective  legal mechanism for this purpose.    "An outrageous attempt on the life of Vladimir Bortnik,  Ukrainian parliament member and president of a state concern  providing material and technical supplies and services to the  country's agro-industrial complex, was committed on May 30,"  Zvyahilskyy said.    "The Ukrainian political and state leader was gravely  wounded  by five bullets fired pointblank by hired killers. His life is  in danger."    "The anti-state mafiosi structures," Zvyahilskyy stressed,  "which have lost the elections, are now unleashing a reign of  terror against the state and the people. It is not without  reason that the killers have chosen Vladimir Bortnik as their  victim. He had opposed attempts to rob Ukraine, refusing to buy  oil products and other materials for agriculture at prices,  dictated by the mafia.    "The brazen attempt on the life of Ukrainian parliament  member Vladimir Bortnik, committed in broad daylight in the very  centre of Kiev, shows that even the first frail sprouts of  economic and political stability in Ukraine and the  government-planned course of gradually raising the people's  living standards infuriate the anti-state groupings and mafiosi  structures, which are used to shamelessly robbing our country  and our people. They have repeatedly threatened to make short  work of members of the government and me personally, as acting  premier of Ukraine. Now they have gone over from threats to  outright terror."    "The impunity with which the anti-state mafiosi groupings  had  acted so far," Zvyahilskyy said, "cannot be tolerated any  longer, because this threatens the national security of Ukraine  and the vital interests of our citizens."</p>

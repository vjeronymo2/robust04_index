			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Offshoot's receivership threatens West - Svenska's action puts capital reorganisation in doubt THE APPOINTMENT of receivers at a subsidiary of West Industries, the heavily indebted engineering and construction group, not only threatens the group's attempt to return to financial health, it also jeopardises its ability to survive as an independent entity. Svenska Handelsbanken, the Swedish bank, appointed administrative receivers at Audit &amp; General, after it failed to clear a Pounds 5.8m overdraft. West acquired A&amp;G, an engineering, nursing homes and property group, and five subsidiary businesses in March. The move by Svenska was a blow to West, which was in the final stages of negotiations with its principal bankers, with a view to converting approximately Pounds 3m of debt into redeemable preference shares. This swap would have allowed a rights issue to raise about Pounds 3m to proceed. More seriously, several other of West's businesses were used as collateral against the Svenska debt. Unless West's banks agree to take on this debt, calling in the outstanding collateral could have a domino effect on the other businesses. The decision by Svenska, which had been privy to West's refinancing discussions, has prompted West to file a complaint with the Bank of England. Mr Chris Charlton, chairman of West, said: 'We are highly displeased with the actions of the bank, which were inappropriate and precipitous. It breaches the clearing rules recently laid down by the Bank of England recommending that banks give due time to any company with restructuring or refinancing plans to allow those plans to go ahead.' Had Svenska been willing to wait a week or even a day, the situation could have been cleared, he added. Instead Svenska, which is fully secured against its loans, chose to lay its claims on A&amp;G's assets. Svenska's relationship with A&amp;G had been rocky for some time. Part of the debt was to be repaid through the disposal of the nursing home businesses. The sale was, however, blocked by Svenska, presumably on the grounds that the net assets were worth more than the Pounds 3.9m being paid. For its part, A&amp;G had not always been helpful in providing the bank with financial information and interest payments had been late from time to time. The demise of its subsidiary is the latest in a series of upsets that has befallen West in recent years. Since it was bought in 1987 in a reverse takeover by Celtic Haven, an engineer and building contractor, its history has involved numerous twists and turns. It began as a pest control and machinery testing business but was transformed after major management changes in 1988, into an assortment of businesses with a growing leaning towards leisure. Throughout 1989-1990, the company embarked on a less-than-successful acquisition spree, buying into restaurants in London and the US in its attempt to build up its leisure side. However, by the time it acquired A&amp;G, the group was already reviewing its leisure operations. The purchase was part of a restructuring programme aimed at bringing the group's focus back to light engineering. During this time its share price plunged from a high of 79 1/2 p on March 27 1987, just after it was floated, to 2p at yesterday's close. In the year to June 30, the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.79m, against profits of Pounds 1.32m. Group borrowings of approximately Pounds 18.5m compare with net assets of about Pounds 9m. A&amp;G's history is no less colourful. It was bought by Humberside Electronic Controls in 1988 in a reverse takeover, and embarked on a buying binge throughout 1989 which left it with several engineering companies, nursing homes and properties. A&amp;G's last reported results showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 646,000 in the year to the end of June. Borrowings totalled Pounds 7.74m at the year-end, against net assets of Pounds 5.56m. Nevertheless, there are some grounds for hope at West. Mr Charlton emphasised that the group's other banks were fully supportive. The receivership relieved the company of considerable debt owed by A&amp;G, and 'there are precedents for rescue operations that actually achieved better results for a company in this kind of situation,' said Mr Piers Harford at Albert E Sharp, West's financial advisers. There was a possibility, for example, that West could re-acquire two of the businesses from the receivers, for no increase in its gearing, he said. Mr Piers admitted that there had not been many successful examples of such 'Texas cavalry rescues' and there was no knowing whether West and its financial advisers could achieve success in the present banking environment. 'Even in 1974 there was nothing like this mass walking away of banks,' he said.</p>

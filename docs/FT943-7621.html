			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Servisair plans October float Servisair, the former British &amp; Commonwealth subsidiary and Europe's largest aircraft and passenger handling company, is to come to the stock market in October valued at more than Pounds 50m. Servisair currently handles about 23.5m passengers a year or one aircraft every 90 seconds, and it operates out of all the UK's largest airports, with the exception of Heathrow. It should benefit from increasing air traffic and a trend for airlines to contract out their more labour-intensive non-core activities, such as ticketing and baggage handling. Servisair's profits are slanted towards the second half, and next weekend, the bank holiday, will be the busiest of the year, when it will process more than 650,000 passengers. The passenger trend has been upwards, and despite the impact of the recession and the Gulf war on the travel market during the 1990s, Servisair has recorded 10 years of uninterrupted profits growth. In 1993 its operating profits were up 35 per cent to Pounds 3.6m and earnings have increased tenfold in 10 years. The group derives about 70 per cent of its profits from passenger handling, with 25 per cent coming from cargo, and the remainder from operating lounges and other businesses. It handles all the passenger services for three of the UK's four largest charter airlines: Brittania, Air Tours and Air 2000, and charter flights accounted for 53 per cent of passenger revenue in 1993. It also represents international airlines from Air France (all its flights outside Heathrow) to Pakistan International. The company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Securum, the Swedish investment company formed after the 1992 collapse of Nordbanken. Servisair started as an offshoot of B&amp;C's shipping operations during the 1950s and 1960s and became part of Bricom, B&amp;C's industrial holding company. Bricom was privatised in 1988 by its management, but was bought out by Swedish investors in 1990, and ended up with Nordbanken as collateral for a bad loan. It will be the first Securum flotation outside Sweden but is to be followed by others, including its extensive UK property interests and another former B&amp;C industrial subsidiary, ANC, which operates a parcel delivery service. It is planned that Securum will retain a stake of about 40 per cent in Servisair, which will also raise some capital from the offer of new shares through a placement and intermediaries offer. In the short term Servisair should achieve profits growth from the impact of the recent purchase of Ogden Aviation Services, which gives the group an entry into Birmingham International Airport. Most analysts forecast passenger growth of between 5 and 7 per cent a year up to the year 2000. Mr Tony McCann, chairman, argued that airlines were going through a 'period of self-examination', which should see independent companies start to pick up more of the airlines' management intensive non-core activities. Given the breadth of its business, it can utilise its staff efficiently and employs up to 3,300 people during peak periods of the year. Mr McCann also expects some of the airport monopolies to be broken up. It recently won the baggage handling franchise for East Midlands Airport, and is optimistic that other opportunities will emerge. In the longer term, it plans a push into continental Europe, having already developed a presence in the Netherlands.

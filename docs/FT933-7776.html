			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Electrolux interim result better than expected ELECTROLUX, one of the world's leading white goods manufacturers, saw its shares rise by 4 per cent yesterday after it produced a better-than-expected first-half profit of SKr763m (Dollars 95m). The result was up fractionally on profits of SKr758m in the same 1992 period and followed an increase in second-quarter profits to SKr561m from SKr505m. Sales surged to SKr49.6bn from SKr40.8bn in the first half, almost entirely because of the impact of currency movements rather than increased volumes. The company noted that market conditions continued to be difficult, with demand generally weaker in Europe but better in North America. Operating income after depreciation rose by 6 per cent to SKr1.6bn as a result of a better performance in most countries. The two main exceptions were North America and Spain, where the company's total operating income from household appliances fell by SKr500m. Electrolux has been hit by heavy product launch costs in North America, while the company's Spanish activities have suffered from weak market conditions and from the impact of an 'inflexible labour market' on its restructuring efforts. Analysts said that they welcomed signs that the company's long-running problems in North America were being resolved and said that they were encouraged by the company's assessment that its income in the region should gradually improve in the second half. They also noted the performance of the group's outdoor products division, where sales rose 43 per cent to SKr8.25bn from SKr5.76bn. Sales in the group's main division, household appliances, rose a more modest 17.8 per cent to SKr27.0bn from SKr22.9bn. Industrial product sales were up 22.5 per cent to SKr8.93bn, while commercial appliance sales rose 13.4 per cent to SKr4.98bn. Outdoor products and industrial products improved their operating income during the period, while household and commercial appliances both registered a decline. The latest figures included a SKr200m gain from the sale of most of the company's stake in the Australian company Email, but this was entirely offset by a capital loss on the disposal of the company's direct sales operation in France. Mr Colin Gibson, analyst with Carnegie in London, said he now expected Electrolux's full year profits to exceed 1992's SKr1bn level. Electrolux B shares closed at SKr273, up SKr11 since Tuesday's close.</p>

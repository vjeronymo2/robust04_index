			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / People: Civil servants' stores Working for The John Lewis Partnership, the high street retailer owned by its staff, has sometimes been likened to a career in the civil service - it is not hard to see why. Stuart Hampson, 46, who took over as chairman yesterday, was a civil servant for 13 years and his new deputy chairman, David Young, 50 (right), has been almost twice as long a civil servant as he has been a John Lewis partner. Both men are Oxford graduates and joined John Lewis in 1982. David Young, who retains his job as finance director, spent most of his civil service career in the Ministry of Defence, before joining John Lewis. Before becoming finance director he ran a number of stores including Peter Jones in London's Sloane Square. The deputy chairman traditionally chairs the principle executive committee, a conference of directors which discusses policy. Meanwhile, the group has also promoted a third ex-civil servant to its board  -Luke Mayhew, the 39-year-old director of research and expansion. Born in New Zealand and educated at Oxford also, he worked in the Department of Industry between 1974 and 1978. From there he went to Thomas Cook Travel and then British Airways where he rose to be general manager human resources. In May 1991 he was appointed chief executive (Europe) of Shandwick, the troubled public relations group, and in June 1992 he joined the partnership.</p>

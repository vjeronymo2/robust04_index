			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / World Trade News: EC aims for Gatt deal by end of year JOLTED by a German appeal for a breakthrough on Gatt's Uruguay Round trade talks, EC foreign and trade ministers yesterday agreed to make a determined bid to reach a comprehensive deal by the end of the year. US and EC trade negotiators plan to hold detailed discussions later this week on the farm trade dispute that has for two years blocked progress on the Uruguay Round. This would prepare the ground for ministerial talks in Brussels on Sunday and Monday. EC ministers hope this will provide an outline deal that can be endorsed by EC heads of government at the Birmingham summit on October 16. Evidence that significant progress was being made towards a US-EC deal on reducing subsidised farm trade also came yesterday from Washington, where farm trade lobbyists were voicing alarm that the Bush administration was poised to make concessions aimed at finalising a Uruguay Round agreement. A US-EC stand-off on reform of the EC's farm subsidy regime has blocked progress on the Uruguay Round for two years. Other critical areas of dispute, including services trade and tariff reductions, can only be tackled when the farm issue is resolved. At yesterday's meeting of EC foreign and trade ministers in Luxembourg, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, Germany's economics minister, said a Gatt agreement was vital to avoid further chaos in the financial markets and political instability in Europe. Mr Mollemann criticised the EC for failing to overcome political divisions, especially now the Bush administration was interested in reaching a deal. 'We have arrived at the moment of truth. If there is no Gatt, we will be pushed further into crises.' Meanwhile in Brussels, EC officials emphasised that failure to settle the US-EC farm trade dispute would make it virtually impossible to contain a long-standing row over trade in oilseeds. This centres on US claims for compensation of an estimated Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) for producers affected by EC subsidies that have twice been condemned by Gatt dispute panels. The EC has offered compensation of no more than Dollars 400m. Settlement of the oilseed dispute will also be a high priority in Brussels this weekend. Just to illustrate that EC member states are anything but united in their attitudes to Sunday's meetings, Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, France's new farm minister, said in Paris that President Francois Mitterrand was urging Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to resist US pressure to speed the trade talks ahead of US elections. 'France is in a solitary position,' Mr Soisson said. 'That is why President Mitterrand is having contacts with Mr Kohl to loosen the stranglehold.' Next Sunday's talks involve Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary. The aim is to exploit what EC officials regard as a 'final window of opportunity' to settle the Uruguay Round - between the French referendum on Maastricht, and the US presidential election on November 3. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a British Foreign Office minister, said a 'narrow window' of opportunity for a Gatt deal existed ahead of the election. 'Let us not let it slip from our grasp,' he added, noting that President Bush had clearly signalled his interest in reaching an agreement. The ministers called a separate row over US action against EC steel producers 'wholly unjustified' and reserved the right to refer it to Gatt. An EC official said yesterday's meeting in Luxembourg was aimed at sending a 'political signal' it remained committed to a Gatt deal, within the existing mandate.</p>

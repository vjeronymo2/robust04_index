			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Caird Pounds 25m in the red after write-down CAIRD, the waste management company which has been crippled by a flurry of acquisitions in the late 1980s, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 25.1m for the first half of 1993, after exceptional debits of Pounds 22.9m including a Pounds 17.6m write-down of assets. The write-down followed a review by Mr David Weir, who replaced Mr Peter Linacre as chief executive earlier this year. Caird said a number of the landfill sites bought between 1988 and 1990 were no longer considered 'commercially viable or capable of development'. Slower than anticipated disposal of aggregate stocks and non-core assets had also led to a re-appraisal of market values. In June Caird said it would not make a payment that month of the dividend on its convertible preference shares. The group said yesterday it did not expect to pay a preference dividend on December 31 either. Caird's ordinary shares fell 4 1/2 p to 7 1/2 p and its preference shares from 37p to 28p. Mr Christopher Parker, finance director, said the group would be concentrating further on its core businesses. Caird now defines this as the management of landfill sites capable of taking a wide range of domestic and industrial waste rather than its current portfolio which includes some sites only licensed to take dry waste. 'The fact is we have spent too much on development of landfill sites in the last few years some of which we are now going to sell,' said Mr Parker. The group will also be reviewing plans to develop its incineration projects, including Renfrew in Scotland where the company is in dispute with the local authority. Sales on continuing business fell by 13 per cent to Pounds 8.8m and the group reported an operating loss of Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 3.83m profits). Losses per share worked through at 45.55p (1.81p earnings). As a result of the write-off, shareholders' funds have fallen to about Pounds 21m, leaving the company close to 100 per cent geared. Caird said its strategy had the support of its bankers but that with its advisers it was seeking ways of strengthing its balance sheet.</p>

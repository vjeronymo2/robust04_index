			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: First-quarter optimism boosts Cummins shares Cummins, the world's leading manufacturer of diesel engines, yesterday issued an optimistic assessment of its first-quarter performance. The announcement helped send its share price sharply higher on Wall Street. The Indiana-based company said earnings in the three months to the end of March would 'meet or perhaps exceed' its results in the fourth quarter. On an operating basis, Cummins generated a profit of Dollars 52.6m, or Dollars 1.42 a share, in the final reporting period of 1993. The estimate conformed with the forecasts of most analysts. Mr Gary McManus, who follows the company for Kemper Securities in Chicago, projected operating earnings of Dollars 1.60 a share, based on sustained demand for heavy-truck engines and accelerating growth in the mid-range market. The stock jumped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 51 3/4 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The gain came amid a broad advance by capital-goods stocks, including Caterpillar, one of Cummins' main rivals.</p>

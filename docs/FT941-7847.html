			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Army to cut 7,000 further posts The government will today announce up to 7,000 army redundancies in the latest phase of cuts under the 1990 Options for Change cost-cutting programme. Most of the job losses will be voluntary but it is expected that some officers will be made compulsorily redundant. The announcement is likely to upset rightwing Conservative MPs, who have argued that military capabilities have already been cut to the bone by previous rounds of redundancies. Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, described the move as 'absolutely outrageous'. He said: 'Our armed services are so over-stretched that we need a full defence review at once.' About 10,000 personnel have already lost their jobs in two previous rounds of cuts. However the Ministry of Defence is under pressure to meet revised spending targets agreed in the Budget. The defence budget of Pounds 23.5bn is about 16 per cent lower in real terms than in the mid-1980s and a further 12 per cent reduction is planned by 1996/97. The cuts have prompted rising bitterness in the forces, which have been reduced from 320,000 a decade ago to 270,000. Last month Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, chief of the air staff, complained that a 'disreputable campaign' was being waged against the services.</p>

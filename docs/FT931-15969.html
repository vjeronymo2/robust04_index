			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt affected by 2 per cent decline in Siemens THE Bundesbank distanced itself yesterday from assertions by a Paris representative that German interest rates would fall in the current quarter, and German equities continued Thursday's decline, writes Our Markets Staff. Nothing loth, global strategists from the Nomura Research Institute advised investors to buy in Germany, and sell in the US. The team said that Germany is already in recession, that its equity market has bottomed, and that it will now go up as share price multiples expand, in anticipation of recovery driven by declining interest rates. FRANKFURT, meanwhile, saw an accelerated downturn in the shares of the electronics group, Siemens, as the DAX index closed another 10.98 lower at 1,531.52, 0.9 per cent lower on the week. Turnover fell from DM3.9bn to DM3.7bn. Siemens fell DM12.90, or more than 2 per cent to DM572.30 as negative speculation continued ahead of next week's annual press conference. Daimler, which stirred up the speculation after a stiff earnings downgrade by James Capel, dropped another DM4.20 to DM532.30. Kaufhof led retailers down with a fall of DM16.50 to DM398. Mr Roland Wren of James Capel in Frankfurt said that the brokers have marked a very significant correlation between the consumer confidence index and, with a lag of about six months, retail sales; he expects that consumer confidence in December will have recorded an all time low. PARIS consolidated, the CAC-40 index rising 8.16 to 1,852.63, barely changed on the week, with turnover steady at FFr2.8bn. Strong activity was noted in Michelin, Eurotunnel and Hachette with respective gains of FFr5.50, 55 centimes and FFr5.80 to FFr195.30, FFr31.10 and FFr83.30. Matra, which is to be merged with Hachette later this month, also figured with a rise of FFr13.10, or 6.6 per cent to FFr210.00. Among second liners, Spie Batignolles was suspended briefly, limit up at FFr315.50. There were reports, later denied, that its parent company, Schneider, was to buy out the minority shareholders. Spie closed FFr24.60 higher at FFr310.00 while Schneider lost FFr1 to FFr627. AMSTERDAM sold Akzo, Nedlloyd, and Philips: Akzo, down Fl 3.30 to Fl 135.40, on disappointing 1993 prospects; Nedlloyd, Fl 3.00 lower at Fl 30.40, on news after Thursday's close that Mr Torstein Hagen was quitting the supervisory board and had reduced his stake to under 10 per cent; and Philips, down 50 cents at Fl 20.80, as it reported that its joint venture with Siemens in telecommunications cables and optical fibres had been called off. The CBS Tendency index was 1.0 weaker at 96.6. ZURICH majored on CS Holding and Roche as the SMI index lost 7.3 to 2,074.9, 0.7 per cent higher on the week. CS Holding, SFr55 better at SFr1,990, recovered some of its losses on the proposed takeover of Swiss Volksbank. Roche certificates rose SFr60 to SFr4,160 as it said that 1992 group profits should rise considerably. MILAN closed mixed after strong early buying interest in the insurer, Generali, and other blue chips failed to ignite the market. The Comit index closed 1.24 higher at 456.69, 2.3 per cent higher on the week. BRUSSELS strengthened with large volume in Delhaize, up BFr6 at BFr1,220, ahead of 1992 results. The Bel-20 index rose 10.04 to 1,143.97, up 1.5 per cent on the week. STOCKHOLM was firmer in spite of profit-taking in Astra, whose free shares lost SKr19, or 2.6 per cent to SKr736. The Affarsvarlden index closed 4.3 higher at 948.3, up 4 per cent on the week. Lifted by the stronger dollar, the market was also hoping that interest rates may be eased after the budget statement which is due on Monday. COPENHAGEN saw activity in Danisco, up DKr25 to DKr670 following Thursday's sale on its engineering division to GEA of Germany for DKr950m. The KFX index shed just 0.03 to 77.47.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 8                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1080.98    1079.71    1082.18    1082.14 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1166.83    1166.45    1168.89    1168.45  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1081.84    1081.53    1081.94    1080.25 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1169.78    1170.66    1169.23    1167.34  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Jan 7     Jan 6     Jan 5     Jan 4    Dec 31  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1081.92   1091.68   1090.07   1083.42   1083.35 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1171.90   1179.18   1180.16   1174.71   1169.11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1083.19 ; 200 - 1172.22 Low/day: 100 - 1079.43  200 - 1166.08.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

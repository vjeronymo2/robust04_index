			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley to press ahead with sell-off of ECGD division - Trade and Industry MR PETER LILLEY, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday ignored Labour demands for the abandonment of the sale of the Insurance Services Group of the Export Credit Guarantee Department. He insisted that privatisation of the concern would ensure that it was 'better in tune' with the European Community single market. Leading the demands for the abandonment of the sale in the Commons Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, quoted the view of the British Exporters Association that it was turning into 'a shambles'. He argued since there was no serious British bidder the organisation could be controlled from Rome or Amsterdam. Mr Brown maintained that the government's decision to pursue the sale was privatisation 'for privatisation's sake'. Mr Lilley emphasised that other EC countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal and Spain relied on the private sector to provide export credit facilities. He said Denmark and Ireland were also considering privatising their export agencies. Mr Lilley told Mr Brown: 'For the same reasons we believe that export credit for short term business should be in the private sector'. Mr Tim Sainsbury, the trade minister, confirmed that the invitation to tender had brought 'responses' from three companies  - Assicurazioni Generali, NCM and Trade Indemnity. He said: 'There will now be a period of evaluation by Government and its advisers, with a view to proceeding as quickly as practicable with the sale of the short term business, subject to the successful passage of the Export and Investment Guarantee Bill.' The financial robustness of the proposed purchaser, the price offered, and commitment to and understanding of the business would be among the factors taken into account. Ms Joyce Quin, from the Labour front bench, described the proposed sale as a 'fiasco'. She claimed that exporters were alarmed and dismayed at the prospect of the organisation being privatised. Mr Sainsbury replied that the CBI, amongst others, had welcomed the proposed privatisation which would enable the the Insurance Services Group to provide better and more flexible services to British industry. Mr Edward Leigh, junior trade and industry minister, yesterday encouraged the Post Office to seek ways of offering greater choice to its customers. He said 'We are prepared to look at any proposal put forward by the Post Office to improve the quality of services to the customer'. Mr Leigh, an enthusiastic advocate of privatisation, denied that the steps already taken by the Post Office to establish separate divisions for its counter, mails and parcels services were intended as a prelude to privatisation.</p>

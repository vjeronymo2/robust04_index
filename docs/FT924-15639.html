			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (28): Computing with a conscience - Claire Gooding finds out how a marketing database system makes fund-raising more cost-effective Case Study; The Children's Society THE SUFFERING of children has always wrung tender hearts, and won pennies from pockets. But in a recession, the Children's Society has to work harder than usual to fund its work among children of all races and religions, and to keep down its administrative costs. The marketing database system recently put in place by the information technology (IT) staff at the Society's Marjory Street headquarters in central London is designed to make fund-raising cost-effective. 'We had three problems to solve,' explains direct mail manager Roger Beschizza. 'First, we needed to make our IT cost-effective. 'Secondly, we wanted to maintain and improve our marketing ability. 'Thirdly, we wanted to integrate the various incompatible systems into one.' Like most charities, the Children's Society relies heavily on donations, (see the society snapshot, facing page). Its administration and fund-raising, however, is sharply divided from its 'core business' of helping disadvantaged children - runaways, refugees, and other troubled or abandoned children. Even the whereabouts of its two London 'safe homes' for runaways, (to which the police turn a benevolent blind eye), are unknown to the staff at its central London headquarters. Although changing social structures have made many orphanages redundant, there are currently 146 projects, including residential centres for those with disabilities, centres for children coming out of care, family centres, and refuges for drug abusers. The prefix, 'Church of England' has been downgraded in the charity's title, because, as press officer Liz Spenser explains: 'We're for everybody. We deal with Muslim and Somali refugees - any families or children who come to our door.' However, members of the Anglican Church still provide the greater part of funds and supporters. Donations derive from cash collection boxes, and carefully targeted fundraising campaigns, such as the Jester fun events in April, and the recent Great Cake Bake. At headquarters, the emphasis is on fund-raising and channelling funds. Last February, the search started for a system that would bring all operations in-house, converting from the service then based at the Axciom bureau. 'It was a typical bureau situation,' explains Mr Beschizza. 'There was a geographical distance and a technical distance between what we needed and what the bureau was able to provide.' THE Society was looking for a much faster response time, versatility, and better quality of data. After looking at 20 possible solutions, three were left on the shortlist. The decisions on the new technology were made by an IT steering group which drew staff from different divisions, with the help of an independent consultant, Iain Pritchard, who was absorbed into the Children's Society full-time for a year. The process translated Roger Beschizza's 'wish list' into technical requirements, including such elements as the computer's response time. Mr Pritchard's final recommendation was to run two packaged software products from CMG Business Systems on an IBM RS/ 6000 minicomputer under the Unix operating system. The marketing database product, Infobase, links to Fact2000 integrated accounts, and CMG's tailoring included a bridge to the existing PC-based local area networks, running standard PC tool for wordprocessing, spreadsheets, electronic mail and desktop publishing. There was a massive conversion effort to sort out the existing data. The original bureau lists contained 500,000 names and addresses, comprising supporter and contact database, spontaneous donors, regular commitments, appeals committees, projects and companies. Although the job of preserving data integrity never ends, the system has taken around a year to settle down. It took twice as long to implement as the six months Mr Beschizza expected. Now, according to David McKee, the operations manager, they ready to start the next phase of making the data more useful corporately. The conversion of the IBM mainframe formatted information from Axciom's bureau (which the Society still uses for some purposes) was surprisingly smooth, although the results still had to be combed, qualified and tested - 'it doesn't matter how perfect the conversion technique, there will always be glitches in the data,' comments Mr McKee. 'The conversion program itself was 7,000 lines of code, so some imperfections were inevitable. It wasn't until we had all the data in-house and started working on it that we could see for ourselves exactly what was there. Before, we were working in the dark.' The Infobase database and the Facts 2000 accounting system are linked to other administrative functions, such as word processing, so that donations can be posted through accounts, with a note made on the contacts database, and the name and address transferred automatically to Wordperfect for the creation of 'thank you' letters and acknowlegements. There are several different lists, such as the 'box lists' for the holders of collection boxes, and others for area organisers, or active fund-raisers. It is by painstaking attention to detail that the Children's Society has built up its lists. There are of course some problems computers simply cannot solve; poring over indecipherable signatures takes time. A reference book of 'recognised' scrawls helps with the mystery giro slips which come in on a regular basis from area organisers. Often the only source of information accompanying a donation is a barely legible handwritten address or signature, from the hand of an elderly, perhaps visually-impaired donor. These letters are more difficult, as the supervisor of central processing, Sheila Gay, explains: 'A Pounds 10 donation in someone's memory has to be acknowledged, just as much as the larger amounts from fund-raising events. That person might be a regular donor, or become one - or even consider putting a bequest in his or her will.' Ms Gray and her colleagues go to considerable lengths to establish correct name and address information, particularly for donations over Pounds 100. They also search indefatigably for postcodes, in a quest that will qualify the direct mailshots for a Mailsort discount. All such information now goes onto the database, which records the activities, donations and original point of contact for each person on it. Six months down the line, the data problems are less fundamental, more cosmetic, and Mr McKee is more concerned with de-duplication, more with the ability to do 'soundex' of fuzzy-match searches. It is not possible to discover and keep details, such as age, which might allow accurate profiling of the database, but even so, initial efforts to analyse the data have yielded valuable information. For instance, in a recent analysis, Roger Beschizza was surprised to find how many of the collection boxholders were also economically active credit-card holders. A profile of 'the typical donor' will be easier to establish now the data is reliable - 'we came out of darkness, and into the light - to use a Biblical phrase . . . we're now in a much better position to use data in a way that's useful to us, rather than the way the bureau could have provided it.' The big benefit for the Children's Society is that it now has one database, accessible by everybody and working more or less in real time, instead of the out-of-date microfiches that were once their mainstay. 'That's a big plus. The spin-offs are that people support one another because they are all working on the same system, with the same data,' he says. Mr Beschizza is now preparing to increase the level of science he uses in targeting his various support groups, using his new database in management decision-making - 'if I have a word of advice, it is: 'Get the people at the top to own the system, make sure that everyone uses and owns it; get people involved early in the consultation process.' ' This process, he suggests, makes staff feel more valued and reassured, especially if they are facing technology for the first time. Going live was traumatic for those unused to interactive computing, although, in the event, disaster-free. He describes it as an 'arm round the shoulder operation, requiring lots of comfort and reassurance.' 'It takes careful management of people's expectations. And it's very easy to forget where you came from, and all the hurdles you've already conquered. Now, we are all talking the same language, and we all understand one anothers' systems.' The Children's Society's contemporary attitude to raising funds is evident in its use of IT for cost-effective operations. Nor does it miss a chance to add to its 'soft' asset, the database. By the end of the visit, there were two more economically-active adults on the list as collection-box holders. For an organisation which admits it still has some way to go in sophisticated marketing, supplying 'freebies' that actually woo money from the recipients' pockets is no mean feat.</p>

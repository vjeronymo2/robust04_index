To fulfill these tasks, it is  necessary to take four measures as follows.    1. Increase inputs into agriculture and the rural economy by  a fairly large margin. The budgeted investment in capital  construction as well as the funds and bank loans set aside to  aid agriculture should also be increased. Specific arrangements  must be made with respect to planning and monetary and financial  matters.    2. Increase grain and cotton purchase prices. When new  grain goes on the market in 1994, the guaranteed price for grain  will begin to go up by a fairly large margin. The measures for  increasing the price of cotton ordered by the state will also be  published in time.    3. Improving the special grain reserve system. It is  necessary to lower domestic market prices of grain and promote  steady growth in grain production through adjusting the amount  of grain purchased and sold and utilizing the swap market  mechanism for grain at home and abroad. Efforts should also be  made to establish market risk funds for grain, to protect the  peasants' interests to arouse their enthusiasm for production,  and to guarantee the normal operation of the special grain  reserve system. And,    4. Establish banks whose sole function is to make  low-interest loans for agricultural development. This is an  essential measure to ensure that we have sufficient funds for  purchasing agricultural and sideline products. We should step  up specific preparations for the establishment of such banks.    Plans for rural reforms -- such as developing diverse forms  of collectivized agricultural services, setting up cooperative  and joint stock economic entities, reforming the system of  supply and marketing cooperatives, and reforming certain  management systems to promote developments of small towns --  should be formulated and implemented step by step.    The central leader pointed out: As peasants constitute the  main segment of China's population, the problem concerning  agricultural development is of vital importance to the overall  situation. Whether there is comprehensive development of  agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations,  and fishery and whether there are good harvests in agriculture  all have a direct bearing on prices and the people's daily life.  Rapid economic growth depends on opening up rural markets, but  the latter depends on developing the rural economy and  increasing the peasants' income. Over the past few years we  have enjoyed successive bumper harvests and a sustained  development of the rural economy, but the comparative efficiency  of grain production has declined; the gap between the prices of  agricultural and industrial products has widened; and the  peasants' income has grown rather slowly. We must take  effective measures to solve all these problems.</p>

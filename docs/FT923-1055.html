			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Marzotto reports first-half tumble MARZOTTO, Italy's biggest clothing group which last year bought control of Germany's Hugo Boss, reported a steep decline in consolidated net profits after minority interests to L9.3bn (Dollars 7.3m) in the first half of this year from L20.3bn last year. The decline was most marked at parent company level, where operating earnings fell by 25 per cent to L28.7bn. After a L52.9bn write down on its Hugo Boss stake, the parent company reported a L31.2bn six-month loss. However, the group forecast full-year earnings should be in line with the net L39.8bn made in 1991, in spite of the growing recession in Italy and the slowdown in many foreign markets. The group expected sales to reach around L2,000bn this year, confirming its position as one of Europe's leading textile and clothing manufacturers. Meanwhile, net group debt should fall, on an adjusted basis, through the continuing policy of using cash flow to reduce borrowings. The drop in earnings comes in spite of the first-time contribution from Hugo Boss, which pushed Marzotto's group sales up by 42 per cent to L951.8bn in the six months. The bulk of the surge in turnover came on the clothing side, where the inclusion of Boss spurred a 118.2 per cent rise to L584.8bn. Buying Boss also sharply reduced the group's dependence on the Italian market, with the majority of sales coming from outside Italy. While domestic turnover fell by 6.4 per cent to L437.1bn, foreign sales jumped by 153.2 per cent to L514.7bn. Marzotto minimised the impact of profits fall by noting that earnings in the first half of 1991 had been boosted by L9.6bn in extraordinary items. By contrast, non-recurring items had caused a L800,000m loss in the first half of this year.</p>

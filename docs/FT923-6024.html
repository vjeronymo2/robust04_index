			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Ford set to cut prices on old stock FORD, leader in the UK market for new cars, is expected shortly to announce price cuts of between Pounds 200 and Pounds 1,000 for selected cars across its range to dispose of outstanding stocks of 1992 models. The package of price cuts and other financial incentives is the latest sign of distress marketing by carmakers in the UK. The industry has been hit by disappointing sales during the crucial month of August. Figures released earlier this week showed that registrations in the first 20 days of the month at 290,550 were only 0.9 per cent higher than the same period a year ago. Sales of new cars have not rallied in spite of measures by carmakers including widespread dealer discounting and offers of free insurance, free road-fund licences and low-cost finance for buyers. Ford's last price-cutting initiative came in the wake of the March Budget, which halved the rate of special car tax from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. In addition, Ford made further price cuts averaging 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent on models representing around 30 per cent of its sales volume. A tentative improvement in overall sales of new cars was achieved in the three months from April to June, but sales fell year-on-year in July and after the first seven months of the year registrations were still 4.3 per cent lower than last year's very depressed level. Ford and Rover have already imposed short-time working on several of their UK vehicle assembly lines to cut production and reduce excessive stock levels. The indication that Ford is planning another round of price cuts on old stock follows the warning earlier this week from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders that rapidly rising imports coupled with the poor state of domestic demand 'must increase the risk of stock problems in the months to come'.</p>

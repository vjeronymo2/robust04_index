			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Eastern first to buy back shares Eastern Electricity yesterday became the first regional electricity company to buy back some of its shares since the industry's privatisation three years ago. It spent about Pounds 7.7m buying 1.2m shares - 0.4 per cent of the equity. It said it intended to buy back up to 5 per cent. The move, announced after the close of trading yesterday, is expected to set a trend in the sector, although some companies will await the outcome of a regulatory review of power distribution before following Eastern's lead. Analysts said the move was likely to have a positive effect on shares in the 12 regional power distributors. An increasing number of companies are seeking shareholders' permission to buy back shares, although few have carried it out. Those with strong cash inflows and net cash, but limited growth opportunities, are among those most likely to do so. Eastern won approval to buy back up to 13.5m shares at its annual meeting last August. It has about Pounds 90m cash, which at the current price of 644p is slightly more than what would be needed to buy back all 13.5m. Mr Eric Anstee, finance director, said the buy-back would have a 'mildly positive' effect on earnings per share. Putting the cash on deposit attracted a rate of 5 per cent, although tax reduced this to 3 per cent. The yield on the shares was close to 4 per cent. The company also wanted to give a signal to its 400,000 shareholders that the shares represented good value, he said. Many shareholders in the regional companies are thought to be considering sales after receiving one bonus share for every 10 they hold to reward them for loyalty since flotation. Bonus certificates are being sent out this week. Mr Nick Pink, analyst at SG Warburg Securities, said he expected other regional companies to follow Eastern's lead. 'The stock market is very wary of them using surplus cash to diversify. It makes more sense for them to buy back shares.' Eastern is one of only two of the regional electricity companies which have shareholder authority to buy back shares, the other being Swalec, serving south Wales. Others are expected to seek approval shortly. Lex, Page 18</p>

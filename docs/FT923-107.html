			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Jefferson Smurfit down by 20% as low prices take toll JEFFERSON Smurfit, Ireland's largest industrial group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits for the first six months to July 31 down 20 per cent from IPounds 75.1m (Pounds 78.33m) to IPounds 60m. Results were below expectations and the company's shares fell 11 per cent from 257p to 228p. Mr Dermot Smurfit, chairman and chief executive of Smurfit Continental Europe, said the results were disappointing. The group was continuing to struggle with low prices while the industry suffered a period of deflation, he explained. He stressed, however, that the company was a strong ship in turbulent waters. In particular, the balance sheet was in good shape with net cash of about IPounds 200m. Operating cash flow was positive at IPounds 26m. The group remains on the lookout for acquisitions, he said. But although the industry's earnings were falling, transaction prices had not dropped to a level at which the company was interested. Any acquisitions would be funded in cash or through bank borrowings, rather than a rights issue, he added. The results were achieved on turnover up 7 per cent, from IPounds 611m to IPounds 654m. Earnings per share fell 22 per cent from 11.7p to 9.1p on a part capitalisation basis. The company recently had a one-for-one share issue. Margins had been suffering in the US and Europe, said Mr Smurfit. Poor demand and prices had meant the US and Canadian businesses' profits before tax fell from a profit of IPounds 728,000 to a loss of IPounds 4m for the six months. The group has restructured the borrowings of its JFC/CCA American subsidiary, which should increase its profits by Dollars 23m (Pounds 13.4m) for the full year. In continental Europe profits fell from IPounds 22m to IPounds 16m. A number of plants in Germany and Spain were operating short time. However the Venezuelan business was a star performer, with profits up 16 per cent from IPounds 10m to IPounds 11.6m. The group plans to expand and modernise the San Felipe paper mill in Venezuela at a cost of Dollars 77m. The directors declared a second interim dividend of 1.2306p per share for the year ending January 31 1993. The board's intention is to recommend a full-year dividend of 3.74p, an increase of 5.7 per cent over the previous year. Lex, Page 22; People, Page 11</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Canadian health care faces financial realities: The provinces are considering reforms including user fees CANADIANS enjoy one of the world's most widely admired health care systems. Anchored by the principles of universality and accessibility, the publicly funded system has ensured that rich and poor alike are able to visit a first-class doctor, call an ambulance or get a bed in a prestigious hospital. But keeping these principles intact is becoming difficult. A vigorous debate is under way on how a system that so many other countries have been tempted to follow should itself be reformed. The nub of the problem is money, as underlined last month when, for the first time, the health ministers of all 10 provinces (health care is a provincial responsibility) met jointly with provincial finance ministers. Canadians can visit a doctor as often as they like at no charge. Doctors charge provincial health plans according to a schedule of fees for various services, but with few aggregate limits. The system is funded by a variety of taxes, ranging from a portion of general government revenue to a special payroll tax in some provinces. For years, financial considerations were secondary. But public spending on health ballooned by an average of 12 per cent a year during the 1980s to the point where Canada's spending on health care relative to its gross domestic product is now 9.2 per cent, higher than any other country with a national health system. The budget of Ontario's health ministry, by far the biggest in the country, has almost quadrupled since 1980. Some of the spiralling costs are attributed to the bureaucratic inefficiency of a government-run system split between 10 provinces. Canadian hospitals, for instance, have traditionally been run as separate entities, each with its own board of directors trying to carve out a high profile in the community. The recession and growing grassroots resistance to tax increases have forced governments to tighten their belts. Ontario has budgeted for a mere 1 per cent rise in funding for hospitals this year. It has warned pharmaceutical companies not to increase their prices by more than 2 per cent. Mr Earl Berger, managing director of Canadian Health Monitor, a national health care survey, says the cuts are 'forcing hospitals to do things which many of them have never done before'. These include drawing up business plans and encouraging doctors to remove their patients from hospital more quickly. At the same time, the fundamental principle of universal health care is being questioned. Critics are asking whether unlimited 'free' access to services encourages demands on doctors and hospitals. Similarly, could doctors, whose income is partly determined by how often they see their patients, be more sparing in their choice of tests and treatments? Does every hospital in every city need the most modern equipment to treat a wide variety of ailments? Changes are already under way. New Brunswick, for example, hopes to improve efficiency and bring down administrative costs by replacing 53 hospital boards in the province with eight regional boards. Ontario has warned commercial laboratories that from next April payments will be cut by half when the number of tests grows by more than 2 per cent a year. Health care administrators are trying over the longer term to ease the pressure on hospitals by putting more emphasis on walk-in clinics, day surgery and homecare. Doctors are playing a bigger role in hospital administration. But they are also being encouraged to move towards what some derisively call 'cookbook medicine'. Instead of carrying out simultaneous tests and treatments, they are being encouraged to move stage-by-stage from one procedure to the next. Some politicians have promised that such reforms to improve the efficiency of health care delivery will be sufficient to ease the financial crunch. The Ontario government said in a recent paper that its reforms would ensure 'our current system is maintained and actually enhanced'. Others, however, predict more fundamental changes. Quebec set warning lights flashing last year when it proposed a CDollars 5 (Pounds 2.20) 'orientation fee' to be levied when a patient insisted on visiting a hospital casualty ward without first going to a family clinic, or made an appointment with a specialist without referral by a general practitioner. A political outcry forced Quebec to drop the idea, but it is toying with others that would have much the same effect. One is a surcharge on personal income tax, based on the volume of medical services used during the year. The surcharge would have an upper limit of CDollars 300-400 a year for the average family. Several provinces are gradually narrowing the definition of universal and accessible care. Ontario sets strict limits on payments for medical care outside Canada - a substantial burden, for instance, on the people who have retired to Florida. Quebec is considering removing some services, such as eyesight examinations and prescriptions for the elderly, from its health plan coverage. Mr David Levine, director-general of the Notre Dame hospital in Montreal, says that 'piece-by-piece, there's going to be a way in which this is going to be introduced'. Mr Berger predicts that at least one of the provinces will introduce some form of user fee within five years. The challenge for politicians is to put the changes in place without unleasing a public furore. Though the long-term result may be a significantly different system, Mr Levine predicts it will be achieved only through small, incremental steps.</p>

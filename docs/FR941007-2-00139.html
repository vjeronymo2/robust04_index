			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are many allegations that the traditional social  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service systems, including vocational rehabilitation, are ill- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipped to respond to the need for services. For example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991 National Survey of Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) and AIDS,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributed to State VR agencies by the American Rehabilitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association (ARA), concludes that there are numerous barriers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the delivery of rehabilitative services to persons living with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HIV/AIDS. These barriers include the fears and anxieties of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vocational rehabilitation staff, public stigma associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HIV/AIDS, confidentiality issues, lack of knowledge about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation needs of persons with HIV/AIDS, and the need for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more extensive services than those currently available through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the vocational rehabilitation system. Factors in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural course of the disease, including remissions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exacerbations, compounding, rates of decline, and many other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics that are not well understood in terms of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relation to disability and to support services may affect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitability of existing service models to meet the needs of PLWA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, there is some indication that the patterns of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disease, and the associated service needs, are different for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minority individuals, who are likely to enter the health care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service system later in the illness, and for women, for whom not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only the support needs but also the natural course of the disease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appear to differ (Campbell, et al., 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many rehabilitation experts hypothesize that the approaches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and techniques that have been developed to address issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding other types of disability are relevant to, and will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective in, addressing issues regarding HIV/AIDS. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaches include secondary prevention, vocational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation, job accommodations, barrier removal, peer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support, independent living, personal assistance services, public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education, integrated model service systems, job sharing, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advocacy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the most effective application of disability and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitative approaches to HIV/AIDS is dependent upon first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing knowledge about the pattern(s) of disabling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences typically associated with the disease process; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functional capacities associated with various stages of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disease process; and the duration and intensity of various types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of supports needed for this population at different stages of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disease process. Any research designed to address these issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must ensure that findings can be applied cross-gender and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> culturally diverse populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any project to be funded under this priority is expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be familiar with, and to coordinate and cooperate with, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant AIDS research activities of the Centers for Disease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Control and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Diseases, and with other major current or planned research  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An R&amp;D project on HIV/AIDS and disability shall_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Analyze existing data on HIV/AIDS, prepare population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates and statistical profiles of adults with HIV/AIDS,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including such factors as: age; age at onset or diagnosis of HIV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infection and AIDS diagnosis or length of time with the disease;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ethnic background; gender; educational level; employment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience and current employment status; marital and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> socioeconomic status; patterns of SSI, SSDI, Medicaid, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare enrollment; and standard demographic factors;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Document the natural course of the disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of the disease process, including iatrogenic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabilities, and document the functional losses associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various stages of the disease process, taking into consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such factors as age, gender, ethnic background, and concomitant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabilities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify and assess the major disability-related societal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> barriers confronted by adults with HIV/AIDS, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unemployment, discrimination, lack of accommodations, and lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities to maintain independent living, distinguishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patterns by age, gender, ethnic background, and urban or rural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

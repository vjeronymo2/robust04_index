			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (6): King's conciliation efforts pay off - David White assesses foreign policy ahead of next week's important conference in Casablanca The choice of Casablanca for next week's conference of political and business leaders to discuss economic development following the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement is an acknowledgement of Morocco's role in trying to promote reconciliation between Jew and Arab. It has played this role, mostly discreetly, over 20 years or more. Its efforts stem from the strong personal convictions of King Hassan II, whose conciliatory gestures in the past have provoked indignation among more hardline Arab nations, and are rooted in the country's own history of tolerance. Not only has Morocco always had a Jewish community, with Jews now in some influential positions: almost a tenth of Israel's population, some 600,000 people, are of Moroccan Jewish descent. Initially, the scope of the conference was to have been limited to the Middle East, but Morocco insisted it should be extended to cover North Africa as well. Morocco has taken a forward position in its relations with Israel. Its agreement to exchange liaison officers in Rabat and Tel Aviv, a first step towards full relations, made it only the second country after Egypt to establish formal ties with Israel. Senior Moroccan advisers warn against the risk of excessive expectations from the conference, whose participants will include heads of multinational corporations. 'But it is essential to send an electric jolt to political and private sector decision-makers,' they say. 'Across the whole region, from Morocco to the Gulf, it will not be the same as it was before.' The host nation is willing to support in principle the idea of a new development institution on the lines of the European Bank for Recons- truction and Development, as proposed by Israel, but only if it is demonstrated that if can play an effective and more than symbolic role, say Moroccan officials. The conference will look at prospects for region-wide projects, less ambitious international ventures involving groups of nations, and national projects requiring aid. Morocco will bring specific proposals including possible involvement by Moroccan companies in building a Tel Aviv-Amman motorway, hotels in Jericho and agricultural projects in the Nile valley. It will also be seeking assistance for infrastructure plans of its own. The idea of a vast new frontier-free zone, Moroccan officials warn, 'will not come about overnight'. The precedent of the Arab Maghreb Union, set up amid much fanfare in 1989 between Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania, is hardly encouraging. The pact came at a high point in relations between Morocco and Algeria, officially re-established the previous year. The one significant project that can be said to have come from this co-operation is the Dollars 1.4m gas pipeline - on which work was officially inaugurated earlier this month - running from Algeria's Sahara gas field of Hassi R'Mel some 1,100 kilometres through Algeria, Morocco and under the Strait of Gibraltar before reaching the Spanish and Portuguese, and probably at a later stage, French markets. The Arab Maghreb Union was already considered moribund before Morocco and Algeria locked horns again in the aftermath of a shooting incident in August, in which two Spanish tourists were killed by gunmen in a Marrakesh hotel. Morocco, possibly rashly in retrospect, immediately imposed visa requirements on Algerian citizens or people of Algerian origin. Algeria reacted, not by reciprocating with visa rules, but by closing the border completely, something which some believe it wanted to do anyway to try to stop gun-running. After initially suspecting Algerian fundamentalist groups of the hotel killings, Moroccan officials now point the finger at the Algerian authorities themselves. They believe Algiers may have wanted to demonstrate that Morocco was not immune to the threat of Islamic extremism and to put a stop to alleged passive assistance to Algerian fundamentalists. One of the basic precepts of the UMA treaty was freedom of passage. 'When the country in the presidency of the UMA closes its border I do not see how you have a zone of open frontiers,' a Rabat government official commented wryly. 'The border is easy to close, but difficult to open. Up to 1988 it stayed closed for 12 years.' Relations between the two countries have been strained for most of the time, ever since Algeria won independence from France in 1962. The tension started with border disputes and built up after 1975 when Spain decided to pull out of its Western Sahara territory, with the intention of ceding it to Morocco and Mauritania (the latter subsequently dropping its claim). Algeria's objection to what it saw as Moroccan expansionism, and its support for the Polisario Front movement fighting for independence in the territory, kept a wedge between the two nations. Morocco walked out of the Organisation of African Unity 10 years ago over its stance on the Sahara. More than three years after the formal ceasefire with the Polisario, a UN-sponsored referendum deciding between independence or attachment to Morocco is supposed to take place next February. But after many delays already, the date is expected to slip again because of difficulties in drawing up the electoral register in the region, which covers an area more than half as big as the internationally recognised territory of Morocco. However, there is every indication that King Hassan wants to tie up the Sahara issue rapidly. The general assumption now is that the referendum, when it takes place, is likely to go in Morocco's favour - and that, in any case, Morocco would not let it go ahead unless it was pretty sure it would win. That would put an end to a 20-year quarrel during which the Moroccans, not adept at handling their own propaganda, incurred widespread discredit.</p>

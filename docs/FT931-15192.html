			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Privacy may be protected by new law THE GOVERNMENT is examining civil law measures to defend privacy rights, to add to the drafting of new criminal offences against the intrusive use of electronic surveillance and telephoto lenses, it emerged yesterday. A possible extension of the law of tort to cover privacy was raised by senior ministers at a cabinet sub-committee after it was agreed to rush forward publication of Sir David Calcutt QC's report on media behaviour to today. Alongside his central recommendation of a statutory press tribunal, Sir David calls also for a new criminal offence of 'physical intrusion' to prevent the use of bugging devices, long-range camera lenses and other electronic equipment to illicitly gather information. The new law would give the High Court the authority to issue injunctions against the the publication of information gathered by such means. It would also would provide for large damages to be awarded to the victims of such intrusion. Creating the separate breach-of-privacy tort, or civil wrong, would allow individuals to sue for compensation in the courts when they believed they could prove their private lives had been unreasonably invaded by intrusive behaviour or reporting. It is recommended by Sir David. There would be considerable legal complexities, however, over where the mitigating defence of public interest applied and over how to cover legal costs. Downing Street said early publication of the controversial Calcutt report, originally scheduled at the end of the month, was necessary to counter a distorted debate of the subject misinformed by 'partial leakages' of its findings. The decision came as a new storm was mounting over claims that the security services might be behind the leaking of tape-recordings of phone calls, allegedly made by members of the royal family. Lord Rees-Mogg, a former editor of The Times and now chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Authority, made the charge yesterday after the publication in Australia of an alleged conversation between the Prince of Wales and his longtime friend, Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles. A senior official rejected the claim as 'nonsensical' and dismissed any possibility of an inquiry. A formal response to the Calcutt report will be discussed at a full meeting of the cabinet today. Ministers will also decide whether a statement should be made to the Commons outlining the government's immediate reaction to its findings. Officials said it was quite possible that a statement would be made by Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, but that a detailed government response, including proposals on legislation, could be held back until later.</p>

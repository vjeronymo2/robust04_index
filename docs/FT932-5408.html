			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: US insurer buys life business of Aetna UK NEW YORK LIFE, the large US life company which moved into the UK insurance market when it acquired the Windsor Life group in 1989, is buying the life insurance operations of Aetna UK, part of another big US insurance combine. The operations which are changing hands comprise a mixture of life, health and disability income insurance, and take in the second-largest provider of employee benefits in the UK. No purchase price for the deal was disclosed, but assets supporting the operations total about Dollars 400m. The transaction is dependent on UK regulatory approvals. Aetna UK is part of Aetna Life and Casualty, the large US composite insurer. Aetna said it would continue to run its remaining UK operations, which encompass reinsurance, property-casualty policies and investment management. The deal is the second acquisition by Windsor Life since it came under New York Life's control. In 1992, it purchased Gresham Life Assurance. The latest transaction - which, according to New York Life, 'gives entry to the very important employee benefits market in Britain' - should take total assets under management at Windsor to around Dollars 1.5bn.</p>

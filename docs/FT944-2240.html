			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / Santer: Firm believer in market forces - How the next Commission president will face the tough tasks ahead Mr Jacques Santer, prime minister of Luxembourg and president-elect of the European Commission, holds the first official session with his new colleagues in Brussels today. In its own modest way, the meeting marks the end of the Delors era. Mr Santer has been kicking his heels these past few weeks as Mr Jacques Delors has occupied centre stage with his on-off interest in the French presidency. Still, as visitors to his office in Luxembourg report, Mr Santer has been using his spare time to reflect upon what he intends to accomplish in his five-year term in office. This begins at the end of next month, assuming he and the rest of the 20-member Commission win approval in a vote of investiture in the European parliament on January 18. Mr Santer is determined to make a good speech to the parliament the day before. He has carefully circulated drafts to colleagues, and wants to set out the Commission's programme in terms which can be understood by ordinary citizens. 'Santer is very worried about the gap between public perceptions of the European Union and its policies,' a colleague explains. As the president-elect understands, substance matters. So what are his own priorities, and how does he intend to reach a consensus inside the newly-expanded Commission, an uneasy combination of heavyweight hold-overs such as Mr Martin Bangemann (information technology) and Sir Leon Brittan (trade), and tigerish newcomers such as Ms Ritt Bjerregaard, the Dane in charge of environment policy? Just as important, how does he intend to keep the 15 member states on board, a skill at which Mr Delors excelled during his 10 years in Brussels? Mr Santer says all the big ideas are on the table; now it is up to member states and the Commission to make them work. He has therefore set himself three conventional, but difficult tasks: He is committed to achieving monetary union by the end of the century; to strengthening the common foreign and security policy; and to laying the groundwork for the 1996 inter-governmental conference (IGC) to review the Maastricht treaty, the Union's blueprint for closer integration. Mr Santer is an unabashed Emu supporter and sees a single currency as the indispensable complement to the single European market. He is cautious about the prospects for Emu by 1997, but relatively upbeat about reaching the Maastricht treaty target of 1999. On no account does he advocate softening the Emu 'convergence criteria' on budget deficits, government debt and exchange rate stability, though he recognises that the Maastricht treaty does offer flexibility, provided that candidates for monetary union are moving in the right direction toward targets. Most striking to visitors is Mr Santer's belief in the virtue of market forces. Whereas Mr Delors' first instinct was to corral the financial markets, especially during the currency turbulence in 1992-1993, Mr Santer leans toward a lighter touch. He thinks the introduction of wider 15 per cent fluctuation bands in August 1993 for currencies in the exchange rate mechanism - and the fact that they have worked so well since then - shows that people should put more confidence in markets than politicians. Mr Santer is less sure about how best to strengthen the common foreign and security policy, though he shares the view held in Bonn, Brussels, London and Paris that it is not working properly. Now comes the hard part. Countries such as the UK and France are wary of Commission encroachment in foreign policy-making and prefer the Council of Ministers to take the lead role. Mr Santer would like to bolster the Commission's role in intelligence gathering and political analysis and has also been dropping hints about strengthening the Western European Union, the fledgling EU defence arm. This does not amount to support for, say, the creation of a pan-European army but he would agree with Mr Delors' recent comment that the Union 'must be more than the Red Cross'. On the 1996 conference, Mr Santer's bottom line is that the Union must put in place new arrangements so that it can cope with the next round of enlargement covering the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, perhaps around the turn of the century. Contentious issues include an adjustment in the voting system in the Council of Ministers which is weighted disproportionately in favour of small member states; a reduction in the number of Commissioners; and a change in the six-monthly rotating presidency system so that large member states preside more regularly in an expanded Union. Mr Santer keeps his cards close to his chest, but he is adamant on one matter: the IGC must take decisions which will allow the Union to function with an expanded membership of more than 25 members before negotiations with the east Europeans can begin. He is betting on a long inter-governmental conference.</p>

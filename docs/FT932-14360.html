			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (19): Rival bibles for travellers - Airline guides IF you are a business traveller working out of London or any other European capital, the bible for you is probably still the ABC World Airways Guide, published by the Reed Travel Group. And If you are business person based in the US you would probably regard the Flight Guide, published by Official Airline Guides as an indispensable prop. OAG was part of the group of companies controlled by the late Robert Maxwell. According to Mr Jolyon Neely, sales and marketing director - business sector, the company is profitable and effectively controlled by the banks to whom Mr Maxwell owed money. The point is that these two companies virtually have a duopoly on scheduled airlines guides, but have relative strengths in different markets. On the face of it, OAG has the larger share of the market. It claims sales of 430,00 units against about 120,000 for ABC. These figures are not strictly comparable because OAG has a heavy emphasis on the US market, while ABC has more of a dominance in Europe and the rest of the world. Moreover, the two companies produce slightly different products for different markets so comparisons on units of sales is not very meaningful. Suffice to say the two companies dominate a market which is worth at least Pounds 100m and has been growing at between 5 and 10 per cent a year for the past five years. Much of the growth has come from the corporate sector, ie business travellers. Mr Ron Spiers, publishing director at Reed Travel Group, estimates there 735 scheduled airlines in the world. He says: 'We lose some each year and gain some; we are about 10 down on last year.' He adds: 'There are 122,243 unique flight numbers each day. If you break these down into sectors, say London, Paris, Johannesburg, then there are 671,000 sectors each day. These sectors are what the monthly guides would catalogue in some way or other each month.' Last year, ABC updated its flagship World Airways Guide and now calls it ABC World Airways Corporate Edition. This is the large tome to be found in many offices. It costs Pounds 330 for an annual subscription and is published monthly in two volumes. ABC says it sells about 71,000 of these. Much of the growth in the corporate market is in the pocket guides, called flight planners. These are condensed versions of the World Airways Guide and cover Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and the Americas. ABC sells a total of 26,278 of these around the world, in various editions and different markets. The pocket guides cost Pounds 73 for an annual subscription of 12 volumes. These are the main products of the Reed Travel Group. There are other publications covering hotels, and guides such as the ABC Rail Guide for the UK. This includes timetables and fares. Updated each month it covers all services in London and southern England, with complete details of the rail services between Britain's main towns and cities. The Reed Travel Group can be contacted in Church Street, Dunstable, Bedfordshire LU5 4HB (Telephone: 0582 600111) The flagship guide at OAG is the Flight Guide. This is published in two editions, a North American edition and a worldwide edition. The North American edition sells 106,000 copies each year and costs Dollars 310 for an annual subscription. The cost of the worldwide edition, which sells 40,000 copies, is Dollars 382. OAG, like ABC, publishes pocket guides. These cover the North Americas as well as Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific. As with the standard desk Flight Guide, the emphasis on OAG's pocket guides is on the Americas. OAG's pocket flight guides cost Dollars 103 for a 12-month subscription. They appear each month. In the UK it is possible now to buy individual monthly editions at selected bookshops. They retail at Pounds 4.99 each. Again these are the main publications put out by OAG relating to the airline business. There are other products covering hotels, shipping and cargo. In Britain, OAG can be contacted at Bridge House, 4 Lyons Crescent, Tonbridge, Kent TN9 IEX. Telephone: 0732-770655. Both companies are now going electronic. OAG has developed a system of computer discs for IBM-compatible personal computers. This is essentially a floppy disc which is grafted onto a hard disc and is updated each month. The cost of 12 monthly discs is Dollars 250. ABC has chosen a different route via CD-Rom. This means that the purchaser will also have to buy special equipment akin to a compact disc player to use these discs.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Australian insurer to sell Californian unit C. E. Heath International, the Australian liability insurer which was spun off from its UK-based parent via local stock market flotation in 1992, is selling C. E. Heath Compensation and Liability Insurance Company (or Heath Cal), its Californian workers' compensation subsidiary, for ADollars 132m (USDollars 94.3m). The purchaser of the business is Care America, a subsidiary of UniHealth America. The sale, according to the Australian group, should generate a pre-tax profit of about ADollars 30m and is likely to be completed during the next few months. C. E. Heath International said the funds generated from the sale would be ploughed back into expanding its interests in Australia, the UK and Asia. It mentioned growth possibilities in the Australian workers' compensation market - 'both Victoria and South Australia are expected to provide such opportunities in 1994-95' - and in liability and travel insurance in the UK. Other areas targeted for expansion include marine insurance and the Asian markets. News of the sale came as C. E. Heath announced a profit after tax of ADollars 38m in the 12 months to end-December. This compared with ADollars 16.3m in the previous year. Net premiums were ADollars 371.1m, up 27 per cent, and there was a small underwriting profit of ADollars 4.6m. Heath said operating profit before unrealised gains on investments and tax stood at ADollars 40.3m, up from ADollars 38.6m last time. Net unrealised gains on investment increased by ADollars 31m before tax, to ADollars 17.7m, and accounted for ADollars 11.8m of the after-tax profit.</p>

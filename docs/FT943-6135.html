			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Buckingham faces Pounds 4m legal bill Buckingham International, the lossmaking property, hotels and nursing group, yesterday said it faced a total bill of Pounds 4.3m after judgment was given against the company last month in litigation with the former directors and owners of Worldwide Dryers. Buckingham, which also announced pre-tax losses cut from Pounds 62.5m, after a Pounds 59.1m property provision, to Pounds 904,000 for the half year to May 1, said the judgment was for two amounts - Pounds 3.31m and Pounds 368,722, plus estimated costs of Pounds 600,000. Sir David Hardy, chairman, said that after taking legal advice, an appeal had been lodged against the judgment of Pounds 3.31m which resulted in a stay of execution until October 17. He said it was intended to seek a further stay until the appeal was heard. However, the Pounds 368,722 was now liable to be paid and as the company was unable to pay at this stage it was in talks with judgment creditors with a view to them participating in a bank support plan. Sir David said the group's future was dependent among other things on the stay of judgment being obtained, the discussions with judgment creditors being satisfactorily concluded and agreeing an extension to the support plan which ends on October 31. Turnover slipped to Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 24.4m) including Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 5.13m) from discontinued activities. Interest charges were cut by Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.2m. Losses per share came through at 0.8p (51.9p). The shares closed unchanged at 3p.</p>

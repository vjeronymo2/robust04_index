The following general guidelines are provided to assist in the preparation of responses. Please indicate to which form(s) your comments apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a potential respondent:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Are the instructions and definitions clear and sufficient? If not, which instructions require clarification?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Can the data be submitted using the definitions included in the instructions?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Can data be submitted in accordance with the response time specified in the instructions? Would it be possible for you to submit the data as much as two months earlier?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Public reporting burden for this data collection is estimated to range from 62 to 333 hours per response for the field level (i.e., large operator) version of Form EIA&hyph;23, ``Annual Survey of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves'' and reporting burden is estimated to average 8 hours per response for the State level (i.e., small operator) version of Form EIA&hyph;23. Public reporting burden is estimated to average 5.9 hours per response for the Form EIA&hyph;64A, ``Annual Report of the Origin of Natural Gas Liquids Production.'' Public reporting burden is estimated to average 0.25 hours per response for the Form EIA&hyph;23P, ``Oil and Gas Well Operator List Update Report.'' How much time, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information, do you estimate will be required for you to complete and submit the required form?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. What is the estimated dollar cost of completing this form, including the direct and indirect costs associated with the collection?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. How can the form be improved?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. Do you know of any other Federal, State, or local agency that collects similar data? If you do, specify the agency, the data element(s), and the means of the collection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a potential user:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Can you use data at the levels of detail indicated on the form? In particular, can you use the proposed data on reserves and production associated with enhanced oil recovery methods and nonconventional gas?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. For what purpose would you use the data? Please be specific.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Would you be adversely affected by discontinuation of indicated additional reserves data from the EIA&hyph;23 field form?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. How could the form be improved to better meet your specific needs?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. Are there alternative sources of oil and gas reserves data and do you use them? What are their strengths or deficiencies?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EIA is also interested in receiving comments on any other aspect of the data collection forms or the need for the information contained in the Oil and Gas Reserves Surveys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB approval of the form; they also will become a matter of public record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=3 --> Statutory Authorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Sections 3506(a) and (c)(1), Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended, Pub.

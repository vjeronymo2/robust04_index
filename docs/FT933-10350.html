			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Mexico will take to the road with toll-backed notes THE MEXICAN government is set to issue its first bonds backed by the revenues of a state-owned toll road. If next month's offering is well received, the government plans to securitise more of the Dollars 10bn-worth of private toll road concessions owned by national banks and construction companies. The government is preparing to offer around Dollars 600m of dollar-denominated bonds backed by the peso revenues from the state-owned toll road linking Mexico City to Cuernavaca, a senior official said. The debt is likely to be placed in the US with qualified institutions under the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule 144a, and to be sold publicly in the rest of the world. The Cuernavaca toll road was opened in the 1950s and traffic flow is stable. The Dollars 600m is estimated to be less than the full value of the road, giving bondholders added security if revenues are less than expected. The government is apparently not planning to offer any credit or exchange rate guarantees for the Cuernavaca bonds, but intends to issue different classes of debt, enabling investors to choose their level of risk. Lehman Brothers and Banamex are expected to manage the offering. The Cuernavaca bonds will probably be followed by Grupo ICA's securitisation of completed parts of the Dollars 540m Guadalajara-Tepic toll road. In this case, the government is exploring ways of helping ICA reduce exchange rate risk, perhaps by giving the issuer the right to borrow dollars from the state development bank in the event of a peso devaluation, one government official said. Mexico's privately-financed toll road programme is believed to be the largest in the world, with some 2,700km of roads completed, and 1,900km under construction. However, many roads have run into trouble because traffic has fallen below forecasts and costs have rocketed. Mexico's banks, which financed most of the construction, are thought to have been left with hundreds of millions of dollars of under-performing debt. The government was forced to postpone a planned offering of highway-backed bonds last year due to the fall in the Mexican stock market and rise in interest rates. If the government successfully sells bonds on the Cuernavaca road, it plans to offer more backed by revenues from its other toll roads, Mexico City to Puebla and Mexico City to Queretero. Tribasa, another construction company, also intends to securitise some of its Mexico City toll roads in the autumn, after its planned initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in September. ICA, GMD, another construction company, and Tribasa also plan to securitise the first part of the Dollars 1bn Mexico City-Guadalajara road. The only previous toll road bond offering, sold last year and backed by Tribasa's completed Toluca highway, did not attract much initial interest, although Lehman Bros says the entire Dollars 312m of bonds have now been placed. The transport ministry is trying to sort out problems in finished toll roads, by extending concessions, and requiring trucks over a certain weight to use the toll roads. Officials say traffic on a few roads, generally those far from large cities, is so low that equity and debt holders will have to inject more capital. The existing commitments to under-performing toll roads have made Mexico's banks, except Banamex, unwilling to finance new projects. The government has said it will pay for the Dollars 600m Tehuacan-Oaxaca road, and another toll road in Chiapas out of proceeds from privatisation not accounted for in this year's budget. It hopes Banamex will finance the Tuxpan-Pachuca toll road.</p>

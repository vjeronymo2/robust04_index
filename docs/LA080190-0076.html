			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY IDENTIFIED IN FIERY FREEWAY CRASH  </P> <P> A family of four taking its first trip in a motor home from a rural area of  British Columbia to Disneyland was identified Tuesday as the victims of a fiery  crash on a Burbank freeway that left the husband, his wife and stepdaughter  dead and his stepson badly burned.  </P> <P> Doug Bertsch, a milkman who lived in Killiney Beach, had recently inherited the  35-foot camper after his father's death, said neighbors in the town of 300  residents about 200 miles northeast of Vancouver.  </P> <P> Bertsch, 45, his wife, Joanne, who was in her late 30s, and her children from  an earlier marriage, Gavin Sweezie, 14, and Allison Sweezie, 10, set off  Thursday in the motor home for Southern California, said neighbor Kim Redding.  </P> <P> "They were so looking forward to this trip," Redding said tearfully. "The  family had traveled often. But this was the first time in the motor home and  the kids were so excited because they were going to Disneyland. They had never  been there."  </P> <P> But the trip ended in catastrophe Monday morning on the southbound Golden State  Freeway when the motor home and a semi hauling 50,000 pounds of tomatoes  collided and crashed into a concrete abutment at the Burbank Boulevard  overpass.  </P> <P> The driver of the truck escaped with minor injuries but the motor home burst  into flames. Rescuers were only able to pull Gavin from the fire. He was burned  over 80% of his body and remained in serious condition Tuesday at Childrens  Hospital of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Redding said Bertsch and his wife were married last summer. In addition to  driving a milk truck on a route through the small towns around Okanagan Lake,  Bertsch also was a dog breeder. Redding said the couple had recently bought a  large parcel of land near the lake and planned to live on the site in the motor  home while a house was being built.  </P> <P> "This was to be their big trip to California before they settled down and  started building," Redding said. "Doug inherited the motor home a couple months  ago but didn't pick it up until last week. He went and got it and they left."  </P> <P> The accident remained under investigation Tuesday by the California Highway  Patrol. Authorities declined to released the names of the three victims who  were killed because their identities had not been confirmed through medical  records.  </P> <P> But officials confirmed that Bertsch was the registered owner of the motor home  and that Gavin Sweezie had lost his mother, sister and stepfather in the  accident.  </P> <P> Officer David Padgett said the CHP was still looking for a white pickup truck  that might have triggered the accident with a dangerous lane change. A truck  driver who witnessed the accident told investigators that the pickup cut in  front of the motor home and struck its front side, knocking it into the truck  that was hauling tomatoes.  </P> <P> Padgett said a Honda Accord was also involved in the accident. The car's right  side was damaged and a passenger slightly injured at some point when it  collided with the motor home, but investigators are still attempting to  reconstruct the accident and determine what part the Honda played.  </P> <P> Maria Iacobo, a spokeswoman for Childrens Hospital, said Gavin Sweezie remained  in the intensive care unit and would face weeks of care there. She said the  boy's father flew to Los Angeles from Canada Monday night and has been  constantly at his side. Hospital officials declined to allow the father to be  interviewed.  </P> <P> Iacobo said numerous phone calls were received Tuesday at the hospital from as  far as Canada from people who did not know Gavin but were inquiring about his  condition.  </P></p>

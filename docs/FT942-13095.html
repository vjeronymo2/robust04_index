			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Economic Watch: Swiss money supply up 1.2% Switzerland's seasonally adjusted monetary base rose SFr350m (Pounds 166m) or 1.2 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 from the fourth quarter of last year, the Swiss National Bank said. The adjusted monetary base (bank notes in circulation plus bank reserves held with the central bank divided by seasonal factors) is the SNB's chosen measure for tracking medium term monetary policy. It averaged SFr30.078bn in the first quarter, slightly higher than the SFr29.9bn forecast, due to lower interest rates and a pick-up in the Swiss economy. French consumer spending on manufactured goods was 1.8 per cent higher in March 1994 than March 1993, according to detailed seasonally adjusted figures released yesterday by Insee, the national statistics institute. Dutch seasonally adjusted manufacturing output rose 1 per cent in February from January but was almost flat year-on-year, the Central Bureau of Statistics said yesterday. Consumer prices in the western German state of Hesse rose 0.3 per cent in the month to mid-April and were up 3.2 per cent from a year earlier, the state statistics office said yesterday.</p>

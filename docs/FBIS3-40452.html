The Technology Policy  Committee to be established as a part of the Small and Medium  Sized Enterprise Modernization Council (an advisory organ of the  Minister of MITI) will begin deliberations this fall. While  developing a successor law to the Law on Extraordinary Measures  for the Technology Development Promotion for Small and Medium  Enterprises, which will expire at the deadline of July 1995, the  Council will carry out support for restructuring and find uses  of regional public research institutes (kohsetsushi labs) by  regional industries.    Almost 10 years have passed since the Small and Medium  Enterprise Agency endeavored to devise a new vision for  technology policy based on a report completed in February 1985  by committee of the Small and Medium Sized Enterprise  Modernization Council. This committee recognized the need for  new objectives given the changing economic and technological  environments.    The Law on Extraordinary Measures for the Technology  Development Promotion for Small and Medium Enterprises which  currently forms the basis for technology policies for small- and  medium-sized enterprises is based on the 1985 report. Support  policies like loans for advanced capital, tax reduction  measures, and exceptions for extra credit for companies  implementing development plans authorized by the prefecture are  organized under this law. Since this law has a 10-year limit,  this system will discontinue as of July 1995.    The purpose of the new vision is to design a successor law.  The report of the Basic Policy Study Group of the Small and  Medium Enterprises Policy Council sought clarification of the  vision for technology policy for the country. To address this, a  study will begin. The Technology Policy Committee to be  established this fall in the Small and Medium Enterprise  Modernization Council will try to respond before the end of  fiscal year 1993.    In concert with the new vision, about 170 kohsetsushi in  prefectures throughout the country will begin to develop a  system to facilitate the activities of small- and medium-sized  enterprises like local manufacturing industries. Support for  restructuring will also be included.</p>

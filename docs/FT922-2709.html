			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Technology: One step forward and two back - Technically Speaking COMPUTERS, through their ability to store and process large quantities of data quickly and quietly, have greatly complicated the copyright business. The European Commission is doing its best to deal with the new electronic threats to intellectual property, but some of the solutions it is considering seem at best poorly thought through, at worst a potential block on progress. A case in point is the measures it is prescribing - in the form of a draft directive - to protect the intellectual property contained in online commercial databases. The measures seek to outlaw what Brussels describes as 'unfair extraction': in other words, database piracy. Online databases are collections of information about specific subjects  - foreign exchange rates, chemical formulae or medical statistics, for example, collated, organised and held on computers. The information is available to customers typically through a computer terminal or personal computer on a fee basis. Examples include Priceline, owned by Reuters, and the World Patents Index from Derwent Publications. The on-line database business in Europe is flourishing after a slow start and is now probably worth some Pounds 1.75bn a year. The EC is intent on building a comprehensive body of legislation to cover information processing and intellectual property rights. Last year, for example, it sponsored a directive, which continues to work its way through the system, designed to protect software producers against piracy. It is also working on measures to protect personal data. Earlier this year, however, Brussels approved draft legislation aimed at would-be database pirates. It would, in essence, protect producers of databases from 'unfair' copying of the contents of their product for 10 years. The underlying rationale is that without such protection producers would hold back from investment in these databases. Sensible enough on the surface, but some would say the Commission had fired a broadside before pirate galleons were on the horizon. Although some database producers have welcomed the legislation, there is little evidence to date that investment has been prejudiced because of its absence. Critics argue, moreover, that the directive contains provisions which are not only unnecessary, but could stifle the competition necessary to drive innovation in the business. The directive, for example, aims to protect not only the originality of the selection and arrangement of the facts in a database but the raw facts themselves. This threatens not only to hinder the free flow of information but also damage competition between providers of data. Furthermore, the level of originality in the database need not be very high. So almost any collection of material might qualify for copyright after which it could neither be reproduced, translated, adapted, arranged or altered without the express consent of the copyright holder. It raises the bizarre possibility of database producers scrabbling for information of all sorts to stuff haphazardly into databases to qualify for copyright protection. There are other anomalies - protection is awarded to the mechanism which makes the database work but not to computer programs used in its making or operation. Many would argue the two are indivisible. And a reciprocity clause in the proposal is clearly designed to enable Europe to put pressure on the US, where unfair extraction legislation has already been rejected by the Supreme Court, to follow the European example. The point is that databases are already adequately protected - by conventional copyright laws, by contract and by the EC member state's unfair competition laws. Any further layers of protection seem likely to smother the very originality the EC is trying to protect. This is one directive which should be abandoned before its clauses catch inextricably in the Brussels machinery.</p>

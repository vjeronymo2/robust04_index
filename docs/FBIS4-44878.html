Naoaki  Aizaki, Ken Nakajima, Satomi Hirasawa, and Yoshikatsu Kojima, pp  4-9    An 0.25 m electron-beam direct writing technology has  been  developed for 256 M bit DRAM test fabrication. The following  three key techniques have been improved and optimized:    (1) a pattern data preparation technique for correcting  proximity effect and reducing data conversion time;    (2) a resist process technique for fabricating reliable fine  patterns;    (3) an electron-beam writing system technique for improving  overlay accuracy.    The overlay accuracy was improved to under 0.075 m  (average + 3 _s_), which is sufficient for the required  alignment tolerance. Utilizing these techniques, a 256 M bit  DRAM in a feature size of 0.25 m was successfully  fabricated.    3.3 V Single Power-Supply 64 M Bit Flash Memory. Toshio  Takeshima, Hiroshi Sugawara, Hiroshi Takada, Yoshiaki Hisamune,  Kohji Kanamori, Takeshi Okazawa, Tatsunori Murotani, and Isao  Sasaki, pp 10-14    A 3.3 V single power-supply 64 M bit flash memory has been  developed by using 0.4 m CMOS technology. 50 ns access time  and 256 bit erase/programming unit-capacity have been achieved  by using hierarchical word-line and bit-line structure. Dynamic  Bit-line Latch (DBL) programming scheme, which enables 256 bit  simultaneous programming, has been developed. The chip measures  19.3mm by 13.3mm.    Development of the Low Cost and High Voltage CMOS Process.  Ken'ichiro Takahashi, Kousuke Yoshida, and Hideaki Horii, pp  15-18    EL (ElectroLuminescence) display, VFD (Vacuum Fluorescent  Displays) and PDP (Plasma Display Panel) need a high operating  voltage of more than 100 V. The junction isolating technology  has been usually used for the EL, VFD and PDP drivers. However,  the junction-isolating structure requires more process steps  than self-isolating structure, such as buried layer formation,  epitaxial layer growth, and isolating layer formation.  Accordingly, the junction-isolating type IC is more expensive  than the self-isolating type. NEC has developed the  manufacturing process of self-isolating type for the EL, VFD and  PDP driver ICs. The maximum rating voltage of this process is  150 V. Until NEC develops the process, NEC's maximum voltage of  self-isolating type ICs was 80 V. From now on, most EL, VFD and  PDP driver ICs will be supplied with inexpensive self-isolating  technology.    500 MHz 32-Bit CMOS RISC Process. Hachiro Yamada, Yoichi  Yano, and Isami Sakai, pp 19-25    NEC has developed a 500 MHz, 32-bit RISC microprocessor LSI  using triple-level aluminum 0.4 m CMOS technology. Its  32-bit  data-path is designed with 8-stage pipeline architecture, which  includes 2-stage 1 KB cache memories, 2-stage adders and a  2-stage barrel shifter. NEC has also developed several key  technologies for high-speed LSIs, such as a level-short clock  tree circuit, a low noise high-speed interface circuit, a  low-bounce stacked power line, a high-density standard cell  method, and a 500 MHz low jitter PLL circuit. About 200,000  transistors are integrated into a die area of 7.90mm x 8.84mm.  The power dissipation is 6 W at a 3.3 V power supply and 500 MHz  operating frequency.    Multi Chip Module for the RISC Microprocessor. Mikio Baba,  Teruhiko Konno, Yuichi Yoshida, Tsuneo Koike, Yumi Yoshida,  Takahiro Fukui, and Ichiro Yoshida, pp 26-30    Needs for Multi Chip Module (MCM) are rapidly increasing, as  electronic products are required to have size-reduction and  high-performance. NEC has developed MCM technologies based on  single-chip packages. This paper describes the technologies of  the MCM containing a RISC microprocessor and cache memories in a  conventional package.    Miniaturized LCC Type Hybrid IC With Chip Capacitor and  Resistor Components. Masao Ushigome, Osamu Ohnishi, Yoshifumi  Moriyama, Futoshi Hosoya, and Yoshihito Kataoka, pp 31-33    LCC (Leadless Chip Carrier) type hybrid IC is a package  which  is established by joining COB (Chip On Board) assembling  technology and manufacturing technology of epoxy-glass printed  wiring boards. To meet requirements for high-frequency and  high-performance, NEC has developed a new type of LCC package.  This paper describes the new LCC type hybrid IC which contains  chip capacitor and resistor components.    Development of Ultra Fine Pitch (0.4, 0.3mm pitch) QFP.  Takayuki Uno, Masato Aiba, Satoshi Takahashi, and Yasuhiro  Suzuki, pp 34-37    NEC has developed ultra fine pitch (0.4, 0.3mm pitch) QFPs  to  satisfy the requirements of size-reduction and high-performance  of electronics. This paper discusses the ultra high pin count  QFP for higher density and performance LSI devices. These QFPs  have been developed by realizing new technologies: the design  method using simulation, and the package structure using TAB  tape. As a result, NEC has developed 376 pin QFP (0.4 mm pitch,  [square] 40 mm, 3.2 mm[.sup]t[/]) and 504 pin LQFP  (Low-profile QFP, 0.3mm pitch, [square] 40 mm,  1.4mm[.sup]t[/]).    Development of On-Line System for Wafer Sort Process. Haruo  Amano, Tetsunori Maeda, Yuji Miyagi, Michio Honma, Toshihiko  Kikuchi, Yoshihiro Miyajima, Masahide Ozawa, Kenichi Nagatome,  Mamoru Maki, and Shigeo Fujino, pp 38-42    As wafer sort process becomes multiple processes, such  improvements as the reduction of mis-operation, the achievement  of high efficiency in operation, and higher accuracy in test  data collection have been required. For these improvements, NEC  has developed a wafer sort on-line system as NEC's standard  system. The system, called WITS, has been installed in Roseville  plant of NEC Electronics Inc. (U.S.A.). In the WITS system, all  the test and sort equipment are controlled through Ethernet by  the line control system, which is connected to the production  control system and transacts data with each other. Regarding  operation, the worker's job is only to input the LOT-ID barcode.  Receiving the data, the system can set the testing parameter  automatically, and testing can start easily. As a result,  mis-operation and pre-operation time can be greatly reduced, and  low yield trend or causes can be detected early. This wafer sort  on-line system has increased production efficiency, and is  currently operating well.    Acquisition of ISO9000 Certification in NEC Semiconductor  Group. Tsutomu Igarashi, Teruo Muroya, Teruo Hidaka, Mineki  Fukumoto, and Takenori Kanasaki, pp 43-48    ISO9000 quality assurance system was enacted in 1987 and  more  than 50 countries have already implemented it. In Japan, it was  implemented as Japan Industrial Standard (JIS), and in 1993 the  Japan Accreditation Board Quality System Registration (JAB) was  established. Under these status, as for all NEC semiconductor  business unit in Japan, divisions with design functions have  been qualified for the ISO9001 and subsidiary companies with  manufacturing functions have also been qualified for the  ISO9002. In the acquisition period, we specified the job area  promoted in terms of both the whole group and each unit, then we  encouraged assigned members. This paper describes troubleness,  usefulness or effectiveness by examples from the divisions and  subsidiaries.    Development of Radiation-Hardened HCMOS Logic ICs in Excess  of a Total Dose of 10 kGy (Si). Toshio Tsubota, Mamoru Tanitsu,  Masahide Hayama, Naomichi Gotoh, Susumu Nakakarumai, Satoshi  Kuboyama, and Takashi Tamura, pp 49-54    NEC has developed the radiation-hardened high speed CMOS  (HCMOS) logic ICs applicable to artificial satellites or  spacecraft which are exposed to radiation environment under the  guidance of National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA).  They have the total dose tolerance in excess of 10 kGy (Si) and  conform to NASDA-QTS-38510A. They will be used for the Japanese  Experimental Module (JEM) to be attached to the space station  that will be launched and assembled on orbit from 1998.    NEC Semiconductor Device Information System. Ichiro  Miyazawa,  Yoichi Shikata, Tomihiro Ishihara, Tohru Kamisaki, Hiroshi  Yamamoto, Akio Tanaka, Hiromi Yokoyama, Syuji Suzuki, and Seiji  Miyamoto, pp 55-60    NEC uses a variety of methods to provide technical  information on semiconductors both inside and outside the  company. Among a large amount of information, product  information is provided as printed material, including data  sheets, user's manuals, and regular publications. However, due  to the quick technical innovations in the field of  semiconductors, the volume of information is rapidly increasing,  and information is greatly varying. There has thus arisen the  need on a computer-based retrieval system for efficiently  retrieved specific information from a mass of information  available. This paper describes the technical information  support system, especially NESDIS (NEC Semiconductor Device  Information System), and also gives an outline of the future  trend in information services.    On-Line Japanese Character Recognition on a V810 RISC  Microprocessor. Kaoru Uchida, Kazunaga Yoshida, Keiji Yamada,  Masahiko Hamanaka, Yoshinobu Koujin, Takamitsu Komatsu, and  Shuichiro Urata, pp 61-65    NEC has developed an on-line handwritten Japanese character  recognition system on a V810 RISC microprocessor. This  recognition system employs a hierarchical classification  technique based on flexible template matching, which frees users  from the constraints of stroke order and connectivity in  handwriting. Handy pen-based computing with highly user-friendly  Japanese recognition can be realized using the V810, with its  high cost-performance and low power consumption.    Development of 64 M Bit DRAM. Yoshinori Matsui, Akihiko  Kagami, Shyuichi Tsukada, Toru Chonan, Shigeo Chishiki, Yoshiaki  Yamada, Takaho Tanigawa, Haruo Iwasaki, Hiroki Koga, Shozo  Nishimoto, Shinichi Kuwabara, and Yasuhito Takeuchi, pp 69-73    NEC has developed the world's latest commercial 64 M bit  DRAM. This paper discusses the new process and circuit  techniques in the 64 M bit DRAM. Bit organization is x 4/x 8/x  16, packed in SOJ and TSOP(II) by LOC (Lead On Chip) technology.  The Triple Well process technique and new boost circuit scheme  have achieved the fastest access time of 38 ns at Ta = 70C  and VCC = 3.0 V. Regarding spec value, RAS access time is 50 ns,  cycle time is 90 ns and operating current is 100 mA. The dual  wordline scheme with distributed wordline driver circuit has  made it possible to use the conventional lithography technique,  rather than complicated lithography schemes like multi-layer  photo resist and phase shifting technique. Thus, it has  successfully reduced the manufacturing cost.    High-Speed DRAMs. Toshihiko Sato, Toru Ishikawa, Shoji  Kaneko, Hiroshi Nakayama, Yasuhiro Nonaka, and Tomoko Kobayashi,  pp 74-83    NEC has developed three types of high speed DRAM. They have  been revolutionarily improved in the data transfer rate by using  0.45 m CMOS process as the most advanced fabrication  technology and the latest circuit technology. One is hyper page  DRAM. Another is synchronous DRAM. The other is  Rambus[.sup]TM[/] DRAM (RDRAM[.sup]TM[/]). This paper  describes their features and applications.    BiCMOS 256K Bit/1M Bit High-Speed Static RAM Family.  Masakazu  Soeda, Toshio Komuro, Kenji Kondou, Hiroyuki Goto, Yasushi  Yamazaki, Shintaro Asano, Keita Maeda, Shigeru Maruyama, Kenichi  Echigoya, Minoru Yamagami, Tamotsu Watarai, and Satoshi  Katagiri, pp 84-88    NEC has developed the world's fastest static RAMs (1M bit: 8  ns, 256K bit: 10 ns). These high-speed static RAMs comprise the  following types: PD46258/9/8L/9L (256K bit),  PD461008/9/8L/9L/16L/18L (1M bit). In consideration of the  high density in mounting; the PD46258/9/8L/9L are packed in  32 pin-300 mil width plastic SOJ, the PD461008/8L in 32  pin-400 mil SOJ, the PD461009/9L in 36 pin-400 mil SOJ, and  the PD461016L/18L in 44 pin-400 mil SOJ or TSOP. These  high-speed BiCMOS static RAMs use an 0.5 m double layer  aluminum process, high-performance transistors, an optimized  layout plan, and a voltage regulator that keeps the internal  circuit voltage constant.    288 K Bit Ultra High-Speed Synchronous ECL SRAM. Hiroyuki  Takahashi, Hisamitsu Kimoto, Masahumi Mitsuishi, Masakazu  Sasaki, and Takahisa Migita, pp 89-92    NEC has developed a 32 K x 9 bit synchronous static RAM with  the cycle time of 6 ns and the access time of 3 ns, which are  the world's fastest. This high-speed SRAM family with the ECL  I/O interface consists of two types of product, which have the  different synchronous circuits of register and latch. A low  power consumption of 0.9 W has enabled the adoption of plastic  package, that is 52 pin PLCC. This performance has been achieved  by 0.5 m BiCMOS process technology, new circuit technology  (for instance, the differential BiCMOS register), and layout  technology for noise reduction.    High-Speed 16 M Bit Mask ROM With Page Access Mode. Shinobu  Miyata, Yukio Fuji, Tatsuo Sato, Kouichi Suzuki, Asami Katagiri,  and Shinji Okumoto, pp 93-94    This paper discusses the features of high-speed Page Access  Mode CMOS Mask ROM PD23C16040. The PD23C16040 has been  realized by employing very fine pattern technology of 0.5 m  minimum design rule and new circuit architecture. As a result,  the device achieves a high-speed access time (120 ns) and page  access time (50 ns). Three types of package are available: 42  pin 600 mil DIP, 44 pin 600 mil SOP, and 44 pin 400 mil TSOP  Type II.    Development of 4 M Bit Video RAM Organized as 256 K Words x  16 Bits. Satoshi Tamaki, Moemi Harada, Takafumi Masuda, Hidekazu  Higuchi, Takeshi Fukuda, Kenshi Izumi, Tsuyoshi Konishi, Kouzi  Itonaga, and Yuki Anan, pp 95-97    NEC has successfully developed a 256 K x 16 bit-based 4 M  bit  Video RAM through 0.5 m CMOS process. We have achieved a  low-power and high-speed Video RAM with byte write control and  block write equipped with column mask and self-refresh, which  can satisfy market needs ranging from PCs to EWSs.    16 M Bit Silicon File PD426171/426174. Toshihiko Sato,  Seiichi Hannai, Yuji Muraoka, and Yukiyoshi Kiyota, pp 98-99    Recently, the application of battery back-up memory is  increasing for solid-state disk and portable equipment. NEC has  successfully developed the PD426171/426174 (16 M bit Silicon  File) which are the most suitable for these applications. The  PD426171/426174 have achieved the very low data retention  current of 30 A (max.) at ambient temperature of 0 to  55C. In addition, the PD426171/426174 are fully  compatible with the standard 16 M bit DRAM (x 1, x 4) including  the access time (60, 70, 80 ns).    Low-Cost, Low-Power 64-Bit RISC Microprocessor  V[.sub]R[/]4200. Hirokazu Tsukamoto, Noboru Kobayashi, Yasumi  Kurashima, Yuuichi Takeshita, Jun-ichi Aoki, Takahiro Kawamura,  and Masakazu Chiba, pp 102-106    V[.sub]R[/]4200 is a new 64-bit RISC microprocessor based  on a joint development of NEC and Mips Technologies Inc. The  V[.sub]R[/]4200 contains 16 K byte instruction cache and 8 K  byte data cache associated with 5-stage pipeline processing,  which allows to perform 55SPECint92 and 30SPECfp92 at 80 MHz.  The V[.sub]R[/]4200 also performs low power consumption, 1.5  W at 3.3 V operation, using 0.6 micron 3-metal CMOS technology.  The V[.sub]R[/]4200 has much higher cost-performance compared  to conventional RISC processors. Therefore, the  V[.sub]R[/]4200 puts a strategic target upon low-end UNIX  workstations and personal computers for WindowsNT. The  conventional RISC processors have been mainly used for high-end  UNIX workstations. The V[.sub]R[/]4200 will respond to  further market needs by expanding the capabilities of RISC  processors into not only UNIX workstations but also WindowsNT  personal computers.    High-Performance RISC Processor V[.sub]R[/]4400. Tatsuya  Maekawa, Takashi Miyazaki, Masayuki Yamamoto, Toshiyuki  Tsutsumi, Sunao Nakamura, Yumiko Yamanaka, and Masatoshi  Yoshida, pp 107-110    This paper outlines a high performance RISC type  microprocessor V[.sub]R[/]4400. The V[.sub]R[/]4400 has a  higher performance of 130 MIPS than the V[.sub]R[/]4000's 80  MIPS with software and pin compatibility.

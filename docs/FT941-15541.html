			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / People: Rhys and Chapman join WDA The reshaping of the Welsh Development Agency, after last year's blistering criticism by the Commons public accounts committee, continues apace. John Redwood, Welsh secretary, is strengthening the board with two new members, Garel Rhys and Rhiannon Chapman. Rhys, who holds the chair in motoring economics at Cardiff, is an expert on the automotive industry; Redwood describes Rhys' expertise as 'particularly significant' as the motor industry is now the largest single manufacturing sector in the Welsh economy. Chapman was until recently director of the Industrial Society and previously personnel director at the London Stock Exchange. They will take up their non-executive posts immediately for a three-year term under David Rowe-Beddoe, who took over as chairman last July. Roy Thomas, a partner in the law firm Edward Lewis Bevan Ashford, was recently appointed as the WDA's secretary and legal director. One post yet to be filled is that of chief executive to replace Philip Head who resigned in October in the aftermath of the Commons committee report. He is continuing at the WDA until his successor is appointed.</p>

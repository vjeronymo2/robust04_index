			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo, 5 Jun (AE) -- PT [Workers Party]  presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will resume his  presidential campaign tomorrow (6 June). During the whole of  the month of June, and prior to the implementation of the real  on 1 July, Lula will try to consolidate his lead in the opinion  polls. The PT will create People's Committees [Comites  Populares] to promote party activism on the streets. It will  launch the first of its long-term programs, the job program, and  will unveil an alternative to the economic program of his main  opponent, Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party]. In addition, Lula will take new trips. On 6  June, he will visit Espirito Santo, the only state he has not  yet visited. All this seeks to counterbalance a possible  negative impact on his candidacy if the implementation of the  new currency leads to economic stability.    A source close to Lula has reported that "to counterbalance  the real, on 9 June, Lula will launch a job program, showing  that curbing the inflation rate is not enough to improve the  standard of living of the people." He added that "promoting the  People's Committees throughout Brazil will be a way to take the  presidential campaign to the streets because up to now, the  campaign consisted of Lula touring the country by bus. Gilberto  Carvalho, one of the presidential campaign coordinators,  reported that within the next few days, the PT will disclose an  alternative economic plan to the dollarization of the economy,  in opposition to Cardoso's plan. The idea is to propose another  currency backing; and to show that Cardoso's economic plan  caused losses in converting prices to Real Value Units on the  basis of the peak inflation rate of the four previous months,  while salaries were converted on the basis of the average  inflation rate of the four previous months. It also intends to  prove that Cardoso's economic plan does not foresee a solution  to the job problem or the achievement of economic growth.    In Espirito Santo, Lula plans to hold rallies in Vitoria,  Linhares, Sao Mateus, Colatina, and Cachoeiro de Itapermirim.  He will also meet with business and religious leaders. He will  be in Porto Alegre from 10 to 12 June, and is scheduled to hold  a rally on 12 June at Vale de Anhangabau in the city of Sao  Paulo.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: MEPC strong The surge in property shares increased speculation that MEPC would shortly follow the example of some of its rivals and call for cash from the equity market. There were strong rumours that such a move might accompany the company's interim results today, with market talk suggesting a right issue in the order of a 1-for-4 to raise Pounds 250m. An issue of this size would catapult MEPC back towards the FT-SE 100, and also take the amount of money raised by the property sector in recent months to over Pounds 1bn. Property analysts also expect the second line stocks to turn to shareholders for extra funds in the very near future. Great Portland Estates and Frogmore Estates were two names being hinted at in the market yesterday. MEPC shares rose 26 to 448p, Great Portland 22 to 205p and Frogmore 17 to 404p.</p>

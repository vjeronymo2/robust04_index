			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 24 Jan (AFP) -- Honduran  President-elect Carlos Roberto Reina today announced the members  of the cabinet with which he will promote his "moral revolution"  in the next four years. Reina will be taking office on 27  January to replace Rafael Callejas. Reina's government team is  a mixture of progressive intellectuals, former university  professors, conservative businessmen, and politicians.    Guillermo Bueno, a prominent financial administrator and  former president of the Honduran Central Bank during military  governments, will be Reina's presidential economic adviser and  coordinator of the economic cabinet.    The intellectuals include Ernesto Paz Aguilar as foreign  minister, Hugo Noe Pino as Central Bank president, and Guillermo  Molina Chocano as planning minister. The three have not held  government or business positions in the past.    Juan Ferrera, who until now has served as president of the  Honduran Council of Private Enterprise (Cohep), will head the  Finance Ministry, and banker Delmer Urbizo will be economy  minister. The main economic advisers will be financier Jorge  Bueso Arias and Dante Ramirez, former president of the Central  American Bank of Economic Integration (BCIE).    Even though during his trip to Washington last week, Reina  had announced a dialogue with the Armed Forces to appoint a  civilian as defense minister, today he stated that this position  will be held by Colonel Reynaldo Andino Flores.    Reina's government team is completed by former Liberal Party  presidential hopeful Rodolfo Pastor as culture minister; German  Aparicio, a close political supporter, as transport minister;  lawyer Efrain Moncada Silva as government minister; Cecilio  Zavala as labor minister; Xenovia de Leon, promoter of  nongovernmental organizations, as education minister; and  Enrique Samayoa as health minister. Attorney Ubodoro Arriaga  will head the National Agrarian Institute (INA). He held that  post during the Roberto Suazo Cordova administration (1982-86).  The president-elect appointed his brother, Mario Reina, as  assistant in the presidential office.    "I have sounded out all sectors and this cabinet is what  best  suits the moral revolution," Reina said.</p>

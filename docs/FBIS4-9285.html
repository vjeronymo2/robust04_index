			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu by the Greek </F> magazine BALKAN NEWS AND EAST EUROPEAN REPORT" in Bucharest on  22 March 1994]    [Text] [Reporter] How do you view the development of  Europe and what role will Romania play in that future  development?    [Iliescu] After the events in 1989 in the Central and East  European countries, the physiognomy of Europe radically changed.    Although the Cold War was over, we had to face prejudice and  certain tendencies toward the discriminatory treatment of East  European countries. I believe that the future Europe should  consist of countries that develop relations of cooperation and  not confrontation.    Last year Romania succeeded in removing the last barriers  that affected its image. It became a member of the Council of  Europe with full rights and obtained most-favored-nation status  from the United States. This year, Romania was the first  country to sign the Partnership for Peace with NATO. We propose  to keep up this rapid pace of integration in Europe and develop  good relations with the United States, the Far East, and other  countries of the world.    The recent accord not only represents financial support but  it is also a moral credit granted to our country. It speaks for  itself about the fact that, according to experts, Romania has to  play an important role because of its natural resources, its  people's high level of education, the efficiency of its  government, and its privileged geographical position, which  permits control over air routes and waterways that connect  Europe and the Middle East and mainly the Rhine-Main-Danube  Canal.    [Reporter] In the past months, after the political changes  stabilized in Central and East Europe, we witnessed the first  real signs of redistribution of influence between the major  powers. Could you please comment on this?    [Iliescu] Unfortunately, I cannot fully agree with you that  all political changes in Central and Easter Europe have been  stabilized. While this is obvious for such states as Romania,  Bulgaria, and Hungary, in terms of the former federations, such  as Yugoslavia and USSR, the current stabilization is still  fragile.    Second, I believe that the example of shares of influence of  the great powers belongs to an old mentality that is specific to  the Cold War rather than to current relations. I rather see the  near future of this part of the world in terms of distribution  of areas of influence between big and average centers of power.  The former socialist countries in Europe should mainly  recuperate the technological and managerial deficiency that  separates them from West Europe to be able to make full use of  its resources, among which I would call human resources as the  major one. All this should not turn former socialist countries  in competitors for West Europe; on the contrary, we should  become equal and solid partners in the act of building a  stronger, more stable, and more prosperous Europe. That is why  the last thing we need now is a conflict for hegemony, no matter  whether we are talking about the attempt of one country to  expand its hegemony or the need to defend itself from foreign  hegemony.    I believe that the Partnership for Peace and the prospects  for complete integration of these countries in NATO represents  the first step toward the achievement of a greater stability in  the area. But this has to be completed with an initiative of  the Partnership for Development, according to similar concepts  and organized around the same institutions.    [Reporter] After the downfall of totalitarian regimes in  Europe and after the real abolition of the Warsaw Pact, what do  you believe will be the role of NATO in the world and especially  in Europe?    [Iliescu] Just like all the other East European countries,  we are naturally concerned about our security. We regard NATO  as a successful alliance, which has been one of the major  pillars of security in Europe after World War II. What is  really important is the fact that NATO's development should not  be reduced to a simple expansion of its umbrella with a few  hundred kilometers toward east, but NATO should turn into a  factor of security for all countries in this region.    The proposal of the Partnership for Peace shirks the danger  of establishing new and aimless discrimination among the  countries that are candidates to become NATO members and offers  equal chance to all these countries. That is why we joined this  formula of cooperation and were the first country that took this  step. However, our final goal is to become members with full  rights of NATO.    We suggested the Partnership for Development, as a component  of the Partnership for Peace in Europe and the North American  region. The European Union can represent an adequate framework  for the development of this concept. What is important for us  in Europe is to overcome the stage of confrontation and  suspicion and understand that the problems that exist both in  East as well in West Europe can be solved through a broad  opening of gates toward a free circulation of capital, of  knowhow, goods, and people. In the long run, through adequate  administration, the inevitable phenomenon of a united Europe  will lead not to competition among European countries but to  cooperation and greater prosperity for everybody.    [Reporter] In the less than three years since the Soviet  Union ceased to exist, we have witnessed a new situation  prevailing among former Soviet republics, which we can see in  the military, political, and financial areas. Could you please  comment on this?    [Iliescu] The situations differ in each case, according to  the republics that we refer to, in Asia Minor, in the Caucasus,  or the Western republics of the former USSR. However, even  among the countries that belong to this last group, things  differ, whether it is one of the Slavic republics, one of the  Baltic republics, or the republic of Moldova, the only one that  has no common borders with the Russian Federation. But, at the  same time, all these republics have many common elements. First  of all, the high rate of economic integration that prevailed in  the former USSR, made these countries economically dependent on  each other, but mainly on Russia. Therefore, I believe that in  case of most of these countries to expect them to change  overnight is not a realistic demand. On the other hand,  however, it is essential for them to gradually develop their  alternative economic ties, in order to defend their independence  and prevent Moscow having a monopoly.    Second, unfortunately, all political forces in Russia  manifest an increasingly higher degree of nostalgia for its  former imperial role. These very conservative, imperial forces  are the ones that try to keep strategic control over foreign  lands, sometimes even at the cost of war. I am going to give  you a very significant example for Europe, especially for the  situation in the Balkans: what is the role of the 14th  [Russian] Army in Moldova, on the banks of the Dniester River,  at a distance of almost 1,000 kilometers from Russia and on the  territory of a sovereign state, which is not even Russia's  neighbor? The imperial nostalgia affects all the former  republics of the USSR, including Russia. Instead of  concentrating its efforts on economic and social problems,  Russia will waste its efforts in other ways and the result can  be none other than the continuation of the decline in the  standard of living and in political coherence, with the possible  restoration of an anti- democratic regime. Therefore, all of us  are and must be interested in strengthening democratic forces  and in ensuring the success of economic reform in the Russian  Federation.    [Reporter] You will visit Greece next week. What do you  think Greece could do for Romania's integration in Europe,  especially now when Greece holds the presidency of the European  Union and, furthermore, Greece is the first country that  ratified the treaty of Romania's association to the European  Union?    [Iliescu] I believe that the official visit to Greece, which  will take place on 30 and 31 March, represents an extremely  important moment both for our bilateral relations and for  developments in the Balkans.    The excellent Romanian-Greek relations are based on  longstanding traditions and on mutual advantage and support. We  are grateful to Greece for the support granted to Romania to  achieve its strategic objective of integration in the European  Union. As you have mentioned, the Greek Parliament was the  first to ratify the Treaty of Romania's association to the  European Union. We wish to express thanks again for this act  and we sincerely hope that our Greek friends will make all  possible efforts to see to it that the respective treaty is  ratified by all members of the European Union. Likewise, we  appreciate the friendly support granted by Greece for the  admittance of Romania to the Council of Europe. We are  convinced that Greece can make a new and important contribution  in all stages of Romania's integration in Euro-Atlantic  structures. And last but not least, we rely on Greece's  cooperation in promoting certain economic projects in the  Balkans, with the assistance of European financial bodies, for  the benefit of all countries in the region, including Romania  certainly.    [Reporter] How do you view the issue of former Yugoslavia  and the Macedonia issue?    [Iliescu] The emergence of new states on the territory of  the former Yugoslavia is a reality. Most of them have been  accepted in the United Nations and recognized by the  international community. The promotion of normal relations with  these states is an action that makes a contribution to the  efforts to overcome tension and increase confidence and  stability in our region.    The meetings that took place between officials in Romania  and  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, made it possible for  us to find solutions to current aspects of cooperation and the  movement of our citizens. Therefore, a Romanian Trade Office  and Romanian consular office have opened in Skopje.    I am convinced that problems facing Greece and The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be solved by both sides  through dialogue and understanding, because of the need to have  relations of good neighborliness and in the interest of  cooperation, mutual confidence, security, and peace in the  region.</p>

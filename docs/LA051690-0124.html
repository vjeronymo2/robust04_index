			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE ALTERS STRATEGY IN MEDFLY WAR;  </P> <P> ERADICATION: AGRICULTURE OFFICIALS ARE ABOUT TO REPLACE AERIAL MALATHION  SPRAYING WITH THE RELEASE OF MILLIONS OF STERILE FLIES IN NORTHERN ORANGE  COUNTY AND AROUND LOS ANGELES.  </P> <P> Nori Tanaka, a scruffy, gray-haired entomologist, trudges through a converted  tuna-packing shed, flicking flies off his face. It is just before the dawn of  another humid day. In one corner of the ramshackle building, workers grind out  sticky, brown fly food in a cement mixer. In another, fly pupae are sifted  through a makeshift device of cardboard, old broom heads and wire mesh.  </P> <P> Tanaka reeks mightily of sugar, yeast and other odors that come with the job of  mating insects. A cloud of flies surrounds his face. He gazes about the shed,  proudly surveying the noisy scene. A few flies float in his coffee cup. He  drinks it anyway.  </P> <P> "It takes a certain man," Tanaka says, "to be a rearing man. You have to dream  this stuff."  </P> <P> Tanaka is the country's foremost fly "rearing man." His domain is the  California-Hawaii Agriculture Medfly Project -- a facility that throughout this  summer will be the most important outpost in the state's war against the Medfly  in Southern California.  </P> <P> Agriculture officials are about to attempt a tactical shift in their effort to  eradicate the Medfly, replacing aerial malathion spraying with the release of  millions of sterile flies in northern Orange County and around Los Angeles. If  all goes well, and if no fertile flies are found by the end of next month -- a  major qualifier -- the sterile fly releases will replace the controversial  pesticide program over all but about 10% of the large infestation area.  </P> <P> Devised 40 years ago, the simple concept calls for the release of millions of  sterile Medflies in successive waves. The steriles, made so by exposure to  radiation, are intended to numerically overwhelm their sexual competitors in  mating with wild flies. With no offspring from the mating, the wild flies  eventually will die out. Or so the theory goes.  </P> <P> Largely undetectable by the public, harmless to the environment and, as far as  anyone can tell, harmless to people as well, the sterile Medfly approach not  only will eradicate the pest, agricultural officials believe, but will also end  the public outcry over pesticide spraying.  </P> <P> Much of the task hinges on Tanaka, who as operator of two of the three major  sterile breeding facilities here must be able to deliver the irradiated flies  in sufficient numbers to support the campaign. It is a difficult challenge;  shortages of sterile flies, coupled with a rash of Medfly discoveries over the  last few months, already forced the state to retreat from its original May 9  deadline to end spraying.  </P> <P> There are other hazards. Improperly sterilized flies can be explosively  dangerous to the eradication campaign; some officials still maintain that this  occurred with a batch of South American flies brought in to battle the 1981  infestation. There have also been complaints from residents that the clouds of  sterilized flies have an uncanny knack for knocking into freshly painted walls.  </P> <P> And the central question -- do the sterile releases work? -- remains less than  resolved in scientific circles. No scientist can explain precisely how the  approach works, nor can they say with certainty if it will succeed on the scale  to be attempted in Southern California.  </P> <P> "There's a lot we don't know," Tanaka said in an interview last month. "I  believe it works, but there have been so many failures, too."  </P> <P> Tanaka, who has been rearing flies for four decades, is considered the dean of  sterile Medfly production. Most of the techniques and equipment used in the  United States for raising Medflies were developed by Tanaka, a born tinkerer  who constantly prowls the facilities in a grimy T-shirt, checking on food  mixtures or adjusting the temperature in the rearing rooms.  </P> <P> Since the beginning of the year, he has spent almost every waking hour inside  the tuna shed, located in an industrial section of Honolulu, breeding the  millions of flies demanded by California.  </P> <P> "This is the only thing I know," he said. "It's my whole life."  </P> <P> The state's new battle plan is actually a return to a strategy that agriculture  officials originally intended to use last summer, before the Medfly outbreaks  exploded throughout the Southland.  </P> <P> When the first Medfly infestation was detected last July 20 in Elysian Park,  officials believed that the outbreak was an isolated case and could be quietly  eradicated with one or two aerial spraying followed by the release of sterile  flies.  </P> <P> But by December, the Medfly had spread through 200 square miles of Los Angeles  and Orange counties and state officials admitted that had exhausted their  supply of sterile Medflies. Their only alternative was to spray wide sectors of  Southern California with repeated aerial doses of malathion, deploying steriles  in only a few pockets of infestation.  </P> <P> For the last four months, the state has pushed to increase sterile fly  production and is now receiving about 300 million sterile flies a week --  enough to treat about 300 square miles of the infestation.  </P> <P> In Orange County, the sterile releases are to be limited to an  eight-square-mile area of North County that includes parts of Brea, La Habra  and Fullerton. Hit nine times by malathion spraying in the last six months,  that area is scheduled for the release of hundreds of millions of sterile flies  over coming months. The releases started last week.  </P> <P> About 400,000 residents in the county's larger Medfly zone -- a 36-square-mile  zone centered in Garden Grove -- will continue to face spraying. Faced with a  potential shortage of sterile flies, state officials decided to treat Garden  Grove with three more malathion applications -- tonight, May 23 and May 30.  </P> <P> Tanaka's two breeding facilities turn out a weekly supply of about 150 million  sterile Medflies. Another 120 million are arriving from a breeding facility in  Mexico, along with about 40 million from a third rearing facility in Hawaii.  The flies are raised in places where the pest is already established.  </P> <P> The process begins in the breeding facilities where the flies are raised, dyed  (to make sure they are not confused with wild flies), sterilized by exposure to  radiation, and then shipped to California in long, sausage-like bags that each  contain thousands of fly pupae.  </P> <P> The adult flies emerge after arrival and are then scattered by truck or  airplane throughout an infestation zone at a rate of about 1 million every  square mile every week. Prior to the introduction of steriles, an infested area  usually is sprayed once or twice with malathion to reduce the wild fly  population.  </P> <P> The flies are released for three generations -- about three or four months  during the summer.  </P> <P> It's a virtually benign treatment that seems to make scientific sense, although  the record has been less than perfect.  </P> <P> "There's no reason why it can't eradicate an insect," said Edward F. Knipling,  the now-retired originator of the idea. "I don't know how you can miss."  </P> <P> Knipling was a junior entomologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture when  he hatched the idea of using sterile insects as a weapon of eradication in the  1930s. At the time, much of the southern United States was infested with a pest  called the screw-worm fly, whose burrowing larvae killed livestock.  </P> <P> His colleague jeered the idea. Knipling himself thought of it as a "long shot."  </P> <P> It took nearly 15 years before Knipling heard of a way to sterilize flies using  radiation. The series of eradication programs he eventually launched cleansed  the United States and Mexico of the screw-worm pest. The program still  continues today and is now poised to push through Central America.  </P> <P> Not all such eradication programs have been as successful. Consider the massive  Northern California Medlfy infestation in 1980-82, which some officials and  scientists contend was spread through hundreds of square miles by the release  of sterile flies from Peru that may have been improperly sterilized.  </P> <P> Some scientists say generally that California has never had much luck in using  sterile techniques against the Medfly. James R. Carey, a UC Davis entomologist  and one of five scientific advisers in the state's eradication campaign, said  sterile Medflies have been released in this state eight out of the last 15  years and yet infestations continue to crop up, sometimes in the same place  over and over again.  </P> <P> Carey and other scientists agree that the technique has succeeded each time in  substantially reducing the Medfly population but, they ask, did it wipe out  every last vestige of the pest?  </P> <P> "It's a very good tool for suppression of a population. The evidence of that is  clear," said Ronald Prokopy, an entomologist at the University of Massachusetts  and an expert on the Medfly. "But eradication, that is a different story. I  have no idea."  </P> <P> Little is known about how the technique actually works. For example, scientists  are not certain about such fundamental questions as whether it is the sterile  male flies, sterile females, or both, that break the reproduction cycle.  </P> <P> Prokopy, who was chairman of the state's science advisory panel in the  eradication of the apple maggot in the early 1980s, said scientists have only  begun to understand how sterile flies act in the wild. What they have seen is  not entirely encouraging.  </P> <P> To begin with, he said, the sterile flies appear to be less competitive than  wild flies, partly because the sterilization process itself slightly weakens  them. On top of that, Prokopy said, the artificial environment of the breeding  labs seems to produce domesticated weaklings.  </P> <P> "They're different, that's a fact," Prokopy said. "They haven't forgotten how  to do things, they just don't do them as well. It's like chickens, you put them  in the wild and they'll get eaten."  </P> <P> Kenneth Kaneshiro, director of the Hawaiian Evolutionary Biology Program at the  University of Hawaii and a Medfly expert, agreed, saying that flies fall into  two general categories: duds and studs. Sterile flies are generally duds.  </P> <P> In the wild, he said, lab-reared flies are lousy at performing their species'  complex mating rituals, are  </P> <P> not good at defending their territory, and they are downright miserable at  finding mates. "Sexually inadequate," Kaneshiro said.  </P> <P> The qualities of sterile flies aside, there are constant problems in rearing  them in the huge quantities needed for an eradication program.  </P> <P> When state Department of Food and Agriculture Director Henry J. Voss announced  in March his decision to replace spraying with sterile fly releases, a key to  his plan was receiving millions of flies from a just-completed U.S. Department  of Agriculture facility in Waimanalo, Hawaii.  </P> <P> The $7-million Waimanalo facility, the one Hawaiian facility not run by Tanaka,  is a modern, concrete-and-glass building packed with the latest high-tech  fly-rearing equipment. Its insides bristle in shades of stainless steel and  plastic. It was designed to produce up to 500 million sterile flies a week. So  far, it has been lumbering along at a pace of 40 million a week.  </P> <P> The problems at the facility are legion. The heating system can't keep the  building hot enough. The humidity is not quite correct. The plant has become  infested with another type of fly that eats the Medflies' food.  </P> <P> There are dozens of variables in the touchy rearing process that might be off  and no one is certain which are to blame. Is it the diet? Is it the humidity?  Maybe it's the way the trays of larvae are stacked, which could hamper air  circulation?  </P> <P> "Right now, it's not the best, but it's the best we can do," said Glenn L.  Hinsdale, facility director.  </P> <P> The problems in many ways are inherent to starting a large facility such as  Waimanalo. "It's still an art," said Roy Cunningham, a U.S. Department of  Agriculture entomologist and the chairman of the state's Medfly Science  Advisory Panel. "They're trying to make it a science, and they still have a  long way to go."  </P> <P> Even Tanaka has experienced problems with his far simpler operation. He once  received a bad shipment of wheat, used for fly food. The wheat was contaminated  with a small amount of malathion -- just enough to wipe out an entire batch of  flies. In the current push to increase shipments to California, he's had  workers spill jugs of fly eggs and barrels of larvae.  </P> <P> Tanaka said the problems at his facilities and Waimanalo are to be expected and  eventually will be ironed out.  </P> <P> Agricultural officials believe that when the Waimanalo plant reaches full  potential, Southern California may never have to face the repeated aerial  malathion assaults that have inflamed the region.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the political and economic stakes riding on the success of the  sterile fly technique are high. The state has only two weapons -- sterile flies  and malathion -- to fight the Medfly, a voracious pest that could do  substantial damage if it reached California's agricultural regions, producers  of over half the nation's fresh fruit and vegetables.  </P> <P> Voss said in an interview that repeated malathion spraying is becoming  unacceptable because of the intense public opposition. Thus, sterile flies  offer the only feasible long-term strategy.  </P> <P> "The whole desire of society is to have less amounts of pesticide used," Voss  said. "It's very likely even one spray may become unacceptable. In the long  term we have to move away from where we are."  </P> <P> But he said no matter how well the state plans for the future, there are no  guarantees when it comes to dealing with the unpredictable Medfly.  </P> <P> The Medfly stunned officials last winter when the infestation spread like  wildfire throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties. And there is always the  grim possibility that another infestation the size of the 1,300-square-mile  Northern California outbreak of 1980-82 could hit again and throw their plans  to the wind.  </P> <P> "I think we are far better prepared today," Voss said in a recent interview.  "But how prepared is prepared?"  </P> <P> CANDIDATES ON SPRAYING -- Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls Dianne Feinstein  and John Van de Kamp call for an end to spraying. A22  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS ON SPRAYING -- A bitterly divided Board of Supervisors voted  Tuesday to extend Orange County's Medfly emergency. B1  </P> <P> MEDFLY SPARYING MAP: B2  </P></p>

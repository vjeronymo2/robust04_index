			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ... AND FOR ALL ANGELENOS, AS WELL;  </P> <P> WHY THE CITY COUNCIL SHOULD APPROVE BRADLEY'S MANDATORY CONSERVATION PLAN  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley today fires the toughest salvo yet in his campaign to make  Angelenos more efficient consumers of water.  </P> <P> Though the City Council members who will consider the mayor's proposal this  week seem as ambivalent as Los Angeles consumers about the complex plan, the  lawmakers do seem to be in general agreement that seemingly hard measures taken  now will pay off many-fold in the months and years to come.  </P> <P> Bradley proposes a mandatory 10%, across-the-board reduction in water  consumption by residential and industrial customers alike. The proposal, if  adopted, will make Los Angeles a national leader in public water conservation.  </P> <P> Under the plan, every municipal water customer must reduce consumption to 90%  of the amount the household used in 1986. Violators first face warnings and,  after subsequent abuses, stiff fines. In effect, customers flagged as wasteful  will pay the true cost of the scarce resource.  </P> <P> The plan incorporates opportunities for appeals and exempts  already-conscientious consumers who had the foresight to conserve in or before  1986. A Department of Water and Power office will analyze data on each home to  determine whether a customer already is conserving. Another panel appointed by  the City Council will review records of cases in which homeowners feel DWP  issued an unfair finding.  </P> <P> Moreover, consumers using less than nine billing units of water -- a single  adult with no yard, for example -- will automatically be exempt from the  compulsory cutback.  </P> <P> How landlords and tenants will share the burden of conservation in multifamily  dwellings is a bone of contention. Mayor Bradley favors charging 75% of any  needed fines to landlords and the remainder to tenants. Landlords, he reasons,  should enforce cutbacks and install conservation devices.  </P> <P> Mandatory is a fearsome buzzword in a society that values convenience  practically above all. But water conservation is an issue in which the public  welfare is at stake. The council should endorse the mayor's proposal and  enthusiastically help keep the issue before the general public.  </P> <P> Water cannot be considered an inexhaustible resource. Although rain may fall in  torrents tomorrow, or next year, such factors as Mother Nature's fickle nature,  Southern California's population growth and even how well the economy fares all  conspire to soak up every drop of water in the state: None of it can prudently  be called "extra."  </P></p>

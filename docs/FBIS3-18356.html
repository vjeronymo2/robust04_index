			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ferdinando Adornato, Italian Democratic </F> Alliance, AD, leader, by Sebastiano Messina in Rome on 24  February: "Adornato: `Bertinotti Betraying Alliance'"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Messina] Mr. Adornato,  what on earth is happening to the progressive alliance's  "wonderful war machine?" What are we to believe -- the strict  liberal recommendations of [Finance Minister Vincenzo] Visco and  [Budget Minister Luigi] Spaventa, or the threatening  proclamations of [Communist Renewal leader Fausto] Bertinotti  for a tax on treasury bills, his praise for the strikes that  have brought railroad stations to a standstill, and his warnings  about a reappraisal of NATO?    [Adornato] I want to say something to Bertinotti right away:  Let us not play games, please. There is something extremely  serious at stake here, namely, the country's government for the  next five years. The fact is that this election campaign is not  as the voters expected.    [Messina] Whose fault is it?    [Adornato] It is everyone's fault. The law permitted the  creation of two broad and consistent progressive alignments  against the conservatives, but instead the parties -- all of  them -- have pursued the rationale of the proportional system.  They have come together to win more votes, but the alignments  do not coincide on matters of policy. The Right is forming  obscure, agreements with [Northern League leader Umberto] Bossi  who cannot tolerate [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi,  [Italian Social Movement leader Gianfranco] Fini who cannot  tolerate Bossi, Bossi who cannot tolerate Fini, and Berlusconi  who says: Maybe it would have been better for me to stand alone.    [Messina]It seems to me that the progressive front has some  minor problems, too....    [Adornato] Who is denying it? The difference with respect to  the Right is that everything happens out in the open, but even  among us there is not consistency between policies and  alignments.    [Messina] But you of the Democratic Alliance [AD] also  agreed  to establish the alliance of progressive forces, and you too  were at the negotiations when its establishment was announced,  were you not?    [Adornato] Well, actually we proposed something different.  We said "no" to Communist Renewal. But we of the AD, who are  the youngest of all and must therefore show the others the  respect due to our elders, were told that we could not lay down  the law. And indeed, we did not. We were told that we were  imposing ideological vetoes. But that was no veto; it was a  prediction that things would turn out as indeed they have.    [Messina] Let us be honest: You progressive forces set off  without properly broaching the issue of the government program.  You evaded the obstacle, and now you are paying for that  mistake.    [Adornato] No, the mistake was to have formed an alliance  that lacked consistency between policies and alignments.  Communist Renewal, by its own legitimate choice, has no program  for the government of this country. Bertinotti's continual  harangues show that what Communist Renewal wants is not to  participate in the government but to carve out a proportional  opposition space for itself.    [Messina] But could you not have promptly resolved the  problems of the strikes, treasury bills, NATO, and all the rest,  instead of allowing these bombshells to explode in the very  midst of the election campaign?    [Adornato] Let us make one thing clear: Communist Renewal is  a member of an electoral accord, not of a government agreement.  Only the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], the AD, and the  Social Christians have discussed and presented a government  program. Certainly, the inconsistency remains. But we issued a  warning in plenty of time. And now it is sad to witness the  dishonest use that Communist Renewal is making of this election  campaign.    [Messina] Why do you talk in terms of dishonesty? If  Bertinotti has not adhered to your government program, he can  say whatever he likes about treasury bills, can he not?    [Adornato] Yes, but instead of facilitating a victory by the  alliance of which he is a member, he is concerned only with  gathering votes for his own party in the proportional vote.  This, to the detriment of everyone else. Moreover, Bertinotti  is also betraying the sense of responsibility toward the country  that was demanded of the old irresponsible political class.  Because, if you are a responsible person, you cannot go back to  electrification plus the soviets [paraphrase of Lenin's  definition of communism]. Of course, he is not the main person  to betray this sense of responsibility. The main one is  Berlusconi.    [Messina] Does Berlusconi beat Bertinotti?    [Adornato] Yes, because yet again he is asking the voters  for  a blank cheque. If someone smiles and says, "When I come to  power I will perform the Italian miracle," he is insulting the  Italian people. It is not enough to promise to reduce taxes in  order then to be able to do so and to actually do so. But if we  want to fall yet again into the hands of someone who stands up  and makes such promises, this kind of [shipping magnate] Achille  Lauro of television, then of course we are free to do so.    [Messina] Let us return to the progressive alignment and its  problems. If you perceived this rift on the Left in good time,  why did you not stand up and leave?    [Adornato] For the simple reason that a victory by the Right  would be a victory for irresponsibility and destabilization.  Berlusconi wants a market with no rules. As Spaventa said, if  hitherto politics has managed business, we will have business  managing politics. This is why we stayed on, to combat this  Right and to defend the line of reform represented by Ciampi.  We stayed on, even though we do not like the progressive  alignment, because the real choice on 27 March will be between  Ciampi and Berlusconi.    [Messina] What will happen if the progressive alignment  needs  Communist Renewal's parliamentarians in order to govern? Will  it request them or reject them?    [Adornato] I cannot answer that. We will have to see what  the election results are. My hope is that the progressive  alignment will win and that this alignment can bring about a  democratic alliance government -- that is, one with the  Christian Democrats, the PDS, and the Social Christians. Of  course, the endless nonsense that Bertinotti talks confirms the  fact that Communist Renewal has no intention of broaching the  problems of a modern and complex society, and it is rightly  aiming to go into opposition. And I say that this is as it  should be.    [Messina] Mr. Adornato, have you ever thought that in your  own single-candidate constituency Communist Renewal's voters  might be tempted not to vote for you?    [Adornato] That may be so. But my impression is that  Italians, including those who may incline toward Communist  Renewal, are tired of following theories that would confine them  to the opposition for another 40 years.    [Messina] What would you do if Bertinotti and [Italian  Popular Party, PPI, deputy] Mattarella were competing in your  constituency? Who would you vote for?    [Adornato] Unfortunately, I will not, we will not, have this  choice. The real choice will be between the progressive forces  and Berlusconi's Right.    [Messina] A few days ago a left-wing reader responded to the  "manifesto" with a letter full of anger and disappointment:  "Dear progressive forces, you have lost my vote." Did you read  it?    [Adornato] Yes, and I identify closely with that citizen's  feelings. The candidates should have been chosen differently,  by boldly establishing a single democratic party of the  reformists and leaving the task of democratically selecting the  candidates for the runoff elections. However, I would like to  ask that reader to ponder the fact that in the election we will  have to choose between Ciampi and Berlusconi, and that every  vote less for the progressive forces will be one vote more for  our adversaries.    [Messina] [newspaper editor] Montanelli used to say, hold  your nose and vote DC [Christian Democratic Party].    [Adornato] Just a minute: I would never ask anyone to hold  their nose. I am saying: Open your eyes and vote for us.</p>

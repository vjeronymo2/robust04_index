			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF  </P> <P> Children's books are of course available all year round, but they seem a  particularly enticing commodity around the holidays. And not only for children,  who treasure their books in a way that often fades with age, but also for  moonlighting adults, who can appreciate a level of sophistication in art and  design that makes these books the biggest bargains on the publishing scene. For  those who've waited till now to make their selections, here is a last-minute  look at some of the best this season has to offer.  </P> <P> HAIL TO MAIL by Samuel Marshak (Henry Holt: $14.95). Newly translated by  Richard Pevear, this delightful tale by Russian children's poet Marshak follows  a particularly determined certified letter as it follows world traveler John  Peck from New York to Boise, Switzerland and Brazil before (not to give away  the ending) it finally catchs up to Mr. Peck back in old New York. Unafraid to  rhyme "yesterday" with "Schenectady," Hail to Mail is particularly well-served  by the sophisticated primitivism of Vladimir Radunsky's illustrations.  </P> <P> LITTLE LOU by Jean Claverie (Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang: $14.95). Dedicated to  Memphis Slim, the piano great who was a longtime fixture on the Paris jazz  scene, this playfully illustrated work by Frenchman Jean Claverie takes us into  the Depression-era world of its title character, a small boy who learns about  Bach and Mozart at piano lessons but finds he has the blues in his soul. A  gangster attack on a local club add a little excitement to the proceedings and  give Little Lou his big break.  </P> <P> A CHRISTMAS CAROL by Charles Dickens (Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang: $25; 152  pp.). and THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW by Washington Irving (Stewart, Tabori and  Chang: $25; 63 pp.). While it is left to each generation to rediscover the  classics of children's literature, the virtue of these two new editions  (published in conjunction with Creative Education Inc. of Mankato, Minnesota)  is that the illustrations are so rich they immediately feel timeless. Roberto  Innocenti, a past winner of the Bratislava Golden Apple, among other awards,  brings a vivid sense of detail to the Dickensian panoply of 19th-Century  London, capturing its poverty as well as its exuberance. Gary Kelley, by  contrast, works in broader strokes as recalls the moodiness of the autumnal  world of New York's Hudson River Valley.  </P> <P> DINOSAUR DREAM by Dennis Nolan (Macmillan: $13.95). Children and dinosaurs have  been an item for generations, and though "Dinosaur Dreams" is hardly the first  book to take advantage of that phenomenon, it is one of the most charming. When  a baby brontosaurus appears outside Wilbur's window, the young lad has no  choice but to walk the creature back through several strata of time until he  meets up with the toddler's parents deep in the Jurassic age. If  author/illustrator Nolan's ideas are not brand spanking new, his breathtaking  illustrations more than make up for it.  </P> <P> A 19TH CENTURY RAILWAY STATION by Fiona MacDonald, illustrated by John James  (Peter Bedrick Books: $16.95; 48 pp.; ages 10 and up). Just as Ninja Turtles  have not quite replaced dinosaurs, space ships have not quite replaced trains  in the child's imagination. This book, a British import, carries all the  excitement of a visit to an old-fashioned railway station. With vivid  description and illustration (the cutaway drawings are unusually clear here),  the book covers everything from engine models and switching layouts to  construction of sleeper chairs and modern uses for the old station buildings.  </P> <P> A FLOWER GROWS by Ken Robbins (Dial Books: 12.95; all ages). This picture book  combines the magic of storytelling with the precision of science instruction.  Ken Robbins photographed the stages of development of an amaryllis, a  breathtaking flower whose fast-growing stalk produces a ring of enormous  trumpet-shaped flowers. Robbins' text explains how the parts of the flower  unfold, how the plant goes into hibernation, and how it stores nourishment for  its next flowering. Rather than use straighforward color photographs, Robbins  shoots in black and white and hand-tints the pictures; this illustration  technique lends his pictures a luminous beauty that suits the poetry of the  story.  </P> <P> MY GRANDMOTHER'S STORIES: A Collection of Jewish Folk Tales by Adele Geras,  illustrated by Jael Jordan (Alfred A. Knopf: $17.95; 96 pp.; all ages). Adele  Geras tells her tales through the eyes of a little girl visiting her  grandmother. As she discovers how her grandmother does things, she learns of  the clever villagers who outfoxed the Czar and the Wise Elders of Chelm who  pondered their edicts long and hard, as well as her grandmother's own mother,  the Bobbeh. Jael Jordan's illustrations further tie together the worlds of the  Old Country and the New -- a pretty package, but one word of caution: This  collection is not for those who like their folk tales straight up, for the  questioning between the little girl and her grandmother will make the  connection between children and their heritage too didactically for some  tastes.  </P> <P> THE GLORIOUS IMPOSSIBLE by Madeleine L'Engle (Simon &amp; Schuster Books for  Young Readers: $19.95; all ages). Madeleine L'Engle retells the life of Jesus  to the accompaniment of illustrations from Giotto's early 14th-Century frescoes  in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua, Italy. The heart of her celebration of the  Christmas story lies in the title: Everything about Christ's birth is  impossible, and yet it happened -- and her text sings "Glory!" The unschooled  visitor who enters an Italian church is often hard-pressed to follow the story  told on the walls, but the beauty of this book is how clearly Giotto's  magnificent panels tell the story when arranged with the parts of the tale.

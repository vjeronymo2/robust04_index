Suggestions in a recent television interview that he would still be chancellor after the year 2000, when he will be 70, he described as 'weird'. But he still gave nothing away. Appearing at the last major press conference of his election campaign before the poll on October 16, he stressed his determination to see his two great projects accomplished -German unification and European unification. The latter meant that the forthcoming inter-governmental conference of EU member states, in 1996, must make further big strides towards integration, including a significant boost in the role of the European parliament. 'This conference must bring us an important step further,' he said. As for the enlargement of the EU, he called for a firm timetable to be set for the admission of the new democracies of central and eastern Europe.

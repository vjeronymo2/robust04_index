			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Abdallah al-Franji, PLO </F> representative in Bonn, by Vera Szoelloesi; place not given --  live]    [Text] [Szoelloesi] I now welcome 'Abdallah al-Franji,  PLO representative in Germany, on the telephone. Good morning.    [Al-Franji] Good morning.    [Szoelloesi] Mr. Al-Franji, have Israel and the PLO overcome  the greatest obstacle to the Gaza-Jericho agreement? Can you  tell us when Rabin and 'Arafat will sign it?    [Al-Franji] I think that there is no other possibility than  to sign it soon because this state of affairs, that is, the  present state of affairs, will result in major tensions and  certain actions here and there that might stop this peace  process. Therefore, it is time for both sides, that is, us, the  PLO, and Israel, to sign it soon. That is to say, I expect that  we will be through with everything before 13 April.    [Szoelloesi] That is to say, even before 13 April?    [Al-Franji] This is my hope and my estimate. I hope that I  will be right.    [Szoelloesi] Yesterday it was said -- the number of  Palestinian policemen who might be deployed was controversial --  that 9,000 policemen for Gaza and Jericho were agreed upon. Can  you confirm this figure?    [Al-Franji] I think this figure is correct. I think that  the number of policemen that the Israelis have accepted is about  8,500 to 9,000. We need so many policemen now in the Gaza Strip  and Jericho because we can only have this situation under  control with a strong police troop and because security will  only be guaranteed for all people living there if we see to it.  There is a vacuum and certain problems that have developed in  these days. One can only have this under control if one is  prepared for it.    [Szoelloesi] You are saying that a strong police would be  needed in these days, which indicates that the PLO is aware that  there are also many radical forces on the Palestinians' side and  the whole of the society has also got used to something like  violence. What will happen if a Palestinian police take action  against Palestinians?    [Al-Franji] We are planning to refrain from violence against  our people. This would be the most stupid thing that we could  do. We simply have to lead the Palestinian society into a  democratic process, so that the Palestinians can somehow cope  with a dialogue between themselves alone. If we use force  against each other, this will mean that we have peace with the  Israelis, while, on the other hand, we have a situation of  violence with the Palestinians. This is not the objective of  the Palestinians and the PLO. We would like to develop a  democratic society, but, on the other hand, order also has to be  established in these days. It is not easy to establish order in  a people who have lived under an occupation regime for, let us  say, 27 years.    [Szoelloesi] But is your answer not also wishful thinking?  I mean that this is a long-term objective. All agree on it.  However, in the beginning the society will be as it is and the  people will be as they are. The police will be confronted with  the question of how to establish order.    [Al-Franji] Well, I think -- first of all, this is not  wishful thinking -- that the Palestinians among themselves have  been very tolerant so far. The Palestinians outside have  practiced democracy for many years, for 30 years. The  Palestinians in the occupied territories will not regard the PLO  and the Palestinian policemen there as occupation forces.  Therefore, there is a great difference between Palestinian  policemen and the Israeli Army units. The Palestinians who live  there are waiting for their freedom. Therefore, only minorities  will carry out violent actions. This is the reason we have to  see to it that such violent acts cannot be repeated and that  they are not so frequent. However, the Palestinian people will  welcome it and you will see that the Palestinians will be very  enthusiastic when the Israeli Army leaves and, second, when the  PLO comes.    [Szoelloesi] For a similar reason, that is, in order to  prevent a split of the Palestinian people, the PLO also insists  that Israel should not only release PLO adherents who are in  Israeli prisons, but also Hamas adherents. How far have the  negotiations progressed in this respect?    [Al-Franji] First of all, this is a very clever attitude of  the PLO, so that the Palestinian society is not divided.  Second, I think that the Israelis will also have to understand  that they cannot achieve peace with the Palestinians if they  distinguish between them -- that is, these Palestinians are  good, those Palestinians are not good. Hamas has lived in a  state of war with Israel for 5 or 6 years, since the  establishment of this organization. The PLO has also lived in a  state of war with the Israelis for 30 years. If they strive for  peace now, they have to win all Palestinians for this peace.  Therefore, it is very clever if the Israelis accept the  Palestinians' position and also release the imprisoned Hamas  members.    [Szoelloesi] What will happen if Israel does not do this?    [Al-Franji] I hope that they will do it. What will happen?  This will, of course, be negative. It will also have a negative  influence on the future development. We would simply like to  have a certain harmony between all Palestinian groups when we  come. When we say that we are striving for a democratic  Palestinian society, we mean it and we also do not want to  interfere in the Israelis' affairs. The Israelis also have to  learn that, according to the treaty that we signed, the  Palestinians are a partner with equal rights. That is to say,  we, not the Israelis, are responsible for us and for our society.    [Szoelloesi] Why has the PLO not yet dispatched a vanguard  of Palestinian policemen to the Gaza Strip and Jericho? After  all, the Israelis have prepared their withdrawal and are now  really beginning to withdraw. Would it not be time now to send  someone there as early as now and not to wait any longer? The  dispatch was again postponed to Thursday, as I believe.    [Al-Franji] Well, I think that one point is also that the  Israelis accepted 100 people. This number is not sufficient  because here and there, on the Palestinians' side, but also on  the Israelis' side, the people who want to disturb this process  might take action against these 100 people, who are not armed.  If they simply go there without protection -- a pistol is not a  weapon -- another action might take place. This would expose  the Palestinian authority to ridicule. We do not want this.  When we get there, we want this troop to be able to defend  itself at least against anybody who plans to disturb this peace  process. Therefore, we are trying to convince the Israelis that  they should not insist on these small matters. I hope that they  will accept it. Some Israelis, above all the Israeli Army, are  not yet used to treating the Palestinians as partners with equal  rights.    [Szoelloesi] Thank you very much, Mr. 'Abdallah al-Franji,  PLO representative in Germany.</p>

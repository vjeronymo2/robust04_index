			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Abbey National If the value of estate agents is a reflection of investing institutions' view of the housing market, yesterday's disposal by Abbey National is depressing news. Even allowing that the purchasers are getting a discount for buying the whole Cornerstone chain, an average price per office of Pounds 23,000 is well below that achieved by Prudential following its decision to divest in 1990. Abbey was not alone in paying 10 times more per office in the 1980s. That will be of scant consolation to shareholders now faced with another Pounds 30m writedown to add to the Pounds 228m of losses already announced. Since estate agencies have proved to be unreliable sales outlets for mortgage lenders or life insurers, it is hard to quibble with Abbey's decision to sell. Provident Life will be hoping for better luck with a tied agency agreement with the new owners in return for acquisition finance. In theory, that should yield the same flow of life insurance business without the capital risk while giving entrepreneurial managers their head. Legal &amp; General is aiming for similar results through franchising. Even as housing market turnover recovers, though, much depends on whether sales of endowment mortgages are held back by the combination of public suspicion and new commission disclosure requirements. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's decision to stop selling endowments underlined that the economics are already finely balanced for some mortgage lenders. Without a good flow of business from that direction, the already tattered argument for marrying long-term savings and estate agency will be impossible to sustain.</p>

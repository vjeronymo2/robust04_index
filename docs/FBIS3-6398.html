			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 16 March  carry articles and editorials on the International Atomic Energy  Agency's (IAEA) recent inspections of North Korean nuclear  facilities.    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 a 700-word  editorial entitled "North Korea's Hindrance During the Nuclear  Inspection." The editorial says: If the IAEA's judgment that its  current inspection activities were "not sufficient" due to North  Korea's hindrance turns out to be true, and if the alleged  report that North Korea refused the IAEA inspection team access  to the radiochemical laboratory is true, and that some seals in  the laboratory were found to be destroyed is true this is "a  grave problem" and shows that there is a possibility that North  Korea might have converted its nuclear materials for military  purposes.    The editorial also analyzes that the reasons for North  Korea's acceptance of the IAEA's inspection this time were to  avoid sanctions by the UN Security Council and to use its  nuclear card in its diplomatic bargaining with the United States  by turning the issue of inspecting two undeclared sites over to  the U.S.-DPRK high-level talks. The editorial then urges North  Korea to show sincerity in the on-going North-South level  contact for the exchange of top- level special envoys, stressing  the need for the IAEA to refer the North Korean nuclear issue to  the UN Security Council and for the governments of the ROK and  the United States to resume the Team Spirit exercise if North  Korea fails to carry out the preconditions that the two  government have put forth. The editorial concludes by saying  that in view of North Korea's recent attitude, it is almost  impossible to expect momentous changes in its attitude.    Additionally, SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 4 a 1,000-word  article by reporter Yang Sung-hyon analyzing the results of the  just ended IAEA inspection. The article notes the ROK Government  assessment of the IAEA's inspection, quoting a high-ranking  government official as saying: "the IAEA's inspection seems to  be satisfactory from a quantitative viewpoint," but it "does not  seem to be satisfactory from a qualitative viewpoint." However,  the article notes the IAEA inspection team's failure to collect  sample materials from the radiochemical laboratory as well as  IAEA and U.S. Government officials' negative assessments of the  inspection results.    Noting that a final report on the inspection results will be  released three to four weeks from now, the article says that if  the continuity of safeguards is confirmed in the report or if  North Korea's conversion of nuclear materials to military  purposes is discovered, a special IAEA Board of Governors  meeting will be automatically held regardless of whether or not  the ROK and U.S. Governments want and, accordingly, the issue of  imposing sanctions against North Korea will be discussed at the  UN Security Council.    In conclusion, the article analyzes that the IAEA will  conclude the current inspection at the present stage because it  does not want the third round of the U.S.-DPRK talks to be  broken up and that it will, accordingly, assume the attitude  that the North Korean nuclear issue should be settled at the  U.S.-North Korean talks.    The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 5 a 1,200-word  article on the prospects of the nuclear issue after the North  Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's warning that North Korea may  stop cooperating with IAEA inspections.    The article reports that the government analyzes that North  Korea's response is to utter in advance that it "could not keep  the promise made in the (25 February) agreement because the  United States is demanding the exchange of special envoys which  is not in the agreement."    The article speculates that because there can be no  flexibility in the policy to have the special envoy exchange  first despite North Korea's warning, the nuclear issue has to go  back to the point before the 25 February agreement, and North  Korea will have to try to negotiate with the United States again  for the third round of talks and the ROK and the United States  will have to discuss anew international sanctions on North Korea.    The article adds, however, that time is not on North Korea's  side this time because the IAEA will hurry to have a special  Board of Governors meeting and speed up discussions on referring  the issue to the United Nations.    The article reports a "positive reverse" is also possible if  North Korea agrees to postpone the third-round U.S.-North Korea  talks. The article continues that some ROK and U.S.  commentators expect the third-round talks in mid-April because  it will be difficult for North Korea to ignore the benefit from  extending a one-time invitation to the ROK special envoy to  Pyongyang.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an  800-word editorial entitled "Urging a Firm Stance on North  Korea's Nuclear Card." Referring to the "unsuccessful" IAEA  inspections, the editorial warns that North Korea is only  hurrying itself to become an international orphan saying that  "having the seals broken is no different from asking the nuclear  issue to be referred to the UN Security Council."    The editorial also warns that it is a mistake if North Korea  thinks it is better to deal with the United Nations than the  IAEA.    The editorial points out ROK "mistakes of appeasement" and  misinterpreting the "full-scope inspection" by which North Korea  meant to open seven declared facilities, not unlimited  inspections on all of its nuclear facilities.    The editorial urges both U.S. and ROK Governments to take a  firm and resolute stance on the nuclear issue by announcing the  resumption of the Team Spirit exercise.</p>

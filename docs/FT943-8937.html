			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Bosnian accord on snipers Bosnia's rival Serbs and Moslems yesterday signed a UN-brokered accord to halt sniping in Sarajevo within 24 hours and promised to patrol high-risk areas with UN peacekeepers to stop disobedient marksmen. 'The sides shall undertake within 24 hours to issue publicly orders which explicitly forbid sniping activities against military personnel, civilians and UN personnel in the Sarajevo region,' the agreement said. The accord was signed by Serb and Moslem political, military and police commanders and UN military chiefs. In Paris, French Defence Minister Francois Leotard said he had warned Washington that France and other European countries would pull peacekeeping troops out of former Yugoslavia if the Bosnian arms embargo is lifted.

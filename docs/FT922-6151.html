			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Price war checks advance at Blacks CUT-THROAT competition helped dampen the profits advance at Blacks Leisure, the camping goods and sportswear company, which yesterday announced a Pounds 200,000 rise to Pounds 3.7m for the year to February 29, on sales 18 per cent higher at Pounds 70.4m. Mr Simon Bentley, chairman and chief executive, said one of the group's star performers of 1991 - the distribution of LA Gear goods - had suffered from US wholesalers dumping stock at much reduced prices in the UK. Retail profits had also declined in the face of 'one of the severest recessions this century' and price-cutting promotions from competitors. Trading remained tough in the first half of the current year, Mr Bentley said. 'There has been no sign of an improvement.' However, some of the adverse conditions had been eliminated - such as the dumping practice which had cost the company at least 30 per cent of LA Gear sales. The distribution operation improved overall profits before interest and tax by 14 per cent to Pounds 4m, largely on the back of a record rise in the sale of Fila brand goods. The figures included a marginal contribution from Quaser, the sports goods company acquired for Pounds 1.9m in shares in January. The fashion and textiles division, now part of distribution, incurred a 'small loss' for the year. Mr Bentley said Blacks' longer-term plans included selling this business which supplies retailers such as Burton and Etam. The retail operation, which sells camping and sporting goods, increased outlets by nine to 69, and consumed Pounds 3m of the group's Pounds 3.7m capital expenditure. Profits before interest and tax tumbled from Pounds 3m to Pounds 1.93m as margins came under pressure from competitive price-cutting. The Pounds 4.7m rights issue in June, which helped cut debt from Pounds 10m to Pounds 5.8m by the year-end, resulted in lower earnings per share of 9.82p (11.6p). The final dividend is maintained at 2.25p, resulting in a 10 per cent rise for the year to 3.35p. COMMENT Simon Bentley is determined to prove that Blacks' chequered past is dead and gone. Organic growth and development of existing brands is the key, he says, so Blacks does not expect to open retail stores this year. He also emphasises that Blacks now has an in-house brand in Quaser, endorsed by Gary Lineker. That endorsement could give a hefty boost this summer, if the football hero scores just two more goals. That would make him England's highest scoring player and kick into action a massive advertising campaign for the brand. Such a windfall might offset gloomy noises about current trading and fears that Blacks may lose its licence to distribute LA Gear when it expires in 1994. Nevertheless, it might be better to wait for the outcome of the important summer months before acting. House brokers are forecasting flat profits of Pounds 3.75m, with a prospective p/e of 10.</p>

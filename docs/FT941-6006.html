			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Union Pacific buys more oil and gas assets Union Pacific, the US railroad and resources group, has agreed to pay Dollars 819m for the oil and gas interests of Cypress Amax, the mining company formed by a merger late last year, writes Richard Waters. Union said it had already reached agreement to sell on some assets for Dollars 94.5m, retaining mainly gas producing, gathering and processing assets in Texas and Louisiana. The disposal signals Cypress Amax's intention to concentrate on its mining activities. It brings Union Pacific proven gas reserves to 550bn cubic feet, adding about 20 per cent to its existing reserves. The assets also include 550 miles of gathering lines and three gas processing plants.</p>

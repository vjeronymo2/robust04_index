			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Domestic &amp; Gen up 28% DOMESTIC &amp; General Group, the appliance breakdown insurer, lifted profits by 28 per cent, from Pounds 2.13m to Pounds 2.73m pre-tax, in the half-year to December 31. The lack of any upturn in retail sales of electrical appliances resulted in growth of new business premiums slowing. However, Mr Martin Copley, chairman, said increased direct mailing activity had led to improved numbers of annual contracts being sold over the past two years and that this had led to higher levels of renewal premiums. 'Margins have improved, with expenses growing at a slower rate than written premiums,' he added. Gross premium income amounted to Pounds 21.4m - an improvement of 36 per cent - while investment income rose some 17 per cent to to Pounds 2.63m. Strict claims controls maintained loss ratios at 'acceptable levels'. Earnings per share rose almost 35 per cent to 26.74p (19.85p). The interim dividend goes up by 1.5p to 6p.</p>

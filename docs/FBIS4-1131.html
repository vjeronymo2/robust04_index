			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with State President F.W. de Klerk by Shiphiwo </F> Mogoda; place and date not given--recorded]    [Text] Our series of interviews with top political party  leaders continues today with the discussion with the state  president and leader of the National Party [NP], F.W. de Klerk.  Shiphiwo Mogoda asked Mr. De Klerk for his thoughts on the  televised debate which was held last week?    [Begin recording] [De Klerk] I feel that overall the debate  was good for South Africa. It had two sides; the one side was  the party political side, and I feel that the National Party's  cause has firstly not been harmed by the debate, I think it has  been advanced by the debate. But it had another side, which was  also important, and that is that the two leaders of the two  biggest parties in South Africa were seen by all South Africans  and the whole world as being able to debate in a civilized  manner, and when it came to the interests of the country, that  they will be capable of rising above their differences and  working together in a government of national unity in the best  interests of all the people.    [Mogoda] Mr. President, what has caused you to cry, or let  me  put is this way, to laugh, if necessary, in all these things  that have happened during your rule?    [De Klerk] What makes me happy, what makes me buoyant, is my  confidence in the future, is the achievement of what I have set  out to achieve -- the achievement of free and fair elections for  all South Africans, the achievement of a new South Africa being  born, which I worked for from the very moment when I was elected  as leader of the National Party. I am thankful that I was able  -- and I am not saying this in a holier than thou attitude -- to  really keep all the promises that I made. Originally people  said talk is cheap, but money buys the whisky: Is he really  going to do it? Is the National Party really going to do all  these things that it has set out to do? And we've done it!    What makes me cry is the violence. It is the one thing which  I would have liked to see different. I sincerely believed that  when we reached agreements, when a new constitution was agreed  upon, when we focused all South Africans on participation in the  election, that the political violence would abate and would come  to an end. Maybe the lack of inclusivity, with Inkatha standing  out until so recently, was one of the main causes why it didn't  stop or abate. But now they are in and I am praying everyday  that that will now make a big contribution to really bringing  the tension and the violence and the confrontation to an end.    [Mogoda] President, what do you think is the most exciting  thing about you since you entered politics? What I mean is  that, what do you like most about yourself since you entered  politics?    [De Klerk] I am not a vain man. That is the most difficult  question I've had in this whole election campaign to answer.  Let me rather say, what do I like most about that which I  represent in politics? I like the commitment of my party, the  honesty of my party, the courage which my party had to also  admit mistakes and to change that which was wrong. I am proud  of the way in which my party has changed and has become a party  for all the people of South Africa, representing all the  population groups, the most nonracial party participating in  this election.    [Mogoda] You refer to your new National Party as somewhat an  overhauled party. It's not an old one. Now, are you maybe  trying to convince people that a leopard can change its spots?    [De Klerk] Yes. I think it is a very shallow saying that a  leopard can't change its spots, because we are not dealing with  the skin. We are dealing with the heart, and too much emphasis  is being put on skin and color in South Africa. What is in your  heart is what counts; it is warmth, it is caring for the needs  of the people, it is that you have succeeded to remove racism  from your pattern of thinking. Yes, we have a new heart in the  National Party.    [Mogoda] Well, another question. Some of your opponents, I  would say, have accused you of having intervened to stop your  son from marrying a colored girl in Cape Town sometime. I have  never heard you commenting on this. Now is your time.    [De Klerk] I have at all times with regard to that taken the  viewpoint that my son is an adult. He must make a choice, and I  have no color prejudice in my mind. I am not a racist. Parents  are concerned about whether the choice of a son or a daughter is  the right one. In this case my son's decision not to marry was  his own.    [Mogoda] Well, Mr. President, there have also been reports  that a number of white people are stockpiling for fear of the  aftermath of elections. What does this indicate to you?    [De Klerk] I think many of them have fallen prey to media  reports and speculations which gave rise to a little bit of  panic. I don't share the analysis that we will have vast  disruptions after the election. I think we will have some  festivity. Some parties might be very quiet and licking their  wounds, but generally speaking I think apart from the  festivities we will return very soon to normal. The public is  tired of politics. They want a little bit of relaxation again  on their television screens. They don't want to be inundated  with political propaganda all the time, and I think the whole  country is really looking forward to get the election behind us  now so that we can resume our ordinary normal lives and really,  I see no cause for grave concern.

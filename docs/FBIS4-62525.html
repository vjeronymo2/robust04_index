			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tbilisi Radio Tbilisi Network in  Georgian at 0515 GMT on 16 May was intercepted in progress  broadcasting a debate between Aleksandre Kavsadze, a senior  Georgian negotiator with the Abkhazians, and Deputy Ivliane  Khaindrava, one of the leaders of the opposition Republican  Party.    At the beginning of the intercept Kavsadze presents a  clause-by-clause interpretation of the Georgian-Abkhaz agreement  signed in Moscow 14 May. He says that, unlike previous  agreements, the only signatories to this deal are the Georgian  and Abkhaz sides. The Moscow agreement has not been signed by  either Russia or the United Nations, he says, and continues:    "The first article of the cease-fire and disengagement  agreement says that the sides bind themselves to stop  hostilities and not to use force against each other. This was  also mentioned in other documents signed since December last  year. However, this time we have an agreement, rather than a  statement, a memorandum of understanding, or some other  document. It is an agreement signed by two sides -- the  Georgian and the Abkhaz sides.    ``The second article says that the armed forces should be  disengaged from each other. It also outlines the disengagement  principle. The reason why I am not paying too much attention to  the absence of disengagement charts is that only a principle of  disengagement was formulated, rather than an entire procedure.  Under this principle, the sides are to be separated and the  buffer zone is to be filled by a peace-keeping force. That is  what the principle is.    ``The third article is about who should be deployed and how.  It says: The precise marking of the lines of disengagement and  a detailed chart for the disengagement of forces is to be drawn  up by the sides within the framework of a stage-by-stage  full-scale settlement. [Preceeding sentence spoken in Russian]  In this connection, a working group is to be formed, which will  clarify these issues, draw up a chart, which will show who  should be deployed where in order to maintain peace.    ``The fourth article outlines in general terms the mandate  of  this force. The aims and purposes of this peacekeeping force  are still to be finalized. Its main function should be to  maintain peace and create conditions for the return of refugees.    ``The agreement also includes articles five, six, and seven.    ``The fifth article says that full-scale negotiations on  conflict settlement are to be continued.    ``The sixth article requests the UN and its Security Council  to renew and broaden the mandate of UN military observers in  Abkhazia, so that their involvement can be more active and  efficient.''    After further remarks which are indistinct owing to poor  reception, Kavsadze concludes by saying that this agreement  alone only lays the foundation for the return of ethnic Georgian  refugees to Abkhazia and that another deal is needed for the  actual process to get started.</p>

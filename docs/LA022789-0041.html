			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: BY THE NUMBERS;  </P> <P> WORDS WORTH REMEMBERING AT OSCAR TIME  </P> <P> "How do you know who's an actress and who isn't? You're an actress if you're  acting. But you can't just walk up and down the room and act. Without that job  and those lines to say, an actress is just like any ordinary girl trying not to  look as scared as she feels."  </P> <P>  -- Andrea Leeds,  </P> <P> "Stage Door"  </P> <P> "As an actor, no one could touch him. As a human being, no one wanted to touch  him."  </P> <P>  -- Walter Matthau,  </P> <P> "The Sunshine Boys"  </P> <P> "Kirk was wrong when he said I didn't know where movie scripts left off and  life began. A script has to make sense, and life doesn't."  </P> <P>  -- Humphrey Bogart,  </P> <P> "The Barefoot Contessa"  </P> <P> "Congratulate Walter on his sets, Lucien on her costumes and Boris on his score  . . . and tell the director he should have his head examined. He shouldn't have  shot the picture; he should have shot himself."  </P> <P>  -- Kirk Douglas,  </P> <P> "The Bad and the Beautiful"  </P> <P> "Why do (producers) always look like unhappy rabbits?"  </P> <P>  -- Marilyn Monroe,  </P> <P> "All About Eve"  </P> <P> "The last (screenplay) I wrote was about Okies in the Dust Bowl. You'd never  know because, when it reached the screen, the whole thing played on a torpedo  boat."  </P> <P>  -- William Holden,  </P> <P> "Sunset Boulevard"  </P> <P> SOURCE: Harry Haun's "The Movie Quote Book"  </P></p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Galliford slips to Pounds 267,000 Pre-tax profits at Galliford, the Midlands-based contractor and housebuilder, slipped further from Pounds 327,000 to Pounds 267,000 during the six months to end-December. The decline was in spite of a 42 per cent profits rise to Pounds 1.3m from private housebuilding and a return to the black by the merchanting division. The company said that contracting operations continued to face strong competition for work and had incurred a loss during the first half. Mr Richard Miles, chairman, said: 'The board expects the second half to continue to be difficult.' Turnover of continuing operations fell from Pounds 109.3m to Pounds 102.5m. Earnings per share dipped from 0.27p to 0.2p leaving the interim dividend, unchanged at 0.5p, uncovered, requiring a Pounds 265,000 transfer from reserves.</p>

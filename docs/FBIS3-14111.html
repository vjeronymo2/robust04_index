General Secretary of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran  (KDPI) Mostafa Hejri accused Iran of "killing and attacking  Kurds here in the same way as in Iran."    He told AFP from his headquarters in Kou Senjaq, northern  Iraq, that in the past month "two villages have been nearly  totally destroyed by Iranian shelling," although there had been  casualties [sentence as received].    Hejri added that Tehran had only stopped its attacks on the  Iranian Kurdish population during winter.    Kurdish security forces added that an Iranian, who was  active  in the Iranian Kurdish movement had been killed in  al-Sulaymaniyah, in the east of Kurdish-controlled northern  Iraq, several days ago.    Northern Iraq passed to Kurdish control, with the backing of  the allied forces, after the end of the Gulf war in February  1991.    The KDPI, the main Kurdish opposition party in Iran, has  several bases in northern Iraq close to the Iranian border, and  in the past there has been intermittent shelling of the border  areas.</p>

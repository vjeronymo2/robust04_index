Valentyn Landyk, the  Republic's deputy prime minister told INTERFAX that the Cabinet  of Ministers held a special conference devoted to the formation  of a currency rate policy. The conference did not produce a  final agreement on a mechanism for currency regulation.  However, it is expected that a decision on this will be taken  in the next few days.    The exchange rate for cash karbovantsy at exchange points at  present is about 40,000 to the dollar. The official rate is  used by the state to purchase half of the foreign currency  incomes of exporters and other payments. At the end of 1993,  inflation in Ukraine was over 60 percent per month but in  January it fell below 20 percent.</p>

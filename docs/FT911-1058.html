			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Shareholders challenge US stores group TWO dissident shareholders of Sears, Roebuck, the troubled US retailing and financial services group, yesterday asked a Federal judge to postpone the company's annual meeting tomorrow, accusing it of failing to disclose important financial information. The judge said he would give his ruling today. Sears' directors face a separate challenge from Mr Robert Monks, a leading figure in the US shareholder rights movement, who is seeking a seat on the board at the company's annual meeting. The directors oppose his candidacy. The new challenge comes from two small investors, together holding some 500 Sears shares, who are suing the company in a Pennsylvanian court. They maintain that the annual meeting should not be held until Sears distributes to shareholders new proxy, or voting literature, disclosing that for the past three years the company has been involved in a legal suit in Chicago. The Chicago case - which the company has not mentioned to shareholders  - centres on allegations that the company's officers hastily initiated a restructuring programme in 1988, mainly to foil any hostile bid for the business and entrench themselves in office. Sears has dismissed the Pennsylvanian suit as without merit.</p>

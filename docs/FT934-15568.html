			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: Tokyo cracks down on builders - Robert Thomson writes on the latest Japanese political scandal FOR the past few weeks, Japanese television viewers have watched the almost nightly drama of construction company executives being hauled from their homes and escorted to the Tokyo Detention Centre for questioning about their role in an unfolding political scandal. The construction industry is traditionally an important source of campaign cash for Japanese politicians. At the last count, 18 executives from five leading contractors had been arrested for alleged involvement in the bribery of provincial government leaders. The public prosecutors continue to circle the industry. This crackdown by the authorities has come at a difficult time for construction companies where margins are already under severe pressure from the downturn in the economy and an accompanying 30 to 40 per cent fall in property prices. Most contractors have downgraded their profit forecasts for this year, and the five companies implicated in the scandal - Taisei, Shimizu, Hazama, Mitsui Construction, and Nishimatsu Construction - are likely to feel the squeeze more than most. They are temporarily excluded from bidding for some public works contracts. 'The situation is really very severe, and we will have to try to regain confidence,' a manager at Taisei explained. Taisei was embarrassed this week by the arrest of a vice-president over the company's Y20m (Dollars 190,000) payment to a prefectural governor. Prosecutors say the payment was a bribe, while Taisei insists that it was merely a political donation. A court will ultimately decide, but the Construction Ministry has already suspended Taisei from public works contracts for two months and local governments might do the same. In an average year, the company said, public works account for 20 per cent of orders, but the ratio had risen from 25 to 30 per cent this year. Before the arrest this week, Taisei was expecting pre-tax profit for the six months ended September to be 34.8 per cent lower than a year earlier on sales down 6.4 per cent. The only positive turn for Taisei is that Japanese interest rates are now at their lowest ever levels with the official discount rate standing at 1.75 per cent. In the case of Hazama, another implicated contractor, 47 prefectural governments and 12 cities imposed temporary bidding bans, ranging from two to four months, which the company said will remain in place until we 'are designated as a bidder again'. Under the Japanese bidding system for public works projects, a company must be 'designated' by the authority responsible, which is under no obligation to explain why a company is overlooked in the bidding, meaning that a suspension may be indefinitely extended by some governments. 'We won't really know when the penalties are over until we are nominated again,' Hazama said. 'Even though the period of our ban is two months, the period will not exactly be two months. It is likely to be longer.' Last week the company was forced to revise downwards its forecasts on profits for the current corporate year, ending March. Its forecast for net profits was lowered by 26.7 per cent on sales expected to be 12.7 per cent lower than earlier estimated. Hazama might benefit from an increase in public works orders next year, as governments have held back in awarding contracts, fearing that the winner may be entangled in the scandal, which would force the complicated award procedure to be conducted again. In August, government orders to the 50 largest contractors were down 42.7 per cent on a year earlier, the largest fall since the Construction Ministry began collecting figures in 1959. In the same month, private orders were down 9.3 per cent, partly reflecting the growing surplus of office space in Tokyo and Osaka, the two largest cities. The surplus is particularly acute in newer commercial areas, where buildings sprouted during the late 1980s, the bubble era, and developers are still completing the more ambitious projects planned during those heady days. Officials at the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, established by Japanese banks to clear away bad property-related loans, expect commercial property prices to continue falling for at least another year. Japanese manufacturers account for about 20 per cent of private construction orders, but are reducing capital spending at home and expanding production facilities in cheaper east Asian sites. The Industrial Bank of Japan expects that capital spending this year will slip by 2.3 per cent, the second consecutive fall, and the Bank of Japan has warned that the higher yen could lead to a 'massive substitution' of overseas investment. In these harsh conditions, scandal is an unwelcome burden, but companies which have avoided implication in the latest spate of allegations are likely to receive a fresh flow of orders. For example, Obayashi this week raised its pre-tax profit forecast from Y52bn to Y60bn for the year to March. However, the company has cut the net profit forecast from Y23bn to Y13bn, as it has chosen to confront a separate but common affliction for the industry, over-exposure in the US property market. Obayashi is to liquidate three subsidiaries and write off losses of Y30bn.</p>

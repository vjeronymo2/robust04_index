			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Shadows Over Budget"] </F>   [Text] Sir Hamish Macleod yesterday brought down a Budget  which should be the envy of the developed world. In what other  country could the government cut salaries tax and profits tax --  taxes that already are low by world standards -- order big  increases in spending on social welfare, health, education and  roads, and still produce a surplus? If the Financial  Secretary's forecasts prove correct, the surplus will help  produce reserves of more than $260 billion, to be handed over to  the Special Administrative Region [SAR] government in 1997.    The Budget is generous--but Sir Hamish could afford to be  big- hearted. As he said, the task of this Budget was to manage  prosperity. That this is so is a tribute to the Government and  its basic philosophy of keeping its own activities restrained to  allow the private sector to blossom and to the productive energy  of the people of Hong Kong. It is a tribute, too, to fortune --  the good fortune of being in the world's fastest-growing region  and the bad fortune of a sky-rocketing property market which  nevertheless keeps filling the administration's coffers.    The salaries tax concessions will help ease the financial  burden on millions of people. The profits tax cut should help  to make Hong Kong business a little more competitive. The  forecast reserves awaiting the new sovereign government in 1997  should calm China's fears that borrowing to build the airport  and related projects would risk leaving the SAR bankrupt.  <H5>  High Growth Needed </H5>   All this is based on the assumption of continued high  economic growth. Growth in 1994-95 is estimated to stay at 5.5  percent -- well above growth rates in other developed economies.  The territory's growth should be helped by better performance  in the United States and United Kingdom and by continued rapid  expansion in China.    Unfortunately, another key figure is forecast to be  unchanged  in 1994-95: The rise in the cost of living will again be 8.5  percent, eroding the gains people will make from tax cuts and  salary rises. As the Budget is in surplus, it should make a  small contribution to keeping inflation controlled. But the tax  cuts will fuel more consumer spending, helping to push inflation  up.    The property boom will continue to be one of the biggest  contributors to inflation. Sir Hamish admitted that Government  moves to try to control property prices (including the  restrictions on mortgage lending) had been ineffective. He  proposed a number of measures to increase the supply of new land  and building sites and cut delays in getting projects finished  in an effort to control prices.    But he also decided to reduce the impact of property stamp  duty for lower- and medium-priced flats. Making it easier for  people to buy homes is desirable socially but the effect of  higher demand will be to pull prices up. The Budget will not  keep a lid on the price of property.    Inflation, however, is not the only cloud on the budgetary  horizon. The territory's dependence on China, which accounts  for so much of our prosperity, also brings risks.  <H5>  Beware the Fallout </H5>   One flows from the possibility that China's economy will  grow  too quickly, producing a bust to follow the present boom. That  would hurt Hong Kong businesses and families and make nonsense  of the Budget forecasts. Another comes from the annual debate  over China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status with the US. If  MFN were not continued both the US and the Chinese economies  would be damaged. The fallout for the territory would be  devastating.    The Budget documents estimate that, if China lost its MFN  status, Hong Kong would suffer a loss of up to $26 billion in  income and of up to 75,000 jobs. Growth would be cut to just  over three per cent. Little wonder that the Government supports  China's case in this annual battle with the US.    Hong Kong began compiling growth statistics in 1966. Since  then the territory has enjoyed -- and earned -- 27 unbroken  years of expansion. That historical fact is no guarantee that  growth will go on. So people here should be concerned about  China and its trade. We should hope that Beijing manages to keep  high growth going without losing control. And we should hope  that the US puts its muscle behind levers other than trade as it  tries to press China for improvements in human rights.    If those hopes are realised, the clouds will cast nothing  but  shadows on the bright economic picture. Hong Kong will have its  28th straight year of rising prosperity.</p>

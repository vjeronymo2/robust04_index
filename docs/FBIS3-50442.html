He also is convinced  that this project is not a winner for his other colleague  deputies. Let us listen to Mr. Antoine Joseph at Edner Jean's  microphone:    [Begin Joseph recording in Creole] I encourage all ideas  that  allow Haitians to sit together and discuss, whether it is at an  international or national conference. However, I think that the  political parties in the Parliament should give their opinion on  the idea of the national conference, as the invitation was sent  to them. If they reject it, then the idea will fail. Right now,  many political parties favor the national conference. Some of  them have said no. As I had already supported the national  conference, I still support it. This is because I think it can  embrace more subjects than an international conference. Many  people think that the Haitian crisis must be repatriated, and I  am not totally against that idea. Let me remind you that the  Washington protocol agreement was signed between the  international community and partly the Parliament. Although two  Haitians signed the Governors Island Accord, it was with the  mediation of the international community. What would be better  is to have the international community broaden the framework of  the negotiations and the search for a solution by inviting  several sectors-- such as political parties, the labor unions,  the peasant organizations, the active sectors of national life,  and the social professional associations. All those people  should sit together in order to find a solution. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

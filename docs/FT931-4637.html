			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / German chemicals groups expected to make more cuts THE GERMAN chemicals industry is expected shortly to announce further cost-cutting measures after BASF and Hoechst yesterday announced sharp falls in 1992 profits and dividends. BASF, the weakest of the big three, cut its dividend by DM2 to DM10 compared with the DM3 or DM4 reduction widely expected. The news gave all chemicals stocks and the DAX index of 30 leading shares an immediate boost. The index closed up more than 18 points at a new high for the year of 1,713.13. BASF stocks, which gained DM9 as soon as the news was released ended even higher at DM240.10, up DM11.6. A DM3 cut to DM9 in the Hoechst payout and a 17 per cent drop in earnings were revealed after the markets closed. According to yesterday's figures, pre-tax profits at BASF slumped 41 per cent to DM1.24bn (Pounds 520m) on sales down 4.5 per cent at DM44.5bn. Earnings at Hoechst were 17.7 per cent lower at DM2.1bn, while sales fell 2.8 per cent to DM45.9bn. In spite of the early market reactions, analysts noted that both groups had reduced their dividends by less than expected after profits fell by around 20 per cent in 1991. At the time this was interpreted as a sign that worse was yet to come. Early estimates of the outlook for the current year and details of further rationalisation plans will be given at the groups' annual press conferences next week. Dividend and earnings details at Bayer, the last of the big three, will be published after its supervisory board meets tomorrow. Average prices for chemicals fell almost 2 per cent last year and stood 8.5 per cent below those of 1985, according to the chemicals industry association. Prices for organic chemicals and plastics slumped almost 8 per cent. Confidence in the pharmaceuticals business, which usually avoids the worst effects of cyclical downturns, has slumped lately because of the introduction of price cuts, controls and prescription limits imposed from Bonn. According to early figures, drugs sales have fallen by between 30 and 40 per cent in the first two months of this year. Lex, Page 22</p>

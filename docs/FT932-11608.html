			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: The chancellor turns to Zorgs DON'T mention green shoots of economic spring to me. Not when I am sitting here in a rainforest of creepers, vines and carnivorous orchids so luxuriant and swift-growing that I cannot see sunlight or moonlight or anything - a tropical paradise of economic indicators so virile and upthrusting that yesterday I rang my close and valued friend, Norman Lamont, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, to garner his reaction. Norman has taken a shine to me ever since, a bold eight weeks ago, Hawks &amp; Handsaws U-turned with great suavity and declared that - far from blaming him for Britain's manifest ills and woes - we should honour him for taking the blame for John Major's policies; that his strength and insouciance were little short of miraculous, and that he reminded us of Churchill (also of Hercules, stinting we were not). Yesterday I asked Norman what it felt like, how did it really feel, to see Britain's economy rocketing into orbit. He said: 'Jolly good, actually.' I said: 'Give me more. Sparkling personal stuff. Material like that I pounce on. I can use whatever you've got.' 'Well,' said the chancellor, 'the stats are looking good. 0.2 per cent. 0.6 per cent. 0.6 per cent. 1.2 per cent. Minus 52,000, seasonally adjusted. Structural, not cyclical. Yield curve sloping upwards. GDP ebullient. 1.5 per cent. 2.5 per cent. 3.7 per cent. Broad money holding. Inflation not a problem. Trend-lines converging. 7.3 per cent. 9.7 per cent. Exports surging manically. Stuff your German cars. Pounds 115bn. Dollars 517bn. FFr952bn. Exchange rate trending higher. DM2.90. DM3.00. Perhaps we're looking at 4. 'All of Europe watching us. Stretched to breaking with envy. One in the eye for Clinton. Teach him to dodge the draft. Eyes of the world on Britain. Our leadership role regained. Naturally I'm delighted. I said it would be alright. Trust me, I told the nation. The abuse I had to contend with. Tabloids out to get me. Every black trick in the book. But water off a duck's back. Now it's all come good. The green shoots of spring have turned into barleyfields, hopfields, tundra and emerald swathe, a swampland of orchids. Is this the stuff you want?' 'Magical,' I replied. 'But show me your innermost feelings. Take me inside your head. Keep it reasonably personal. There's a market for personal stuff.' 'Well,' said the chancellor, 'I'm singing in the bath again. Songs from all the shows. If I were a rich man. Oh what a beautiful morning. Let's spend the night together. Tomorrow belongs to me.' 'Fascinating. But how does it actually feel to be running a miracle economy?' 'Well,' said the chancellor, 'it's the best feeling in the world. It's like  -gosh, Michael, how can I put this? - it's like, you know, you're in the royal box on Derby day and you've just eaten the best lunch ever and then you've walked down to the paddock with the royals and stood around knowledgeably and on the way back to the grandstand you've plunked down Pounds 10,000 on a 20-1 no-hoper that scoots in by five lengths, still accelerating, and the Queen turns to you and says with that beautiful smile of hers: 'Extremely impressive, Norman. Did you know the dam?'' I said: 'Magnificent material, chancellor. I pounce on stuff like this. But what will you do for an encore?' 'Well,' said the chancellor. 'Economic miracles have to be consolidated. By the time I become prime minister, I want to see Britain launched upon a hi-tech glidepath from which it cannot be diverted. We must re-establish our scientific eminence. As a result, I am in the throes of launching an ultra-secret programme of scientific catch-up designed to catapult us once more to the forefront of nations. 'No stone am I leaving unturned. Sumerian gesh-time. Gnomonics. Transitional logic. Animism. Exobiology. Metamathematics. The polyhedral cohesion of virus crystals. Prelinguistic thought. The evidence for blueshifting. Re-mapping the computer universe. Black-body radiation. Twin-theory phenomena. Star-ponds. Nonobjective truth. The divine essence. Nutean surfaces. Zorgs. Infinite binary fractions. Mohole totalities. N-bottomed matter-crush. The novels of Don DeLillo. How am I doing for length, Michael? This the material you want?' I said: 'I have got 716 words, chancellor. Exactly the right amount.'</p>

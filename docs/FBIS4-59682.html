			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yemeni "Prime Minister" Haydar Abu-Bakr </F> al-'Attas by Hanan al-Badri in Washington; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Al-Badri] What is your reaction to the  decision dismissing you from the post of prime minister, and  what are the constitutional repercussions as far as the  continuation of the government is concerned?    [Al-'Attas] The dismissal decision was unconstitutional and  illegitimate. It was actually a suspension not a dismissal  because only the House of Representatives has the right to  withdraw confidence from the cabinet. Withdrawal of confidence  would mean formation of a new cabinet but, to avoid that  dilemma, they played tricks to circumvent legitimacy and the  Constitution. I say that the suspension decision means nothing  at all.    [Al-Badri] How do you assess the chances of settling the  crisis, bearing in mind current developments, the Arab mediation  attempts, and the ideas proposed by some Yemeni figures for  ending the fighting and starting a dialogue?    [Al-'Attas] The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has always  supported dialogue as the ideal way of tackling the problems  facing Yemen's unity since its birth. We made great efforts  over the past years. That resulted in the national dialogue and  we all agreed that obstinacy only weakens Yemen. I support any  initiatives calling for a cease-fire.    [Al-Badri] You personally and the YSP stand accused of  seeking secession and receiving foreign aid to help you achieve  secession.    [Al-'Attas] That [sounds like] the same old broken record.  These accusations are a kind of ideological terrorism which is  meaningless. The YSP advocates true unity with the exercise of  democracy and under which the tribe-state link would end and the  militarization of the regime would end. [passage omitted]    [Al-Badri] Do you believe that the southern and northern  leaderships can afford the military confrontation, considering  their difficult economic conditions at present?    [Al-'Attas] Yemen needs every penny for development but this  war was imposed on us by the military clique in Sanaa.    [Al-Badri] So you agree on the question of accepting foreign  aid?    [Al-'Attas] Not at all. I am not discussing that now. Some  states are providing material and human aid for the regime in  Sanaa, such as Sudan which came into the picture when some  Sudanese were arrested during the crisis, and Iraq which has  also come into the picture.    [Al-Badri] Do you believe it is possible to work in  accordance with the Pledge and Accord document?    [Al-'Attas] The Pledge and Accord Document was the only way  out of Yemen's crisis. It provided a launching pad for a  realistic way of tackling current problems and for an approach  to the future with the aim of building a modern Yemeni state and  a decentralized system, but Sanaa's rejection of that document  has been perfectly clear from the first day. [passage omitted]    [Al-Badri] The United States is still cautious about the  current situation in Yemen. What is the truth about your  contacts with the State Department and especially with Assistant  Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau?    [Al-'Attas] Pelletreau contacted me from Washington when  the attack on the 3d Brigade began and he expressed U.S.  resentment of the action of the government in Sanaa.  Regrettably, that attack on the 3d Brigade in 'Imran on 27 April  was a result of a speech on the same day by President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih in which he declared war, and the situation  erupted despite the YSP's self-restraint.    Yes, my contacts with the U.S. State Department are  continuing. The U.S. position is clear. They are against the  war and they are trying, along with all the Arab brothers, to  put pressure on Sanaa to stop the war and to resort to political  dialogue.    [Al-Badri] Who is responsible for opening a new front in Bab  el Mandeb?    [Al-'Attas] Aden did not open a front in Bab el Mandeb.  Sanaa did.    [Al-Badri] Do you still hope for the success of diplomatic  efforts to stop the fighting?    [Al-'Attas] I am very optimistic that the efforts of Egypt,  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Syria,  and the Arab League states and also U.S. efforts will produce  results toward stopping the fighting so that the Yemeni  leadership in Sanaa will return to its senses and make the brave  decision of ending the war and returning to dialogue, because  war means more Yemeni fragmentation.    [Al-Badri] [House of Representatives Speaker] Shaykh  'Abdallah al-Ahmar has accused 'Ali Salim al-Bid of mutiny.  Planning Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani says that he sees  nothing wrong with fighting. Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim  Basindwah has stated that they will put down the mutiny in a  matter of hours. What is your comment?    [Al-'Attas] It is ridiculous that those three should come  together and reach conclusions denoting ignorance of the facts  about Yemen. The YSP is a part of the regime and it is an  effective and essential partner, but it seems that the mentality  of those people reflects a policy of annexation. As regards  al-Iryani's statement, it is, like his previous statements,  self-contradictory.    [Al-Badri] How do you interpret the conflicting statements  of the Yemen capital?    [Al-'Attas] It has declared an unjust war and is trying to  conceal its real objectives. We are clear and they are lying.  The proof is the arrest campaign against all Yemeni patriotic  figures who reject the war, which reflects Sanaa's military  mentality.    [Al-Badri] The appointment of a new defense minister has  been announced and it has been said that Sanaa's aim was to  weaken the southern side.    [Al-'Attas] That too, regrettably, is another one of their  stupid mistakes. They just do not understand Yemen's situation  and circumstances.    [Al-Badri] Have you obtained American assurances or promises  to settle the crisis, even militarily if necessary?    [Al-'Attas] The Americans are for an end to the war. I will  be holding contacts with them in the next few days with the aim  of reactivating the U.S. position in the direction of stopping  the war, in cooperation with the Arab brothers.    [Al-Badri] Is it just a coincidence that you are outside  Yemen now and were outside Yemen when the January 1986 incidents  broke out?    [Al-'Attas] The circumstances are different. In January  1986 I was on an official visit abroad. Now the reason is that  I have had a health problem. I contributed to the work of the  National Dialogue Committee despite the fact that I was in  severe pain. The treatment for pain in the spine was started in  Sanaa at the hands of Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid al-Khalidi. I forced  myself to take part in the cabinet meetings but then the  deterioration in my condition compelled me to take the doctors'  advice. I had to go abroad for treatment. I left Aden on 12  April, 15 days before the president's ill-omened speech.    [Al-Badri] So how do you envisage your return to Yemen, and  when?    [Al-'Attas] I will return to Yemen as soon as my treatment  is completed. I am now recovering and, God willing, I will  return soon to participate with the brothers in solving the  problems facing Yemen.</p>

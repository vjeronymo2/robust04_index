			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Valmet cuts losses to FM72m at four months VALMET, the Finnish paper machinery and engineering group, cut losses after financial items to FM72m (Dollars 12.7m) in the first four months, from FM126m in the same period in 1992. Given the stronger performance, and signs of revival in the wood processing industry, the group has forecast a 'considerable improvement' in income for the full year, after 1992's FM298m loss. Sales rose 38 per cent to FM3.31bn, and the operating margin rose to FM265m from FM123m. However, financing costs increased to FM152m from FM84m, mainly because of a FM50m foreign exchange loss following the depreciation of the markka. The company's paper machinery division was the star performer, with sales rising to FM1.46bn from FM603m, thanks to the timing of several large machine deliveries. Other units improved sales, except at Saab-Valmet, where sales fell to FM384m from FM608m after a dispute with Adam Opel interrupted production of Opel Calibra cars. Valmet's optimism for the rest of the year is based partly on a pick-up in orders as the forestry sector shows signs of recovery. At the end of April, the group order backlog was worth FM6.3bn, against FM4.7bn at the end of April 1992. The company forecasts a 10 per cent increase in 1993 sales from FM9.64bn last year, and says all its units should show positive operation income.</p>

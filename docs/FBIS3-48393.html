			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Pak Tu-sik] </F>   [Text] It was learned that the U.S.-North Korea  working-level contact, held in New York on 5 January, came to an  end after "having agreed to disagree."    The contents of their agreement is relatively simple. That  is: North Korea will accept ad hoc and ordinary inspections of  seven declared nuclear facilities in Yongbyon demanded by  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA].    The Status of Agreement on Disagreement. [subhead]    However, North Korea interprets acceptance of inspections to  mean the acceptance of "limited inspection for maintaining the  continuity of nuclear safeguards measures, not the 'regular  inspection' which member nations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty [NPT] are obliged to undergo," while the Western camp,  including the ROK and the United States, interpret it to  actually mean "the acceptance of full-scale ad hoc and ordinary  inspections."    Both the ROK and the United States chose the position that  "North Korea's complete return to NPT is the main agenda for the  third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks that are to be  resumed after inspections are conducted. Therefore, whether the  number of inspection is one time or not is not a serious  question." In other words, the negotiations were for North  Korea to find justification [myongbun] and for the practical  interest of the ROK and the United States.    Negotiations between North Korea and IAEA have dragged on  for  much longer than expected. In a recent negotiation, North Korea  raised the issue pertaining to interpretation of the "agreement  to disagree." Concerning "the inspection plan and list" where  all seven facilities are targets of inspection, North Korea  questioned: What relationship does this plan and list have with  continuing nuclear inspections?    Relationship With "Continuity of Inspection." [subhead]    From North Korea's point of view, the question of North  Korea's full return to NPT membership is an important card in  forthcoming negotiations with the United States.    Therefore, North Korea may be planning to clearly delineate  this issue in negotiation with the IAEA. The abrupt 21 January  statement by the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman might  have been prompted by such a strategy.    It was learned that a similar situation occurred in  consecutive contacts held between North Korea and IAEA on 17 and  18 January.    Meanwhile, it is the IAEA's position that the continuity of  nuclear safeguards measures cannot be guaranteed if North Korea  refuses to accept the whole lists put forward by the IAEA, and  if North Korea fails to send a reply on this issue by the end of  this month, the IAEA must declare a "breakup" in continuity  during its regular Board of Governors meeting slated for 22  February.    Variable Factors, Including the Two Kims' Birthdays.  [subhead]    Since the IAEA agrees that forthcoming inspections are not  "regular inspections" conducted on NPT member states and North  Korea is not opposed to the inspection of seven facilities  itself, the road to an agreement is unlikely to be difficult.  At least, this speculation was dominant until the end of  U.S.-North Korea contact in New York. Nevertheless, North Korea  is dragging the talks along without presenting a clear  explanation. The reason for this can be interpreted in several  ways.    First, North Korea may need to buy time to adjust internal  opinion on the results of the New York negotiation, or they may  have decided that if they are to accept IAEA's inspections, to  make the most of it. However, there are a number of hurdles  lying before these delaying tactics of North Korea.    For instance, the IAEA's Board of Governors' meeting is  scheduled to be held in a little over a month and the North  Koreans need to keep an eye out for Kim Chong-il's 52nd birthday  on February 16.    Since North Korea celebrates birthdays of Kim Il-song and  Kim  Chong-il as an extraordinary national holiday, it usually  refrains from taking any external action during this period.  Therefore, North Korea must settle the issue of IAEA's  inspection before this day. Thus, the North Korean nuclear  issue faces another time limit.</p>

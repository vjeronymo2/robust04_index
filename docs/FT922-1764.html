			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market ends grim week with a bounce PRICES recovered slightly on the London stock market yesterday following a grim few days beset by political worries and corporate gloom. Nevertheless, claims that the market has reached a floor might have shaky foundations; it appears to be following the old traders adage: 'Sell in May, go away, come back on St Leger Day'. Initial impetus for a bounce, yesterday, was provided by the Japanese Nikkei index, which rose by 474 after hitting a five-and-a-half-year low on worries about the state of the economy. The Nikkei's improvement enabled London to shrug off Thursday's weak close on Wall Street and prices were marked up by 12 points at the opening ahead of the expiry of Footsie futures and options at 10.10am. After this technical situation was out of the way, it was confirmed that Ireland had chosen resoundingly to accept the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. Concerns about the way Ireland would vote had been overhanging the market and, on the news, the Footsie sprang ahead by another 10 points, prompted by the first genuine buying of the day. In the afternoon, the Dow opened some 13 points ahead and gave a further prop to the Footsie which closed 22.1 up at 2,584.8. Turnover was boosted by three programme trades, speculation that a bidder was sniffing around glassmaker Pilkington and active dealing among banking stocks. However, the closing volume was 440.6m shares, compared with 517.9m on Thursday, suggesting that the level of genuine retail business would be below Thursday's Pounds 1.03bn. The market had managed to shrug off the effect of poor performances in Tokyo and Wall Street and the decision by the aviation leasing group GPA to abandon its planned share flotation. In fact, traders appreciated that the cash reserved for the GPA offer would now be looking for another home. One piece of bad news the market was unable to ignore was Thursday's statement by ICI that signs of an upturn had petered out. SG Warburg Securities summed up the view of many when it commented; 'The prospect of a summer which might well be marked by a steady drizzle of earning downgrades suggests that even if the market is near the bottom any rebound may be slow and hesitant.' The feeling was that although the Footsie might be undervalued, institutional buyers were cherry picking on selected stocks rather than buying the market. If that continues to be the case, London could stall for some time. Customer, or retail turnover in equities languished as buyers waited on the sidelines until Ireland had voted on the Maastricht treaty.</p>

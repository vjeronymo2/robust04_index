As a result, a large number  of militia troops were killed.    A responsible source of the Ministry of National Defense  told  a BIA military correspondent that jets of the Islamic army  bombed enemy assembly centers in Maranjan Tapa and around  Chelstoon, as a result of which heavy losses were inflicted on  the enemy.    The spokesman added that Dostam-Golboddin militia embarked  upon a series of movements and military transportation in the  frontline battle zone, which were pushed back as a result of the  activity of the Islamic army units. Their dead were left behind  on the battlefield, and a number of their positions have been  seized by the Islamic army.

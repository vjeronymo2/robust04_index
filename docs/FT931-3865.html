			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: KBL extends Brown Shipley bid KREDIETBANK Luxembourg-eoise has extended its 30p-a-share offer for Brown Shipley Holdings by a week until next Thursday after adding acceptances of only 1.4 per cent to the 29.8 per cent of the equity that it already owns, writes Jane Fuller. Since KBL launched the offer, which values BSH at Pounds 4.8m, on February 18, a potential rival has appeared. Guinness Peat Group, the UK investment vehicle for New Zealand entrepreneur Sir Ron Brierley, has taken a 22.3 per cent stake, paying 35p a share for the majority of it. BSH's share price closed at 43p yesterday. GPG announced this week that it was contemplating making a full bid and asked for the same information as had been furnished to KBL. KBL has stressed that its offer is the only one on the table.</p>

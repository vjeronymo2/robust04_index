			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Feb 26 (ANTARA) -- President Suharto in his  capacity as chairman of Nonaligned Movement (NAM) has strongly  rejected suggestions that would put Bosnia-Herzegovina's  capital, Sarajevo under the UN administrative control.    "Such control would disregard the rights of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Republic to establish its sovereignty over  its own capital," Minister/State Secretary Murdiono quoted  President Suharto as saying here over the weekend.    When briefing UN Security Council Chairman Roble Olhay on  the  NAM chairman's attitude on Friday (25/2), the NAM chairman  expressed deep concern over massacres, military aggressions and  the ethnic cleansing program launched by Bosnian Serbs against  the non-Serbian Bosnian people. He told the UN Security Council  chairman that the continuation of the Serbs' military  aggressions against the Bosnian people is a reflection of the  world community's failure to implement every UN Security Council  resolutions in the region.    The chairman also underlined that the UN Security Council  should have been acting as the protector of the Bosnian  territory and sovereignty. "The failure has even been worsening  by the arms embargo resolution imposed on the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. It meant that the Bosnians had been denied  their very basic rights, that is, to self-defense," said Suharto.    The NAM chairman said that the international community  should  stay alert, even if the Serbs had withdrawn its artillery from  Sarajevo following NATO's threat to launch air strikes. "We  should stay alert till the Serbs fully withdraw from the  besieged area," said the NAM chairman.    Suharto also urged the UN Security Council to hold a meeting  on the latest development in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to take some  concrete and effective steps to implement all relevant  resolution on the region. In a letter to the UN Security Council  chairman, President Suharto also touched on the need to convene  an international conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  conference should have a streamlined structure to achieve a just  and comprehensive solution to the issue. President Suharto and  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic last month in Jakarta  discussed the idea of convening such an international conference.    Minister Murdiono said that after meeting with the UN  Security Council chairman, President Suharto has asked the head  of NAM Chairman Executive Board Nana Sutresna to order the  chairman of NAM Coordinating Bureau at the UN to discuss the  Bosnian issue with the NAM caucus at the UN Security Council.    Murdiono said that NAM would always be ready to take part in  such an international conference or in a new round of talks on  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

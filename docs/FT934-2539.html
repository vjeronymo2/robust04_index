			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Chipmakers try to scuttle push for Gatt US semiconductor makers are trying to scuttle the push for a final Gatt agreement by urging Congress members to vote against ratifying it, unless big changes are made on intellectual property rights protection. 'The entire industry will come down hard against Gatt,' Mr Craig Barrett, chief operating officer of Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, said. Chipmakers charge that in its present form, the draft Gatt threatens their ability to protect intellectual property rights, denies open access to the European market and weakens US anti-dumping provisions. Mr Barrett is angered by provisions that might force Intel to license its patented technology to foreign makers. 'If a foreign government decided it needed a chip industry, it could force us to license our technology.' The draft Gatt proposal states that a patent holder must be paid 'adequate compensation', but it is unclear how that amount would be calculated. 'Our only recourse would be to appeal to a Gatt panel; by the time the issue was resolved, it could probably be moot,' because semiconductor technology advances rapidly. Passage of such measures could have a serious impact on the competitiveness of the US semiconductor industry. 'It hardly motivates a company to spend millions of dollars on product development if you are looking down a gun barrel at people threatening to seize your technology.' The US industry spends an average 12 per cent of revenues on research and development. Intel has spent Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) developing its latest line of Pentium microprocessors. 'In its current form, the draft Gatt hurts the US semiconductor industry and threatens US jobs,' Mr Andrew Procassini, Semiconductor Industry Association president, said. With nothing to gain from passage of the pact as it stands, the SIA would oppose Congress ratifying it. In addition to its objections to 'compulsory licensing', the US industry views European offers to lower import tariffs on chips as 'totally inadequate. The greatest tariff cuts occur in product areas exempt from European duties because Europe grants waivers for semiconductors for which there is no European competition. Europe is creating the illusion of big tariff concessions, when the tariffs paid would change very little.'</p>

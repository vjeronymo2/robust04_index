			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Geneva peace  conference has got its evolution and its continuity and cannot  forever return to the beginning, Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic said in his address today to the participants of a  plenary session devoted to negotiations in Bosnia.    The Serbian side has assumed a serious and responsible  approach to the European Union [EU] demands because it deemed  that the EU has defined its proposition in a serious and  responsible way, Milosevic added.    He recalled that the EU demands were precisely set out: 33.3  percent of the territory for the Muslim republic, temporary UN  administration of Sarajevo, EU administration of Mostar, and  access to the Sava river for the Muslim republic.    The Serbian side came to Geneva to sign the peace plan  because it has accepted the EU proposal, the Serbian president  said, adding that a plan perfect to the smallest detail has  never existed; the remaining issues can be successfully resolved  in bilateral relations after the peace agreement has been  reached.    Slobodan Milosevic added that he reasons along the lines of  the logical view that acceptance of the EU proposal creates  conditions for the peace plan to be signed and for ending the  war. He stressed that the remaining critical points and  alterations to the plan can be no one's reason for continuing  the war and that a peace should be endorsed immediately, while  any possible exchanges should be left to negotiations between  the parties involved.    The Serbian president said that the international community  has an obligation to explain to the Muslim side its attitude to  its proposal in the event of the Muslim side refusing to sign a  peace in the circumstances surrounding the acceptance of the EU  proposals. At the same time the European Twelve ought -- in  keeping with their obligations -- to lift the sanctions against  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Serbian people. The  Serbian president said in conclusion that this is the  international community's moral obligation.    Sources close to the negotiators say that the plenary  session  was held in a depressing atmosphere against the backdrop of  mutual recriminations between the Muslim and Croatian  delegations. The Muslim army side is reported to have tabled  new territorial demands with the Croats.    The second plenary session is expected to begin this  afternoon. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia have  resumed their bilateral talks following the signing of their  joint declaration. President Slobodan Milosevic and President of  the Serbian Republic Radovan Karadzic have also talked to  Co-chairmen Owen and Stoltenberg. Sources close to the Croatian  delegation claim that Tudjman suggested to Bosnian Muslim Leader  Izetbegovic that an arbitration commission be set up which would  resolve territorial disputes between all three warring sides in  the whole of Bosnia- Herzegovina. It has been unofficially  learned that Lord Owen has proposed that the UN Security Council  should set up a commission and that a cease-fire should be in  effect while the commission is working. Sources close to the  delegation of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina say  that the Serbian side has rejected such a commission.    According to the latest indications, the current round of  peace negotiations on Bosnia is expected to wrap up tonight.</p>

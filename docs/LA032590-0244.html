			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENROLLMENT IS THE PRIZE IN PRESCHOOL WAITING GAME  </P> <P> It's spring, and many Orange County parents' thoughts turn to camping.  Overnight. On the sidewalk. In front of some of the most coveted preschools in  the county.  </P> <P> This is registration time for the schools, and parents are willing to go to  extremes to assure that their youngsters take the proper first step toward a  quality education.  </P> <P> "If you do it for a house, you should do it for your kid as well," said Bob  Ludovise, a businessman from Laguna Niguel who spent an evening in a sleeping  bag outside the shared campus of Children's Choice preschool and McDowell  Elementary School in Laguna Niguel to assure getting his child enrolled.  </P> <P> Much of the problem stems from an extreme shortage of child care in South  Orange County, where the population of young families has mushroomed in recent  years. The Children's Home Society of California reported 4,218 requests for  child care from South County in 1989 -- and 1,000 to 1,500 openings.  </P> <P> But lines outside preschools crop up throughout the county.  </P> <P> "It's really a nightmare," said Vickie Vega, who finally registered her child  at Children's Choice preschool this year after paying fees at two other  preschools just in case. "There are a lot of dual-income families down here.  The need is such, families are doing whatever they have to to be sure their  children are enrolled in schools."  </P> <P> Each spring, Children's Choice director Sandra Senn issues numbers to waiting  parents and keeps bathrooms open all night.  </P> <P> After working late one night before registration, she said, she tried to open  the door to leave, but found it blocked at 8 p.m. by a sleeping parent.  </P> <P> Last year, she said, some parents replaced her procedure sign with one of their  own and issued new numbers. A brawl broke out between two fathers when they  found that they both had No. 1, she said. So Senn decided to hire security  guards to keep the peace during the overnight vigil.  </P> <P> Donna Woods of Laguna Hills said she was in the hospital having her second  child March 8 while her husband, Gary, stood in line at Children's Choice to  register their kindergartner.  </P> <P> "This year, (the director) told everyone not to come before 7. I thought  everyone would think they'd be there by 6," she said.  </P> <P> Arriving at 5:30 a.m., her husband was first in line to register their  5-year-old for three mornings a week, two hours each.  </P> <P> At the Fullerton United Methodist Preschool, where families have camped out for  the past 10 years, director Barbara Beasley said it is sometimes hard to tell  the parents from the homeless who also sleep on the sidewalk.  </P> <P> "Last year, I saw a vagrant on the stoop and said, 'You'll have to move on.' It  was Mr. Knudsen, one of the church leaders, trying to get his child in."  </P> <P> Her registration will be held this year in April.  </P> <P> But particularly among schools in the fast-growing South County, camp-outs for  school registration have become as commonplace as they are for opening days for  selling new tract homes.  </P> <P> One father installed himself in the sanctuary of Church of the Master in  Mission Viejo at 4:30 p.m. last year to be the first in line for the next  morning's preschool registration. "The mom said he had a better night's sleep  then she did," director Marsha Cowper said. "She worried about it all night.  </P> <P> "They bring their TVs, their record players, they ordered pizza that year. They  all seem very happy. It's very strange."  </P> <P> Parents will sometimes take turns in line. "One mom came and brought her son  when the dad left to go to work," she said. "The dad said, 'Boy, I hope you  understand what I gave up for you.' "  </P> <P> Like other directors, Cowper has seen the camp-outs begin earlier and earlier  as word spreads among parents.  </P> <P> Senn of Children's Choice called it "psychological group hysteria."  </P> <P> Parents, she said, "spread the word: You'd better get there early."  </P> <P> Recognizing that development was exacerbating the day-care problem in South  County, the Orange County Board of Supervisors has stipulated that South County  builders either contribute to a day-care fund or provide child care in their  projects. This year, $60,000 from the fund was distributed among seven  agencies.  </P> <P> But so far, the money has apparently done little to alleviate the crunch. To  the day-care directors, it looks like more of the same.  </P> <P> From the Church of the Master Preschool, Cowper can see more houses sprouting  on the rolling hillsides like wildflowers.  </P> <P> "There will be no place for these families," she said. "There are not enough  preschools to accommodate the people who will live in these houses."  </P> <P> Other high-demand schools that do not have camp-outs say the first-come,  first-serve situation can be avoided.  </P> <P> "I call from the waiting list, and people come in," said Gretchen Schoren,  director of St. John's Preschool in Rancho Santa Margarita. "I don't have them  all come and register in one day. I think it's dramatics."  </P> <P> Having parents camp out at your school "gets to be kind of a status symbol,"  she said.  </P> <P> Senn of Children's Choice said she had considered using a lottery system but  rejected it as unfair: "I don't like to give a number to a human being. Maybe  if it's an object, like a house. But I don't think a human being should be  treated randomly like a number.  </P> <P> "Every year, we try to rack our brains for a better system. I just shake my  head."  </P></p>

Recently the police detected cases of  smuggling fuels into Montenegro through Buna River flowing from  Shkodra Lake into the Adriatic. Major Muhamet Gradeci, head of  Shkodra Financial Police, told ATA that the police in  cooperation with police of order, discovered December 21, 1993  in the coastal village of Pulaj near Buna, 30 kilometers from  Shkodra, pipes which were used for smuggling fuels from Albania  into Montenegro. The pipes were some 20 meters long and  connected the coasts of Buna.    The pipe line is larger than the one discovered a month ago  almost in the same place, Major Gradeci said and added that the  other pipe line was some 10 centimeters broader and operated  through pumps which carried fuels from tankers into Montenegro.  Mr. Gradeci said he had suspicion that other pipes might exist  in other areas of Buna River and added that financial police has  been working to discover them.    The pipe lines have been installed by peasants of nearby  zone  who transport fuels which is provided to them by smugglers. The  pipes were destroyed right after they were discovered but this  was done only in the Albanian territory.    Smuggling with fuels is result of cooperation among Albanian  and Montenegrin smugglers. Financial police is working to cut  the threads of fuels smuggling.    A private fuels station in Velipoja, near Buna River flow,  has been a good shelter for smugglers for a long time.  Financial police has already blocked the station and every  tanker which passes this way is suspicious of smuggling. Mr.  Gradeci explained that 50 per cent of condraband fuels is  carried out through the fuels station in Velipoja.    Attempts to smuggle with fuels increased especially by the  end of last year and the beginning of the new year. Financial  police and that of public order blocked December 30 evening 11  tankers loaded with oil and the amount of fuels was not usual.  After verification of documents the police controlled the  destination the fuels were headed to.    On January 4, 1994, the police took possession of lorries  and  cars carrying 130 barrels of fuels. Half of the barrels carried  kerosene which is not allowed to be transported by citizens but  only through vehicles having the authorization of the government.</p>

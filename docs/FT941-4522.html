			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control Systems (10): Fruitful solution - User view: Financial consolidation / Geest's efforts to expand into Europe brought about a need for more complex consolidation than spreadsheets could provide. A consolidation package provided the best of both worlds Black Sigatoka, a fungal disease of fruit, rarely appears on balance sheets. But for Geest, the fresh food importer best-known for its bananas, it has threatened the Costa Rican crop and affected the share price. This is just one of the challenges facing Geest, which has been expanding over the last few years, and building its presence as a European supplier - a strategy that has already cost Pounds 120m. Currently the group has a turnover of Pounds 625m, and employs around 7,500 people worldwide. Up to 1991, the process of financial consolidation used to be fairly straightforward, involving little in the way of foreign currency with returns only from the UK and the West Indies. Supercalc spreadsheets managed the profit-and-loss accounts easily. But, according to group management accountant Richard Peck, Geest's restructuring put a strain on the process - 'as we expanded, we realised we could not cope with the inflexibility of the spreadsheet,' he says. 'We couldn't add new companies to the consolidation, nor extra lines to the profit and loss accounts, and we needed to add an analysis of component parts.' In seeking an alternative, Geest was wanted something easy to use that it would be able to tailor and manage in-house. It also sought an integrated approach that would reflect its structure. 'We wanted flexibility, but we also wanted what I call 'rigidity,' so that the reporting units couldn't change things. We wanted 'cross-checks' so that retained profit on the profit and loss had to be the same as net profit carried into the balance sheet,' he says. 'It was a matter of having control over the figures.' Geest assessed several well-known consolidation packages including IMRS' MicroControl and Comshare's FDC. 'There was very little between them, both were rich in functions, but we felt FDC was more user-friendly, and that we could build up our applications more quickly, with less help from suppliers,' comments Richard Peck. The FDC solution enabled each of Geest's business sectors, (banana, fruit, and products) to do its own consolidation before submitting to head office. Mr Peck adds: 'Head office can set its own reporting requirements, but the banana sector, for example, might want to add its own information: FDC gave us the option of adding its own database at that lower level.' Mr Peck and his colleagues wrote their own applications with the minimum of training, provided by Comshare as part of the Pounds 75,000 contract. Geest also bought extra personal computers, and spent a further Pounds 10,000 extending its software to provide the basis of an executive information system. FDC is now in use in 30 locations, including Holland, Belgium, Costa Rica, the West Indies and Miami. 'The main benefit,' concludes Mr Peck, 'is the speed of consolidation, and the fact that we get accurate information now, within those shorter time-scales. 'We now run a consolidation in just over an hour instead of two of three days. And because the data is more accurate and reliable, people have more confidence in the figures and in making decisions on them. Communication has also become better, because we're all looking at the same figures.' Excel, a favoured spreadsheet in-house, still plays its part - 'the figures are pulled straight through from FDC to Excel, which gives us standard-look reporting and high quality presentation.' Commander FDC This product is a financial consolidation software system, based on local area networks (LANs), and is PC and Windows compatible. It collects, consolidates, analyses, forecasts, and reports on financial information. There are 2,000 users, worldwide. Version 2.1 was launched in 1990; products in the same family include Commander, (1986) claimed to be the world's leading executive information system, and Commander Budget, (1993) the PC/LAN-based budgeting system. Supplier: Comshare International was formed in 1966 in the US, with a UK operation launched in 1971. Price: Pounds 40,000 for initial one-user licence for FDC; Pounds 34,000 for 25 users of Commander EIS LAN. User views: 'User-friendly, control and support can be in-house, also good support from vendor, useful interface with Excel.' Other comments: 'Complexity demands considerable in-house expertise. Some bespoke programming needed (where features 'didn't do as much as expected' for one user); 'performance can be slow over high-volume consolidation, eg 12 hours for one annual budget.'

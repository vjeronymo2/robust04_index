			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Bonuses static at GA and Friends Provident General Accident and Friends Provident began the 1994 round of with-profits endowment bonus announcements with maturity values for 25-year policies only marginally changed. The value of a 25-year GA endowment maturing on January 1 this year is Pounds 65,604, an increase of 0.2 per cent on last year. The figure uses the standard industry assumptions of a policy started by a man aged 29 paying Pounds 30 monthly premiums. General Accident's pay-out on a 10-year endowment, based on the same assumptions, slipped 0.4 per cent to Pounds 6,567, after a drop of 6.2 per cent last year. Many insurers have cut bonuses in recent years to compensate for over-generosity in the past. However, Mr David Heslop, marketing actuary for GA Life, said the company's pay-outs on endowment policies were now at a sustainable level, roughly in line with their asset share. Friends Provident's 25-year pay-out is up 0.2 per cent at Pounds 61,636, while its 10-year pay-out is down 2.5 per cent at Pounds 6,709. Friends Provident said it expected lower investment returns in the future would reduce bonus rates, but this year's excellent investment returns allowed bonus rates to be maintained.</p>

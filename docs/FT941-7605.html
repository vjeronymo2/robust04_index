			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Tories join Commons assault on army job cuts The government came under heavy cross-party fire at Westminster yesterday over a new round of army redundancies. Tory backbenchers joined MPs from the leading opposition parties to attack the 7,000 job losses made under the third phase of a redundancy programme to reduce the size of the army. There was particular concern about the prospect of redundancies among officers and other ranks serving in Bosnia. Downing Street officials said last night that the number of compulsory redundancies among troops in Bosnia would 'only just' run into double figures. Redundancies would be 'across the board'. It would be the same for troops serving in Northern Ireland and elsewhere as it would be for those in Bosnia. Giving details of the cuts in a parliamentary written answer, Mr Jeremy Hanley, armed forces minister, said tht the number of compulsory redundancies would total just over 1,000. All those selected would be notified today. Mr Winston Churchill, a Tory member of the cross-party Commons defence committee, said: 'We are strongly opposed, on an all-party committee basis, to these cuts.' Mr Churchill said the committee did not regard the cuts as inevitable. The committee had 'called on the government last year not only to cease these cuts but possibly to reverse them'. He added: 'I happen to be opposed to all these redundancies, but the fact is that if one is going to have redundancies it is regrettably impossible to be selective as between those who happen at any moment to be in Northern Ireland, the Falklands, Cyprus or, as the case may be, Bosnia.' Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said it was 'outrageous' that British troops would be 'sacked' while they were risking their lives in Bosnia. The government was 'badly mismanaging British military forces'. What was needed was a full defence review rather than 'arbitrary cuts imposed by the Treasury'. Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said the cuts were 'foolish and insensitive'.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PICKETERS DEMAND GM PLEDGE TO RETAIN PLANT  </P> <P> General Motors auto workers demonstrated Thursday outside GM's long-embattled  Van Nuys plant, demanding that the company make a formal commitment to keep the  plant open or face a consumer boycott campaign against its cars.  </P> <P> The status of the Van Nuys plant, which employs about 3,600 workers and is one  of only two remaining auto assembly plants in California, was thrown into limbo  two months ago when GM formally confirmed years of speculation that the plant  would not be chosen to build the next generation of Chevrolet Camaro and  Pontiac Firebirds in the early 1990s.  </P> <P> A GM spokesman said Thursday that the march was premature because the  corporation has no stated intent of closing the plant. Executives say they are  studying options for the plant, including converting it to a "flexible"  facility that would build a variety of models.  </P></p>

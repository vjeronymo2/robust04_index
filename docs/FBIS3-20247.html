			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Freedom Alliance, which brings together the main  groupings on the Center-right, has won the elections, the first  using the new electoral system. Silvio Berlusconi and Forza  Italia, Gianfranco Fini and the National Alliance, and Umberto  Bossi and the Northern League, won -- according to the latest  projections -- an absolute majority of seats in the Chamber of  Deputies and most probably also in the Senate, even if  projections for the Senate only give the Alliance a relative  majority rather than an absolute one.    The Left, which was grouped around the Progessive Alliance,  was defeated. The Center, led by Mario Segni and Mino  Martinazzoli, was also penalized. Unless there is a major  surprise, the Italian Socialist Party, La Rete, Democratic  Alliance, and the Greens will be without a quorum in the new  parliament.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW &amp; USEFUL: CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> CHIPS OFF THE PINE BLOCK AS FIRE STARTER  </P> <P> From the manufacturer that offered Fire Flakes charcoal barbecue starter last  summer, there's a new winter warmer: Fire Flakes Wood Fire Starter, which makes  lighting that comfy fireplace blaze is a simple task.  </P> <P> The flakes, specially cut pine wood chips covered with paraffin wax, replace  newspapers or kindling. They come in separate 2.2-oz. packages -- seven to a  box. Pop a packet under the firewood, light and you should have a nice fire in  15 minutes, says Chuck Aydelotte, of the Chevron Chemical Co.  </P> <P> Fire Flakes are not combustible so there's no problem storing them; they don't  give off harmful fumes when burned. Suggested retail price for a box is $2.59.  They are available only at groceries in Los Angeles, Denver, Milwaukee, Salt  Lake City and St. Louis. In Los Angeles, they're carried at Albertson's, Alpha  Beta, Lucky, Vons, Boys, Hughes and Pavilions markets.  </P> <P> Consumers who want to try Fire Flakes may write the company to obtain a free  sample -- Fire Flakes, 2445 S. Gearhart Ave., Fresno 93725.  </P> <P> A Dust Buster for Delicate Items  </P> <P> Dust-Off Plus is just the ticket for photographers, computer operators or  owners of VCRs, CD players and other electronic equipment. It's a canned  cleaning gas that whisks away damaging lint, dust and dirt.  </P> <P> Manufacturered by Falcon Safety Products in New Jersey, Dust-Off Plus leaves no  residue and adds no moisture to a surface. It contains no chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs) that damage the ozone layer.  </P> <P> The new duster uses what is called a Vector Valve, which sweeps in 360-degree  circles, making it possible to direct the dry gas into hard-to-reach areas.  </P> <P> Dust-Off Plus is available nationwide in photography, office supply and other  retail stores at a suggested price of $36.95 for a 12-oz. can with the Vector  Valve; $9.25 for refills. In Los Angeles you can purchase it at Samy's Camera  on Beverly Boulevard, Pan-Pacific Camera on North La Brea Avenue and Frank's  Highland Park Camera on North Figueroa Street. If you can't find it in your  area, contact Falcon Safety Products Inc., 25 Chubb Way, P.O. Box 1299,  Somerville, N.J. 08876.  </P> <P> Putting the Lid on Marriage Disputes  </P> <P> LidAlert is a small alarmlike device that affixes to the commode and plays  "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" when the toilet's flushed but the lid isn't  lowered.  </P> <P> Sure, it might sound like a gag gift. But it could be a help in ending the long  battle between men and women over lowering the toilet seat. It also can help  keep a child or pet out of the toilet bowl. The 2 1/2-inch long, 1 1/2-inch  wide device comes equipped with a lifetime battery.  </P> <P> "When I started to develop the idea, the feedback that I received from women  was tremendous," said its inventor, Blake Warrington, a Dublin, Calif.,  firefighter. "I was told that it would save marriages and is the next best  thing to having separate bathrooms."  </P> <P> Suggested retail for LidAlert is $19.95. In Southern California, it is  available at Broadway department stores. If you can't find it in your area, you  can order it from Kaleidosphere Inc., 7400 Center Ave., Suite 105, Huntington  Beach 92647; phone (800) 433-8900.  </P> <P> A Lure That Will Never Get Away  </P> <P> For the anglers in the family, there's FISH-ON Lure Hunter, a new retrieval  system that keeps them from losing their favorite lure.  </P> <P> Constructed of metal to withstand harsh outdoor conditions, the Lure Hunter  includes a 6 1/2-oz. plated zinc retrieval head that can be easily affixed to a  line.  </P> <P> It descends directly to the point where the knot is tied. There is a circle of  seven stainless-steel teeth that catches the eyelet of the lure or swivel snap.  Once hooked up, the system has 50 feet of 150-pound nylon line spooled on a  one-piece weatherproof handle. When not in use, the compact device fits snugly  in a tackle box.  </P> <P> The Lure Hunter system retails for about $24.95 and is sold nationwide in  fishing and tackle shops and sporting goods stores. In the Los Angeles area, it  is available at West Marine Products in Long Beach and Marina del Rey. If you  can't find it in your area, contact the manufacturer, Tempress Inc., 701 S.

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average declines by 2.1 per cent TOKYO fell back sharply in the final session of the year, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The 225-share Nikkei average closed down 360.69, or 2.1 per cent at 16,924.95 on index-linked selling after a day's high of 17,254.04 and a day's low of 16,891.94. The market will remain closed until January 4. Turnover was about 90m shares traded compared to 130m on Tuesday. Declining issues outpaced advancing by seven to two, with 698 lower, 193 higher and 187 unchanged in volume of some 90m shares. The broader first section Topix index lost 18.72 or 1.4 per cent to 1,307.66 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.01 to 1,066.65. The market opened at its morning high, succumbing immediately to futures-linked selling. Disappointment that a hoped-for year-end rally had failed to materialise, combined with overnight losses on Wall Street, also weighed on sentiment, brokers said. 'Some people clung to the hope that US pension fund money might kick in during the morning, and when this didn't happen they just gave up,' one broker commented. High technology issues were mostly lower with NEC falling Y6 to Y681, Fujitsu Y9 to Y550 and Pioneer Y100 to Y2,670. In the banking sector Daiichi slipped Y80 to Y1,670, Sakura Y60 to Y1,200, Sumitomo Y40 to Y1,810 and Fuji Y70 to Y1,800. Isuzu bucked the trend, extending recent gains to end up Y14 at Y332. Large capital issues were down on profit-taking: Nippon Steel shed Y2 to Y292 and Mitsubishi Heavy Y15 to Y530. The second section index advanced 3.23 to 1,730.65, with 2.4m shares traded. Roundup THE region was generally dull yesterday with both Seoul and Taiwan closed until January 4. HONG KONG was featureless in slow trade. The Hang Seng index gained 23.76 to 5,467.89 in low turnover of HKDollars 1.3bn. Investors concentrated on banks and utilities with HSBC Holdings gaining 50 cents to HKDollars 55, Hang Seng Bank rising HKDollars 1.00 to HK52.50 and Bank of East Asia firming 25 cents to HKDollars 34. AUSTRALIA lost ground slightly, although news earlier in the week that BHP had signed a contract to develop an oilfield off the south coast of Vietnam helped to lift sentiment. The All Ordinaries index slipped 0.8 to 1,538.2 in turnover of ADollars 138.8m. BHP rose 4 cents to ADollars 13.28. In the banking sector ANZ put on 5 cents to ADollars 3.01, National Australia advanced 1 cent to ADollars 7.52 and Commonwealth improved 3 cents to ADollars 6.04.

The NZSE-40 index advanced 6.53 to 1,564.04, but off the day's high of 1,570.38, in turnover of some NZDollars 18m.

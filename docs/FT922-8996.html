			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / BCCI auditor scorns fraud claim PRICE WATERHOUSE, auditor to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, yesterday dismissed as 'outrageous' an accusation of fraud made on behalf of two Omani depositors with the bank. Zaiwalla &amp; Co, a London-based firm of solicitors representing the depositors, is applying to the High Court for leave to amend its statement of claim alleging negligence so that it also includes deceit in relation to the Price Waterhouse auditing of the BCCI accounts. Price Waterhouse said last night: 'These charges are absolutely outrageous and have no grounds at all. We have never been fraudulent. If this ever comes to trial we have no doubt we can defend ourselves.' The request is due to be considered before a High Court judge on June 2 at the same time as Price Waterhouse argues that the entire action should be dismissed. It is brought on behalf of Mohammed Khasruzzaman and Rabha Khasruzzaman, who say they deposited Dollars 600,000 in BCCI in London after relying on the 1989 audited accounts of BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg). The news comes a week after Judge Consuelo Marshall in the central district of California court dismissed a class-action suit filed by US and other BCCI depositors against 77 defendants including Price Waterhouse. Mr Graham Stacy, the Price Waterhouse partner co-ordinating the firm's BCCI team, said: 'We are grateful to the US court that we can draw breath. This is a fair result.' However, Mr Bill Lerach, lead counsel to the plaintiffs and a partner with law firm Milberg Weiss, said yesterday he would be acting early next week to 'vacate' the judge's opinion. If that action fails, the plaintiffs will appeal to the ninth circuit court of appeals in San Francisco. That could take up to 18 months, but they will request a rapid hearing.</p>

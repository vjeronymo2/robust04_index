			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Patents claims hit parallel importers in Japan Japan's parallel importers, which import branded goods through third parties rather than through licensed distributers, are being challenged under an increasing number of patent infringement claims by manufacturers. A row between Chiyoda Sports, the Japanese sports equipment retailer, and Nordica, the Italian ski equipment manufacturer, has become the latest case in which a manufacturer has tried to stop the distribution of cheaper parallel imported products by alleging the importer had violated intellectual property rights. Tokyo customs officials have banned Chiyoda from importing Nordica ski boots from European wholesalers. The Italian company claims that only a licensee can distribute the product, which uses a patented buckle. Chiyoda, on the other hand, argues that Nordica is misusing the licence to quash efforts to offer consumers cheaper products. 'They're just doing it to stop competition. It's overstretching patent rights and very unfair to the consumer,' said Mr Yoshikazu Miyakoshi, president of Chiyoda. Chiyoda, which has been selling parallel imports of US and European ski equipment for more than 10 years, was planning to sell the ski boots at Y33,000 (Dollars 330.00) The same product imported by Nordica Japan, the manufacturer's Japanese subsidiary, costs around Y55,000 while it is sold at Y27,800 in Italy. The ministry of finance, which oversees the customs office, says the ban on Chiyoda's imports of Nordica ski boots was implemented according to the patent law. 'Patent guidelines are oriented towards protecting industries,' it said. Meanwhile the country's Fair Trade Commission said Nordica's claims did not breach anti-trust guidelines. Other companies which have won bans on parallel imports based on patent licensing claims include Ajinomoto, the leading Japanese maker of monosodium glutamate (MSG). It said that parallel imports of MSG from the company's south-east Asian production lines did not contain a special patented acid and could 'confuse' the Japanese consumers' palate. The customs office has also banned parallel imports of agro-chemicals by Monsanto, a US chemicals maker. While the ministry of finance says it is not trying to stop parallel imports, some importers are wary of a clampdown by large overseas manufacturers. They claim that such manoeuvres by the ministry of finance go against efforts by the ministry of international trade and industry, which is promoting parallel importing as a means to reduce Japan's mounting trade surplus.</p>

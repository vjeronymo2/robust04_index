			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / International Company News: Weak Japanese recovery hits results at steelmakers The weakness of Japan's economic recovery and worldwide competition put pressure on the country's integrated steel makers, which reported disappointing half-year results and passed their interim dividends. Losses by the five large steel companies more than doubled in aggregate at the recurring level, but analysts pointed out that recovery is on the way. The companies expect restructuring to result in a substantial improvement in the second half, enabling them to cut losses substantially or return to profitability. 'The benefits of restructuring will definitely come through in the second half, so we believe we will be able to make a small profit,' Nippon Steel said. Nevertheless, the companies warned that the outlook for the second half remained uncertain. Private capital spending in Japan is not expected to pick up strongly and the foreign exchange situation is still unpredictable. In the first half, firm demand from overseas markets, particularly the US, failed to make up for the fall in capital spending in the Japanese market, the impact of falling unit prices and the high yen. There was a moderate pick-up in demand from the motor vehicle and electrical industries, but falling steel prices prevented the companies from reaping the benefits of the upturn. Large domestic users in the shipbuilding, automotive and electrical industries have pointed to the price differential between Japanese steelmakers and those based overseas, such as in Brazil and Korea, and requested price cuts from domestic suppliers. The differential has been widened by the yen's continuing rise against other leading currencies. Domestic manufacturers have generally complied with the requests, partly because 'the quality of Korean steel, in particular, is improving,' noted an official at Sumitomo Metal Industries, which reduced unit prices by 8 per cent in the period.

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURERS WIN UPGRADE ISSUE  </P> <P> Insurance companies are not bound to cover extra construction costs mandated by  new building codes when paying damages on insured structures, the state Supreme  Court has ruled.  </P> <P> The decision could have implications for many San Francisco Bay area residents  whose homes were damaged in October's Loma Prieta earthquake.  </P> <P> At issue was whether the insured or the insurer should pay for upgrading older  structures to current code after they are damaged. The upgrades often add  substantially to reconstruction costs.  </P> <P> Locke and Sumire McCorkle of Mill Valley filed the failed suit against State  Farm Fire and Casualty Co. after the firm refused to pay the full replacement  cost for a garage destroyed in a 1986 fire.  </P> <P> Replacement cost was estimated at $29,350. However, a new code forced the  McCorkle's to install a cement floor and foundation in place of the old wooden  floor, which raised the cost to $58,448.  </P> <P> State Farm refused to pay the additional cost, saying it was obligated to pay  only for "equivalent construction."  </P> <P> The state Court of Appeal ruled in State Farm's favor in June, and the  McCorkles appealed to the Supreme Court, which ruled this month.  </P></p>

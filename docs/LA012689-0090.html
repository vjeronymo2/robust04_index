			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: CERRITOS;  </P> <P> GAHR HIGH WILL GET FREE SATELLITE TV PROGRAM  </P> <P> The ABC Unified School District board has unanimously approved a proposal by a  Tennessee publishing company to conduct a test of a satellite television  program at Gahr High School in Cerritos.  </P> <P> "This is a gift that we're blessed to participate in. We are very excited about  the possibilities," said Nadine Barreto, Gahr principal speaking on behalf of  the school.  </P> <P> Whittle Communications, a publishing company that is branching into  telecommunications, selected Gahr as one of six high school participants from a  cross-country search.  </P> <P> As a participant, Gahr will broadcast a daily 12-minute current events program  for 25 days with a format similar to nationally televised morning talk shows.  The goal is to increase students' awareness of world events and geography.  </P> <P> "It is a way to bring the world into the classroom," Barreto said.  </P> <P> Beginning March 6, teen-age anchors will present the combination news and  features show, that contains four 30-second commercials from Ford and Levi  Strauss, to all classrooms at Gahr. The commercials are the source of funding  for the equipment and "are being done in good taste," said Barreto, who also  has the right to preview them.  </P> <P> A satellite dish, master VCR and 25-inch television monitors in 85 classrooms  are being installed at Gahr at no expense to the district. Whittle officials  say the company will donate the equipment to the school at the conclusion of  the test period that is scheduled to end April 28.  </P></p>

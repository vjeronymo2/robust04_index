			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Ratners targets costs after losses swell to Pounds 31m RATNERS GROUP continued to struggle in the face of recession in the first half as pre-tax losses swelled from Pounds 17.7m to Pounds 30.6m, writes John Thornhill. However, Mr James McAdam, chairman of the jewellery group, said that although 'there were no signs of an easing of recessionary trading conditions' operating margins were significantly higher than last year's levels as a result of severe cost-cutting. A comprehensive business review had led to Pounds 19m of cost reductions in the first half, with Pounds 50m of savings expected in the full year. Mr McAdam also promised that in the critical Christmas period Ratners would place more emphasis on service and quality. Last year, the company indulged in massive discounting, which boosted sales but savaged margins. Sales in the period to August 1 fell to Pounds 365m (Pounds 450m). Trading losses of the UK stores' jumped to Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 11.7m) on sales of Pounds 185m (Pounds 232m). But in the US, although sales slipped to Pounds 179m (Pounds 219m), operating profits rose from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 5.17m. Group trading loss jumped to Pounds 18m (Pounds 7.13m) and interest took Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 11.2m). An extraordinary profit of Pounds 1.1m came from the disposal of Watches of Switzerland. Losses per share amounted to 11.3p (7.3p). Ratners is not paying an interim dividend and is still rolling up payments on its preference shares.</p>

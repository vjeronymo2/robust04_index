			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Liu Xianri (0491 7639 2480) and </F> XINHUA reporter Lu Yongjian (7773 3057 1696)]    [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- A five-day State  Council conference on the resettlement of residents of areas  affected by the Three Gorges project ended today. Zou Jiahua,  vice premier of the State Council, and Qian Zhengying, vice  chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference, attended the conference. In  his speech summing up the conference, Chen Junsheng, state  councillor and vice chairman of the Three Gorges Project  Construction Committee, stressed that various localities and  departments should fully understand the importance of resettling  the residents of the areas affected by the Three Gorges project,  accurately understand and implement the resettlement principles,  and properly handle the following relationships so as to ensure  the appropriate settlement of those residents:    First, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship  between the construction of the Three Gorges project and  economic development. The construction of this project will  bring an unprecedented opportunity for the economic development  of the areas along the Three Gorges. Moreover, with the  implementation of preferential policies adopted by the state, it  is bound to attract large amounts of funds from abroad and other  parts of the country. This will be conducive to the economic  development of the areas along the Three Gorges and to opening  those areas to the outside world. We should "think about and  look forward to the construction of the Three Gorges project,"  but we should not "be a drag on the project and just take  advantage of it."    Second, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship  between the construction of the Three Gorges project and the  distribution of productive forces across the country. The  construction of the project is not only the business of Sichuan  and Hubei provinces but the common undertaking of the people  throughout the country. It is an unshirkable responsibility and  obligation of people in all trades and professions to support  the construction of the Three Gorges project and the  resettlement of those residents affected by the project.    Third, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship  between migration and local economic development. We should  clearly define the near-term goal of migration and the long-term  objective of economic development in the resettlement areas and  combine the former with the latter.    Fourth, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship  between agriculture on the one hand, and the secondary and  tertiary industries on the other. Most residents affected by  the Three Gorges project should be resettled in rural areas. In  migrating people to rural areas, stress should be placed on  agriculture. In areas with the necessary conditions, efforts  should be made to develop the processing of agricultural and  sideline products, transportation, service trade, and other  secondary and tertiary industries according to local conditions  in order to increase job opportunities for migrants.    Fifth, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship  between settling problems on the spot and resettling people in  other areas. We should implement the principle of resettling  those people in areas close to the Three Gorges reservoir area  and settling problems on the spot. When people from rural areas  cannot be resettled this way, they may migrate to other areas;  but the funds for this purpose should not exceed the  compensation standard set by the state or the budgetary estimate  approved by it.    Sixth, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship  between support given by relevant departments and mutual  benefit. Various localities and departments should first give  consideration to support, but such support is not given without  compensation. In actual work, it is essential to give support  on the principle of being mutually complementary and beneficial,  and working together for development from a long-term point of  view.    Seventh, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship  between the central and local authorities. In resettling the  residents affected by the Three Gorges project, we should  implement a resettlement management system under which "the  central authorities exercise unified leadership, with provinces  assuming their respective responsibilities and counties acting  as the basic unit." By exercising unified leadership, it means  that the central authorities mainly exercise leadership in  principle and policy, and perform their functions in macro  regulation and control. Assuming their respective  responsibilities by provinces, with counties acting as the basic  unit, means that, from now on, provinces should have full  authority to handle matters that should be handled by them, in  order to fully arouse the enthusiasm of local authorities. A  responsibility system should be instituted from the central to  local levels.    In concluding, Chen Junsheng stressed that it is most  important to first resettle residents of the areas affected by  the Three Gorges Dam. All the residents in the areas within 15  square kilometers of the dam construction site should be  migrated to other areas by the end of next year. Measures  should be taken now to ensure that they will pass the winter  safely.</p>

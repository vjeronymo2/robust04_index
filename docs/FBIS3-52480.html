			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dhaka, Jan 2 (AFP) -- The Bangladesh taka was  devalued Sunday against the US dollar to minimise the trade gap  and increase exports, an official of the Bangladesh Bank said.    The central bank, in a statement, said the new exchange rate  was fixed at 39.97 taka for buying and 40.17 taka for selling,  effective Sunday, a normal working day in Muslim Bangladesh.  The previous rates were 39.75 taka and 39.99 taka.    The FINANCIAL EXPRESS newspaper said that although the taka  was "very stable," the devaluation would minimise the trade gap  and increase exports.    In the year to December 1993, the taka was devalued by two  per cent, the newspaper said.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Tokyo money supply grows meagre 0.9% JAPAN'S money supply expanded by a record low of 0.9 per cent in June, compared to the same month last year, and grew by an average of a meagre 1.2 per cent during the second quarter, the Bank of Japan said yesterday. The growth was lower than expected by the central bank, which insisted there were adequate funds available to fuel economic recovery, though industry representatives called for another cut in official interest rates to boost the economy. Bank of Japan officials did admit that the economy appeared to be in its 'most severe' stage of adjustment, and that demand for funds was unexpectedly weak. The bank prefers to use a broader money supply measure, M3 plus certificates of deposits, which includes postal savings, an important influence in Japan. By that measure, the year-on-year growth in June was 4 per cent, down from 4.3 per cent in May. The previous record low for M2 plus certificates of deposit was 1.1 per cent in May, while the expansion in the first quarter was 1.7 per cent, significantly higher than the second quarter figure. With evidence accumulating that the recovery will not come as expected in the autumn, the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai) yesterday called for a quick reduction in the official discount rate, which was lowered by the central bank by 0.75 per cent to 3.75 per cent on April 1.</p>

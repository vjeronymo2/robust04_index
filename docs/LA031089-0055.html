			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A student demonstration that had forced the resignation of Republican National  Committee Chairman Lee Atwater from Howard University's board of trustees ended  when the university granted the students' demands. The students left the  administration building around 4 a.m., following several hours of negotiations  involving the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Washington Mayor Marion Barry and Walter  Fauntroy, the district's non-voting delegate in Congress. The demonstration  ended after university officials delivered a letter promising that students  will not be punished for participating in the action. Atwater resigned Tuesday,  saying he was worried the occupation might lead to injuries.  </P></p>

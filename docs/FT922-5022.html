			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Letter: Rates burden having destructive effect on empty properties Sir, The present 'empty rates' regime is leading to a depressing bout of destruction similar to that of the 1980s when roofs were taken off factories to escape liability for rates. Industrial property and warehouses have since become exempt, but offices remain liable. We know of one major plc currently thinking of 'stripping out' an office block in the City in order to avoid a rate liability of Pounds 1.5m. The property would have little potential for redevelopment even in a bullish market. The current state of the market makes it virtually unlettable. The government must act immediately to stop this destructive course. The period of grace should be extended from three months to one year and the liability itself reduced to 40 per cent followed by further phased reductions. Unless action is taken, this highly destructive process of 'stripping out' is bound to continue. Such a situation does little to enhance the image of our system of business taxation, the prestige of the City of London and the position of business ratepayers generally. The Non-Domestic Rating Bill currently before parliament will do much to help businesses suffering from the combined effect of the introduction of the uniform business rate and the 1990 revaluation. But the bill offers no help to those businesses facing huge liabilities for property which is unoccupied. Empty rate liability - currently 50 per cent of the total liability following a three-month period of grace after occupation ceases - was introduced to discourage developers from deliberately keeping property empty. The notorious case of Centre Point in the 1960s highlighted the problem. Since then, however, times have changed and nobody welcomes having empty property on their hands. The collapse of the commercial property market - the effects of which have been particularly marked in the City of London - has thrown the unfairness of empty rate liability into stark relief.

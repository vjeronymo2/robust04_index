			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Germany's gas rivals end three-year dispute Arch-rivals in the German gas industry last night called a temporary truce after a contract guaranteeing long-term Russian gas deliveries to eastern Germany was signed in Leipzig. The contract ends a bitter three-year dispute in which Wintershall, a subsidiary of BASF, Germany's largest chemical group, attempted to weaken the east German gas monopoly held by Verbundnetzgas, the regional gas transmission company. It is also seen as a victory for Wintershall, which is poised to play a more important part in the German gas industry, despite strong resistance from Ruhrgas, which holds 70 per cent of the western German gas market, and other German gas distributors. Under the terms of the 20-year contract, VNG will buy gas from Wintershall Erdgas Handelshaus, or WIEH, Wintershall's trading house. Annual deliveries will rise from 3.5bn cubic metres to 7bn cubic metres after 1999. In the process, VNG has secured a supplier and Wintershall has secured a buyer for its gas. Until 1990, natural gas accounted for less than 9.5 per cent of eastern Germany's primary energy consumption. It was delivered through two Russian gas pipe lines - Yamburg, which delivered 3.1bn cubic metres a year, and Orenburg, which delivered 2.8bn cubic metres to the region. The contracts had been made between the former east German and Soviet governments, with VNG acting only as a distributor. Everything changed after unification. The Yamburg contract - which is due to expire in 1998 - and the Orenburg contract were taken over by the German federal government, which assigned them to VNG. VNG had been privatised by the Treuhand privatisation agency. But the carve-up of its shares weighted against Wintershall, British Gas and Elf Aquitaine, which combined hold 25 per cent of VNG, in favour of Ruhrgas and other west German gas distributors which hold the majority. However, Gasprom, the former Soviet gas ministry, which was selling on behalf of the Soviet and later the Russian government, insisted it would no longer accept old - and lower - prices from VNG for any new gas deliveries from the Orenburg pipe line. At issue was not only price; it was also a question of who would control Russian gas supplies to eastern Germany. After VNG declined to pay more, Gasprom and Wintershall set up a joint venture - the WIEH trading house, with Gasprom holding a 30 per cent stake. Gasprom gave WIEH both the right to market Orenburg's gas - if necessary through Wintershall's new pipe lines - and influence over gas prices. After endless arguments and short contract deliveries by WIEH to VNG, both sides last night called a truce. 'It has been a difficult dispute,' a Wintershall official said. 'But if you want to create competition in this country, you need a lot of energy in order to fight your way into it.'</p>

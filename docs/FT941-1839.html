			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussels' cheese-paring irritates Italians - John Simkins reports on resistance to a proposal to reduce the country's milk quota Italy's milk producers are strongly resisting a proposal by the European Commission to reduce an increase in their quota just as they believe they are getting back on track after years of over-production. Their anger is directed at Mr Rene Steichen, the agriculture commissioner, who has decided that an agreed increase of 900,000 tonnes in Italy's annual milk quota, taking it to a total of 9.9m tonnes, should be reduced by 350,000 tonnes in 1994-95. A hot reception awaited Mr Steichen earlier this month when he was to attend the opening of Italy's agricultural trade fair in Verona, but the commissioner had second thoughts and stayed away. In response, Italy's three big farming associations also boycotted the event. However, the producers are likely to confront him at Brussels on March 28 and 29 when the European Union's agriculture ministers will discuss the Italian quota. Italy, which is a net importer of milk, admits to having violated milk quotas for much of the 1980s and Denmark, Britain and the Netherlands were reluctant to see its quota increased. But the 9.9m tonne quota was granted in the light of Italian commitments to bring production down from an estimated 11.5m to 9.9m by the end of March 1995. As a first stage, Italy was expected to reduce production to 10.6m by the end of this month. The commission believes Italy is not meeting the demands made of it. Whereas Spain and Greece have had quota increases confirmed - the latter only provisionally - it has therefore shaved Italy's. The decision will make it easier for the commission to win the approval of the 12 EU countries for a suggested 1 per cent cut in quotas in 1994-95. 'The market is fragile and balance is maintained by quotas on the one hand and subsidising outlets on the other,' according to a spokesman for the agriculture commissioner. 'There is no guarantee the balance will continue and there is a serious danger of intervention stocks building up without the cut in quota.' Mr Alfredo Diana, Italy's agriculture minister, retorts that Mr Steichen has acted too hastily and that Italy had until the end of this month to present evidence of the results of a costly overhaul by the ministry, which has subjected 130,000 milk producers to quota controls. The Italians hope that this data will enable Mr Steichen to amend his proposal and he is in close touch with Mr Diana. However, if the cut is confirmed, Italy may face more financial penalties on top of the L2,800bn (Pounds 1.12bn) that Confagricoltura, the farming association, estimates it must pay for violating past quotas. The herd-by-herd examination revealed widespread abuses, such as quotas being claimed by defunct businesses, which disqualified 35,000 farms. The commission claims that at one time quotas were issued for over 12m tonnes, compared with production estimated by the Italians at 11.5m, and Confagricoltura admits that the abuses date back to a period when Italy 'paid too little attention to quotas'. Mr Steichen has complimented Mr Diana on the progress made but it is only in the past 18 months that Italy has signalled a serious attempt to get output in line with quotas. Italy has always objected to the system, mainly because it imports 60 per cent of its annual 18m tonne consumption and has not wished to curb development of its domestic producers. Production is concentrated in the north and transport costs make fresh milk expensive in much of the south. 'It seems nonsense to cut 350,000 tonnes of quotas from a country that imports,' says Mr Walter Luchetti, a director general at the agriculture ministry. Mr Luchetti rejects suggestions that Mr Diana's efforts to reduce production have met with resistance within Italy's fragmented milk industry. 'Our producers have accepted the regulations and are making great efforts to comply,' he says. Confagricoltura says that much of Italy's milk is used to make cheese, which is not in surplus in the EU, and is sceptical about the effectiveness of quotas as a method of balancing the market. 'But we are serious about resolving the milk issue because this is essential to give us negotiating influence in other agriculture reforms,' says the association.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Big increase seen in life expectancy THE STARTLING scale of lifestyle changes in Britain over the last 20 years is underlined in the latest government statistics, which show big increases in life expectancy and in travel and leisure habits. Life expectancy for men jumped from 68.6 years in 1970 to 72.8 in 1990, and life expectancy for women from 74.9 to 78.2. In 1970 only 4.7 per cent of the population was aged over 75, but this had risen to 6.9 per cent 20 years later. Women still outnumbered men by 1.4m in 1990, although this was down from the 1.6m 20 years before. Average earnings rose more than tenfold, from Pounds 26 a week to Pounds 263  -but what a pound would have bought in 1970 would have cost Pounds 6.80 in 1990. The period also saw a growing taste for travel, both at home and abroad. Air travel showed the biggest increase - up from 2bn passenger kilometres in 1970 to 5.1bn in 1990. Overseas travel became more popular in spite of the fact that Britain showed signs of getting warmer. At home the average daytime temperature in England and Wales rose from 10.10C in 1970 to 11.10C in 1990. In Scotland temperatures rose from 8.30C to 9.30C. and in Ulster from 9.10C to 9.80C. Rainfall declined in England and Wales over the period, although the pattern was not consistent. There was 910mm of rainfall in 1970, rising to 979mm in 1980 before dropping to 814mm in 1989 and 838mm in 1990. Government Statistics 1992. United Kingdom in Figures.

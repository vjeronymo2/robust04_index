			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / German toxic rules blocked The European Court of Justice has overturned a Brussels decision to allow Germany to apply more stringent rules than its EU partners on the use of pentachlorophenol (PCP), a toxic chemical used for hardening wood and treating textiles and paper. Officials say this is a test case of an EU treaty article designed to ensure that member states can, under certain circumstances, act to protect public health and the environment even when it could conflict with the free movement of goods within Europe's single market. Four governments including Germany's were outvoted on the 1991 modification of the toxic substances legislation, but in 1992 Brussels gave Germany a derogation, or time-limited exemption, for its tougher domestic rules. France launched a complaint, and the court has now upheld it, arguing that Brussels has failed to establish that the EU treaty's safeguard article applies in this case. Commission officials say they will now have to go back to the court, or risk the treaty safeguards being brought into discredit.</p>

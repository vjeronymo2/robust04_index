			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (10): Beating on the EC's doors 'THE thrust of this agreement,' says the Polish government of the association arrangement now under negotiation with the European Community, 'is to open Europe for Poland and Poland for Europe. It is therefore an agreement of historical importance.' So, indeed, it is. Correspondingly, the first and perhaps most fundamental government demand has been that the agreement commit the EC to the principle of Polish membership. As a step towards that aim, but also to underpin its economic reforms, Poland seeks a free trade area with the EC 'for essentially all products', one that would ensure stability of market access for Polish exports (about half of which already go to the EC) and would also enable Poland to maintain the 'open import system that we now enjoy'. The latter is no trivial demand since, at present, Poland's import regime is more liberal than that of the EC. Confronted with a political challenge of the first magnitude, the EC counts ears of wheat and votes of farmers. In his statement to the EC of March 19, 1991, Mr Andrzej Olechowski, secretary of state at the Ministry for Foreign Economic Co-operation, condemned the resulting proposals on trade, as 'a highly unbalanced proposal. 'On one side, it asks Poland to commit itself to eliminate before the end of the agreement all restrictions on imports from the EC, limit and discipline the use of safeguard measures and strengthen protection afforded to intellectual property. On the other side, it offers Poland removal of import restrictions pertaining to about one half of its exports (since it excludes most of agriculture, textiles and clothing, and steel) and the assurance of GATT-consistent use of safeguards also covering only half of the products it exports. 'There is no government in the world which would submit such a one-sided agreement to its parliament for ratification,' concluded the Polish negotiator. In its response to the EC, the Polish government proposed the following: Customs duties for all products to be removed at the latest by the end of the agreement's second stage (after ten years), but the EC would consolidate tariff preferences and remove duties for selected agricultural, textiles and steel products upon initiation of the agreement, while Poland would remove duties on all products that it does not produce; Upon initiation of the agreement the EC would remove quantitative restrictions for all products (so matching Poland), while Poland would undertake not to introduce such restrictions on imports from the EC; Gradual reduction of variable levies on agricultural imports from Poland and gradual removal of minimum prices for agricultural and iron and steel products, while Poland would undertake not to impose countervailing duties on EC's officially dumped exports; Adjustment of protection of intellectual property by Poland to EC standards; and Agreement on mutual liberalisation of public contracts. How agonising it must be for the EC to confront a government that believes in both the EC and in free trade] Shamed perhaps, EC foreign ministers did decide on April 15 to go a little further towards meeting the demands of Poland (and of Czechoslovakia and Hungary as well). In particular, membership of the EC may now figure in the preamble to the agreements as 'an ultimate, though not an automatic' goal. The EC has also dropped its call for a review half-way through the 10-year period during which trade barriers are to be phased out. Eastern Europeans will probably be allowed to sell more fruit, vegetables, pork, game, but not - heaven forbid - cereals, beef, lamb or dairy products, which will continue to receive the full protection of the Common Agricultural Policy. Northern EC members also overruled Mediterranean objections to giving eastern Europe a little more on textiles and steel. All textile tariffs are to disappear over the 10-year transition period, while steel import duties and quotas will go within five years. But the country most concerned to keep out Polish coal was Germany, which insists upon a special regime. In spite of these steps forward, the agreement is likely to remain 'asymmetric' - on the EC's normal mercantilist logic - in the EC's favour. The EC's response is, it appears, to suggest that Poland increase its tariffs. No wonder the US is grumbling that eastern Europe will be persuaded to make a general increase in its tariffs, followed by a selective reduction only towards the EC. While an agreement is almost certain to be reached this year, the question remains what sort of an agreement it will be. The entry of Poland into closer trading relations with the EC could make the latter more liberal or the former more protectionist. Poland is in grave danger of losing this battle, to the disadvantage of both sides.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 30 May (MTI) -- The Monday [30 May]  edition of every Hungarian national daily gave extensive  coverage to the second round of parliamentary elections on  Sunday [29 May], reporting that the Hungarian Socialist Party  (MSZP) won an absolute majority in the new Parliament (54.15  percent of mandates according to unofficial results), with the  Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) in second place with 18.13  percent.    The newspapers note that the ruling Hungarian Democratic  Forum (MDF), with merely 9.59 percent of seats, will be now in  opposition.    Commentators give much attention to chances for Socialists  and Free Democrats forming a coalition, which would ensure them  a two- thirds majority. Several papers quote leading Socialist  politicians as saying that the MSZP plans a coalition government  and regards the Free Democrats as its natural ally.    NEPSZABADSAG says that large voter turnout at the elections  indicated the stability of Hungary's democratic system.    That so many voters placed their confidence in the Hungarian  Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Alliance of Free Democrats  (SZDSZ) is also important as a clear signal that the tasks lying  ahead for Hungary can only be accomplished by a government with  broad mass support. Therefore, what the decisive majority of  the politicking public wants today can be expressed by one word:  coalition, says the newspaper.    "The unavoidable economic measures can only be taken on a  very strong political basis. If it is missing, the government  will seek support to the detriment of rational economic  management, which would harm the country. The new government  stands to have a historic, and in all probability one-off,  chance, which must not end in disappointment. This is also a  common interest of all parliamentary parties," the commentator  of NEPSZABADSAG writes.    While considering big voter participation an important  indication of citizens" commitment to democratic elections, the  daily UJ MAGYARORSZAG is pessimistic about the possible  implications of a sweeping Socialist win.    "Initial unofficial returns showing an excessive Socialist  victory are disheartening not because of the defeat of  Christian- conservative forces, but because they foreshadow the  comeback of the one-party system. It is to be feared that the  brain trust of the Alliance of Free Democrats will be reluctant  to enter into a coalition, in which it would have weak  positions, and it may also happen - according to established  Eastern European custom - that the Socialist Party will not look  for partners at all. But this may elicit the SZDSZ's  resistance, and a really democratic Socialist party will no  longer be capable of stable government, since one or two  deputies may as well vote against their own party, and the thin  majority, shrinking from time to time, will create a new  political situation. It is also possible that new elections  will have to be called, which would be a tragedy. We are all in  the hands of the Socialists. We all are controlling the  Socialists. As long as we are allowed to do so," reads a  commentary in UJ MAGYARORSZAG.</p>

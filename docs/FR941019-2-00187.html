			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Applicants submit that the substantive ongoing obligations imposed on the independent directors of the Company provide significant protection to investors against possible conflicts of interest in co-investments by the applicants and the M.D. Sass Affiliates. Applicants also believe that the proposed conditions applicable to the operations of the Company governing the terms on which co-investments may be made and the disposition of investments held by any affiliate that co-invests with the Company (including the conditions set forth herein) are consistent with the policies underlying the Act and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that the order shall be subject to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Before a co-investment transaction is effected, the Investment Adviser must make an initial determination on behalf of the Company regarding investment suitability. Following this determination, the Investment Adviser will make a written investment presentation regarding the proposed co-investment to the independent directors of the Company. Such information will include the identity of each affiliate that proposes to co-invest with the Company (collectively, including the Company, the ``Co-Investors''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The independent directors of the Company will review the Investment Adviser's initial determination. In doing so, the independent directors will request such additional information from the Investment Adviser as they deem necessary to the exercise of their reasonable business judgment, and will employ such experts, including lawyers and accountants, as they deem appropriate. Prior to committing to a co-investment, a ``required majority'' (as defined in section 57(o) of the Act) of the independent directors of the Company must conclude that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The terms, of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the stockholders and the Company and do not involve overreaching of the stockholders and the Company on the part of any person concerned; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The transaction is consistent with the interests of the stockholders of the Company and is consistent with the investment objective and policies of the Company as recited in its Registration Statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 and subsequent reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The investment by one or more of the other Co-Investors would not disadvantage the Company in the making of such investment, maintaining its investment position, or disposing of such investment and that participation by the Company would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other Co-Investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The other Co-Investors will be permitted to invest only to the extent that the total investment opportunity exceeds the amount that the Company determines to invest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Co-Investments in securities by the Company with any other Co-Investor will consist of the same class of securities including the same registration rights (if any) and other rights related thereto, purchased at the same price on the same settlement date, and the approval of such transaction by the Company's independent directors will be made in the same time period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. If any Co-Investor determines to make an additional investment in an issuer whose securities were purchased in a co-investment transaction (a ``Follow-On Investment''), notice of the proposed Follow-On Investment will be given to the Company at the earliest practical time. Follow-on investments will be reviewed, approved, allocated, and disposed of in the same manner as prescribed for initial co-investments under these conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. No co-investment will be made in the securities of any entity if any Co-Investor has previously acquired a security issued by such entity provided that this prohibition shall not apply to Follow-On Investments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. If any Co-Investor elects to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any interest in a security purchased in a co-investment transaction, notice of the proposed disposition will be given to the Company at the earliest practical time. The Investment Adviser will provide a written recommendation to the independent directors of the Company concerning the proposed disposition. The Company will participate in the disposition at the same time as the other Co-Investors, on a proportionate basis, and on the same terms and conditions: provided that a required majority of the independent directors may decide that the Company will not participate in the proposed disposition or will dispose of less than its proportionate interest if they determine that such action is in the best interest of the Company, is reasonable and fair to the stockholders and the Company, and does not involve overreaching of the stockholders and the Company on the part of any person concerned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The independent directors of the Company will be provided quarterly for review all information concerning co-investment transactions made by the Co-Investors, including co-investment transactions in which the Company has declined to participate, so that they may determine whether all co-investment transactions made during the preceding quarter, including those co-investment transactions that were declined, complied with the conditions set forth above. In addition, the independent directors of the Company will consider at least quarterly the continuing appropriateness of the standards established for co-investment transactions by the Company, including whether use of the standards continues to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders and does not involve overreaching of the Company and its stockholders on the part of any party concerned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The independent directors of the Company will maintain the records described in section 57(f)(3) of the Act as if each of the transactions permitted under these conditions were approved by the independent directors of the Company under section 57(f). In addition, the Company will maintain, at its office, written records detailing the factors considered in each of its determinations or recommendations referred to in these conditions. All records referred to or required under these conditions will be available for inspection by the Commission and will be preserved permanently, the first two years in an easily accessible place. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. No independent director of the Company shall participate in the consideration of any aspect of a co-investment transaction if he is affiliated with an M.D. Sass Affiliate that proposes to participate or has participated in the transaction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

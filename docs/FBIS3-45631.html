Joke, currently president of the Revenue Court of France,  said previous decisions to sell arms to Taiwan were natural and  necessary decisions.    The French Government approved the sale of Lafayette-class  frigates and Mirage fighter planes to Taiwan during Joke's  service as defense minister.    Joke noted that when the French Government approved the arms  deal, it knew that it would be a long-term cooperation project.    Joke also said that when the Francois Mitterrand government  was weighing the possibilities of selling arms to Taiwan, he  submitted a report to Mitterrand based on his experience in the  Air Force.    He explained that the arms sale would not just include one  purchase, but also follow-up purchases and parts maintenance,  which require long-term cooperation.    He said that there is still plenty of room for Taipei-Paris  cooperation, especially in culture and trade.    Joke arrived here last Saturday. He will leave on Friday.    During his weeklong visit in Taiwan, Joke met with Vice  Premier Hsu Li-teh, presidents of the Control and Legislative  Yuans, and other officials. He also visited the National Palace  Museum.</p>

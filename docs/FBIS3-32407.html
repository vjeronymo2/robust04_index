			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by Brazilian Finance Minister </F> Fernando Henrique Cardoso from Planalto Palace in Brasilia on 7  February -- recorded]    [Text] Good evening ladies and gentlemen. In view of an  inflation rate of nearly 40 percent per month and the  difficulties being faced by the Brazilian people, the government  has sent to Congress an economic plan to defeat inflation.    This plan has three stages: first, it adjusts the  government's own accounting, reduces expenditures, and balances  the budget; second, it creates a stable monetary index, which is  known as the Real Value Unit, or URV, to adjust the prices of  our economy; third, it transforms this index into a new national  currency, which will be strong and guaranteed by the Central  Bank, thus reestablishing our currency's credibility and  defeating inflation.    Since my installation at the head of the Finance Ministry, I  have insisted that we should not fool the country by skipping  stages. We must first balance our budget. Unless we do that, it  will be impossible to definitively force inflation down. To put  a decisive end to inflation, the government cannot spend more  than it possesses. Otherwise, it will have to resort to the  banks and ask for loans or issue money and, as a result, we will  have more and more inflation. This is a simple accounting rule:  If I have 100, how can I spend 150? If I spend more than I have,  I will have to get money to cover the difference. When the  government prints money, it is the people who have to pay for  it. There is no doubt about that. When the inflation rate is  high, the common people lose more. The common people who have no  deposit accounts in the banks or even the possibility of having  a savings passbook are more affected because they have no way to  defend themselves from currency devaluation. They become poorer  by the day. President Itamar Franco's administration is doing  its best to balance its expenses and defeat inflation.    My friends, in this year's budget, the government reduced  the  expenditures of the administrative machinery and its investments  by nearly 40 percent. We have also succeeded in doing something  that the pessimistic people declared to be impossible: states  and counties have reached agreements with the federal government  and are paying their debts in accordance with the rules  established by Congress. We must also mention our stern fight  against tax evasion, which has already yielded concrete results.  We have put an end to tax havens and the privileges of those  whose accounts had never been investigated. Despite all these  efforts, however, we still need billions of real cruzeiros to be  able to obtain a zero deficit in our public accounts. Worst than  that, reducing expenses is not enough, because the Federal  Government is forced to give most of its revenue to the  governments of the states and counties and to finance other  expenses contemplated in the Constitution. Out of each 100 real  cruzeiros collected by the Federal Government, 80 are already  earmarked for mandatory obligations. Only 20 are left to pay for  all government expenses, which include health assistance, the  antifamine fight, transportation, agriculture, science and  technology, and other indispensable programs. How can we balance  our expenses? How can we defeat inflation? Society is tired of  paying taxes because most of the taxes are unfairly paid by the  poor instead of by the wealthy people.    This is why the government has proposed a constitutional  amendment creating the Social Emergency Fund [FSE]. The FSE will  help distribute the national resources better. It will not force  us to make new expenditures. It will be used to finance the  social programs that cannot, and should not, be subjected to  more cutbacks. Unless we have this fund, the government will  continue to make debts to cover essential expenditures, as we  did in December, when we issued certificates for more than $1  billion -- with interest rates of real 25 percent per year -- to  pay for our debts to hospitals and other social programs.    Most of the estimated $16 billion required by the FSE, will  result from reallocation of resources. Only $3 billion, i.e.  nearly 20 percent of the FSE, will result from tax hikes. This  increase is indispensable to cover urgent expenses. Who will pay  for it? Those who have more; those who make more than 5 million  real cruzeiros per month; the financial institutions, which will  pay 30 percent more of their profit in social contributions; the  upper middle class members, whose income tax will be increased  by well below 2 percent; and the banks, which are not  contributing to the PIS [Social Integration Program], and will  have to do so from now on.    This tax effort will not affect either the workers or most  of the middle class. We are trying to make inflation stop being  a tax that affects the poor to become a tax on the wealthy. Even  so, there are always demagogues who contend that the government  is merely increasing taxes without cutting its expenses.    Let us speak clearly and without protocol: without the FSE,  it will be impossible for us to fight the worst of all taxes;  that is, inflation. The government is convinced that this  program is the best way to achieve the desired stability and to  ensure a sustained economic growth.    Yet, only together and acting in partnership -- society,  government, and Congress alike -- will we be able to overcome  the difficulties.    The government neither can nor wants to impose its program  on  the Congress. Most of the economic plans implemented by  previous governments -- most of them containing shock measures,  confiscations, and freezes -- had been endorsed by the Congress  practically without disputes.    Today, fortunately, the Congress is not acting that way  because democracy entails participation. Nor does our program  have characteristics similar to those implemented in the past.  Never before has a Brazilian finance minister conferred so much  with members of Congress to effect the approval of an economic  plan.    I held lengthy talks with my congressional counterparts. I  accepted good suggestions. I made as many concessions as I  could as long as it would not be detrimental to our proposal of  approving a zero deficit budget.    I agreed to avoid touching the resources of state  governments  and municipal governments because they need these resources. I  did what I could. I pushed my possibilities to the limit.    What is going to be voted on this week is the result of this  extensive negotiation. A joint effort has been made by the  government and the Congress itself.    The Congress must now make a decision, not because the  government wants it to do so, but because Brazil is in a hurry.  We again grew in 1993 and we should increase even more in 1994.  By making adjustments, the private sector of our economy has  made progress. Industrial production grew by 9 percent in 1993.  Our exports totaled nearly $39 billion and our trade balance  yielded a $13 billion surplus. Salaries increased by more than  10 percent and employment rose by 3 percent. Our country's  international reserves today stand at more than $33 billion, a  record figure.    Our foreign debt to private banks, the negotiations of which  must be concluded by 10 March, does not exceed $35 billion. The  inflow of foreign resources into our financial market was more  than $12 billion. We have also received $1.3 billion as direct  investments. Foreign investors have given a vote of confidence  to Brazil. Yet, much remains to be done.    We must yet implement constitutional revisions in the area  of taxation, social security, and we must redefine the powers of  the state governments, of municipal governments, and of the  Federal Government, just to mention a few examples.    These are fundamental changes that are needed to once and  for  all balance the government's accounts. We must yet implement a  broader privatization program -- I am fighting for this -- in  order to consolidate our economic stabilization.    There is a major contradiction today in Brazil. The Congress  and other sectors agree on the need to stop inflation and to  implement constitutional reforms, but there are still those who  are objecting to these necessary measures. Some members of  liberal blocs want constitutional revision, but they disagree  with aspects of our economic program. Progressive blocs  partially support the economic program, but they do not want a  constitutional revision. Many people advocate the market and  free enterprise, but they do not stop pressuring government  coffers. They want freedom, but they are afraid of competition  and risks.    Some of them talk about downsizing the state, but they are  vulnerable to pressure groups that are contrary to streamlining  the state apparatus. There are others who boycott  privatizations and advocate a misguided nationalism by defending  stagnant monopolies, even those in nonstrategic areas. They are  capable of asking and demanding, but they fail to discharge  their responsibilities.    Today, Brazil clearly needs everyone to assume his share of  responsibility. As President Itamar Franco said: Governability  is a responsiblity for each and everyone of us. Either changes  pick up momentum now or it will not occur any time soon. The  Congress, which through congressional investigating committees  is making politics credible again, must act responsibly in the  economic area. Congress must decide. It must say yes or no. It  must neither fail to act nor postpone its decision.    If Congress does not agree with the proposed plan, let it  turn it down, because there will always be those who may look  for alternate courses.    If Congress approves the entire program as submitted, a huge  task will be awaiting the finance minister. Our people have  always excelled for their patience, but our country can no  longer wait. Each of us is responsible for making decisions and  for acting in a timely manner, both in the government and in  Congress. Brazil is in a hurry and the government is prepared  to act.    Thank you and good night.</p>

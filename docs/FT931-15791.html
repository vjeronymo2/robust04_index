			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Letter: Flaws in the idea of an 'output gap' Sir, Mr Samuel Brittan (January 7) reports that estimates of the gap between actual and potential output have been revised down. Unfortunately, he omits to say that the fact of such a revision casts grave doubt on the very concept of an 'output gap'. Such a gap is only meaningful if the rate of growth of potential output is independent of actual output growth. Mr Brittan belatedly recognises that this is not the case, as he says that the capital scrapping caused by the recession has reduced potential output. He should have added that capital scrapping is not the only way in which the recession has reduced potential output growth. The weakness of investment may have exacerbated the mismatch between what UK industry can produce and the composition of demand, so that even capacity which has not been scrapped is, in effect, unusable. This is confirmed by last year's sharp rise in imports, despite the weakness of demand. This convergence of 'potential' output towards its actual level means that the idea of an 'output gap' is - and always was - profoundly flawed. Those hoping that this 'gap' will hold down inflation may be profoundly disappointed.

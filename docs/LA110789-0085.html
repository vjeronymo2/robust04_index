			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Chile's standing in international soccer may be in jeopardy in the wake of  charges of conspiracy by FIFA, world soccer's governing body.  </P> <P> The charges stem from a Sept. 3 match against Brazil, which was leading, 1-0,  when Roberto Rojas claimed to have been hit by a flare thrown from the stands.  Rojas later retracted his claims and has since been banned for life. Chile  abandoned the match, saying its safety was endangered, and FIFA later awarded  Brazil a forfeit victory.  </P> <P> FIFA General Secretary Joseph Blatter said other Chileans seem likely to have  colluded with Rojas in staging "the biggest attempt at swindle in the history  of FIFA," making him "perpetrator and victim at the same time."  </P> <P> Possible measures include banning Chile from international tournaments for an  unspecified period of time.  </P></p>

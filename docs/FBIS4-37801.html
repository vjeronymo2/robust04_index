			<p>BFN     [Text] The Janata Dal parliamentary party leader, Mr.  Sharad Yadav, and Mr. Ram Vilas Paswan, MP, are of the view that  their party has no president at present. Briefing newsmen in  New Delhi today, they said that had proposed constitution of a  steering committee for leading the party. They alleged that  yesterday's split in the party was aimed at destabilizing the  Lalu Prasad Yadav government in Bihar.    Meanwhile, in Patna, a number of Janata Dal MP's and MLA's  [Members of Legislative Assembly] at a meeting have expressed  full faith in the leadership of the chief minister, Mr. Lalu  Prasad Yadav. The chief minister later told newspersons that  all the ministers and legislators present in Patna attended the  meeting. On the contrary, Mr. Nitish Kumar, a member of the  breakaway Janata Dal claimed in Patna today that 90 percent of  the party's rank and file supported his group in Bihar. He also  claimed that a majority of party members in the Rajya Sabha will  soon join the new group. Another member of the split group, Mr.  Harikishore Singh, told our correspondent in New Delhi that  their group would like the president of Janata Dal, Mr. Bommai,  to cooperate with them for upholding the ideals for which the  party has always stood for. Mr. Bommai, on the other hand, told  newspersons in Bangalore that he will reach New Delhi tomorrow  in a bid to bring back the breakaway group of MP's back into  party fold. He described the decision by the 14 MP's as  unfortunate, but not unexpected. Orissa chief minister, Mr.  Biju Patnaik, told newspersons in Bhubaneshwar that the split  will not have any impact on the party in Orissa.    Reacting on the split of the Janata Dal, the Congress-I  spokesman, Mr. V.N. Gadgil, told newsmen in New Delhi that it is  always sad in a democracy when a party splits. But, in the case  of Janata Dal, it was inevitable. He said the Janata Dal was  never a homogeneous party with leaders having no following.    The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] says only those political  parties which have grown on the basis of an ideology will  survive. The party spokesperson, Mrs. Sushmaswaraj, said that  the political which have merged for political convenience will  break up and disappear.</p>

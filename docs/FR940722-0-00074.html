			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Historically, the amount of FHWA planning and research funds available to a State is consistent from year to year over the period covered by authorizing legislation (e.g., the ISTEA). In any case, if a State's or subrecipient's transportation planning is a continuation of the same activities with minimal change in activities over an extended period, use of a 2-year work program should result in a significant reduction in paperwork since draft and final work programs would not need to be prepared and submitted for review and approval in the second year unless significant changes are necessary in the description of work. The initial work program would describe the activities anticipated to be accomplished over the 2-year period along with an estimate of funds for each year. The FHWA would approve the 2-year work program and authorize the first year's work subject to availability of funds. Prior to the beginning of the second year, when the actual amount of funds that will be available is known, the State would only need to submit a request to revise the budget to reflect the actual funds available (and if necessary any significant amendments in the description of work to be accomplished) for the second year and request the FHWA's authorization to proceed with the second year's work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 420.113&blank;Eligibility of Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section includes general criteria and incorporates by reference other regulations and OMB Circulars for determining eligibility of transportation planning and RD&amp;T activities and allowability of items of cost (e.g., salaries, travel) within such activities that are proposed for FHWA planning and research funds. Administrative procedures that must be followed for costs to be eligible for reimbursement are also included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requested that a list of examples of transportation planning and RD&amp;T activities that are eligible for FHWA planning and research funds be included in the final rule. Appropriate sections of title 23, U.S.C., that include information on broad categories of eligible activities are included by reference. The FHWA believes that any attempt to provide a more specific listing could be misinterpreted since all eligible activities could not possibly be listed. The longstanding practice of allowing the FHWA field offices to determine eligible activities, in consultation with the headquarters office if necessary, has worked well in the past and will be continued. In addition, the FHWA headquarters office will continue to issue appropriate guidance when necessary on the eligibility of specific types of activities. For example, in response to several inquiries since enactment of the ISTEA, guidance has been provided on the use of FHWA planning and research funds for transportation planning involving modes in addition to highway or transit. As discussed in the preamble to the NPRM, transportation planning studies involving modes in addition to highway or transit are eligible for FHWA planning and research funds when performed as part of the statewide or metropolitan transportation planning processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to questions regarding eligibility of travel costs of team members conducting peer reviews of a State's RD&amp;T management process, subpart B has been revised, as discussed below under the responses to comments on subpart B, to specify that such travel costs are eligible for FHWA planning and research funds. While not required by this regulation or 23 CFR part 450, similar peer reviews of statewide and metropolitan transportation planning processes would also be eligible if included in a State or MPO transportation planning work program and it is determined by the FHWA that the costs are necessary, reasonable, and benefit the FHWA planning and research funded transportation planning process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) of this section in the NPRM referenced the provisions of 23 CFR part 140, subpart G on the allowability of indirect costs of STA planning and research units. The allowability of such costs for any STA unit that performs work for development, establishment, and implementation of the management and monitoring systems required under 23 U.S.C. 303 was addressed in a May 3, 1994, memorandum to the FHWA and FTA Regional Administrators. (This memorandum is available for review and copying in the file for FHWA docket number 93&hyph;18 at the address specified above under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) To more clearly identify such allowable indirect costs, the reference to 23 CFR part 140, subpart G has been replaced with the specific provisions and information provided in the May 3 memorandum. In accordance with longstanding FHWA interpretation of 23 U.S.C. 302, except as specified in new paragraph (b)(2) of &sect;420.113, STA indirect costs are not eligible for reimbursement with FHWA planning and research funds. Paragraph (b)(2) specifies that salaries, but not other indirect costs, for services rendered by STA employees generally classified as administrative are eligible for reimbursement for a transportation planning unit, RD&amp;T unit, or other unit performing eligible work with FHWA planning and research funds (including development, establishment, and implementation of the management and monitoring systems required by 23 U.S.C. 303 and 23 CFR part 500). Such STA administrative costs are allowable in the ratio of time spent on the FHWA planning and research funded work in the unit to the total unit's working hours. The FHWA is currently conducting a review of its longstanding policy on eligibility of STA indirect costs and, if necessary based on the results of this review, the provisions in this section will be amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

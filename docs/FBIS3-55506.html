[Parchimowicz] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy told me that he intends  to visit Poland in the very near future. The leader of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia was in a good mood today and  declared his fraternal feelings for Poles. Many evil things  happened in relations between the Tsarist empire and Poland, as  well as in relations between the Soviet Union and Poland. One  must forget and neutralize all that, Zhirinovskiy said, so that  our relations will become good and Poles should not be afraid of  us, because Russians and Poles are Slav brothers.    Asked whether Russia will allow the Germans to take away  from  Poland the former Prussian territories, Zhirinovskiy replied  that he is against any changes of borders, which were finally  recognized in Helsinki in 1975 at the CSCE conference.</p>

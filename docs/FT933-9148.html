			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Patchy climate of confidence: The conditions for a small business revival in the UK seem to be in place Tyne Tees Cash and Carry, based in a converted telecommunications factory in Middlesbrough, has prospered during the recession by selling cheap, basic foods to small retailers. Mr Munir Ahmad, one of three brothers who run the Pounds 59m-turnover company, is confident of expansion, despite the uneven pace of recovery in the UK economy. On the other side of England, Warwick Fabrics, a textiles company with 20 employees in Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, spreads its Pounds 4m annual sales over 45 countries. In the past six months, it has increased staff by a third. Mr Cameron Warwick, sales director, says: 'We're young, enthusiastic and aggressive.' In the East Midlands, Mr Geoff Duck, managing director of specialist engineering group Loughborough Sound Images, says 'things couldn't be better' after the company's 40 per cent growth last year based on sales to big electronics groups such as Motorola and GEC. These anecdotes illustrate the optimism among many small businesses as Britain enters what the Bank of England yesterday called a 'gradual recovery'. Small companies - those with fewer than 200 employees - have been worse affected than big ones during the poor economic climate of the past three years, both in terms of falling output and in the number of business failures. But a survey last week from the Confederation of British Industry says that the small manufacturers which have survived are more likely than larger groups to increase staff and investment in the next few months. A similar message came from another survey last month of nearly 9,000 companies in both manufacturing and services conducted by the British Chambers of Commerce. It said small companies - which account for roughly three-quarters of the UK workforce - had increased their staff in the second quarter, while bigger groups continued to reduce employees. In the case of those small British businesses which are prospering, their relative success can be explained largely by the following factors: value-for-money products or services that suit recession-hit customers; bias towards exports, which have been an important factor behind recent UK growth, helped by the depreciation in sterling following Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, and the consequent fall in interest rates; specialist activities directed towards big companies, which have shed staff during the recession and have become more dependent on subcontracting; eagerness of staff to show a flexible approach to work, partly because they fear unemployment which, in spite of the recent five-month drop of 83,100, remains high at 2.91m; enthusiasm from the people in charge of the companies, who often own a majority stake and so have a strong financial incentive to see their businesses do well. One company exhibiting several of these characteristics is Dunphy Combustion, a family-owned maker of low-pollution burners for boilers and central heating equipment, based in Rochdale, Lancashire. It has grown rapidly in the past three years, exporting 95 per cent of its products. Mr Malcolm Dunphy, who set up the company 29 years ago, gives his sales staff twice-weekly German lessons to help them in continental markets. He has also started building what will be a Pounds 1m research centre 'to turn Rochdale into the Silicon Valley for environmental technology'. He says UK manufacturers 'are so used to thinking they are inferior, they don't appreciate the export opportunities'. His company is budgeting for a 50 per cent increase in turnover this year, mainly on the back of orders from Germany for central heating equipment. Even though the evidence from small companies such as Dunphy points to better times ahead for the sector, the CBI and chambers of commerce surveys underline the fact that big, rather than small, companies have been in the lead in pushing up output in the first half of the year. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the chambers of commerce, explains that, in the early phase of recovery, bigger groups would be expected to increase orders and output faster than their smaller counterparts. This is because their greater resources, in terms of production lines and marketing staff, can be activated more easily on signs of higher demand. But he is cheered by signs of higher recruitment by small companies. 'The opportunities for a sustained recovery very much depend on the small business sector,' says Mr Brown. Even so, the sector as a whole is a long way from being pronounced healthy. Bankruptcies among small traders totalled 21,678 in the first half of this year, up 12.5 per cent on the same period last year, according to business-information company Dun &amp; Bradstreet. Yet the rate of formation of small companies is high. According to the chambers of commerce, precise figures for new business starts are hard to come by. It says that as a rough rule, about 10 per cent of the 2m or so small businesses collapsed each year during the recession, only to be replaced by new ones at about the same rate. More recent evidence is that company starts may be increasing. Jordans, which specialises in analysing business start-ups based on registrations from Companies House, says in the first six months of the year, 55,567 companies were started. This was 5.5 per cent up on the first half of 1992 and the first rise since the recession began about three years ago. Mr Stephen Alambritis of the 58,000-member Federation of Small Businesses, says positive factors helping the sector include brighter economic prospects and signs of greater financial support by the banks. Although small companies continue to complain about the difficulties of increasing their overdrafts and getting new loans, the banks say they do have money to lend and that bad debts are now less of a problem. National Westminster Bank, which claims to handle the accounts of 30 per cent of new small businesses, says that the outlook for the sector is 'cautiously optimistic', with its own figures indicating that start-ups so far this year are slightly higher than in the second half of last year. Illustrating the generally brighter prospects for the sector, Manchester-based Mother Hubbard Cakes, which started in 1979 and makes cakes for supermarkets such as Asda and Kwik-Save, is operating its second-hand cake plant 24 hours a day. It has expanded to annual sales of Pounds 2.5m and taken on a third of its 90 staff in the past year. 'We can take out 25 per cent of our competitors' costs, for example by cutting down on packaging, and still make an adequate margin,' boasts Mr Philip Wilson, managing director. Another who claims the recession has helped is Mr Gus Coulton, who started London-based McBride's Design Consultants alone in 1989, and now employs 10 people. He undercuts bigger rivals because his employees each do a range of jobs from design work to chasing up invoices. But can the generally good progress of these small companies last? A large part of the answer depends on the overall economic climate and confidence levels among consumers and big companies. Figures out this week showed a new willingness among consumers to borrow with total consumer credit rising in June by Pounds 213m, the highest monthly figure for two years. Meanwhile, many large companies are confident that their output may rise slightly over the next year. Assuming further reductions in interest rates across Europe, which will help export demand, a continuation of better conditions for obtaining bank finance and no further hiccups in the UK recovery, the conditions for a small business revival seem to be in place.</p>

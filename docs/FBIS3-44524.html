This is the second time within 40 days that the French  Minister has expressed his willingness to improve ties with  China.    In his interview with a French newspaper "LES ECHOS" on  November 29 last year, Juppe regretted that France and China  were at loggerheads over the decision made by the French former  socialist government to sell Mirage-2000 combat planes to Taiwan.</p>

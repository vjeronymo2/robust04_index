Usov  (Nuclear Reactors Institute, RNTs [expansion not given]  ``Kurchatovskiy institut''); received Dec 29,1991; UDC  621.039.577]    [Abstract] The article examines construction principles of  universal space platforms [USPs] using thermal emission nuclear  electric power units [NEPUs] with thermal and fast reactors and  electric reactive drives [ERDs] as applied to a ``Proton''  carrier rocket. Due to their compactness, the possibility to  substantially increase the output during 15 to 20% of the  total  flight time, and small disturbances to spacecraft motion it is  expedient to use thermal emission NEPUs in USPs. As far as their  mass, overall dimensions, cost and performance characteristics  are concerned, NEPUs have important advantages over  photoelectric units. The article lists NEPU components and  describes their parameters. Two versions of orbital injection  are examined a single launch (the USP is launched into orbit  together with the special purpose equipment module) and double  launch (the USP and special) purpose equipment module are  launched independently and then joined in a radiation safe  orbit. Power supply of the special equipment module can also be  done remotely by directional power transmission in the  centimeter wave band. Capabilities of a spacecraft with USPs  using various capacity thermal emission NEPUs for a flight to a  stationary orbit, wherein a ``Proton'' rocket is used for  launching into a low (about 200 km) orbit and a special purpose  acceleration module is used for transferring the spacecraft to a  radiation safe orbit (around 800 km), are discussed. The mass  and dimensions of the special purpose equipment module are  estimated. The data presented in the article justify the  promising character of application of power propulsion complexes  with thermal emission NEPUs for solving practical problems of  space exploration.

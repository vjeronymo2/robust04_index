			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> BRECHTIAN BROADSIDE BY ACTORS' GANG  </P> <P> We can only hope that Ariane Mnouchkine's Theatre du Soliel, last here for the  '84 Olympic Arts Festival, might return someday. (Not likely.)  </P> <P> We can only pray that El Gran Circo Teatro de Chile, just here for the L.A.  Festival, might return someday. (More likely. Maybe.)  </P> <P> But, after what Los Angeles' own Actors' Gang is currently displaying at the  Odyssey Theatre with its production of Bertolt Brecht's "The Good Woman of  Setzuan," hopes and prayers are beside the point. If El Gran Circo proved that  it's Chile's carrier of the great Mnouchkine tradition, then the Gang is  proving that it's the American equivalent.  </P> <P> Through growing surges (like "Carnage") and growing pains (like "The Big  Show"), the nearly decade-old Gang, with "Good Woman," has blossomed into a  unit to take on the world. A day after seeing El Gran Circo's extraordinary "La  Negra Ester," there was the Gang equaling -- and sometimes surpassing -- the  Chileans.  </P> <P> The parallels were almost spooky. "Ester" is about a prostitute, is staged on a  resonantly "poor" set of wood planks, has a fantastically inventive live band  that plays the music and the sound effects, and sings with actors who switch  costumes, make-up and character faster than you can say "commedia dell'arte."  </P> <P> The Robbins-directed "Good Woman" has all these, and more: a play that arguably  marks the pinnacle of Brecht's powers, and a passionate political core that  serves as bedrock, not soap box.  </P> <P> More than anything, this is Brecht as Brecht wanted it: for the masses. Robbins  is aiming for emotional directness, but within a ritualistic style. He  remembers that while Brecht's Theater of Alienation was about the alienation  Out There, it was also about humanizing the audience In Here.  </P> <P> Brecht fills his imaginary Chinese city (and the heavens above, home to three  devious gods) with so much injustice, that justice is precious. Forced to  embody and confront both, Shen Te (Shannon Holt), is a prostitute blessed with  monetary providence and unable to control her instinct for charity. Neither  Brecht nor his English translator, Eric Bentley, who collaborated in  neighboring Santa Monica, spell out how Shen Te becomes Shui Ta, her wily  "cousin" who knows how to run a business.  </P> <P> Holt and Robbins have come up with their own solutions, adding haunting,  psychological dimensions that the text only hints at. It begins with simple,  powerful costume changes, and one of Xander Berkeley's expressively  physicalized masks which follow Dario Fo's dictum that "the mask is not  intended to mask." It ends with a staggering acting display by Holt, becoming a  good woman who dangerously tests her moral limits.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Wang the water seller (Brent Hinkley) reports to the gods (the  hilariously evil trio -- also masked -- of Jeff Foster, Dean Robinson and  Michael Rivkin) on the good woman's struggle. Hinkley plays him as a bedraggled  Everyman, trying and failing miserably to befriend Shen Te. Brian Brophy's Yang  Sun wants Shen Te as a life preserver and a twisted affirmation of his  maleness, with Lisa Moncure as his mother cajoling him with gleeful amorality.  </P> <P> Moncure typifies the dazzling artfulness here, as she switches from seedy Mrs.  Yang into Shen Te's slick landlady with invisible speed. She has a lot of  company on this theatrical fast track: Foster, Robinson, Rivkin, Brophy, Jack  Black, Steven Porter, Evie Peck and Tricia Parks. Cari Dean Whittemore, Kate  Mulligan and Patti Tippo lead the spongers who hang around Shen Te like a bad  cold.  </P> <P> This is theater about acting, with production gloss kept spare, yet seldom has  a spare show seemed so rich. Richard Hoover's set is a simple frame of wood  ladders and platforms which Garrett Caine's lights turn into outer space or a  hellish factory.  </P> <P> Neal Teguns' fine costumes are ingeniously utilitarian. Music supervisor David  Robbins, with pieces by Darryl Tewes, Ernesto Salcedo, Carey Fosse and Keythe  Farley, creates a vast sonic universe, from tougher-than-Weill songs to a  rainstorm. These emerge from an array of instruments, some played by actors on  the sidelines.  </P> <P> Observers may protest that, with the "Miss Saigon" storm over appropriate  ethnic casting, any current "Good Woman" should boast a largely Asian cast.  Robbins chose not to go that direction, which doesn't prevent someone else from  doing so. What direction he did choose has produced magic. That is what finally  matters.  </P> <P>  At 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., on Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7  p.m., until Oct. 19. $10-$12; (213) 477-2055.  </P> <P> </P></p>

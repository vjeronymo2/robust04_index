The delegation will take 500 agricultural and industrial  products and 333 co-operation projects with them to seek  investors and trade partners in America.    All the projects, focusing on such fields as electronics,  machinery and transport, have been carefully chosen to  restructure the local economy and produce the greatest possible  profits.    More than 50 co-operation projects will be launched  especially to satisfy the demand of the U.S. domestic market.    The economy of China's inland Shanxi Province for long  lagged  behind other developed parts of the country because it centered  solely on the coal industry and entrepot trade.    Along with the efforts of the central government to tap the  potential of mid-western China in recent years, Shanxi has  consolidated its strength as the number one energy supplier of  the country.    To foster technological innovation in old enterprises and  accelerate development of all local economic sectors, Shanxi has  put the utilization of foreign investment and expansion of  foreign trade on top of its agenda.    The province has previously sent an economic delegation to  the Republic of Korea and hopes that the voyage to the United  States will prove to be fruitful.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 11 June -- Russia would like to come to an  agreement with NATO on forms of partnership before the meeting  between President Boris Yeltsin and the leaders of the seven  leading Western states, which is to be held in Naples next  month. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said this on  Friday [10 June] evening.    Speaking to journalists on board his plane to Moscow from  Istanbul, where he had attended a session of the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council, Kozyrev called on the parties "to finish  their ideological disputes more quickly and get down to  business." He had noted sympathy in this regard in his talks  with U.S. State Secretary Warren Christopher, among others.    As President Boris Yeltsin said on Friday, Kozyrev noted, we  are talking about the signing of a framework document and of the  NATO- Russia program. Incidentally, the minister added, in the  communique following the NATO council session, which has just  taken place, Russia's viewpoint is taken into account. It talks  about a program that will reflect the Russian Federation's  specific role and weight.    Russia will sign both the framework agreement and a  substantive and much more thorough program for partnership as  soon as the documents setting down the relevant agreements are  ready. This should be done quickly, before the meeting in  Naples, the minister said.    The minister was asked whether it was probable that the  agreement between Russia and the European Union would be signed  at the forthcoming meeting of European Union leaders on the  island of Kerkira (Corfu), in which it is expected Boris Yeltsin  may take part. "I think that this probability is constantly  growing," Kozyrev stated. "The remaining matters are technical  ones connected with the translation of the text of the accords  into the languages of the countries involved in the agreement."  According to the head of Russia's diplomacy the possibility of  completing the necessary preparatory work in a short space of  time was confirmed too during his conversation in Istanbul with  Karolos Papoulias, the foreign minister of Greece, which is the  current chairman of the European Union.</p>

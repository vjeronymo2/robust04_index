			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>   [Text] The conservative wing of the Chinese Communist  Party has made a bold bid for power by preparing plans to expose  patriarch Deng Xiaoping's alleged responsibility for the  Tiananmen Sguare massacre. In a campaign codenamed "The Two  Opens", the Maoists plan to launch a blistering attack on how Mr  Deng and his faction had "opened the door to capitalism and  opened fire on the residents of Beijing" in the early hours of  June 4, 1989. Chinese sources said yesterday that while the  full blitz would not be launched until Mr Deng's death, the  first salvoes had been fired in view of the rapidly declining  health of the 89-year-old senior leader.    The sources said while the leftists had denigrated the  student demonstrations of early 1989 as a sign of "bourgeois  liberalisation" they had always disputed the need to use live  ammunition against the students and citizens of the capital.  They said the ideologues had collected "impressive black  material" that would point to Mr Deng, then chairman of the  policy-setting Central Military Commission, as the leader who  gave the order for soldiers to shoot to kill.    "Seeing how they have been marginalised by the development  of  reforms, the conservatives hope they can win widespread support  by spearheading the drive to overturn the verdict on June 4," a  source said. "While the ideologues will never support the  prodemocracy movement, they figure they can deal a body blow to  Deng's reputation by laying bare his June 4-related `guilt'."    China analysts said Mr Deng had never admitted  responsibility  for ordering the troops to open fire. Sources close to the  People's Liberation Army said after the massacre that detailed  information and documents on the chain of events that led to the  shoot-to-kill order had been obliterated or covered up.  However, a party elder claimed in late 1992 that he had  recordings and other material proving it was Mr Deng who made  the fateful decision. The sources said it was likely the  conservatives would publicise some of this evidence immediately  upon Mr Deng's death.    At the same time, leftist commissars have in official  journals under their control started an open campaign against Mr  Deng's "re-introduction of capitalism". The attack has focused  on attempts by the Deng faction to diminish the "leading  position of the state sector" in the economy through  quasi-privatisation.    In a recent issue of In Search of Truth [QIUSHI], a  commentator on the leftist journal accused certain cadres of  "failing to make a distinction between the socialist market  economy and the capitalistic market economy". Other articles in  the same journal attacked the conversion of state-owned  enterprises into shareholding companies as evidence of  "sidelining state planning" and "curtailing state ownership".  Referring to Mr Deng's famous doctrine that "productivity is  the only criterion" for assessing a policy, the ideologues  criticised unnamed cadres who said the question of "ownership"  should be dropped so long as economic development could be  expedited.</p>

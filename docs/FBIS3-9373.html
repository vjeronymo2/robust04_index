Ostensibly, our arms are Russian, we cry out for spare parts  from Moscow and Kiev, the army does not have a penny to its  name, and yet our generals constantly look toward the West.    The chief of General Staff returned from Brussels and left  immediately for NATO's Atlantic headquarters in Norfolk. All  right, in Belgium we at least have certain interests -- we are  about to send our representatives to NATO headquarters -- but  what business do we have with the Atlantic?    In addition, the fact that three delegations are heading for  the United States shows that there is apparently no coordination  between the General Staff and the Ministry of Defense in  anything related to the Army cuts and visits abroad.</p>

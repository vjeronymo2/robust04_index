			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]  <H5>  New Business Strategy Is Explored With 9.5 Model STN Color </H5>   Kyocera's renewed business strategy includes market  penetration with a new 9.5 model STN color, and the start of  color filter sales. For STN color market penetration, the  company will attack TFT-LCD with an eye toward the personal  computer market. Employing COG packaging that is Kyocera's  forte, high precision products will be challenged. In March of  next year, it is said that they will mass produce 15 thousand  units per month. On the other hand, since the sales of color  filters will start, production planning at the Kawauchi plant,  which is one of five main five plants that the company operates,  will be restructured.  <H5>  Over 1993's Sales Amount &yen;5 Billion Projected </H5>   --What is the behind the scenes story of Kyocera's entry  into the LCD business, referring to the strategic location of  Hayato plant, and its overview?    Research on LCD started in 1981, and its production started  in 1986. The product was realized by integrating the thin film  technology that we are good at, and COG packaging technology  employing a thermal head. By employing COG packaging technology,  a thin film model was realized from the beginning of sales.    The Hayato plant (Kagoshima Prefecture) which is the base  for  production has been operated since June, 1981. As seen from the  date, the plant was not build for LCD production. The place was  functionally a mother plant for various kinds of thin film  electronic parts. As we still maintain the same business  philosophy now, LCD is recognized not as a special device at our  company but as one our thin film parts.    At present the production site is divided in two wings, one  for LCD and the other for thermal head production. In the LCD  production environment, a clean room related to lithography is  operated at a class less than 300, and rest is at a class of  1000.    --What are the products and their capacity at the Hayato  plant?    The production capacity for the 9.5 model is 30 thousand per  month. The main product is a 9.5 model STN monochrome for  personal computers. This is 50% of our entire production.  Forty  percent is model 5 for FA and electronic notebooks, and  10% is  9.5 - 10.4 model STN color for OHP. One hundred percent of the  products are sold.    --How about Kawauchi plant that manufactures color filters ?    The Kawauchi plant (Kagoshima prefecture) is three stories  high and was constructed in 1990. The first and third floors  were used for other businesses, and color filter production  takes place on the second floor. A clean room is operated with  same base as that of Hayato plant. At present, the line only  occupies 1/8 of the entire floor. This lineUs capacity is 10  thousand a month but in reality production is 4 thousand a  month. If lines are installed on the entire floor, 200 thousand  a month will be produced.    --Color filter production method and production idling?    A pigment dispersion method is employed. Due to idling, the  production level is 80% but we will raise that to  95% level in  two to three months.    --Base place for R &amp; D?    A new wing was constructed at the site of the Hayato plant  in  December of 1991. R&amp;D is conducted in this new wing including  the research for thin films such as LCD. Development of  commercial products, material technology, and process  development are all conducted here.    --Ratio for export?    Fifty percent of the products sold are exported, and  80% of  our exports are for the US, 20% are for Europe. We intend  to  maintain the sales ratio for domestic and overseas market at  50-50. At this point we are not considering overseasUs  production. Even in the future if we decide to open plants  overseas, the plants will probably be for assembly only. Also I  think the production of color filters will not go overseas.  <H5>  New Business Explored </H5>   --New Business Strategy for LCD Business?    Since September of 1993, 9.5 model STN color production for  personal computers has started. As you know, supply for  monochrome is 2 to 3 times greater than the demand. That is to  say there is an excess of supply. On the other hand, TFT for  color can not catch up with the demand. For this reason, the  market is shifting from TFT to STN color.    At a concrete level, production at a rate of 150 thousand  per  month is planned by March of 1994, and production ratio for  color and monochrome will be 50:50. After March, color  production will be increased, and eventually the ratio will be  90:10.    Also, a dot pitch 0.25 with high precision will be  commercialized by the beginning of next year (1994), we will be  ready for market penetration. Application is for subnotebook  personal computers.    --What is the technical point that will realize the 0.25  dot pitch?    That is the COG packaging. Certainly in monochrome type,  other companies' products are getting thin, and the merit of COG  is diminishing. However, for color, COG packaging is still  surviving. With STN color, to package 0.25mm products with TAB  is difficult. In the TAB technique, 70m is the limit for  pitch, but our COG technology can interface up to 60m pitch.  Moreover the color filter is also manufactured at our company,  the disadvantage of meeting delivery day seen in TFT is not a  problem.    --So we hear that the color filter be sold also.    The sales will start in November this year. A concrete plan  has not yet been finalized, but at present, samples have been  shipped to three makers for evaluation. From now on, looking at  the status of ordering and shipping of STN color, production  plans at Kawauchi plant will be formulated.    --How about business exploration from now on?    Our first goal is to raise the STN color ratio. The  monochrome type is not going to diminish in the market at all,  minute high precision products will become important. After  that, products with a digitizer on board for use with a pen  input and OHP will also become important. These four products  will be the pillar for our business.    --How about the budget for new business plan?    We project 1994 sales of &yen;10 trillion.  <H5>  Keyword Is Color </H5>   -- What about the plan for TFT-LCD Commercial Products?    At this point when and how to get into the market is not  clear. It is still at the stage of R&amp;D.    --How are you going to purchase the driver ICs?    From several semiconductor makers, we buy bare chips stored  in a tray.    --From bare chips, are you going to package? Don't you face  any environmental test?    We have technology and data that were accumulated for 12  years that built the thermal head. Reliability is no problem at  all. Structure of technology is quite well founded. For example,  liquid crystal panel guaranteed value is 60 C at maximum,  and even polarizing plate is 60-70 C. These guaranteed  values are quite less than our thermal head requires.    At present, after the chips are packaged, they will be  subjected to environment tests, and repair will be done. And for  new products, 100% inspection is performed. After the  manufacturing process is established, then random sampling will  be employed.    --How do you reduce costs other than through the production  of your own color filter.    Reduce the number of process, and throughput will be  increased. On that foundation, by the efficiency of mass  production, cost reductions will be planned.    --Are you referring to a single unit commercial product for  efficiency of mass production?    That is right. Our business strategy aims at the 9.5 model  STN color from now on.    --How about lines for processing?    Still the same one that is seven years old. The dual phase  processing line using 300 x 360 baseboard.    --Are you going to invest in new equipment?    No. The present line is good enough. If we build a new  plant,  then that will be a four-phase line. But we don't feel the need  at this point. Will there be any merit for investing in new  equipment for STN? To recoup from investment, if the plus is  going up, then new investment doesn't make sense. For that  reason, our LCD business is a part of the thin film electronic  products department. We have so many other things to do. before  getting into new equipment investment under a cloudy climate.    --How about mid-long planning?    That will be also after March of next year (1994) when the  ratio of color and monochrome reaches 50:50. The keyword is  color, and the trend of color will determine our business plans  from now on.</p>

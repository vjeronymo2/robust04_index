			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Man held over Schneider funds A former business colleague of Mr Jurgen Schneider, the German property entrepreneur whose disappearance in April triggered Germany's biggest property crash since the second world war, has been arrested on suspicion of helping Mr Schneider to transfer up to DM750m (Pounds 300m) of company funds out of Germany. The Cologne-based businessman, who was not named, is believed to be an Iranian who was managing director of a company within the Schneider group up to March this year. According to the state prosecutor's office in Frankfurt, the person arrested had established contacts with an unnamed Swiss bank and is alleged to have helped Mr Schneider to transfer the funds. He was arrested on Tuesday morning. Mr Schneider, whose whereabouts are still unknown after he failed to come back from holiday in Tuscany at Easter, has been accused by the Deutsche Bank, the property group's biggest creditor, of misappropriating at least DM218m of the group's funds. Other estimates suggest that he took up to DM750m from the group, which collapsed with debts of DM5bn.</p>

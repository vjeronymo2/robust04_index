			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Row looms over shipping cartels A political row is building up between the European Commission, Parliament and European Union ministers over controversial Commission inquiries into shipping cartels. The Commission and Parliament, backed by exporters, are worried that transport ministers, who meet in Brussels on Monday, may try to meddle with the Commission's exclusive authority to rule on competition cases. At issue is a draft resolution on the application of competition rules to maritime transport, which could be adopted by ministers on Monday. EU exporters - including companies such as ICI and Mars - say the resolution is largely the work of shipowners, trying to protect themselves from the latest in a series of Commission investigations into shipping cartels. The European Parliament's legal affairs committee has written to the council of ministers warning that adoption of such a resolution could upset the balance between the EU's institutions. The pressure already appears to be having an effect. National officials said yesterday that member states' enthusiasm for a prescriptive resolution was waning, although they may still call for a Commission report on the subject. Much will depend on how ministers react to Monday's statement by Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, about the maritime industry. The shipowners said this week that all they wanted from the Commission was greater legal certainty about the treatment of shipping conferences, in particular those that now offer door-to-door container services, including road haulage. In the last two years, the Commission has aroused the wrath of shipowners by imposing fines on two cartels operating between Europe and Africa. Brussels is now poised to publish a statement of objections to the Trans-Atlantic Agreement, signed last year by 14 shipping companies including P&amp;O Containers of the UK, Hapag-Lloyd of Germany and Maersk of Denmark, and should also take a decision on the Far East Freight Conference. The shipping lines say the TAA is essential to combat overcapacity in the transatlantic container market, but exporters say that it has led to 'exorbitant' rate increases in 1993. The original draft resolution tabled by the Belgian presidency of the EU was sharply criticised by MEPs and the Commission for going too far.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / One man's war against the evils of society: Fifty years ago, Sir William Beveridge battled to establish the welfare state amid the horrors of world conflict. John Willman asks, did he succeed? THE ALLIED guns had turned the tide of war at El Alamein in North Africa. The Nazi advance across the frozen Soviet Union was held up at Stalingrad, but mainland Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals was still under Hitler's thrall. Winston Churchill was at his desk as usual in Downing Street on a bleak November day in 1942 when a heavy report dropped on to the maps and directives spread before the prime minister. This volume was to change the face of Britain in a way that no German blitz could do. It was the blueprint for a welfare state. Now 50 years later, the shortcomings in Sir William Beveridge's vision of a comprehensive welfare system can be seen all too clearly - even though some of the faults stem from the way in which his plans were implemented. At the time, the Beveridge report sent shockwaves throughout Whitehall and Westminster, fatally damaging Churchill's hopes of post-war re-election as he strove to balance the huge potential cost of a welfare state against public enthusiasm. Ministers had expected the proposals to be much more modest. Beveridge's inquiry had been set up in June 1941 at the request of the Trades Union Congress to tidy up the confusion of inadequate social and medical insurance schemes. No one expected him to start a revolution. But the opening phrases showed the grandeur of his vision: 'A revolutionary moment in the world's history is a time for revolutions, not for patching. . . Want is only one of the five giants on the road of reconstruction. The others are Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness.' The defeat of these evil giants would require sweeping changes and big money. As soon as the Treasury counted the costs, it opposed the reforms - and Churchill was joined by other influential ministers in questioning the expense, scope and timing of such an ambitious plan. Beveridge, indeed, received no support from the cabinet except from Brendan Bracken, the information minister. But after some skilfully-engineered press leaks, he succeeded in getting the report published on December 2, 1942. The reception was rapturous. A mile-long queue formed outside the government bookshop for the 300-page report. It became a best-seller, with 250,000 copies sold that year. A cheap edition was sent out to the armed forces, 50,000 copies were sold in the US, and summaries in many languages were parachuted into occupied Europe. One Londoner quoted by Mass Observation, the opinion research organisation, said that the publication of the Beveridge report ranked with VE Day (for Victory in Europe) as one of the two most memorable days of the war. A Gallup poll at the time showed that 95 per cent of the population knew about the report and overwhelmingly approved of it. A complete translation was circulated in Germany, marked 'Top Secret'. Copies of the Nazi response to Beveridge were discovered in the remains of Hitler's Berlin bunker. Beveridge even made it on to ITMA (It's That Man Again), the popular radio comedy programme starring Tommy Handley and listened to by millions. Handley was introduced as 'His Fatuity, the minister of Social Hilarity', who had 'been up the last three days and nights reading the first chapter of a book called Gone with the Want by that stout fellow Beveridge'. But the report's transition from vision to reality took three more years. The delay hurt the popularity of Churchill and the Conservatives in his coalition government, in spite of three white papers on the subject and the introduction of the Family Allowances Act. The public's impatience for change was one of the main reasons for the Labour party's landslide election in 1945. The baton for social revolution passed to Clement Atlee. Ironically, Beveridge had become chairman of this inquiry because his bosses at the Ministry of Labour wanted to be rid of a turbulent academic and gave him a job where they fancied he could do little harm. He remained master of University College Oxford when he was co-opted into the service of the wartime government, along with other distinguished academics, such as Maynard Keynes and James Meade. He took charge of manpower planning in the Ministry of Labour in 1940 and soon began to annoy his minister, Ernest Bevin, the former trade unionist, with unsolicited advice on how to win the war. He drew this from his experience as a civil servant in the first world war when he helped to organise mass mobilisation and food rationing. 'He was a very clever man, and had done a good job on manpower,' according to Tom Wilson, later the Adam Smith Professor of Political Economy at Glasgow University, who met Beveridge while working in the Cabinet Office secretariat. 'But he was vain and terribly difficult to work with.' Bevin took the first opportunity to rid himself of this difficult man and when Beveridge accepted the chairmanship of the inquiry into social and medical insurance, he had tears in his eyes. Eighteen months later, his report with the unappealing title Social Insurance and Allied Services, was on the desks of unhappy ministers. Churchill himself was not opposed to the idea of a more comprehensive welfare system. He had been responsible in 1909 for setting up labour exchanges and launching the world's first statutory social insurance scheme. But other compelling - and expensive - plans were being prepared: for educational reform, for slum clearance and for the reconstruction of industry. Churchill wanted to wait until after the war before committing the country to any particular scheme. Beveridge recommended the creation of a comprehensive system of national insurance. Compulsory flat-rate contributions would be paid by employers, the insured and the state, to pay for universal benefits such as a retirement pension, sickness and unemployment benefit. These would provide bare subsistence and would be paid to everyone, unlike pre-war benefits which were subject to the hated means test. Those not covered by the national insurance system could receive national assistance as a safety net. These recommendations alone required a sharp rise in spending, sweeping away the existing provision by friendly societies and the insurance companies. But the plan also vastly increased the power of the state, which for the first time would assume responsibility for the relief of poverty. Since the Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601, this had been the job of local authorities. The report's revolutionary heart lay, however, in three explicit assumptions set out by the author. The abolition of want, squalor and the other three giants could be achieved only if family allowances were paid for each child; a free health service were made available to all; and the post-war government would guarantee full employment. The Treasury, as guardian of the public purse was almost bound to fight the plans. In an effort to deflect this opposition, Beveridge discussed early drafts of his report with Maynard Keynes, who was then an economic adviser in the Treasury. Keynes was sympathetic and made several recommendations designed to minimise resistance by reducing costs in the early years. Unfortunately for Beveridge, Keynes's optimism was counterbalanced by Treasury heavyweights such as Hubert Henderson, whose ability to foresee disaster was legendary. Treasury jeremiads found a willing listener in Churchill, who was angered by Beveridge's press leaks. Churchill's colleagues in the war cabinet also found Beveridge's activities a distraction from the main business of defeating the Germans, at a time when victory was far from certain. The report was published only after Bracken persuaded the cabinet that to suppress it would cause an outcry. 'Even the enemy took notice,' says Peter Baldwin, Professor of History at the University of California (Los Angeles). 'The Nazis were piqued that, by promising the state's concern for the material well-being of its citizens, Beveridge had appropriated what they regarded as one of their best propaganda weapons' Not everyone was so admiring. The insurance industry objected to the prospect of a state takeover of a large amount of its business. The Prudential even produced a briefing to enable the 'man from the Pru' to argue the case against Beveridge on the nation's doorsteps. But how was the government to react? Churchill's policy adviser, Lord Cherwell, told him that he should accept the report entirely, or shelve it until after the war. The worst thing for the government, Cherwell thought, would be to appear to accept it half-heartedly and under pressure, while diluting its proposals. But this was just what the War Cabinet did, partly because of pressure from the Treasury and partly because Beveridge's abrasive style had antagonised so many ministers. By the time the report was debated in Parliament in February 1943, the government had accepted 16 of the 23 recommendations. But even then, the event was turned into a public relations disaster. The colourless John Anderson, Lord President of the Council, appeared lukewarm just as the report was becoming a banner of hope amid the terrors and privation of war. In a radio broadcast a month later, Churchill said he supported a national social insurance scheme for all classes 'from the cradle to the grave'. But this was too little and too late to save him from electoral defeat in 1945. Ironically, Beveridge was also rejected, losing Berwick, the seat he had taken for the Liberals in a 1944 by-election. But sadly for Beveridge's vision, the implementation of the report after 1945 was flawed. The unified benefit rates for the new national insurance scheme were nearly a third below what Beveridge had recommended as necessary for subsistence. There was also no commitment for annual uprating to inflation-proof the benefit levels. This, in turn, left a growing number dependent on the means-tested safety net. Many modern critics also question Beveridge's reliance on insurance as a basis for eligibility for benefits. Beveridge felt that the payment of insurance contributions would eliminate the stigma of dependence. Again, this noble aim has been overtaken by the growing numbers in poverty who have never been contributors, especially single parents. A two-tier welfare state has been created, in which one group enjoys contributory, non-stigmatised benefits and another relies on the means-tested safety net. Beveridge has also been criticised for his insistence on flat-rate contributions and benefits. On the contributions side, this simply proved inequitable - and it was not long before contributions became earnings-related, implying an element of redistribution as well as social insurance. The payment of flat-rate benefits was designed to encourage people to continue to make their own provision to top up the state pension - Beveridge was keen not to discourage thrift. But he was too successful: these benefits are at subsistence levels and most better-off people have made additional pension provision for themselves, so much so that for many the state pension has become a relatively unimportant source of income in retirement. This has undermined their commitment to a welfare state in which all pay into and draw out of a common pot, allowing the level of the state benefits to remain at very basic levels. Beveridge's vision of a health service commanded almost universal support for most of the post-war era, but his optimism that costs would fall as the nation's health improved turned out to be completely wrong. This means that his fundamental assumptions are now having to be reassessed as medical costs and the demand for health care rise ever more steeply. However, Beveridge's welfare state was a product of the age. All social classes shared the same air-raid shelters and suffered the same blitz. Rationing represented deprivation for the middle classes, but it meant cheaper food and better nutrition for many working people. And the evacuation of over 4m mothers and children to the country broke down many social barriers. In such circumstances, people accepted high taxation and common sacrifice. Beveridge's vision was seductive in a regimented wartime society, with the economy under strong central control and common suffering. But since the war, rising affluence has eroded that feeling of social solidarity, while new social problems have overtaken the report's original credo. As the celebrations begin next week for the 50th anniversary of the Beveridge report, it would be equal folly to blame him for the defects of the welfare state as to idealise its conception during the horrors of war. Those reshaping the system in entirely different circumstances have yet to find a modern equivalent of Beveridge's vision and sense of the public mood.</p>

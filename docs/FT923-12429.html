			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Books: Flowers and foliage and birds and bees - Fiction DUNEDIN by Shena Mackay Heinemann, Pounds 14.99, 341 pages LIFE FORCE by Fay Weldon Harper Collins, Pounds 14.99, 200 pages BAILEY'S CAFE by Gloria Naylor Heinemann, Pounds 14.99, 234 pages BODILY HARM by Rachel Billington Macmillan, Pounds 14.99, 399 pages REAL liveliness is a quality much to be prized in a writer, and Shena Mackay has it in spades. Her new novel, though sprawling and not immaculately plotted, sparkles with wit and shimmers with lyricism even though it deals with darkish matters. It opens in New Zealand in 1909, whither Jack Mackenzie, more boulevardier manque than dominee, has been sent to minister to a disapproving flock. His interests lie in hunting and natural history rather than in preaching and soon he is more involved with a beauteous mixed-race washerwoman than with his retiring wife, Louisa. The effect on his children is hinted at. Then location and time change, and the rest of the novel - apart from a brief return to New Zealand at the end - deals with his grandchildren: William, disgraced, repressed ex-headmaster with a child's life on his conscience; his sister, Olive, independent, lonely, unhappy in love and full of splendid destructive fantasies and biting assessments of life in Eighties Britain; and a strange, slightly loony, wandering New Zealand boy, whose connection with the family is revealed by authorial sleight of hand towards the end of the book. In truth, the book does not go anywhere very much: although the sins of the fathers are much emphasised, there is vague causality and some flurried tying-up of ends. But none of this seems to matter. Mackay's glowing treatment of the natural world which refuses to be buried and subdued by the grimness of modern Britain is in extraordinary counterpoint to her sharp way with the obscenities of London life. Mackay is scathingly funny about the tackiness of modern Britain, the pretensions of literary life and female bonding. But some of her most telling effects are nostalgic evocations of those long-lost post-war days of comparative innocence, when Olive and William's father, the camel-coated bounder, was in his element. These, and passages on suburban loneliness ('solitary walks when the plywood backs of dressing tables in bedroom windows exuded melancholy and a curtain blowing at an open window was as sinister as a noose') are of the very highest order. In Shena Mackay's novel, the life force is everywhere. Flowers, foliage, birds crowd on to every page, as antidotes to the sere spiritual and social life of modern London. Fay Weldon, as ever, takes a more skewed and sceptical view of the same scene. Her life force is Leslie Beck, raffish, uncultured entrepreneur, whose conversation at his neighbours' dinner tables in trendy NW1 in the 1960s left much to be desired - unlike his enormous organ, which was the desire of all the wives. Now, 25 years later, a story of multiple deceptions among the chattering classes is told mainly by Nora, apparently the quietest of all but revealed as as much in thrall to Leslie's influence as all her friends. Leslie is despicable, but none of the others comes out of it much better, except for poor dead Anita, his last wife, whose artistic creativity survives as a reproach to the other women, and Marion, whose single-minded ambition kept her aloof from the self-justifying disingenuousness of the group. This is not Fay Weldon at her best, but even in low key she can tease, tantalise and scandalise better than any other writer today. No one has written better of those lost Sixties days, when people still had dinner parties and could kid themselves that all was well, and no one is clearer sighted about illicit sex. Not recommended for the faint-hearted with something to hide. With Gloria Naylor we are into an altogether different order of things. English women's problems may be all part of the Struggle, but they pale into insignificance before her passionate account of the lives of black American women in the earlier part of the century. In Bailey's semi-mythical cafe, the regulars are mostly the inmates of 'Eve's boarding house' along the street, taking a break from their clients. Naylor's mode is to hover between fantasy and the hardest of realities to tell the lives of these women in a mixture of high-blown, incantatory prose and appalling physical detail. This kind of exalted, bluesy style is a million miles from the deliberate understatement of English writing and needs a different kind of approach to reading. Naylor hammers at you from the depths of her rage at the injustices meted out to her sisters and, by extension, to all those trodden underfoot. It is American writing given its freest rein and it moves in the way that the best jazz moves. A revelatory antidote to the more parochial, though incisive, English mode of Mackay and Weldon, it is like one of those Victorian misery books such as Mrs Haliburton's Troubles. With Bodily Harm we are back on to safe English territory, in spite of the subject matter, which is serious crime, punishment and redemption through love. It starts with an unprovoked crime: Patrick Downes, educated, spiritually wounded, launches a frenzied stabbing attack on Lydia, a young woman who visits the shop where he works. She survives, psychologically crippled. He goes to prison, and, in a profoundly unconvincing turn of the plot, meets her again after his release. They turn out to be each other's salvation. For all its apple-pie ending, this is a serious, caring novel about the way that life is not all about blaming events for one's deficiencies. Even Pat's appalling experiences in prison, his gradual brutalisation by a flawed system, are not seen as simple triggers for bad behaviour, and Lydia's wounds are demonstrated to be part of an original pattern. It is a respectable, solid, responsible novel which deserves attention.</p>

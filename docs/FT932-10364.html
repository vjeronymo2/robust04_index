			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Arts: What a carry on] - Video JUST CONSIDER this. A director puts a surprise plot twist in his new film and begs critics not to reveal it. Under this pact of silence the film does poor-to-modest business. Then the surprise is blown by the Oscar nominations, after which the film - The Crying Game if you have not guessed  -starts to make a fortune. As the only British film critic who thought the interdiction was twaddle in the first place - FT readers could learn the twist in my original review, where it was preceded by a courtesy warning for those wanting to preserve the surprise - may I now welcome the video? At last we can all judge The Crying Game (Polygram) as a piece of film-making, not as a PR exercise in patronising mystification. Those who hold sway over our movie lives, of course, would like to treat us all as children. They would like to believe we cannot make up our own minds whether to see a particular movie, video or TV programme; nor whether to read a piece of plot revelation in a review, even when protected by the critic's own warning lights. There is less difference than we think between those who censor our screen entertainment and those who control the way a film is released and publicised. Condescension and autocracy are common to both. Why all these expostulations, you ask? Because movie presentation is becoming an art increasingly prone to gimmickry and imposture. And because so many bizarre changes - additions, subtractions, transpositions - are now happening to films when they graduate to the after-life of videotape that you should be aware of just when and how you are being pushed around. Not just by the censors but by the film-makers, the hype artists and whoever else tries to extract your money, to disarm you with 'Don't reveal]' plot secrets or to bluff you into thinking a film is an enhanced masterpiece in its latest, newest, most arbitrary format. So we have appointed May a multiple-choice 'special event' month. It is 'Don't Think An Expanded Movie Is Always A Better One' month. Is, for instance, the extra footage in the new, 176-minute-long Betty Blue (Fox) an enrichment or does it turn erotic chic into amorous marathon? And what of the initially fascinating Godfather expansions, now showing signs of slipping into a self-parodying prolixity. See the imminent, even longer, even more amorphous Godfather III. It is 'Don't Trust Companies Who Serve Up The Same Film In Different Formats' (and then pretend it is a whole new video experience) month. We appreciate the increasing choice of widescreen reissues of films like (this month) Oliver] and Gandhi (both Columbia). But some will argue that these films should have been presented this way, with their true original screen ratios, in the first place. Why have we had our pockets raided twice? And it is 'Take Two Pinches Of Salt With The Director Who Appears On His Own Video To Recount His Artistic Struggles' month. We refer to Adrian Lyne, whose on-screen agonisings over Fatal Attraction's alternative endings add to the morbid-curiosity value of the video if not to the film's stature as an artwork. But other movie-makers are already rumoured to be signing on for this stunt. But it is May, as we observed, so let us end by dancing a little round those gaily-coloured new releases with which we have no quarrel. Splendid to see Howards End (Curzon) trailing Oscar glory onto the small screen; and please catch Emma T. also in the funny, underrated Peter's Friends (EV EVV), directed by husband Ken. Excellent to note the multiplying number of foreign movies on video: this month two vintage Rohmers, The Marquise Von O and Pauline A La Plage (both Connoisseur), Zhang Yimou's majestic marital melodrama Raise The Red Lantern (Electric) and Kieslowski's haunting teaser on love and identity The Double Life Of Veronique (Tartan). And wonderful to see twelve vintage 'Carry On' films reissued by Warner. Please carry on, gentlemen, through the whole cannon.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 22 (TANJUG) -- Vuk Draskovic, leader  of the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), said on  Tuesday that the (Moslem-Croat) Washington agreement clearly  indicated a possibility that former Yugoslavia be divided into  two spheres of influence -- the Western and the Russian.    Speaking at a press conference in Belgrade, Draskovic  compared o the agreement signed in Washington on March 18 on  setting up a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  its subsequent confederation with Croatia with the  Roosevelt-Stalin-Churchill verbal accord reached in Yalta fifty  years ago.    Draskovic, whose party is among the strongest opposition  parties in both the federal and republican parliaments said he  was against any kind of Yalta agreements and in favour of  economic, cultural and some form of political reintegration of  war-shattered former Yugoslavia.    He said that Bosnian Serbs had the alternative to form some  kind of federal ties with the Moslems and Croats, which would  make Bosnia-Herzegovina a federation or an assymetrical  federation of Serb, Croat and Moslem cantons.    After Bosnian Moslems and Croats in early 1992 voted for  Bosnia's secession from the former Yugoslav federation, Bosnian  Serbs proclaimed their own republic in their ancestral lands in  Bosnia- Herzegovina.    Draskovic said the Serb cantons could enter into a  confederation with Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) or join a  Bosnian federation, in which case they would not have to cede so  much of their territories.    In the latter case, Yugoslavia could expect the lifting of  international sanctions and the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK)  would establish trilateral ties with Croatia, the Serb cantons  in Bosnia and with Yugoslavia. Moreover, he added, The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia would then almost certainly form  confederal ties with Yugoslavia.    The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 in predominantly  Serb-populated territories in Croatia in response to Croatia's  violent secession from the former Yugoslav Federation. It was  placed under U.N. control in March 1992.</p>

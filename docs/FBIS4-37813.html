			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Ra'fat Yahya] </F>   [Text] Islamabad -- Reliable Afghan sources connected with  the Tajik opposition have told AL-HAYAH that warplanes belonging  to the Uzbek militias under 'Abdol Rashid Dostam have raided the  Tajik refugee camps in the Qonduz area in northern Afghanistan.  The raids took place the day before yesterday and resulted in  eight killed (most of them women and children) and 12 wounded.    The Tajik refugees have come under fire from two sides: the  Communist government [of Tajikistan] and the Russian forces that  support it, from one side, and the formerly Communist General  Dostam's militias, which are considered to be carrying out  Moscow's plans to eliminate the radicals in the Tajik  opposition, from the other.    This aggression comes at a time when talks are going on in  Tehran between the Communist Tajik Government and the Islamic  opposition to reach a cease-fire between the two sides.    Informed Tajik sources connected with [the talks] told  AL-HAYAH that the raid was part of plans that have been carried  out for some time to force hundreds of thousands of Tajik  emigrants to leave the Afghan areas adjacent to the borders of  their country, in view of the fact that the emigrants are a  source of recruitment for the opposition, besides their being a  political cover for it.    The same sources affirmed that the recent raids have not  been  the first of their kind. Dostam's fighters had previously raided  the emigrant camps several times, killing more than 40 Tajiks  and wounding 100 others in two of the raids. They indicated that  the militias also use other means to terrorize the refugees,  among them poisoning the drinking water in their camps, which  has caused the death of more than 90 people.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Clinton puts faith in top lawyer President Bill Clinton yesterday reached into the upper echelons of the Washington establishment for assistance over the Whitewater affair by appointing Mr Lloyd Cutler, the celebrated Democratic lawyer, as his new White House legal counsel. Mr Cutler, 76, who served in the same capacity in the troubled last year of the Carter administration, said yesterday he would concentrate on 'procedures and actions necessary to maintain public confidence in the integrity and openness of the presidency'. The White House has said for several days it was looking for 'a Lloyd Cutler type figure' of unquestioned stature to replace Mr Bernard Nussbaum, whose resignation was announced last weekend. Mr Cutler said he was supposed to be 'counsel to the president in office and to the office of the presidency' but would not handle Mr Clinton's personal affairs dating from before he took office. News of the appointment did not deter Republicans insisting hearings be held into allegations the White House has sought to obstruct investigations into the Whitewater affair, which involves Mr and Mrs Clinton's land and financial dealings in Arkansas in the 1980s. Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia said yesterday the legislature 'has an independent obligation to investigate and to inform both itself and the country'. Republicans have already threatened to hold up the nomination of Ms Ricki Tigert to run the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation if Democrats refuse to agree to hearings. Mr Gingrich also dismissed objections from Mr Robert Fiske, the independent counsel probing Whitewater, who said hearings on Capitol Hill 'would pose a severe risk' to the integrity of his inquiries. Mr Fiske is mindful of the Iran-Contra precedent, where grants of immunity from prosecution given by Congress as a pre-condition for testimony ultimately resulted in the conviction on criminal charges of Oliver North being overturned. But Mr Jim Leach from Iowa, senior Republican on the House banking committee, said there was no reason why anybody testifying over Whitewater should be granted immunity. His committee already has plans to question Treasury officials later this month. The Democratic leadership in Congress, according to Mr Leach, is now on the horns of a dilemma, not wanting to appear to obstruct the probe but also not wanting to embarrass the president, orjeopardise his legislative programme. Mr Tom Foley, the Speaker of the House, has warned against the legal complications that might follow hearings, but has not come out flatly against them. Yesterday, Senator John Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat, speaking of the 'partisan setting' of Congress, said: 'We don't need political hearings, we need legal hearings.' Mr Clinton opened up one possible new avenue of inquiry on Monday when he said he had been told last October that federal regulators wanted a criminal investigation of Madison Guaranty, the Arkansas savings and loan institution at the heart of the affair. He insisted this information had been routinely passed on to him and was the limit of his knowledge of contacts between the White House and other departments. Yesterday Mr Clinton stoutly defended himself. 'I still haven't been accused of doing anything wrong, because I have not done anything wrong and I am not going to do anything wrong.'</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Health benefits of 85,000 retired miners and widows are being threatened by the  wildcat strikes of an estimated 37,000 coal miners, an industry group said.  Joseph Brennan, Bituminous Coal Operators Assn. president, said the health  benefits are funded through hourly contributions by the coal companies, and the  strikes have cut off much of the fund's income. United Mine Workers spokesman  Joe Corcoran could not be reached for comment on Brennan's allegations. Miners  began wildcat strikes June 12 to protest the Pittston Co.'s refusal to sign a  contract with the union and to protest the past jailing and $3-million fines  levied against the union and its members.  </P></p>

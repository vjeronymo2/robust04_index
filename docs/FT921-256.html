			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Inquiry into CD prices ruled out THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has decided not to refer manufacturers and retailers of compact discs to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Two separate OFT investigations into the prices charged by the retailers and producers of CDs failed to discover evidence of collusion sufficient to warrant a referral. An announcement is expected this week. The decision is a blow for the Consumers' Association, which has been campaigning about what it says is the high price of CDs. It has complained that CD prices in the UK are far higher than those in the US. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), which represents the music companies, says that the average full price for CDs in the UK last year was Pounds 11.99, while in the US the figure was between Dollars 12 and Dollars 13 (Pounds 6.60-Pounds 7). CD prices are also higher than those of cassettes, even though the OFT believes CDs are cheaper to manufacture. The call for less expensive CDs has received support from some retailers. In January, Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director of WH Smith, appealed to music companies to provide a wider range of inexpensive CDs. That followed his company's announcement that it would stop selling long-playing vinyl records.</p>

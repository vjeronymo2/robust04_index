Yasar Kaya, DEP  honorary president and founder, is the owner of the OZGUR GUNDEM  (Free Agenda), which ceased publication after several trials and  harassments. Brussels Bureau Director Kaya says that the Bureau  aims at defending the rights of his people, seeking  international solidarity, and serving as an information center.  [passage omitted]</p>

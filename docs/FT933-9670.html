			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Budget is 'all about paying for the 1980s': The debate over the economic effects on the real world A TRILLION dollars would equal a stack of Dollars 1,000 bills 67 miles high. That is what Ronald Reagan told Congress in February 1981, when the US national debt was edging up to this thousand billion level but was still a meagre Dollars 934bn (Pounds 627bn). Twelve years later the national debt is Dollars 4.3 trillion - and the stack of Dollars 1,000 bills is 288 miles high. Clearly, something went very wrong. But, as if indifferent to this dismal track record, politicians did not refrain last week from confidently issuing either forecasts of disaster or extravagant claims of achievement if the Clinton economic plan - the latest solution to massive US budget deficits - was enacted. President Reagan's recipe to boost the economy was to cut personal income tax rates by 10 percentage points over three years and give tax breaks to business as well. This time the Republicans said the Clinton budget package would smash the prospects for 800,000 small businesses, cost jobs and retard the recovery. Democrats said it would cut the deficit by Dollars 500bn over five years, turn the country around, end the 'gridlock' in Congress and create 8m jobs. Among the budget's 15 pounds of pages (according to one congressman, who presumably brought a scale to his office) are thousands of provisions whose effects were vigorously debated. 'As surely as night follows day, these proposals provide those who save the most with the incentive to save less,' declared Congressman Rick Lazio, a New York Republican. 'With productivity finally on the move, these tax changes provide the incentive to work less or not as hard.' In Texas alone, the new taxes will cut 41,000 jobs, said Congressman Jack Fields, another Republican. The legislation would provide Dollars 3 in tax rises and fees for every Dollars 1 in 'promised future spending cuts'. Congressman James Moran, a Virginia Democrat, had a different view. The legislation would reduce real estate taxes, encourage debt restructuring, authorise mortgage revenue bonds and low income housing tax credits. It would 'break the back of the credit crunch that is strangling this economy and reduce the number of properties that have to be seized by failed banks'. Meanwhile, economists in the real world were watching the 'theatre of the absurd', as one called the congressional show this week. Most said the impact of the legislation on the US economy would be slightly negative in the short run, modestly positive over the long term and possibly negligible overall. Economists believed it contained little economic stimulus although the Dollars 21bn to be returned to the 'working poor' in earned income tax credits might boost some additional spending. However, Mr Richard Hoey, chief economist at the investment fund group Dreyfus, is worried about the impact of the budget on consumer spending habits of the well-off. He said: 'I think it's a depressant on the consumer area - what you have is a permanent income tax increase on the higher-spending portion of the population.' He believes higher taxes will crimp consumer demand, which will 'keep the US economy in a restrained expansion mode'. Mr Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities agrees that President Clinton is wrong to have targeted high-income individuals for tax increases. 'He's taking too much money away from people who aren't as rich as he thinks. . . The economy is weak and it's going to hurt.' Many economists initially were disappointed that the president did not seek a larger budget reduction package. But upon seeing the 'absurd spectacle' in Congress, they began to think that Mr Clinton had done the best he could. Mr Bruce Steinberg, a manager at Merrill Lynch, said a tax payment of this scale in the economic package - about Dollars 240bn - would usually tend to slow the economy. But more than half the fiscal drag would be offset by interests rates lower than they would be without deficit reduction. 'The effect is at most 0.5 per cent of GDP, most likely only 0.1 or 0.2 per cent,' he said. The tax package might hurt some small businessmen, whose tax rates could rise from 31 to 36 per cent if they earn more than Dollars 200,000 a year. But 'a lot of these guys are doctors, lawyers and accountants' who do not hire many workers in any case, Mr Steinberg said. Mr Barry Bosworth, an economist with Brookings Institution said there would be 'very small' depressive effect in the short run. However, a smaller deficit means less government borrowing and higher savings and capital formation for the private sector. Much of the corporate finance restructuring is over, but corporations still are not borrowing much, which is one reason for the lower long-term interest rates. Mr William Griggs, a former Treasury official, agreed with Republicans who wanted to stress budget cuts over new taxes which probably would not produce the revenue the president expected. However, 'the depressing effects of this have been overdone,' he said. 'We will get a rise in confidence from having it passed and most taxpayers will find they have almost no tax increase.' The consensus is that job creation may move more slowly than without the new taxes, but the 2m jobs that Mr Clinton promised in the election will still be created this year, and labour force growth has slowed. The budget deficit had to be attacked at some point. 'It's all about paying for the 1980s,' said Mr Griggs.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------              PRESIDENT CLINTON'S DEFICIT REDUCTION PLAN  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Major provisions                                 1994-98 (Dollars bn)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total deficit reduction                                   496 Net spending cuts                                         255 Total revenue increases                                   241 Savings preserved in deficit reduction trust fund         496 Savings available to be spent                               0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                             MAIN SPENDING CUTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  1994-98 (Dollars bn)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Discretionary spending freeze (1993 levels)            -102.1 Medicare                                                -56.0 Retirement                                              -11.8 Medicaid                                                 -7.0 Radio spectrum auction                                  -10.2 Student loan reform                                      -4.6 Agriculture                                              -3.0 Banking and housing                                      -2.9 Customs savings                                          -2.5 Veterans                                                 -2.6 Welfare savings                                          -1.1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- MAIN TAX CHANGES*                                1994-98 (Dollars bn)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Upper-income individual taxes:  Increased rates for high-income individuals           -115.1  Repeal Dollars 135,000 Medicare payroll tax wage cap   -29.2 Corporate tax rate/estimated tax                        -24.2 Social Security                                         -24.6 4.3 cents fuel tax                                      -24.3 Low-income housing credit                                 4.9 Research tax credit                                       4.9 Small business expensing                                  4.6 Targeted capital gains for small business                 0.8  --------------------------------------------------------------------- INVESTMENT IN PEOPLE                             1994-98 (Dollars bn)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Earned Income Tax Credit                                 20.8 Food stamps                                               2.5 Inner city tax incentive                                  3.5 Family preservation and support                           1.0 Child immunisation                                        0.5 Education benefits tax exclusion                          0.9 Targeted Jobs Tax Credit                                  0.7  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Senate Budget Committee, US Office of Management and Budget *Revenue increases shown as negative numbers  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

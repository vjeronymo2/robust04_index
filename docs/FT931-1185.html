			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Properties caution The cash call from Slough Estates was generally well received, chiefly because the shares were offered at such a large discount to the ongoing market price. The 3-for-10 rights at 150p will raise Pounds 147.3m which will be used to cut gearing. News of the rights issue sent the shares into retreat, tumbling 12 at one stage, before recovering to close just 2 adrift at 193p. A cautious but generally positive statement helped lift sentiment in the stock. Some analysts predicted that the Slough issue would be the first of many in the property sector. Property shares have been in vogue in recent weeks, buoyed by talk of recovery and that the sector was at the bottom of the cycle. Last week, James Capel advised clients to go overweight in property, a move echoed by a number of other smaller brokers. Property shares have risen by 8.4 per cent in the past three weeks, against a static performance by the FT-SE All-Share. One leading property specialist said: 'With share prices moving so far ahead, a lot of the leading property groups are thought to be contemplating rights issues.' Favourites to make a call include British Land, the shares off 6 at 260p, and Great Portland Estates, down 3 at 164p.</p>

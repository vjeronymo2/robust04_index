			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Overseas side behind 20% fall at Independent News INDEPENDENT Newspapers, the Irish newspaper and publishing group, yesterday reported a 20 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, from IPounds 9.99m to IPounds 7.97m (Pounds 7.45m), for the year to December 27. Turnover of the group's worldwide operations was marginally up at IPounds 155.8m (IPounds 154.9m). Exceptional costs amounting to IPounds 3.37m related to redundancies and the unsuccessful bid for Australia's John Fairfax newspaper group accentuated the profits fall from the company's overseas markets. However, Mr Liam Healy, group chief executive, said that growth in advertising and circulation revenues in the home market helped the domestic operations increase profitability. Turnover in Ireland totalled IPounds 120m, giving operating profits of IPounds 13.5m. The overseas arms made IPounds 2.6m on turnover of IPounds 35m. Net interest charges were halved to IPounds 2.53m (IPounds 5.11m) after debt was reduced to IPounds 8.8m (IPounds 47.6m) at the year-end. The cut in debt was largely due to the raising last April of IPounds 30m in a convertible capital bond and the repayment of an ADollars 20m loan, relating to the investment in Australian Provincial Newspapers. Earnings per share declined to 18.8p (23.77p). A final dividend of 9p (8.5p) is recommended, for a total of 14p (13p). Following the failure of its Fairfax bid, Independent is now interested in taking a stake in Mirror Group Newspapers. 'If shares were put up for sale by the administrator, we would take a look,' said Mr Healy.</p>

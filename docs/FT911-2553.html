			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Allied-Lyons chiefs to step down THE chairman and chief executive of Allied-Lyons will this week announce their early retirement, only a month after the UK drinks group announced it had lost Pounds 150m on foreign exchange dealings. Sir Derrick Holden-Brown, 68, was due to step down as chairman next year, along with his chief executive, Mr Richard Martin, 58, but both are now expected to leave at the group's annual meeting in July. Sir Derrick will be replaced by Mr Michael Jackaman, 55, currently vice-chairman. The person expected to take over from Mr Martin is Mr Anthony Hales, 42, chief executive of Allied-Lyons' food division, J. Lyons. A report into the foreign exchange losses by the group's auditing firm, KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, will be ready shortly. Allied-Lyons is anxious to clear the air before its annual results are announced on May 14. The drinks group's treasury department was speculating on the continuing decline of the dollar, rather than just hedging to protect dollar earnings. The group was both writing call options on the US currency and selling dollars short against the dollar in the cash market. It was caught out when the dollar rose sharply from early February onwards. Mr Clifford Hatch, 49, resigned as finance director in March, when the losses were announced. The group said that Mr Hatch, who had been tipped as a future chief executive, felt he had to go because he was head of the department responsible for the losses. However, the Bank of England had expressed concern some months earlier to Allied-Lyons about its aggressive dealing. Such a high-level warning is unlikely to have been directed solely at Mr Hatch, which may explain the early departures of Sir Derrick and Mr Martin. Allied-Lyons shares closed at 520p on Friday. This was down 29p since the group announced on March 19 that it would take the foreign exchange loss as an exceptional provision in its results for the year to March 2. Last year Allied-Lyons made pre-tax profits of Pounds 565m on turnover of Pounds 4.7bn. The drinks group's brands include Tetley bitter, Skol Lager and Teacher's whisky. Allied-Lyons had been looking at a plan to merge its brewing operations with Whitbread, but talks have been suspended.</p>

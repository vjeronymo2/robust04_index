			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A BIG trade in Asda stock options that led to a sharp rise in total volume in the traded options was the outstanding feature in the derivatives, writes Joel Kibazo. The trade in Asda was said to have been carried out by NatWest Securities and brought volume in the stock to a hefty 15,618 contracts. Total turnover by the close was 46,052 lots, more than double Tuesday's 19,037 contracts. British Aerospace, newly returned to the FT-SE 100 Index, was also a strong feature and traded 2,920 contracts, to make it the second most active stock option. That total was well above average for the derivative instrument and reflected continued strength in the underlying equities. It was followed by Hanson at 2,161 lots and British Steel at 1,318. Shell, Glaxo and BT were also busy. Hopes of a cut in interest rates brought an advance in the June futures contract on the FT-SE 100, although volume remained thin. Having opened at 2,847, June traded lower in the first hour as independent traders sold stock. But the interest rates talk put paid to further selling and led to a strong rise. It traded around the 2,860 level over the lunchtime period and received a further boost by the firm opening on Wall Street, climbing to the day's high of 2,875. June closed at 2,873, at a 7-point premium to the underlying cash market. Turnover was 7,056 contracts.</p>

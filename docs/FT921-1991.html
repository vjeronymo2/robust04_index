			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Canadian disposal for Hillsdown Maple Leaf Foods, Hillsdown Holdings' Canadian subsidiary, has signed a sale agreement for its edible oils division, which was originally negotiated last spring. The sale will raise CDollars 105m (Pounds 51.2m). Hillsdown shares rose 2p to 177p. The buyer is CanAmera Foods, a joint venture between Central Soya of Canada, a company within the Ferruzzi empire, and CSP Foods, a large oilseed crusher and refiner based in western Canada. The deal has been passed by the regulatory authorities. Maple Leaf, 56 per cent owned by Hillsdown, the food processing company, put the business on the market in November 1990. Hillsdown decided the business, though profitable, was not a core activity. Maple Leaf had net cash at the 1991 year end of CDollars 151m. It also announced a joint venture with ConAgra of the US in flour milling and bakery mixes which would give it greater access to the US market.</p>

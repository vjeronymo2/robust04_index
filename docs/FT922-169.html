			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Arts: On the Town - Musical There seemed to be two performances of Bernstein's On the Town going on, more or less simultaneously, at the Barbican Hall on Sunday evening. The first was a glittering revival of one of the quintessential Broadway scores, glamorously cast (Thomas Hampson, Frederica von Stade, Tyne Daley, Samuel Ramey, Marie McLaughlin, Cleo Laine etc.) brilliantly played by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted with native wit and zest by Michael Tilson Thomas, neatly semi-staged - altogether a rare treat. The second was a Made-For-Video Spectacular - the concert was indeed being filmed and recorded - decked with garish visual trimmings and a thick smear of plasticky showbiz gunk. The model was the LSO's similarly-styled, and much more ghastly, Candide a couple of Christmases ago; the same vile amplification of the singers was redeployed. (Why not reduce the orchestra to pit-band size and let these fine voices ride free?) The presence as narrators of the show's celebrated authors, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, proved a distinctly mixed blessing (though Miss Comden's wry delivery managed to hit points home more than once); the danger of slipping from direct involvement in the musical into a mode of self-congratulatory sentimentality was avoided by the merest hair's breadth. Mr Tilson Thomas, waggling his behind and jumping in the air while conducting the show's nightclub sequence, seemed to be attempting a version of Lenny-on-the-podium  -one instance of 'period' practice which would have been better avoided. One resented any intrusive sentimentality in the re-creation of On the Town above all because its analysis of urban pleasures, urban affections and urban loneliness is so free of stickiness and schmalz. At a distance of half a century from the original Broadway first night, the piece grows ever more significantly in stature and proclaims its richness of substance with ever-louder voice. The schematic plot-line - three sailors on a 24-hour furlough in New York - is no more than a peg for a fresh, compassionate observation of the comedie humaine, focused in a tone of rueful verbal wit that remains authentically the city's own, and achieved in a musical language no less so. Bernstein's idiom, his mining of his Stravinsky and Copland inheritance for the purposes of popular lyric theatre, seems to me one of the great outbursts of genuinely original 20th-century creativity; this 1944 musical was its first expression, and in many ways its purest. Is there anything more touchingly, bittersweetly 'New York' than the show's Abschied, 'Some other time'? Led by Miss von Stade's Claire, in melting voice and enchanting humour, it was one of the evening's peaks. As Gabey, romantic lead of the three sailors, Mr Hampson's elegantly unforced vocal manners and handsome presence approached the ideal - his 'Lonely Town' was another moment of bittersweet sentiment finely turned. The casting of Tyne Daley as Brunnhilde Esterhazy, the wise-cracking, sexually voracious taxi-driver, was a stroke of pure genius; no less so that of Mr Ramey in two cameo roles, a master of dry, throwaway comedy. Kurt Ollman (Chip), David Garrison (Ozzie), and Marie McLaughlin (in the tiny part of the elusive Miss Turnstiles) gave lovely, spot-on accounts of themselves. The pianist, Michael Barrett, the saxophonist, John Harle, and whole handfuls of LSO wind and brass soloists deserve equal mention. In the end, thank heavens, the good, true, tough-minded LSO On the Town won out over the vulgar. Sponsored by United Airlines</p>

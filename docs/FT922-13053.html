			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Exchange contracts out IT operation THE STOCK Exchange yesterday contracted out the management of its information technology operations during the next five years to Andersen Consulting and made 32 staff redundant, Andrew Jack writes. Andersen will from today be wholly responsible for more than 300 remaining IT staff and the equipment they run, which operates Stock Exchange systems including the Seaq, Topic and Talisman information services. Taurus, the new settlement system, is not included and a handful of IT staff will remain to work on new development projects. Total employment has been reduced from 1,900 to about 1,550 over the past few months, including yesterday's action.</p>

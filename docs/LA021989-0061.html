MAYER  (PANTHEON BOOKS: $29.95; 468 PP.; 0-397-57154-1)  </P> <P> Efforts at understanding the "Final Solution" the Nazi term for the  annihilation of the Jews -- have given rise to two polar positions, the  intentionalist and the functionalist. Briefly, the intentionalists see a direct  line between Hitler's anti-Semitic proclamations and the introduction of  anti-Jewish measures, including the Final Solution. In contrast, the  functionalists maintain that in part the Final Solution emerged out of a series  of improvisations and as a reaction to existing conditions. Partly because no  written directive by Hitler was ever found ordering the systematic annihilation  of Jews, the functionalists see no direct connection between the anti-Semitic  proclamations by leaders of the Third Reich and the Final Solution.  Specifically, too, they assume that the Final Solution emerged as a reaction to  German military disappointments on the Russian front. Unlike the  intentionalists, the functionalists think that, as an official policy, the  Final Solution was established not before but during the Russian campaign.  </P> <P> Seemingly innocent, the intentionalist and functionalist arguments may have  significant political overtones. The functionalists, by perceiving the Final  Solution, in part, as a haphazard reaction to existing conditions, diminish its  importance and dilute the responsibility for its establishment and  implementation. Such a position may play into the hands of some revisionists  who deny not only the significance, but also the very existence of the Final  Solution.  </P> <P> It is indeed a matter of historical record that before the Nazi government  began to concentrate on the persecution of Jews it was busy murdering and  placing into the concentration camps thousand of Germans whom it perceived as  actual or potential political opponents. Later on, the same government applied  equally oppressive measures toward native populations in newly conquered  territories. Such measures were introduced with special ruthlessness to Poland  where the first targets of destruction were Polish elites rather than Jews.  Thousands of Poles were murdered while additional thousands were incarcerated  in concentration camps. In fact, at first, most of the Auschwitz inmates  belonged to the Polish elites. In the end, the Nazis succeeded in decimating  the Polish intelligentsia.  </P> <P> Such criminal governmental activities created a proper climate for the  annihilation of Jews without, however, establishing causal connections between  them. Direct causal links are suggested by other developments. One of them is  the emergence of the Einsatzgruppen, SS units whose aim it was to kill  civilians in the soon-to-be-conquered Russian territories. The training of  these groups began in March and April, 1941. After the invasion of Russia on  June 22, 1941, the Einsatzgruppen and their collaborators succeeded in  murdering an estimated 1.5 million civilians, about 90% of whom were Jewish.  </P> <P> Other measures in support of the Final Solution were also being introduced. On  July 31, 1941, Goering authorized Heydrich to prepare a plan for the "total"  solution of the Jewish question. On Oct. 23, 1941, Himmler issued an order  forbidding Jewish emigration from German-held territories. Approximately at  that time work began on the first Jewish death camps at Belzec and Chelmno. On  Nov. 29, 1941, invitations went out for the Wannsee conference, one of whose  aims was to coordinate Jewish deportations from across Europe. Originated in  the highest echelons of the Nazi regime, these moves suggest a  well-orchestrated plan of action that set in motion the Final Solution.  </P> <P> Arno J. Mayer's "Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?" while presenting a thorough  historical account of the Final Solution touches upon some of the issues  contained in the intentionalist-functionalist debate. Offering a lucid  description of the complex historical events that led into World War I and  World War II, and relying on extensive knowledge of European history, the  history of the Third Reich and the history of the Final Solution, the book  deals with the intricate dynamics of these complex events rather than their  structures. Describing the processes of important ideological and behavioral  currents and counter currents, the author offers a fascinating account of one  of the most important chapters in human history.  </P> <P> But how does this book fit into the intentionalist-functionalist debate?  </P> <P> Mayer writes that: "Anti-Semitism was a cardinal postulate of the  Weltanschauung which fired the rise of the Nazi movement as well as the  consolidation of the Nazi regime and its drive for the mastery of Europe. But  although anti-Semitism was an essential tenet of the Nazi worldview, it was  neither its foundation nor its principal or sole intention. Anti-Semitism was  one of several central creeds of an essentially syncretic ideology, the others  being social Darwinism, the geopolitics of eastern expansionism, and  anti-Marxism. While these four articles of faith were closely enmeshed and  eventually crystallized into an indivisible belief system, within this system  their position and importance in relation to each other varied with time,  place, and circumstance."  </P> <P> The author is correct in asserting that anti-Semitism was not the only Nazi  creed, and he elucidates these different components with accuracy. He is also  right in assuming that the importance of these creeds " . . . varied with time,  place, and circumstance."  </P> <P> Having said that, Mayer, in a somewhat ambiguous way, shows how anti-Semitism  became ingrained in other Nazi creeds when he writes that: "Anti-Semitism  permeated Hitler's worldview and project. It was also consonant with his  interpretation -- and execration -- of the corruption of the modern world. But  while Hitler condemned the Jews as the chief disease-carrying poisoners and  parasites of contemporary society, he struck out through them against the  processes and forces of emancipation of modernization, which for him were the  ultimate source of pollution. Indeed, if Hitler's worldview had an epicenter,  it was his deep-seated animosity toward contemporary civilization, and not his  hatred for Jews, which was grafted onto it."  </P> <P> In another place, Mayer says that: "The Nazi leaders stressed that there was,  of course, no fighting Marxism and Bolshevism without understanding them, which  meant facing up to the pivotal role of the Jews. All of Europe needed to  realize that, having invented the Bolshevik madness, the Jews were  masterminding it from Moscow in their bid for world domination."  </P> <P> From these statements, and others, it appears that the Nazi government blamed  the Jews for "Marxism," "Bolshevism," "Modernism," and a host of other societal  ills. Since the elimination of these ills assumed a pivotal position in  Hitler's overall program, it follows that the elimination of Jews who were  defined as responsible for these ills was also a central aim of the Third  Reich.  </P> <P> Once opportunities for destroying the Jews presented themselves, Hitler and  other Nazi leaders took advantage of them. The war with Russia was one of those  opportunities. Moreover, historical evidence shows that eventually the  annihilation of Jews took precedence over the conduct of the war. Jews  continued to be murdered en mass even though they were a potentially valuable  economic commodity, and when the trains transporting them to their death were  needed by the military.  </P> <P> These are some of the facts, but facts seldom speak for themselves. The  enormity and complexity of the Final Solution demand more study and more  deliberation. "Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?" meets both of these  requirements and becomes a welcome addition to the existing literature.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL TEAM MISSING IN WATER POLO EVENT  </P> <P> It's like losing your voice on opening night or missing a surprise party in  your honor.  </P> <P> For six of the past eight years, San Diego Sunset, the county's top water polo  club, has qualified for the U.S. Senior Men's National Water Polo  championships.  </P> <P> This year, the tournament will be held at UC San Diego's Canyon View Pool,  beginning today and ending Sunday. It took years of finagling by Pacific  Southwest Water Polo to bring the event here for the first time. But Sunset,  the two-time defending senior indoor champion, won't be competing.  </P> <P> At last week's zone qualifying, from which five of the 12 teams advanced, San  Diego was knocked out by Santa Barbara and Stanford.  </P> <P> "It's extremely depressing," said Denny Harper, Sunset and UCSD coach.  "Qualifying for this tournament is not an easy process at all. Summer after  summer we've worked so hard to get it here, and now we're not playing in our  hometown. It just didn't work out."  </P> <P> Harper has had to completely change his goals for this tournament.  </P> <P> "At this very minute, I'm trying to adjust our goals," he said. "When I wanted  to host it, the motivation was being able to play in a national tournament  without having to travel."  </P> <P> But with his team not competing, Harper is focusing on putting on an impressive  event instead of his usual coaching duties.  </P> <P> "This have been a community effort," he said. "Everyone's worked . . . to get  this thing done right."  </P> <P> This is the first year the event, which ranks right behind the NCAA  championship in importance, has been held outside the Los Angeles or San  Francisco Bay areas.  </P> <P> Dave Alberstein, PSWP district chairman and tournament director, said that  outside of those areas, water polo awareness is low at best.  </P> <P> "The real reason (it was moved here)," Alberstein said, "is there is a growing  realization that if this is to grow across the county, they need to start  putting the sport on display in other cities. Here, it's not as advanced as it  is in L.A. or San Francisco."  </P> <P> Next year's championship will be in Portland, Ore.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to obtain national sponsorship if (sponsors) don't feel they'll  get national exposure," Alberstein said. "Putting water polo on display in  other cities is one way to do it."  </P> <P> Water Polo Notes  </P> <P> While the absence of San Diego Sunset is disappointing, the tournament is not  totally without San Diego representation. Valhalla graduate James Fletcher  plays for Newport B (UC Irvine's varsity) and University graduate Eric  Bockstahler plays for Bruin Polo (UCLA's top team). . . . The top four seeded  teams of the 12 in the tournament are Newport A, with three 1988 Olympians on  the roster, Beach, affiliated with Long Beach State, Golden Bear of Berkeley  and Bruin Polo.  </P></p>

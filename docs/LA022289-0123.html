			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES;  </P> <P> GSAC BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BICKMORE RALLIES SCC WITH SECOND-HALF RUN  </P> <P> Jeff Bickmore led Southern California College to a 79-67 victory over Fresno  Pacific in a Golden State Athletic Conference basketball game Tuesday at SCC.  </P> <P> SCC trailed at halftime, 32-27, but Bickmore scored 14 points during an 18-0  SCC run in the second half.  </P> <P> "We were pretty much standing around defensively, playing pretty flat-footed  and passively," SCC Coach Bill Reynolds said. "And you could say we alluded to  that rather strongly at halftime."  </P> <P> Bickmore scored on a layup, then Terry Scruggs stole the ball and took it  fullcourt for a layup. In the next 5 minutes SCC (25-3 overall, 12-3 in  conference) used a full-court press to force eight bad Fresno shots.  </P> <P> "The second half I was just getting the ball and getting good position inside,"  Bickmore said. "(The run) was caused mainly by our defense getting loose balls  and making steals."  </P> <P> Said Reynolds: "We usually get a spurt like that, thank goodness. And we never  know if or when it will come."  </P> <P> SCC shot 50% during the second half and 41% for the game, but a 13-point lead  became six points, 67-61, with 4 minutes to play.  </P> <P> "We had our peak and then went right back into the valley, " Reynolds said. "I  guess that's really what you call game slippage."  </P> <P> SCC and Fresno traded baskets the first 5 minutes of play and after tying the  score, 14-14, and three scoreless minutes, Fresno (17-12, 8-5) pulled ahead to  take the halftime lead.  </P> <P> Bickmore led all scorers with 25 points, Scruggs added 22 and Todd Dixon had  21. For Fresno, Donnie Johnson had 18, and Brian Falls had 11.  </P> <P> In another Golden State Athletic Conference men's game:  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran 130, Christ College Irvine 96 -- Steve deLaveaga scored a  single-game school record 51 points for host Cal Lutheran. He was 20 of 30 from  field and 7 of 12 from three-point range. It was the 81st consecutive game he  has scored in double figures. He is averaging a conference high 28.1 points a  game.  </P> <P> Aaron Clasen scored 22 points and Albert Gay added 20 points and a team-high 10  rebounds for Christ College (4-25, 0-13).  </P> <P> In a Golden State Athletic Conference women's game:  </P> <P> Fresno Pacific 66, Southern California 50 -- Irene Robles and Kellie Fry scored  17 points each to lead visiting Fresno Pacific (21-7, 11-2). Roxanne Trost  scored 12 and Paula Hale 11 for SCC (5-24, 1-11).  </P></p>

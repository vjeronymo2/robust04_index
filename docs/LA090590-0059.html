			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> U.S. OUTLINES CONTAINMENT STRATEGY FOR MIDEAST PEACE  </P> <P> In suggesting the creation of a new multinational organization to guarantee  security and stability in the Middle East, the Bush Administration for the  first time has sketched its vision of a solution for the turbulent region that  would outlive the current crisis.  </P> <P> As outlined by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the proposal essentially  would seek to transplant to the Middle East the strategy of containment that  the United States successfully pursued for more than 40 years in its Cold War  against the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Operating like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the new entity would  seek to assemble an overwhelming coalition to repel military aggression by Iraq  -- or any other nation that might rise up to pose a threat to the region and  its vast energy supplies.  </P> <P> The principle is sound, as the success of NATO has shown. But attempts to  create similar structures elsewhere have been less successful, leaving it far  from clear whether the approach could succeed in such a different political  landscape.  </P> <P> Some experts warn that the approach could even be disastrous. They say that it  could inflame Arab resentment at Western intervention, ultimately undercutting  the support of even the most friendly nations in the region for the concept.  </P> <P> "I think that this would not be well received among the Arab populations," said  Shireen T. Hunter, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and  International Studies in Washington.  </P> <P> But other analysts -- expressing what U.S. officials said is the growing  consensus within the Bush Administration -- argue that there is no other  conceivable model for a truly lasting solution in the Middle East.  </P> <P> "It's the only hope," said Judith Kipper, a senior fellow at the Brookings  Institution. "You have to build in deterrents and red lines and green lines  before you can have peace."  </P> <P> Baker provided only spare details of Administration thinking in his testimony  before Congress on Tuesday, insisting that planning for the long term remains  in an embryonic stage.  </P> <P> He made clear, however, that the United States now expects to maintain "some  continuing (military) presence" in the region as part of a new Middle East  security organization to be composed primarily of Arab nations.  </P> <P> And in drawing the explicit parallel to NATO, Baker suggested that the new  security arrangement could serve as such a powerful deterrent "that there would  be very little risk" that a Middle Eastern leader might be tempted to resort to  armed conflict to further his goals.  </P> <P> A senior State Department official said that the remarks reflect a Bush  Administration conclusion that the United States must take steps to "contain"  Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein even if he ultimately agrees to withdraw his forces  from Kuwait.  </P> <P> "It doesn't mean that you have to get rid of him, but you do have to contain  him," the senior official said. He added: "We need a broader security  structure, one that ensures access to the energy of the region."  </P> <P> With the United States likely to provide the decisive military power, the  security arrangement that the Administration appears to have in mind might most  closely resemble not NATO but the regional treaty organizations established in  the 1950s in efforts to block Soviet expansion.  </P> <P> But as critics note, those experiments were far from outright successes. The  Baghdad Pact -- a 1954 anti-Soviet alliance made up of Middle Eastern powers  and backed by Britain -- collapsed of its own weight four years later when  Iraqi opposition to the close links to the West contributed to a revolution  that ousted the monarchy and put Iraq squarely in the Soviet camp.  </P> <P> And the separate Southeast Asian Treaty, signed by the United States and other  world and regional powers in 1954, established a U.S. obligation to the region  that historians regard as a principal factor motivating the American entry into  the Vietnam War.  </P> <P> In citing these lessons, analysts said Thursday that any American decision to  create a new security organization carries with it the danger of a backlash in  the Arab world and could heighten the prospect of U.S. involvement in conflict  in the area.  </P> <P> In particular, many experts warned that simmering Arab hostility toward U.S.  involvement in the region could turn dangerous if it became clear that the  American presence would be long-term.  </P> <P> "People are going to say -- pact or no pact -- this is just a justification to  get the United States involved," said Hunter, the CSIS analyst. As a result,  she and others suggested, regimes friendly to the United States might be  overthrown, undermining the Arab base for the security treaty.  </P> <P> Other analysts, however, contend that the prospect of domestic turmoil in the  Middle East is a risk far more acceptable than the bloodshed that they said  inevitably would continue without some multilateral effort to keep the peace.  </P> <P> "We can't live with this the way it is," said Kipper of Brookings. But she  cautioned that it probably is no longer within the power of the United States  alone to persuade Arab nations to accept a permanent security organization.  </P> <P> "It would have to be a joint U.S.-Soviet initiative," she said, "because that  means it's serious."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jim Mann contributed to this story.  </P></p>

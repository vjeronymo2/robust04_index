			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Unigate buys back dairy and depots Unigate is to buy Dairy Crest's Marshfield dairy located at Cardiff and four associated depots for Pounds 11.45m. The dairy and three depots in south Wales - the other is at Marlborough - were part of Unigate until 1989 when they were sold to Dairy Crest as part of a package together with other dairy businesses in the Midlands and eastern counties. MD Foods, based in Accrington, said yesterday that it had acquired Dairy Crest's milk business at Bamber Bridge, near Preston. No details of the consideration were given. As part of the integration of the businesses the Accrington dairy, which employs 350 people, will be closed. MD said the deal enlarged and consolidated its operations in the north-west and produced a stronger base for further development.</p>

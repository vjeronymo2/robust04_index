			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Management: How to tell a bastard from an ingratiator / A look at who attends training courses Most organisations make some investment in training their staff in management techniques: they either hire training consultants, staff an in-house department or, in addition, send managers on external training courses (often a combination of all three). The courses come in various packages with different titles. There are the skill-based courses, teaching such topics as negotiation, presentation, social or time-management skills. Others on offer are developmental workshops, customer-focused programmes and modified business-school courses. Just as people come to resemble their dogs, so trainers seem to have personalities that fit their courses. The presentation course tutor is immaculate; the customer-driven trainer exceptionally attentive to your needs, and the lecturer for the finance course for non-financial managers highly numerate. But what about the people who attend training courses? Many experienced, full-time trainers tend to develop simple typologies to describe training course attenders or delegates. Cabin crew, waitresses, nurses, traffic wardens and all those who deal with the general public as their customers also classify people into different groups (with sometimes unflattering labels). It is a shorthand to characterise the large numbers of individuals whom they encounter. These typologies, of course, pigeon-hole. They are prototypes that may never exist in pure form but which amuse the trainers who recognise their generic characteristics. They refer to the attitudes and behaviours of the delegates. Indeed they may also reflect the delegates' attitudes to their work. The following categories cover the vast majority of individuals: The prisoner: the scowl on the face, the arms tightly folded across the chest and the folded letter from the boss or personnel demanding - requiring  -that they have to attend the course, characterise this type. They have probably managed to avoid this course, or ones like it, many times before, but eventually are caught. They are prisoners - they do not want to be there and wish they were somewhere else. They are sour, negative, unhelpful and unco-operative. The escapee: this type is the course-junkie who jumps at the opportunity to get out of the office. They may hate their work or simply enjoy education and training at the company's expense. The escapee is usually rather too experienced at course activities, games and questionnaires and may well have done them before. They are easy to deal with from the trainer's point of view, but not good value for money from the perspective of their company. The old dog: there are various reasons why some people believe they cannot be taught new tricks. Some delegates are on-the-job retirees, in the departure lounge of the organisation. They may be quite a long way from retirement, but they are not interested in learning anything. Others believe courses are too abstract, too theoretical, too vague and have nothing to add to their day-to-day working lives. The eager-beaver: this type comes in two forms. The first is the enthusiastic learner, genuinely interested in gaining skills, insights and knowledge. The second is the slightly naive delegate who is happy to take anything on board but has few critical faculties. This makes them gullible and unfocused, though certainly easy for the trainer. The intellectual: whereas the old dog may reject what he has been told because it is too vague and theoretical, the intellectual wants to know the empirical and epistemological bases of the data being presented. Many are snobs who believe that they know more than the trainer (sometimes they do). These high-flyers may believe either the content or the style is not appropriate for their level. They may enjoy humiliating the trainer if they can. The bastard: familiar to UK prime minister John Major, they are arrogant know-it-alls. They usually believe personnel departments should be closed, all consultants fired and the money put into the company's pension fund. In a curious way, they enjoy courses in the same way that they enjoy meetings, because they have learnt to create the maximum disruption. They may be simple attention-seekers and in some organisations they are intellectually under-powered. They are a nightmare for trainers because they are solely interested in scuppering or damaging the proceedings. The ingratiator: many people are anxious when attending courses because they fear being shown up in front of others. These people tend to be what Americans charmingly call 'apple polishers'. The ingratiator tries to do a deal with the trainer: 'I will be a good boy/good girl if you don't expose or humiliate me.' And for trainers it is a good deal. Most trainers will probably recognise the above, although they may have rather different categories or titles. And they also know that different companies tend to have more or less of each type. Thus the publicly owned bureaucracy probably sends mainly old dogs, escapees and prisoners to courses, while the successful private company may send rather a lot of intellectuals and the occasional ingratiator. Next time you are on a course, look around the room, and see who's in. The author is head of the Business Psychology Unit at University College London.</p>

Witnesses reported isolated clashes early Saturday in the  south of the capital between militiamen loyal to opposition  leader Bernard Kolelas and troops of President Pascal Lissouba.    A commission under Defence Minister Raymond Damase Ngollo  formed to mediate a solution to the crisis was in contact with  both camps, officials said. But the officials added that the  commission had failed to set up direct negotiations, although  both sides said they were not in favour of a "military solution"  to the standoff.    The negotiations are being flagged as a forum for opposition  and pro-Lissouba forces to agree on the make-up of a government  of national union to end a seven-month crisis sparked by  disputed general elections last year.    The clashes have killed an estimated 110 people in  Brazzaville since the beginning of December. [passage omitted  covered in referent item]    Opposition forces say they favour the national unity  government, provided the results of a judicial inquiry into 58  calls for the annulment of voting in certains constituencies  from the June 1 first round of polling onwards are published.  The elections eventually returned a majority of 65 pro-Lissouba  candidates, reversing the previous make-up of the 125-seat  legislature.    Opposition forces believe the balance of power could shift  again after the inquiry publishes its findings. They are  scheduled to be released in February.    Clashes after the first round which claimed some 30 lives  forced the suspension of polling. Voting resumed in October  after both sides reached agreement in August to set up the  inquiry.    But violence flared again in November, when around 50 died  during fresh bloodshed in the capital.    The fighting has had a disastrous effect on Congo's already  weakened economy, with opposition barricades forcing the closure  of the rail link between Brazzaville and the port of  Pointe-Noire, the country's main trading centre.</p>

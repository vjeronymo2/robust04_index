			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yevgeniy Bobkun report: "Germany Showing No Signs of </F> Coming to Its Senses After Pavel Grachev's Statements in  Brussels"]    [Text] Bonn -- "A good man, but dangerous": This is how  one top NATO chief, returning to Bonn from Brussels, assessed  the Russian defense minister. The FRG's military-political  circles are alarmed by provisions in Russia's military doctrine  making possible intervention in the "Near Abroad." "Moscow  proposes to move probable conflict on Russia's borders onto the  territory of the opponent as quickly as possible," WELT AM  SONTAG writes.    The initial euphoria of the participants in the Brussels  conference quickly turned to dismay when they listened to Pavel  Grachev, the German general acknowledged. When the guest from  Moscow reassured his NATO colleagues that the Russian Army does  not intend to save national minorities in the "Near Abroad,"  everyone sighed with relief. But, when he added: "Unless the  relevant countries want this," NATO went on its guard. This  phrase reminded many irresistibly of the "call for help" to  Moscow from Czechoslovakia and other countries when it was  necessary to crush popular uprisings in the "Soviet spheres of  influence."    FRG Defense Minister V. Ruehe, who has long advocated the  expansion of NATO to include the states of Central and East  Europe, rejected Grachev's proposals to establish a "strategic"  partnership between Moscow and NATO.    Meanwhile, the Bundeswehr leadership has announced that the  new partners' Armed Forces -- Poland's, for example -- have  already begun to adapt their structures to NATO's. At the  request of the Hungarian Government Bundeswehr General Winfried  Dunkel recently went to Budapest with the same purpose. The  Baltic states have also approached Germany with a request for  aid in reequiping and redirecting their forces. In particular,  they are asking for tanks from the former arsenals of the GDR  Army.    General Helge Hansen, commander of the allied joint forces  in  Central Europe, has announced that the first staff exercises  with the participation of Poland, Ukraine, the Czech Republic,  and Estonia will take place on FRG territory in October of this  year.    It is not only the newcomers who will have to adapt to the  new conditions of partnership. Germany will be required to  elaborate new juridical prerequisites for the presence on its  territory of troop subunits of the Eastern countries who come to  the FRG with their arms and combat equipment. If, for example,  a Polish regiment returns home from the exercises, then, under  the currently existing provision of the law on arms export  controls, it will have to leave its equipment behind in Germany.</p>

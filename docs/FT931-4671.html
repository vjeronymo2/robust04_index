			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Management: Driven towards leanness - Rolls-Royce Motors has radically transformed its working practices Today's annual results from the UK engineering group Vickers will once again bear the scar of big losses from its luxury car subsidiary Rolls-Royce. But according to a confident Peter Ward, Rolls' chairman and chief executive, 'there'll be black ink' at the operating level next time. Ward can make this claim because of the way the company has quietly been undergoing a revolution along Japanese 'lean manufacturing' lines. Traditional working practices have been overturned, employee numbers have been cut from 5,200 to 2,490 and the break-even level of production has been reduced to less than 1,400 cars a year from 2,800 in October 1991. By any standards that is a considerable achievement, though, as Ward admits, urgent action was required. Rolls was certainly forced to slim down in response to the previous car market collapse in the early 1980s  - but inevitably costs got out of control again during the unprecedented eight-year bull market which reached its apogee for Rolls in 1990 with record sales of 3,300. Even at the slashed breakeven level, Rolls-Royce would have made further losses last year with sales of just 1,378. But Ward points out the changes in company organisation first put in train at the end of 1990 mean Rolls needs only a slight sales lift this year for operating profitability to be restored. It will take much more time to reduce the company's daunting debt burden: Rolls will have been largely responsible for an expected rise in Vickers' total indebtedness to around Pounds 110m by the end of last year. The enormous changes in production process and labour organisation are evident all over the sprawling facilities at Crewe, Cheshire. 'It is simply a different business. We've turned it round,' says Ward. The spur for change came from a growing fear that due to the Gulf war, the imposition of a luxury goods tax and doubled 'gas guzzler' taxes in its prized US market, and gathering recession elsewhere, the company's very survival could be in doubt. 'So we asked ourselves, if we had a greenfield site how would we run it? We went away and created a plan of a greenfield site, and decided to make it happen on the old one,' Ward said. Out of the exercise emerged a 'green book' forming the basis of new working practices and factory organisation which would sweep away old demarcation lines, create Japanese-style working teams and the concept that any individual unit within the plant was the customer of another. The plant was divided into 16 zones, each encouraged under a manager to act as a business within a business and assuming full responsibility for cost, quality, delivery and even materials purchased. Within the zones work 160 teams, typically six to 10 strong. Out went charge hands and foremen, leaving a flatter management structure of just four levels. Within the teams there is total flexibility regardless of individuals' craft backgrounds. The 120 union representatives - reflecting Rolls' broad craft traditions - were reduced to 47 and just seven elected to the joint works-staff negotiating committee. Such dissent as there was came from local convenor level, not from national union leaders. It was a radical approach, inevitably provoking great scepticism. But negotiations on its introduction were finished by March 1991. 'The biggest problem was middle management trying to protect status quo,' recalls Bernard Preston, director of quality. Preston recalls recently having a senior Mazda manager visit the plant. 'He said we've gone further than a Japanese plant could go. Here we've got people on Pounds 40,000 working together on the same team with someone on Pounds 280 a week. They couldn't do that in Japan.' Rolls' teams are becoming acclimatised to their new-found freedom - and responsibilities. The sense of commitment and 'proprietorship' has been heightened, says Preston, by changes such as a member of one of the four-engine assembly teams spending three hours assembling one engine, not the previous 34 minutes doing specific taskes. It has become 'his' engine. Butch Wilson, a former fitter, makes clear he has no resentments about income disparities with the engineers on the engine teams: 'We help them; they help us and within a couple of hours we get almost any problems solved.' The results, says zone manager Chris Johnson, are already apparent. One measure - the number of rectifications per car - has gone from 150 to 47, 'and the faults themselves are getting smaller'. The team approach means that even in the tradition-steeped interior trim area, the upholstering of the complex rear seat squab now requires nine hours, not 27. The changes are not confined to labour organisation. The almost total closure of Rolls' London coachbuilding facility, Mulliner Park Ward, nearly three years ago and the transfer of most of its operation to Crewe means the plant has gone from making one model range to four. With the introduction of more computer numerically controlled machining equipment Rolls is making many more of its complex components in-house and in greater variety. It is out-sourcing simple items such as fasteners which it traditionally has made itself. With Rolls' inventories slashed, senior managers say they are becoming able to differentiate between suppliers who already work with Japanese car makers in the UK and those who do not, 'and have the old adversarial attitudes'. With more disciplined production planning, Rolls is now talking to suppliers about delivering straight to its assembly line. For the first time in the company's history, shop floor employees are attending product events so that they can appreciate customer reaction at first hand. Managers say the working system has reached the stage where it is gaining its own momentum, with managers no longer having to push. But no one is under any illusions about the formidable task still ahead in terms of financial recovery.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Syndicated Loans: Cyprus returns with Dollars 35m five-year deal CYPRUS has returned to the international capital markets with a Dollars 35m five-year syndicated loan for the Electricity Authority of Cyprus. The Republic of Cyprus last turned to the loans market in September 1991 when it wanted a Dollars 120m five-year standby facility to back its Dollars 200m Eurocommercial paper programme. The latest deal, arranged and underwritten by Sumitomo Bank and Commercial Bank of Greece, is guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus and will be used to pay for two gas turbines. The margin is 60 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor), with front-end fees of 25 basis points for commitments of Dollars 5m, 20 basis points on Dollars 2.5m and 15 basis points on Dollars 1m. Bankers point out that the terms on the latest deal are not truly comparable to those on the earlier Republic of Cyprus transaction which was arranged by Arab Banking Corporation, Bank of America, Bank of Tokyo, Gulf International Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, WestLB Group and Girozentrale Vienna. The Republic of Cyprus facility paid a commitment fee of 35 basis points, but the margin of 65 basis points over Libor was seen as 'academic' since the facility provided a backstop to the commercial paper programme to be drawn in case of emergency.</p>

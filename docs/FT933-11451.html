			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: French aid helps D Smith to Pounds 27m DAVID S Smith (Holdings), the paper, packaging and office supplies group, reported sharply higher full-year profits and said trading volumes were improving in the UK, but deteriorating on the Continent. Mr Peter Williams, chief executive, said although UK prices remained depressed, volumes in packaging 'are moving ahead by about 3 to 4 per cent.' Pre-tax profits increased by 76 per cent to Pounds 27.1m in the year to May 1, fuelled by a full-year contribution from Kaysersberg Packaging of France which was acquired at the start of April 1992. That compared with Pounds 15.4m in the previous year when profits were depressed by Pounds 8.7m of costs for redundancies and other reorganisation expenses. Earnings increased to 22p (11.5p). The final dividend of 7.25p makes a total for the year of 10p (9.5p). The latest results were unchanged from the estimates made last month when the group announced the Pounds 95m acquisition of Spicers, the UK's largest wholesaler of office products, from Svenska Cellulosa of Sweden. Turnover rose to Pounds 518.9m (Pounds 361.5m) and operating profit jumped to Pounds 38.1m (Pounds 13.3m) including Pounds 24.2m (Pounds 1.8m) from Kaysersberg. Interest charges of Pounds 11m, against net income of Pounds 2.1m, reflected increased borrowings following the Kaysersberg acquisition and the capital investment programme. COMMENT David S Smith's recent performance has been fuelled by the acquisition of Kaysersberg which has helped disguise the severe impact of the recession on the UK paper and packaging businesses. Spicers will add an important third leg to the business while the tentative first signs of the long-awaited turning of the cycle should eventually bring relief to St Regis Paper which nevertheless remained in profit last year because the results of specialist mills offset those from the commodity corrugated case materials mills. First half performance will be held back by the completion of the Kemsley development programme, but full year pre-tax profits of Pounds 44m and earnings per share of 26.3p are expected producing a prospective p/e of 14.4.</p>

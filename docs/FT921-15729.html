			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Observer: Spring fever In the spring, a Frenchman's (or Frenchwoman's) fancy must not turn to thoughts of harassment. If they do, and if the transgressors are at work, Veronique Neiertz, France's state secretary for women's rights and daily life will pounce. Penalties for sexual harassment are increasingly common throughout the world. But the proposed French text is distinctive in one curious way. It describes the offence as 'A word, gesture, attitude or behaviour by a hierarchical superior with a view to compel an employee to respond to a solicitation of a sexual nature'. This wording seems to imply either that there is no such thing as sexual harassment by a hierarchical equal or inferior; or that it is not an offence. Both of these propositions must be absurd.</p>

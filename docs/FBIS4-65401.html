			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis called on the UN  Security Council to adopt specific alternative ways to implement  its resolutions on Cyprus.    In an interview with ASSOCIATED PRESS, Kliridhis said the  deadlock became intractable because of the Turkish side's  continuing intransigence and systematic rejection of UN  resolutions. The president added that in light of this, the  Security Council must take an alternative approach in seeking a  Cyprus solution.</p>

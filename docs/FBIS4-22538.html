			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Industry Minister Vladimer Kereselidze by </F> Armaz Saneblidze, Donetsk-Kiev-Tbilisi: "Economic Passions. A  Triptych for Two Ministers and a Vice President"; date not given]    [Text] Of course you remember the words in the  subtitle below, from Genesis, when Adam and Eve realized they  were naked.    The race of Adam lives on this "cursed ground" because  of him (3:17) and must "eat bread in the sweat of his face until  he returns into the ground" (3:19).    We toil for our sustenance all our lives in this era of  night herdsmen and ministers.    And we seek a way out by making aprons appropriate to  the times, to cover our nakedness.    Even today. But on a grander scale.    We talked to Georgia's Industry Minister Vladimer  Kereselidze on specific subjects of practical value, for we've  had it up to here with the tea, citrus, Borzhomi water and the  strong, healthy economy promised at rallies.  <H5>  "And They Sewed Fig Leaves Together, and Made Themselves </H5> Aprons"    [Saneblidze] My first question, Batono Vladimer, is about  the  32 percent your enterprises are not paying to the state. Why are  they hiding it?    [Kereselidze] You mean the funds our enterprises have in  Russia. They add up to a lot, but we can't get them--that is, we  can't bring them back to Georgia, so the money circulates in  Russia.    I personally am against any deviation; the law is the law,  and I try to obey it. The republic budget should be getting its  due.    [Saneblidze] You are aware that practical executives have  their own practical arguments as to why they aren't bringing the  money into Georgia.    [Kereselidze] If they don't put the money to work there, in  Russia, Georgia's enterprises will just shut down. You know the  banking and credit system has broken down and transfers between  countries have been stopped. And, nobody wants our coupons. The  only chance our factories have now is to circulate the money in  Russia, for example, to use it to buy the materials and supplies  the enterprises need. Is that a crime? I think not. But, again,  we have to obey every lawful requirement.    [Saneblidze] Neither sinful nor sinless.... Specifically,  how  much does this action by enterprise executives help Georgia's  economy--or does it?    [Kereselidze] Of course not. The situation has to be  corrected, but that is often beyond the powers of enterprise  executives.    Let's be specific.    I mentioned that money circulation between the independent  countries has been stopped. Here we are in Ukraine, and one of  my main tasks is to bring it about that the Ukrainians' debts go  to work in their own country. For example, Tbilisi's  Elektroapparat and Kutaisi's Automotive Plant have money here  that they got from selling their products, yet we can't transfer  it from Kiev to Donetsk Oblast--Makeyevka--in order to obtain  goods in exchange from that city's enterprises, because  Ukrainian law forbids it.    The intergovernmental agreement we signed should change this  status quo. That's the goal of me and our delegation.    [Saneblidze] I almost hate to ask, but do you think  Georgia's  joining the ruble zone is the way to solve the problems of money  circulation between countries and, hence, industry's problems?    [Kereselidze] Of course, if they'll have us!    [Saneblidze] Why?    [Kereselidze] First, because rubles are rubles and coupons  are coupons, whether Georgian or Ukrainian coupons. Both  countries are suffering from hyperinflation, so naturally they  aren't interested in our coupons, nor we in theirs. If a unified  zone is created--call it the ruble zone--the problems that today  are unsolvable for the above reasons will be solved.    [Saneblidze] Finance experts (and others besides) think that  the only way to strengthen Georgia's finances is to revive our  economy, specifically industry. What are the prospects?    [Kereselidze] Economists and finance experts have their own  ideas on that. I'm not the kind of man who has a ready answer to  everything. I'll just tell you what industry's contribution to  the revival of Georgia's economy will be, in the Ministry's  framework.    The Industry Ministry was formed by combining the Light  Industry Ministry, the Timber and Woodworking Ministry, Local  Industry Ministry, and plants formerly under Soviet  jurisdiction. That accounts for its large share: the Ministry  complex accounts for 50 to 55 percent of Georgia's production  output. That shows the role it plays in our economy.    A lot has been said about the causes of our woes, by your  newspaper in particular. The main thing, however, is that the  vital ties our industry used to have with Ukraine, Russia, and  other former Soviet republics were broken. These ties have to be  restored. That is the purpose of all our trips to these  countries.    I've already mentioned the other necessity and need not  repeat it.    These things will create the economic climate to help put  industry back to work.    Another thing: unless the problem of natural gas supplies  and  electricity is solved, industry cannot function, and the ties we  are trying to restore cannot operate. In addition, our  enterprises have been operating at 20-percent capacity until  now, but in the near future we will wish we had even that. We  hope that the tremendous efforts we have made along these lines  will yield results. Last December we concluded an agreement with  two major committees in Russia; one of them oversees the  machine-building sectors and eight ministries, while the other  oversees the military-industrial complex. We have signed an  intergovernmental agreement with the latter. Questions of  licensing, quota-setting, and customs duties between Georgia and  Russia have been completely settled in our sector.    Let no one think that the Ministry's leadership is sitting  idle and waiting to join the ruble zone.    I have met with officials of Russia's chemical and  metallurgical complexes, and documents have been prepared to  conclude the appropriate agreement.    This means we will be bringing in the raw materials,  components, and supplies our enterprises need; for some  enterprises these make up 90-95 percent, for others it is less.    If, in addition, we restore banking transactions, industry  will go to work.    [Saneblidze] But some specialists doubt that our industry  can  start operating, arguing that the plants' and factories'  equipment has been looted and cadres have departed.    [Kereselidze] That's partly true. Policies in recent years  have caused a certain alienation between the Ministry and, for  example, plants formerly under Soviet jurisdiction, which have  gone virtually uncontrolled. For this and other reasons, there  have been cases of unwise privatization, specialists have quit,  and equipment, sad to say, has been looted. I had occasion to  discuss that in an article in your newspaper. But I also want to  say that executives, engineering-technical personnel, and  workers are itching to go to work.    If we can systematize all this there is no danger of not  being able to revive our enterprises.    And industry will certainly go back to work.    [Saneblidze] When?    [Kereselidze] Tomorrow! Day after tomorrow!--but only if the  above conditions are met and, in addition, we get offers from  the privatized enterprises to work together, requests for the  Ministry to continue partnership with them. I am certain that  privatization will yield the desired results when the state  treats the privatized enterprises with the same consideration as  those still in the state sector, because ultimately every  enterprise has to work for the market, and closely with each  other as well. There are, for example, the Amirani, Kolkheti,  and Bakhtrioni factories and many others, making up a unified  link with a different form of ownership.    [Saneblidze] About bank credits and your Ministry: do you  need loans from the state?    [Kereselidze] Of course we do, but debts have to be paid  back. If an enterprise doesn't work, how can it get out of debt?  Georgia got 60 million dollars in credit from Turkey, and all  the Industry Ministry got was about 2.5 million, which is  definitely not in accord with the share our complex occupies in  the country's economy.    Another thing: Western credits ought to be spent boldly on  conversion, choosing options that are economically sound and  profitable, so we can invest to create a base producing consumer  goods, sell the products, and thus pay our debts. What's wrong  with that?    [Saneblidze] Problems keep mounting, and our readers need to  hear an encouraging word and some specifics.    [Kereselidze] Let me assure your paper's readers and the  public that the Industry Ministry and its whole complex have the  ability to accomplish the tasks they face.    A program has been worked out for 1994, with all the  enterprises participating, and plans have been mapped. Our  prognosis calls for a twofold (or more) increase in production  output; our Ministry has approved its privatization program; we  have worked out an investment program for the Ministry's  enterprises and published it in English to attract foreign  capital to Georgian industry. We are working intensively to  attract foreign partners, and Australian, German, and American  specialists are working on specific tasks in this effort. It  involves, for example, the Mining-Enrichment Combine, the  Rustavi Chemical Fiber Plant, the Gori Cotton Mill, and others.    All of these programs will go into action and will, of  course, produce results. But until then we have to accomplish  the prime tasks mentioned above.    I think everything is going to go the way the Georgian  government's strategic plan calls for, and we must not try to do  everything at once, nor yet too little either.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   Debts, debts! Nearly everybody in the country is in  debt to Sakgazi [the Gas Department], to the tune of a trillion  coupons.    For this reason, Sakgazi can't pay a kopek to the  countries over whose territories the gas we get from  Turkmenistan flows; it can't pay the transit fee.    Where are we going to get the 40 million dollars it  will take?    A piece of late news: Last Saturday, Sakgazi official  Davit Eliashvili came back from Turkmenistan and said, We're  beaten.    Because we are so far behind, on 1 February  Turkmenistan would no longer supply us with gas and.... But  let's not say what would have happened then, because our guys  wheedled them into postponing it until 1 April.    And that day will come. Last year's 200 million dollars  will have this year's amount added to it (already 25 million in  January). Hence, industry has to go to work, there's no other  way.    The great physicist Albert Einstein once said, What  mankind needs most now is a chair to sit down on and think.    Well, because of "meteorological conditions" we've had  to sit for two days in the Donetsk Airport's waiting room. We've  said what's on our mind. The three participants in our triptych  have had their say and left us with their thoughts.    To all this let me add one thing. From 1945 to 1950  Japan took vigorous measures to dismantle its centralized  economy and convert to the market economy. This big turnaround  took place in two stages.    In the first stage they gave priority to administrative  measures of regulation, affecting price formation, finances,  credit, allocation of resources, and wages and salaries. Along  with filling the markets they carried out stern measures to  restore financial health and curb inflation.    In the second stage they created the conditions  necessary to develop competition, get rid of price controls,  liquidate subsidies and budget deficits, and introduce a single  exchange rate for the yen. And what they ended up with was  today's remarkable Japanese economy.    Many people in our country reject this kind of phased  development--after all, we are tougher, we'll just get to work  and get around any economic obstacle.    But before we start boasting like hillbillies, let's  sit down on that chair and think.    The Donetsk Airport is as quiet as Georgia's economy. The  white airplane is shrouded motionless in the fog and time stands  still.    A crow is perched incongruously among the skittishly  arranged  lines of the garden's black branches and reacts to nothing.    The crow is 299 years old.    "You're not afraid of anything, are you?" (Galaktion Tabidze  [a poet]).</p>

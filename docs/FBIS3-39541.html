Both have launched "a cordial appeal to all registered  socialists and sympathizers to unite their forces in view of the  upcoming elections." In their opinion, "the tragic possibility  exists that no socialist on the socialist lists will be elected  to parliament. This happened previously only during the fascist  era." They added: "We have made errors. However, no  humiliation inflicted by the tabloid press can wipe out the  results of history."</p>

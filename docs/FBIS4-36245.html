			<p>BFN     [Text] Five Palestinians were wounded last night in Rafah  by Israeli soldiers, who launched a search inside the autonomous  area. A Qol Yisra'el reporter says the soldiers thought they  were under fire, but the shooting was in fact from a Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] group that was firing in the air  to celebrate the release of one of their members from the  Qezi'ot prison. The Palestinian police are investigating the  incident.    In Jericho, a Palestinian resident was lightly wounded  yesterday when Palestinian police opened fire. The victim  reportedly drove through a police roadblock without stopping.    In Gaza, the Palestinian police arrested four members of the  Fatah Hawks for shooting and wounding six residents of the  Tuffah neighborhood, one of them seriously and two others  moderately. The Qol Yisra'el reporter says the Fatah Hawks  tried to arrest a car thief, claiming they were from the  Palestinian security service. The driver put up a fight and a  shooting broke out. The four Hawks were arrested and their guns  were confiscated.    In another incident, the Palestinian police demolished a  house in the Rimal area that had been built illegally on public  land.    An Israeli was lightly injured last night on the  Trans-Samaria Highway when his car was stoned near the Arab  village of Mashah.</p>

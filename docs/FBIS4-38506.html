			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 25, RIA -- The border between Russia and  Mongolia, stretching for 3,485 kilometres, has always been a  frontier of good-neighbourliness, none of the sides has ever  made territorial claims against each other.    This fundamental principle is now enshrined in a treaty of  friendship and cooperation between Russia and Mongolia signed by  the presidents of the two countries in January 1993, Nikolay  Pavlov, chairman of a Russian delegation in the mixed  Russian-Mongolian border commission, said in an interview with  RIA.    Although historically there have always been good relations  on the Russian-Mongolian border, checks are currently being made  along it, Pavlov said.    This verification, which began in 1987, is aimed at giving a  more clear identification on the terrain of the border line,  repairing old and installing new border posts, and carrying out  a great deal of cartographical and other work.    To verify the border a mixed Russian-Mongolian commission  was  set up, consisting of a Russian and a Mongolian delegation.    The Russian delegation included representatives of the  Foreign Ministry, of the Defence Ministry, Border Troops, and  also of the governments of the Altay, Tuva and Buryat republics  and administration of the Chita region.    In spite of material and technical difficulties, noted  Pavlov, it is planned this year to complete all work connected  with the installation, repairs and painting of border posts and  fully to hand over the frontier to the frontier troops of the  sides.    The Mongolian side is also interested in the conclusion of  the verification.    The clear demarcation of the border and its inviolability  are  seen by it as a major factor for strengthening friendship and  cooperation betaeen the peoples of Russia and Mongolia, Pavlov  said in conclusion.</p>

Copies of the resolution will be mailed to six offices  concerned, including the U.S. ambassador to Japan, the  commander-in-chief of the U.S. Armed Forces in Japan, and the  coordinator of four branches of services of the U.S. Armed  Forces on Okinawa.    In the resolution, the town assembly protested the  accidental  dropping of rescue gears from a U.S. military helicopter,  declaring: "Accidents of dropping things by U.S. military  aircraft and helicopters are too many to count. Everytime such  accidents occurred, we strongly requested relevant organizations  of the U.S. Forces to do their utmost to prevent recurrence of  such accidents. From this incident ignoring residents' safety,  we have no choice but to conclude that the U.S. Forces are still  entertaining the occupation troop mentality, and are not serious  about enforcing strict discipline."    Concerning the crash accident involving FA-18 Hornet  fighters, the Chatan Assembly denounced the U.S. Forces,  stating: "Each time an incident or accident involving U.S.  military bases occurred, the town assembly filed complaints,  strongly calling for the U.S. Forces' efforts to prevent such  incidents or accidents from recurring. We regret that another  accident occurred in spite of this. We cannot accept any more  sacrifices and discriminations."</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOP THE WORLD! I WANT TO THINK!;  </P> <P> TV NEWS: IF THE '80S RETROSPECTIVES TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY, STAY TUNED -- FOR  THE MILENNIUM.  </P> <P> I looked up from my coffee and newspaper the other morning and noticed that  television's recap of the last decade was in full stride. There rolling across  the screen from the "Today" program were rapidly changing images from the 1980s  -- Nancy Reagan dressed in red as her husband takes the oath of office, smoke  spiraling from the Challenger, a homeless man dragging a torn blanket.  </P> <P>  Just as I started to think about the man with the torn blanket, his image was  supplanted by another -- Secret Service men crouching over someone on the  ground. Oh, yes, I recalled; that was when President Reagan was shot. In the  time it took me to have that thought, pictures from two other events flashed on  the screen without my registering what they were. This weekend, we will  continue to be inundated with quick-cut pastiches of events, not just from the  last year but from the entire decade -- Michael Dukakis riding in a tank, a  woman freebasing, a finger tracing a name engraved on the Vietnam Memorial --  and some eager beavers, in print as well as broadcast, are starting to recall  the millennium. Probably rapid retrospectives of the bi-millennium -- a Babe in  a manger, the rock from which Mohammad ascended to heaven -- are not far  behind.  </P> <P> To study history is a joy. That is why anyone who loves history must find  television's treatment of it jarring, to say the least. By their very nature,  telescoped images -- George Bush stroking a White House puppy, Israeli soldiers  firing tear gas at Palestinians -- foreclose reflection. They feed the eyes but  starve the mind. Over time, they tend to numb us and eventually alienate us  from the political process.  </P> <P> In their whirling speed and lack of context -- blood pouring from a black man's  head in South Africa, Geraldine Ferraro jubilantly raising her arms from the  podium of the 1984 Democratic Convention -- these quick-cut images reduce human  experience to spectacle. Spectacle discourages response. It can titillate, but  not teach. It can excite, but not empower.  </P> <P> Thomas Jefferson's thought about a free press was that citizens needed  information if they were to act on their own behalf. Today we are overwhelmed  by information, but in a form that tends to turn us into audiences rather than  participants.  </P> <P> It's not the technology that is at fault. Bill Moyers sits and talks with one  person about his or her ideas for as long as an hour at a time. Mr. Rogers  still speaks quietly and slowly to children about their interests and fears.  MacNeil and Lehrer dare to give us daily discussions of the news instead of  just videotaped capsules.  </P> <P> These examples, of course, come from public television. The tendency in  commerical television is to speed up. The idea is to snatch the attention of  the viewer who, remote control in hand, "grazes" through the competing  channels. Advertisers attempt to do this with vertigo-producing commercials  that flip through images in milliseconds. This reductionism applies to  news-related programming as well. A researcher at Harvard's Joan Shorenstein  Barone Center recently found that the average network "sound bite" from  presidential campaigns dropped from 42.3 seconds in 1968 to 9.8 seconds last  year. Even the few commercial interview programs such as "Nightline" and the  morning talk shows have a hurried, anxious tone as interviewers interrupt the  speakers to inform them that "we're out of time."  </P> <P> Television can give us so much, except the time to think.  </P> <P> It may be that the best way to comprehend the events of this extraordinary year  -- a solitary Chinese man standing in front of a tank, demonstrators dancing on  the Berlin Wall, American helicopters swooping in formation over a Panamanian  beach -- is to turn off the television set.  </P></p>

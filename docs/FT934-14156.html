			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Walesa names rural leader as PM POLAND'S President Lech Walesa yesterday asked Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the 34-year-old leader of the Polish Peasant party (PSL), to form the next government following the resignation of Ms Hanna Suchocka, the outgoing prime minister. The decision follows parliamentary elections on September 19, when the party won 15 per cent of the vote and the post-communist Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), its coalition partner, won 20 per cent. Together the two parties control 303 seats in the 460-member parliament. Mrs Suchocka's government will continue in a caretaker role until Mr Pawlak forms a cabinet and it is confirmed by parliament. Mr Pawlak is expected to complete negotiations with the Alliance on the make-up of the next cabinet and to present the results to parliament's next session on October 21. He will then seek parliamentary approval for his nomination. President Walesa has a constitutional right to oversee the posts of minister of interior, defence and foreign affairs and is thought to have won assurances in the weeks since the election that his candidates will be nominated in these ministries. These are thought to include Mr Andrzej Olechowski, a former finance minister as foreign minister, and Mr Andrzej Milczanowski, the incumbent as interior minister. For the rest, the PSL wants to have one of its members controlling one of the government's economic posts, which include finance, trade and industry, foreign trade or privatisation, leaving the SLD with the rest. Mr Walesa had expressed doubts about Mr Pawlak's ability to govern with what the president sees as an unbalanced and unstable parliament.</p>

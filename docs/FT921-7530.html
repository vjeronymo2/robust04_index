			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock taunts prime minister over recession - Economy THE ROLE of Mr John Major, the prime minister, in determining policy as the economy plunged into the longest recession in 60 years was firmly underlined by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, in the Commons yesterday. In another bout of fevered pre-election skirmishing he stressed that Mr Major had been chancellor before the recession started and prime minister throughout its course. Mr Kinnock told Mr Major: 'You are not only the prime minister of recession, but the prime cause of recession.' The prime minister urged Mr Kinnock not to go into 'overdrive', but to acknowledge that in the past three months industrial production fell faster in Germany, France, the US and Japan than in the UK. Mr Major emphasised that last year industrial production fell more in Japan and Germany than in the UK. Facing Mr Kinnock he demanded: 'Why do you think that is if you blame me for everything?' The Labour leader retorted: 'British people are not on the dole in Germany. They are on the dole in Britain.' Mr Kinnock urged the prime minister to stop groping around for excuses for his own failures and recognise that it was now official: 'Majorism is not working.' He said Mr Major had been 'convicted by his own record and condemned by his inac-tion in the face of the slump'. The prime minister said interest rates had been reduced on seven occasions and inflation halved. Insisting that the 'right circumstances for recovery' were in place, he said: 'The people of this country will not let Mr Kinnock throw that away.' The Labour leadership was in disarray over taxation policy, he continued, with proposals drawn up over five years being 'ditched' under Conservative probing in a period of five weeks. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, who had earlier ruled out a 'phoney shadow cabinet Budget' had now decided to produce one after all. Mr Major said Labour's proposal to abolish the ceiling on National Insurance contributions would affect more than 1m people, 750,000 of whom paid basic-rate tax. 'So much for the promise that no one earning under Pounds 20,000 a year would be hit,' he said. Mr John Cunningham, Labour's campaign manager, pressed for an assurance that the Budget debate to be opened by the chancellor on March 10 would run its normal four-day course and not be curtailed by the timetable for the general election. He emphasised that if, as expected, the election took place on April 9, the proclamation dissolving parliament would have to be made on March 16.</p>

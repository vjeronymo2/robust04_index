			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan, April 12 (SNARK)--Representatives of many  opposition parties have spoken in the Parliament condemning the  unlawful methods that were used during the "reservists' call-up  for three-month assembly".    The member of the Parliamentary Commission on Human Rights  Agasi Arshakyan reported that many meetings took place in  Armenia. The participants of those meetings adopted a  resolution condemning the unacceptable round-ups in public  places, violence and arbitrariness applied during the military  assembly.    The parents of those taken to the assembly quite often have  no idea about the further fate and location of their children,  declared the Head of the National Library of Armenia, Deputy  Rafayel Ishkhanyan. He noted that such methods, inadmissible  even during World War 2, were used only in Osmanian [Ottoman]  Empire.    Ishkhanyan warned that such actions of law enforcement  bodies  may have negative consequences -- decomposition of the Army,  demoralization of the young generation, cessation of  humanitarian aid, because of the violations of human rights in  Armenia.</p>

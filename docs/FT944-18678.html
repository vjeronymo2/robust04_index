			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Warning on cost of housing benefit The cost of housing benefit is out of control and growing at an alarming rate, a research paper published today by the Social Market Foundation argues, James Blitz writes. Amid signs that Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, is pressing for a crackdown on housing benefit in the public-spending round, the paper by Mr Greg Clark, a business economist from the Open University, says the programme is in urgent need of reform. Mr Clark argues that the system gives tenants no incentive to bargain with landlords over rent levels. He says the housing benefit programme has grown about 140 per cent since 1988 to Pounds 9bn per year, more than child benefit and unemployment benefit combined. He calls for the introduction of a direct cash allowance to claimants to encourage them to negotiate lower rents. Housing Benefit. Social Market Foundation, 20 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AA. Pounds 8.</p>

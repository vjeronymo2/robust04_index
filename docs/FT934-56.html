			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK advertising Those idyllic days when advertising agencies grew at 20 per cent a year and boasted 20 per cent profit margins now seem beyond the imagination of even the most creative copywriter. But it seems equally implausible that big chunks of the industry will continue to work for next to nothing. According to Touche Ross, 15 of the top 50 advertising agencies incurred pre-tax losses in 1992, with the average operating margin falling to 6.3 per cent. This year, investors have been quick to latch on to the sector's recovery appeal with forecasts suggesting that UK display advertising could grow by 8 per cent in 1994. Costs have been cut brutally. Theoretically, that should ensure profits rebound smartly when volumes recover. But advertising is another industry where it is difficult to disentangle short-term cyclical influences from longer-term structural forces. Specialist media buying agencies have permanently eroded buying commissions. Moreover, the fuss over brands following Philip Morris's move in cutting the price of its Marlboro line has concentrated advertisers' minds, leading many to cut promotional spend and concentrate on everyday low pricing instead. There seems little reason why UK agencies cannot match the margins attained by their US counterparts. Both Interpublic and Omnicom achieve operating margins double those of most UK agencies. But that does rashly presuppose that UK agencies can be just as soberly managed.</p>

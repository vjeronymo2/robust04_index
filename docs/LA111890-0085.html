			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRUISE VIEWS: NEW SHIP EXPLORES SEAS UNDER FLAG OF ECOLOGY  </P> <P> Ecotourism doesn't mean much to the handful of Micronesian villagers who stand  on the beach watching us arrive in rubber landing craft at their tiny island in  the central Pacific near the Equator.  </P> <P> We are about 90 travelers -- American, Japanese, German, Swiss, Australian,  Canadian, Brazilian and British -- temporarily disembarked from a ship being  billed as the world's "first environment-friendly expedition ship" and the  possible "model of non-polluting ships to come." We are on the inaugural voyage  of Salen Lindblad Cruising's brand-new Frontier Spirit, a 164-passenger vessel  that left Guam for Papua New Guinea on Nov. 8.  </P> <P> We learn we are carrying the aspects of civilization that interest the  Micronesians most -- cold Coca-Colas, filter-tipped cigarettes and an engineer  who can repair their broken generator so they can again watch videos on the VCR  attached to the community's one television set.  </P> <P> But they would probably be unimpressed, should they venture below deck, by our  ship's state-of-the-art systems for disposing of garbage without spoiling the  environment, because garbage is something these people don't have.  </P> <P> They use everything the sea or others bring to their shores. Remains of crashed  World War II Japanese fighter planes make shelters for dogs and chickens;  Japanese plastic fishing floats, cut in half, are handy as food dishes for  chickens and pigs; washed-up bottles store rainwater or make ornamental borders  around family graves, and pieces of plywood and corrugated metal are  incorporated into the walls of their thatch-roof houses.  </P> <P> Such is not the case with cruise ships, however, even luxurious expedition  vessels filled with passengers passionate about saving the environment.  </P> <P> Aboard the Frontier Spirit, however, a corner of consciousness has been turned.  Instead of bingo, we have lectures on identifying sea birds or how a coral reef  is formed. Instead of floor shows or dancing after dinner, we may watch  National Geographic videos about sharks or life on atolls.  </P> <P> And no future archeologist is likely to find any clues we passed by here on the  way south toward the delicate and threatened ecosystem of Antarctica.  </P> <P> Frontier Spirit was built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Kobe, Japan, the  first expedition ship to be created in 26 years. Reflecting the new attitude of  ecologically aware tourism, it carries one crew member who is solely  responsible for separating and processing shipboard garbage into  environmentally acceptable components.  </P> <P> In one machine, glass is smashed into tiny fragments that are sifted and  released into the sea, where they settle on the sand to be additionally  pulverized by nature. Paper is compressed into small packets and burned in the  incinerator.  </P> <P> Another machine shreds and grinds metal into easy-to-store fragments that are  held in a special compartment with compacted plastics to be returned to  disembarkation ports.  </P> <P> Food garbage is compacted into small bales, with all liquid removed, and what  can be burned is disposed of in the incinerator. The rest is stored in an  air-tight refrigerated compartment until it can be off-loaded at a port that  can handle such garbage.  </P> <P> There is an oil separator in the ship's bilge system that removes the waste  oil, which is then burned in the incinerator, while the water is returned to  the bilge. The ship uses only marine-diesel or gas-oil, cleaner fuels than the  heavy-duty bunker or sea oil that most ships use.  </P> <P> A fresh-water vacuum toilet system throughout the vessel requires less water to  operate, according to the cruise line, than usual shipboard systems. The waste  is transferred to a sewage treatment plant, where it is mixed with  hydrochloride before being discharged into the sea.  </P> <P> Aside from its waste-disposal features, the Frontier Spirit carries a higher  ice-class rating (an ability to cut through five feet of ice) than any other  expedition ship currently in service, according to veteran Capt. Heinz Aye. It  is also the largest expedition ship, according to Aye, who has made 59  Antarctic cruises and two transits of the Northwest Passage.  </P> <P> Passage on the Frontier Spirit costs about $320 a day per person, double  occupancy, plus air fare, for a standard double cabin. Deluxe cabins and suites  are about $490 per day and private verandas about $420 per day.  </P> <P> A glass-windowed, forward, observation lounge and library serves as a  before-dinner meeting place for commentary from our resident naturalists about  the day's events.  </P> <P> There's a swimming pool, sunbathing decks, a gym, sauna, beauty shop and a free  self-service Laundromat with a drying room.  </P> <P> All cabins contain twin or queen-sized beds, sitting areas, view windows, hair  dryers, mini-refrigerators, tiled baths with showers, color TV with remote  control and a generous storage area. Stewardesses and dining-room waiters are  European, and the menu is continental from Austrian executive chef Franz  Sledak, former chef aboard Cunard's Sagafjord and QE2.  </P> <P> Upcoming itineraries include a 27-day Antarctica sailing beginning Jan. 31 to  Ross Ice Shelf and McMurdo Sound; a 17-day voyage around Australia's Great  Barrier Reef starting April 2, and an 18-day Papua New Guinea itinerary April  14. The three-day Alaska/Northwest Passage sailing is scheduled Aug. 18.  </P> <P> For free brochures, contact Salen Lindblad Cruising, 333 Ludlow St., P.O.

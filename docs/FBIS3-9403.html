			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Prague today, Belgian Vice Prime Minister and  Foreign Minister Willy Claes, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus,  and Foreign Minister Jozef Zieleniec discussed relations between  the Czech Republic and the Kingdom of Belgium. Mutual  multilateral relations in connection with the Czech Republic's  effort aimed at joining the European Union were also discussed.  Klara Stejskalova reports:    [Stejskalova] All of the representatives jointly praised the  good and intensive relations between the two countries, evidence  of which is the unusual interest of Belgian entrepreneurs in our  country, Josef Zieleniec said. Over the past year alone, the  Belgians have invested more than $150 million in our country.  Thus, they rank fourth among foreign investors.    Regarding Czech membership in the European Union, Claes  expressed complete support for the Czech Republic. At the same  time, he praised the democratization of politics in our country  and the path toward a very strong economy that we have embarked  upon. In conclusion, he said that those West Europeans who  think they live on an isolated island are naive. He said that  support for the process of integration is in the interest of the  European Union. Integration should take place gradually and not  in blocks. It should be based solely on the fulfillment of the  necessary conditions by individual countries. It cannot be  expected, however, that European Union enlargement could take  place before the intergovernmental conference of the European  Union states, scheduled to take place in 1996.</p>

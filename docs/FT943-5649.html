			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Speculation on NBC TV bid persists Speculation about a possible takeover of the NBC television network continued yesterday after a senior NBC executive stopped short of issuing an outright denial of reports that General Electric, NBC's parent group, has been considering selling all or part of the network to Time Warner. Mr Robert Wright, president of NBC, would only say that a report that NBC and Time Warner had been negociating a sale of the network for eollars 2.5bn was not accurate. A spokesman for Time Warner, meanwhile, said that the group would not comment on the story. Mr Wright's comments failed to dampen takeover speculation on Wall Street, which has been buzzing with rumours about upheavel in the US network television market. The latest talk of a NBC takeover was accompanied by reports that Walt Disney has been negociating to buy the CBS network, which earlier this year failed to merge with the QVC television home-shopping company. The takeover rumours lifted GE and CBS's share prices yesterday, even though most leading stocks on Wall Street were lower. GE climbed Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 50 1/4 and CBS rose Dollars s 6 5/8 to Dollars 328, while Time Warner fell 6. 1/8 to 37 7/8 and Disney fell Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 41. This is not the first time GE is reported to have been discussing selling NBC, which it bought in 1986 as part of the Dollars 63bn acquisition of RCA Corporation. On previous occasions, Mr Jack Welch, GE president, had insisted the network was not for sale, most recently last November. Yesterday, there was no comment from Mr Welch. Although Mr Welch has said he wanted NBC to remain part of GE, the diversified industrial group is believed to be unhappy with the network's recent performance. NBC's revenues last year were down from 1993 levels, it has had the lowest ratings of the big three networks for the past three years and has suffered a string of recent mishaps, including a staged accident in a television news report on General Motors pick-up trucks. If Time Warner is interested in buying NBC, it is understandable, given that the entertainment group is eager to develop its television interests and is preparing to launch its own broadcast network Any deal between GE and Time Warner over NBC would run into regulatory problems. Certain limits are placed on cross-ownership of broadcast and cable TV interests and Time Warner has extensive cable TV operations.</p>

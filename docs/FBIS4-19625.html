			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Richard Savill report: "1,000 Police Raid IRA Paymasters"] </F>   [Text] Police in England and on both sides of the Irish  border raided more than 40 addresses yesterday in a huge  operation against IRA fund-raising. They seized computers,  documents and large quantities of drugs.    Up to 1,000 officers from six police forces, co-ordinated by  the Royal Ulster Constabulary's [RUC] specialist C13  anti-racketeering squad, took part in the operation. It came  after 12 months of "intensive investigations" into the  terrorists' financial activities.    Operation "Madronna", designed to halt the 6 million pounds  a  year that flows to the IRA to purchase its arms and explosives,  was unprecedented in its scale and scope.    In simultaneous dawn raids, heavily armed units searched 41  premises -- eight in the north-west of England, 14 in London and  Surrey, eight in Northern Ireland and 11 in the Irish Republic.    The RUC said that eight people were arrested and officers  seized a "substantial" quantity of drugs, stolen property and  money.    Four people were detained in the south-east of England,  including one held after raids on addresses in Woking, Surrey,  and four in the Republic but none in Northern Ireland.    Computers and a large amount of documents, some of which are  believed to relate to building society and bank accounts, were  also seized.    Irish police said they could not confirm a report that a key  IRA financier who headed the wanted list had evaded capture.    In the Republic, addresses were raided in Dundalk and  Dublin.  One security source said: "We are trying to tie the purse  strings of IRA active service units in Britain."    In Belfast, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland  Secretary, welcomed the operation. "The funds for terrorist  organisations are important. If you get hold of their funds  then you prevent them from doing the worst things they wish to  do."    Mr Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist MP for East  Belfast, said: "The use of apparently legitimate businesses as a  front for funding terrorism has been a long standing problem and  people in Northern Ireland will be eager to determine the scale  of this operation and the consequences to the bankrolling of the  IRA."</p>

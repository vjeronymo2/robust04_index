			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Books: Middle-class, middle-aged anecdotes - Fiction TWELVE RED HERRINGS by Jeffrey Archer HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 324 pages Once upon a time, a London newspaper called the Evening News used to run a daily short story. They were very short indeed but they offered well-turned entertainments designed to divert the home-bound commuter for ten minutes or so; the contributors included respectable and well-known popular authors who knew they were not competing with Chekhov or Maupassant. You cannot - unless you are a genius - do very much in a couple of thousand words: you can provide a smile or a sigh; you can amuse or distract; this is all too often the art of the anecdote. Jeffrey Archer, when he pauses from his best-selling novels to don the hat of the short story writer, is very much in this tradition: he tells anecdotes. Middle-class and middle-aged. On the jacket of his latest collection, Twelve Red Herrings, a comparison is made with Somerset Maugham. This is a gross libel on a long-dead artist, the hem of whose garment the noble lord is unworthy to touch. But let us lean over to be fair. Archer takes a lot of critical stick for his books but constantly tops best-seller lists. On the strength of these dozen tales, what are his qualities? Without a doubt, he has the mysterious gift of persuading you to keep turning the pages even while you protest that life is too short. He has no gift for, and no apparent interest in, description, even when he sets his scene in Greece; his vocabulary is minimal; his dialogue is an undifferentiated middle-English; his prose is as flat as the fens that adjoin his fragrant household. But I confess that I read every page of Twelve Red Herrings. I regret it, of course. I should have been warned by the author's own admission that nine of these 12 stories 'are based on known incidents . . .', which is rather odd, implying that the wells of the imagination have been running low. Thus, we have an old Bond Street anecdote of husband and lover unwittingly sharing the million-pound cost of a bauble for a beautiful woman, another of an Iraqi exile appalled to find himself on a flight diverted to Baghdad, another of an author listening in horror as a friend rehearses to him a draft plot of a book he himself has just finished, and yet another - yes, anecdote is the word - of an Aids victim who tries to con the insurance company by sending his lover to take his medical. Very occasionally there is a flash of wit - 'like a chain-smoker, the former Colombian model was already searching for her next spouse before she had extracted the last gasp from the old one'. There is a well-timed twist in the brisk story of a woman terrorised on a motorway. Cliche abounds: the life insurance salesman licks his lips; the pickpocket jailbird is called 'Fingers', the bank manager is absurdly provincial. Sometimes the plot is worrying: cannot doctors tell if you are faking blindness? How likely is a murder trial without a body? Now and again there is a mistake - the FT has never had a 'City Editor'. And the final episode is a slight and old-fashioned parlour game in which a brief story is given four alternative endings. Not, I suggest, a book to sustain a vacation, or even a flight. But it might do for the departure lounge. I now see why the chairmanship of the Party once beckoned.</p>

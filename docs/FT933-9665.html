			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Belarus seeks currency union with Russia BELARUS, having seen its surrogate currency tumble after the Russian central bank's withdrawal of pre-1993 banknotes, is now trying to tie its economic survival to a new currency union with Russia. The value of coupons issued last year in Belarus to make up for a shortage of rouble banknotes from Russia has fallen 25 per cent in the past two weeks. While roubles traded in Moscow have remained at about Rbs1,000 to the dollar, the coupon, called the hare because of the animal shown on the makeshift banknote, was fetching the equivalent of Rbs1,550 to Dollars 1 on Friday. The weakening of the hare also means that Belarus has to pay more for Russian goods and effectively earns less from its exports to Russia - a body-blow in that most Belarus trade is with its giant neighbour. The exchange rate between the Russian rouble and the Belarus rouble had risen from 1:1.8 on July 24 to 1:2.6 on Friday. Unlike other former Soviet republics enraged by the Russian central bank's withdrawal of notes, the Belarusian government, always respectful towards Moscow in public, appears to accept the central bank move. The reformist chairman of the Belarus parliament, Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, who is also head of state, insisted in an interview that the step had done 'no great damage'. Instead of introducing its own fully fledged currency, as some republics, such as Turkmenistan, plan to do, Belarus would keep the rouble on conditions to be agreed with Moscow, he said. Similar undertakings were made at the weekend by Kazakhstan, the second largest former Soviet republic, and Uzbekistan, the most populous of the Central Asian republics. Central Asian leaders, meeting Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow at the weekend, called for a meeting on September 7 of all republics keen to build an economic union. Russia has long demanded that republics abandon the rouble as their currency or subscribe to common budgetary, financial and monetary policies dictated by Moscow. The central bank move appears to have helped speed their decision. 'We are ready to establish common credit and bank policies, a common tax policy and to set aside all Customs duties,' Mr Shushkevich said. A small country of 10.7m people, which made up just 4 per cent of GDP of the former Soviet Union in 1992, Belarus has staked much political capital on rebuilding economic ties with the rest of the ex-Soviet Union. Staying in a newly recreated rouble zone, government officials hope, might stem the drop in inter-republican trade, down by 40 per cent since 1991. About 70 per cent of imports, including 90 per cent of energy supplies, come from Russia. 'If our relations remained the same as before, the economy would be better,' said Mr Vladimir Khilko, chairman of the Belarus Savings Bank. To that end, even before the central bank move, Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the prime minister and a conservative, last month agreed to work on an economic union with Russia and Ukraine, due to be signed next month. Mr Kebich and Mr Shushkevich, political opponents, see eye-to-eye on economic union - though Mr Shushkevich, against a majority in parliament, opposes a collective security agreement with Russia.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Bush will need something to show for China deal / Review of US relations with Peking as MFN trade status decision looms WHEN US official Robert Kimmitt meets trade officials in Peking this week, he is likely to tell them that his president will find it difficult to renew China's most favoured nation (MFN) status next month without something to show for it. After all, US trade representative Carla Hills has just named China, along with India and Thailand, a 'Special 301 country', whose trade policy is 'egregious' and harmful to US business. That is not very encouraging to Peking when the trade balance between the two countries is nearing Dollars 10bn in China's favour. Nor when human rights voices are still berating President George Bush for renewing China's MFN status last year when the sound of gunfire in Tiananmen Square had not long died down. MFN status, which accords certain countries America's best trading conditions, has been the cornerstone of US-China trade relations for the last 10 years. As June 3, the date President Bush must make a decision, draws nearer, Peking has been at pains to emphasise what it sees as the serious consequences to relations that would result if MFN privileges are withdrawn. Premier Li Peng has warned of losses not only to China but to US companies seeking to do business there. China's foreign minister Qian Qichen said a decision to rescind MFN status would benefit neither side and deal a bigger blow to Hong Kong, which re-exports a lot of Chinese-manufactured goods. China saves hundreds of millions of dollars a year by paying the lowest tariffs on goods it exports to the US. The loss of MFN status would be a blow it can ill afford as the mainland recovers from the austerity measures implemented at the end of 1988. The US is China's largest market, buying more than 25 per cent of China's exports. Under the terms of 'Special 301', a provision of US trade law that permits the US administration to retaliate against named countries considered to be particularly unfair in their trade practices, Mrs Hills said China and India had failed to make any concessions during the past two years in negotiations over US demands for protection of patents, copyrights, trademarks and software. Mrs Hills complained that China practised piracy 'across the board'. It is the only major US trading partner that does not offer product protection for pharmaceutical and chemicals, adequate copyright or trade protection, nor safeguards for trade secrets. Failure to improve intellectual property protection could evoke US sanctions after six to nine months. The trade representative's office devoted 10 pages in the 1991 trade estimates report to Chinese deficiencies. These include a complex import licensing system, import bans on 80 products and materials, stringent and excessive quality standards on foreign goods, and barriers to services and investment. There is further concern in Washington over China's alleged nuclear technology transfers to countries such as Pakistan and Algeria - and this surfaced last night when President Bush refused to approved export of US satellite parts to China. The parts had been requested for a Chinese domestic communications satellite, the Dong Fang Hong 3. Peking has, however, strenuously rejected reports from Washington about nuclear technology sales to Algeria. Yesterday Algeria offered to submit its nuclear programme to international inspection. Meanwhile, Peking disputes the figures that show it has a soaring surplus in its trade with the US, claiming it is nothing like as large as Dollars 10bn. Premier Li is reported to have said he was ready to look at statistical methodology with the Americans and put the Chinese view of the figures. China leaves out of its statistics of exports to the US all products produced by US joint venture companies in China, and all goods re-exported through Hong Kong. This year more human rights concerns have surfaced in the US over allegations that China exports goods made by prisoners, a charge it repeatedly denies. The import of prison-made goods is banned in the US. China's growing anxiety about MFN may explain why it appears to have abandoned its longstanding position that human rights is a domestic issue by inviting Australia to send a team of experts to study human rights in the country. The likelihood is that the decision is related to trading concerns and its expectation that they may continue if China cannot improve its image.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar sinks on payroll figure THE DOLLAR dropped more than 4 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday within an hour of the US publishing extremely poor employment figures, writes James Blitz. Both the dollar and the pound had enjoyed a spate of strong speculative European buying in the morning after the UK government's decision to borrow Ecu 10bn with which to buy sterling on the foreign exchanges. Many dealers liquidated long D-Mark positions, pushing the dollar to a high of DM1.4385 while sterling rose to DM2.8217. The release of the August non-farm payroll figure reversed the upward trend at 13:30 London time. Dealers had been expecting a monthly rise of 150,000, but there was a fall of 83,000. The US government's summer jobs programme added 100,000 to the employment total, meaning that the underlying fall in employment was 183,000. The dollar plunged, bottoming out at DM1.3940 and closing in London at DM1.4030, nearly a pfennig down on the day. Sterling fell to a low of DM2.7950, but rebounded a little, closing unchanged on the day at DM2.8000. Yesterday's events give dealers every reason to think that the dollar could dip to a new low against the D-Mark. The payroll figure will put pressure on the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates further and dealers noted that the Fed Funds rate, which the US central bank regards as a key indicator for interest rate policy, fell by 0.25 per cent yesterday to 3 per cent. Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London, said the same August payroll figure last year set the dollar on a downward trend over the following four months. The dollar's fall also indicated that, whatever policies the Banks of England and Italy may adopt to defend their currencies, they are partly at the mercy of the dollar/D-Mark cross. The UK government's Ecu borrowing plan may stabilise sterling until the French referendum is over. But Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corp in London, warned that sterling's recent recovery appeared to be on the back of speculative selling, and there was little sign of big flows back into the UK currency from investment funds. Several dealers speculated on the possibility of a lira devaluation before the French referendum, after the Bank of Italy raised its discount rate yesterday by 1.75 percentage points to no avail. The lira closed at L765.0 against the D-Mark despite intervention from several European central banks. The stock phrase on dealers' lips yesterday was that a devalued lira could become the 'sacrificial lamb' by which the rest of the EMS signal their determination not to realign.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Sharp fall in Kenyan currency THE VALUE of the Kenyan shilling fell sharply yesterday when a government decision to let it float for the first time took effect, Reuter reports from Nairobi. Commercial banks quoted the currency at 57.85 to the US dollar, compared with an official rate of 36.24 last Friday before the flotation. The new rate was a devaluation of 59.6 per cent on last Friday's official rate. The shilling was marked down by similar amounts against sterling, the German mark and other major currencies. The flotation allowed businessmen to buy foreign exchange for imports from commercial banks instead of the Central Bank, ending a system under which the Central Bank allocated import licences and currency to pay for goods.</p>

During the second week of March  there was a secret meeting at the headquarters of the Joint  Staff that was headed by Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf with  the participation of the intelligence chiefs of the Armed  Forces. The social situation was evaluated during the meeting.    General Mario Diaz and Hugo Anzorregui, the chief of  Argentine spies, also participated in the meeting.    Secretary General of the Presidency Eduardo Bauza met in his  office on 7 March with Ruckauf and Defense Minister Oscar  Camilion. During the meeting, Bauza expressed the president's  wish for the military to cooperate in the vigilance of the  country's social aspects following what is known, after the  events in Santiago del Estero Province and in Mexico, as the  Chiapas effect.    A high ranking Defense Ministry source confirmed to LA  NACION  that the meetings did take place, although he made it clear that  they were not official meetings in which the Armed Forces were  asked to step in and help in a matter that is banned for them.  He said that the only subject discussed was "an evaluation of  the social sector in case the cooperation of the intelligence  forces becomes necessary. The military provide effective  logistic support. The military did not report, they listened,"  the official stressed.    During the meeting at the headquarters of the Joint Staff,  for example, an evaluation was made of the type of shield and  tear gas that the Federal Police used during the 100th march of  the pensioners in Plaza de Mayo.    The first effective blow this year by Menem occurred when he  called an urgent meeting of the military chiefs at the Olivos  Residence. The meeting was held on 12 January when the effect  of Chiapas was still being felt.    The four chiefs of the Armed Forces and Ministers Camilion,  Ruckauf, and Guido Di Tella participated in that meeting.    Two days later it was learned that the government had set  aside 40 million pesos for the purchase of war materiel for the  police of the provinces and for the Border Guard.    On 17 January, Ruckauf announced the creation of a rapid  deployment force in response to the dangers of a social uprising.    Radical Deputy Antonio Berhongaray on 18 March requested  that  Camilion and Ruckauf be summoned before the body for questioning  "regarding the orders that the executive branch has given the  military intelligence organizations regarding their tasks."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yuan Mu (5913 2606), director of State Council Research </F> Office: "Run Commercial Banks Actively, Prudently, and Well"]    [Text] The "Decision" passed by the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee has systematically specified  the targets and principles of the socialist market economic  structure laid down by the 14th Party Congress and delineated  the basic framework of China's new economic structure. As the  banking structural reform occupies an important position in the  overall economic restructuring, a plan for conducting the reform  has also been worked out. While continuously running the  existing commercial banks well, we should quicken the pace of  reforming specialized banks so that our banking system can adapt  itself more satisfactorily to the needs of socialist market  economic development and promote the sustained, rapid, and  healthy [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang] development of the national  economy.  <H3>  I. Running Commercial Banks Well Is an Important Component  Part of Deepening the Banking Structural Reform </H3>   Since the reform and opening up, with the accelerated  development of China's socialist market economy, the position of  the financial industry centering on the banks in the national  economy as a whole is increasingly important. At present, the  savings deposits of urban and rural residents, well over 1,400  billion yuan in total, and the deposits of enterprises,  amounting to over 600 billion yuan, are concentrated in the  banks. Thus, the banks have become the most important suppliers  of funds for social production and construction. Between 1980  and 1993, the banks granted about 2,000 billion yuan in new  credits to all sectors of the national economy. Bank credit  relations have penetrated all spheres and departments of social  and economic life and have become an important hub of national  economic operations. As the focus of state macroeconomic  management is shifting from direct to indirect regulation and  control; banking, as a principal means of regulating and  controlling the economy, is playing an increasingly important  role in the national economy.    China's specialized banks occupy a dominant position in the  banking industry as a whole. The four major specialized banks  have amassed 90 percent of credit funds in the entire banking  system and undertaken over 75 percent of society's  deposit-taking and credit-granting business. Their branches and  offices cover almost every corner of town and country.  Moreover, they are incomparably superior to other banks and  financial institutions in terms of social prestige and staff  size.    Over the past few years, specialized banks have worked hard  to change their internal operation mechanisms and scored certain  achievements. Taken as a whole, however, they still preserve  many vestiges of the planned economic structure and, therefore,  cannot suit the needs of socialist market economic development.  Their principal problems are as follows: First, specialized  banks still undertake a lot of administrative and management  work. Not only do they manage the circulating funds of  state-owned enterprises and the cash of account holders and  supervise their wage funds, which come under the state  administrative planned management, but they also undertake some  macroeconomic regulation and control tasks which belong to the  functions of the central bank. Second, specialized banks  practice a horizontal system of "three-level management and  one-level operation" among themselves. This has resulted in the  practice of "everybody eating from the same big pot" in fund  distribution, making it difficult to call loans in the same  trade or arrange indirect financing in different localities.  Third, as their institutions are set up according to  administrative division, specialized banks have a thousand and  one links with local authorities in terms of personnel  management and many other issues. For this reason, it is  difficult to eradicate local interference and their financial  conduct is tinted with local and administrative color.    These problems have seriously affected the rational flow of  funds and the optimum allocation of social resources, making it  hard for finance to give full play to its role in exercising  macroeconomic regulation and control over the national economy.  Therefore, an important task in the current financial  restructuring is to: Implement the principle of separating  policy-related finance from commercial finance; take positive  and prudent steps to quicken the pace of reforming specialized  banks; establish a set of organizational structures, operational  mechanisms, and internal management systems compatible with the  modern market economy; gradually turn specialized banks into  commercial banks; and to give better play to their pivotal and  regulatory role in the national economy.    We should also note that restoring our status as a signatory  to the GATT offers both opportunity and challenge to our banking  industry. On the one hand, we shall conditionally and  selectively allow more foreign banks and financial institutions  into our market and accord them national treatment. This will  inevitably cause our specialized banks to face many strong  competitors. To go on developing amid equal competition,  specialized banks must step up reform to increase vitality and  raise competitiveness. On the other hand, our banking industry  should also seize this historic opportunity to advance with big  strides toward the international financial market, expand our  position in the international market where there are strong  competitors, and create conditions for our industrial and  commercial enterprises to participate in international  competition. To attain this, specialized banks must change  their mechanisms and speedily bring themselves into line with  international practice and rules.  <H3>  II. International Practice and Experience in Running  Commercial Banks </H3>   Commercial banks have been in existence for over 400 years  in  the West since the first one in the world came into being in  Venice in 1580. The experience of developed countries and  regions in running modern commercial banks can be summed up as  follows: Focus on raising the banks' competitiveness, implement  the policy of simultaneously relaxing controls and tightening  supervision and, by constantly changing and adjusting methods,  strive to resolve the contradiction between the two, keep a  balance between competition and safety in the banking industry,  and ensure the stable operations of the banking system. Their  specific practices are chiefly as follows:    First, all governments exercise tighter supervision over  banks to ensure the stability of the banking industry. As  deposit-taking is the principal source of their funds, the banks  have extensive interest relationships with all sectors of the  national economy and the public at large. Once something goes  wrong with bank credits, this will not only directly harm public  interests but will also seriously affect the normal national  economic operations and even touch off economic crises and  social unrest. Many countries have profound lessons in this  respect. Therefore, while creating conditions for bank  development and offering them services, all governments focus on  safe bank operations in their supervision.    Second, keep on amplifying and perfecting banking laws and  regulations, strengthen law-enforcement institutions, and manage  commercial banks according to the laws. For example, after  putting forward in the early 1970's the objective of turning  Hong Kong into an international financial center, the Hong Kong  region amended and perfected banking laws and regulations almost  annually and overhauled them in 1986 to make them better  organized and scientific. They are compatible not only with  international practice and standards but also with Hong Kong's  reality. The main contents are clearly defined quantitatively.  A banking commissioner and a banking commissioner's office have  also been set up in Hong Kong especially to look after the  implementation of the banking regulations and strictly supervise  local and overseas commercial banks. Those violating the  regulations will be dealt with. Moreover, a self-disciplinary  organization, the Hong Kong Association of Banks, has also been  set up to assist in supervision.    Third, all central banks step up cooperation and the  international supervisory work has gradually caught up with the  situation. In light of the many problems coming to light in  financial liberalization of the international banking industry  in the 1980's, the Bank for International Settlements convened a  meeting of the central bank governors from 12 Western countries  in 1987, where they signed the "Basel Agreement," i.e. the  "Proposals on Unifying Capital Measurement and Criteria for  International Banks." According to this agreement, the ratio  between capital and risk assets of the commercial banks in all  member countries must not be less than 12.5:1 in 1992. In terms  of quality and quantity, this tightens international supervision  over the banking business, reduces the risks and crises of the  banking industry in international competition, and jointly  promotes the competitiveness and safety of the international  banking system.    Fourth, as the international market matures, Western  countries have gradually relaxed controls over the banking  industry. Since the 1970's, due to their failure to fully adapt  themselves to the demands of economic diversification and  internationalization, commercial banks have been placed in an  unfavorable position in competing with other rapidly developing  nonbanking financial institutions. For this reason, some  countries have gradually expanded the scope of bank operations  and relaxed controls over the interest rates and exchange rates  to increase the service functions of commercial banks and raise  their competitiveness.    Bank credit crises and even bankruptcies are also frequent  in  some countries and regions. The lesson to be drawn here is that  these countries and regions do not have standardized management  over commercial banks. They often fail to separate the  functions of the government from those of enterprises, have a  strong monopoly character, reject competition, and have poor  economic returns. Moreover, the lack of perfected financial  rules and regulations and the failure to exercise supervision  according to the law also lead to the poor quality of bank  assets, the high risk of capital operations, and the strong  speculative flavor.    Therefore, in the course of running commercial banks well we  should, in light of the practical conditions in our country,  take as reference the useful experience of other countries and  draw lessons from their failure to avoid detours and reduce  errors.  <H3>  III. Enlightenments From the Development of the Existing  Commercial Banks </H3>   The existing commercial banks in China are the outcome of  reform. Since the reestablishment of the Bank of Communications  in the mid-1980's, there have been nine commercial banks across  the country. From a long-term point of view, and the  requirements of the socialist market economic development, such  commercial banks will probably develop considerably in the  future. By dint of their vigor and vitality, the existing  commercial banks have been active in the economic field. To  date, with total assets of 200 billion yuan, the nine commercial  banks are gradually becoming an important force in our banking  system. Through development and practice they have made a  useful attempt to run the socialist commercial banks well and  have provided experiences and enlightenment.    First, commercial banks should have well-defined property  rights and separate the functions of the government from those  of enterprises. Commercial banks can be turned into state  fully-owned banks or joint-stock banks in which the state holds  a controlling share and other economic sectors are shareholders.  Viewed from the present conditions, the adoption of a  standardized joint-stock system will enable commercial banks to  pool resources through numerous channels and raise the level of  bank socialization; enable the banks to establish an economic  benefit relationship, sharing both risks and benefits with local  governments and enterprises and strengthen the society's  supervision over the banks; and enable the separation of  ownership from right of operation.    Second, establish an operation principle based on  efficiency.  As commercial banks do not have the "big pot" from which they  can eat state funds, they must try to raise the use efficiency  of funds. They should take risks and efficiency into account  when granting credits, consider costs when setting up additional  institutions, and try by every possible means to reap steadily  growing profits by increasing income and reducing expenses.  Generally speaking, because the existing commercial banks have  initially established a system for managing assets, liabilities,  and risks, the turnover of credits and funds is faster and the  rate of recovering due debts is higher.    Third, introduce a competition mechanism to improve the  overall quality of the banking industry. In order to survive  and develop, commercial banks should rely on "first-rate service  quality, first-rate work efficiency, and first-rate bank  reputation." Only in this way can they hold their ground in the  fiercely competitive market. However, this also puts pressure on  commercial banks, urging them to improve their operational style  and work efficiency and provide good-quality services to  customers. Although commercial banks still account for a very  small proportion of the overall banking industry, they have  played a distinct role in improving the overall quality of the  banking industry and boosting financial reform.    Fourth, establish a scientific organizational structure and  management system for enterprises. In the course of  development, commercial banks should fully utilize their  decisionmaking power in operations, boldly reform the personnel,  labor, and distribution systems, and establish relatively  complete reward and incentive mechanisms to arouse the  enthusiasm of workers and staff members.    Naturally, it should be pointed out that as commercial banks  have been developing for only a short time in China, some  problems still exist. Chief among them is the lack of perfected  rules and regulations to standardize the conduct of commercial  banks. In managing commercial banks, the departments concerned  have been too rigid in some respects but too lax in others and  the internal management system is neither standardized nor well  organized. Due to various factors, such as the over-expansion  of institutions and business and the poor quality of workers and  staff members, there are also problems with some banks. The  awareness of commercial banks to discipline themselves is not  high enough and neither is the supervision within the same trade  strict enough. These problems should be seriously studied and  gradually solved. Otherwise, they will hamper commercial banks  from further healthy development.  <H3>  IV. Some Problems To Be Resolved in Turning Specialized  Banks Into State-Owned Commercial Banks </H3>   The establishment of state-owned commercial banks is a  gigantic systems engineering project under which a slight move  in one part can affect the situation as a whole. Not only  should specialized banks change their internal operation  mechanisms but they should also straighten out their  relationships with the central bank, governments at all levels,  and enterprises. For this reason, the reform cannot be  accomplished in one go. We should gradually advance it in a  planned and systematic way in light of the actual conditions and  eventually establish a socialist state-owned commercial bank  system compatible with international practice and possessing  Chinese characteristics. In the new term, positive and prudent  methods or steps should be taken to focus the reform on the  following aspects:    1. First, change the internal operation mechanisms of  specialized banks in line with the operation principle of modern  commercial banks. Taking the best combination of capital  safety, fluidity, and profitability as the general principle of  operation, modern commercial banks pursue maximum profits while  ensuring safety and fluidity (Naturally, commercial banks in our  country should never put profit-making first. They should also  vigorously assume their due responsibility in stabilizing  finance and society and in developing the economy). To this  end, our specialized banks must first change their operation  idea and principle, solidly foster the idea of focusing on  efficiency, and heighten their awareness of the market,  competition, and risk. Second, raise the ratio of capital and  risk assets in accordance with the "Basel Agreement." Our  specialized banks have very little funds at their disposal. At  the end of 1991, the funds under their control amounted to 144.6  billion yuan. After allowing for 117.5 billion yuan in financial  advances and overdrafts, this came to only 29 billion yuan but  the scale of credits was over 2,000 billion yuan. The low  capital abundance rate has not only affected the banks'  financing capability but also endangered the safety of the banks  and hampered the healthy development of the national economy.  For this reason, it is necessary to replenish the funds under  the banks' disposal, adjust the credit structure according to  risk coefficient, and improve the assets quality. Third,  discard the traditional division of labor among the various  specialized banks, allow for appropriate overlapping of  business, and compete on an equal basis. Fourth, reform the  present labor, personnel, and distribution systems, discard the  "iron armchair" [guaranteed rank] and "iron ricebowl," and  closely link the benefits of workers and staff members with  enterprise performance to fully arouse the enthusiasm,  initiative, and creativity of workers and staff members.    2. Change the functions of specialized banks according to  the principle of separating the functions of government from  those of enterprises. It is necessary to speedily establish  policy-related banks and gradually separate specialized banks'  policy-related business from operations. Active preparations  are being made to establish several policy-related banks. The  administrative functions of specialized banks should be  transferred to relevant government departments and some can be  entrusted by the relevant departments to the banks, which  provide paid services.    3. Change the central bank's macroeconomic regulation and  control methods. First, it is necessary to change the method of  controlling credit scale, gradually manage state-owned  commercial banks according to the ratio between asset risk and  liabilities, and solve the dislocation between capital and  credit scale. The central bank can achieve the target of  macroeconomic regulation and control through internationally  applicable money policies or tools, such as reserve requirements  on deposit, central bank credit, rediscount rates, and open  market operation. Second, it is necessary to bring into full  play the role of interest rates as a lever, promote the  marketization of interest rates, adjust the supply and demand of  social funds, concentrate on straightening out the structure of  bank interest rates and bond rates, as well as the interest  rates and yield rates of securities, establish a flexible  mechanism based on the central base rates, and give state-owned  commercial banks the necessary and appropriate right to float  interest rates within the upper and lower ceilings. Third, the  People's Bank of China should gradually delegate the right to  examine and approve the setting up of organizations, allow  state-owned commercial banks to set up organizations according  to the economic development and business volume in the different  regions, change the previous pattern of setting up organizations  in strict accordance with administrative divisions, and rectify  the situation whereby funds are restricted to designated areas.  Some branch offices can also implement, or conduct experiments,  in the joint-stock system to promote the rational and free flow  of funds and achieve the optimum allocation of funds at the  macrolevel.    4. Straighten out the relations between local governments,  state-owned enterprises, and state-owned commercial banks. For  a long time past, in an effort to speedily develop the economy,  some local government adopted various methods to obtain bank  credits. More often than not, huge amounts of credit became bad  debts due to unsuitable choices of projects. The problem of  state-owned enterprises engaging in capital construction and  renovation with circulating funds and credits has yet to be  solved. Some inefficient enterprises are in arrears, owing  large sums of money. This, plus the problems in bank operations,  has resulted in an increasing amount of bad debts and back  debts. If this situation does not change speedily, it will be  extremely difficult to establish and develop state-owned  commercial banks. For this reason, state-owned commercial banks  should be given ample decisionmaking power in operation and  local governments should not interfere with state-owned  commercial banks at will. Enterprises and banks should  establish a normal relationship of creditor's rights and debts  and speedily resolve the outstanding default credits, thus  creating good external conditions for turning specialized banks  into state-owned commercial ones.    5. Improve the financial laws, statutes, and systems and  establish a sound organ of supervision and management. At  present, we should pay close attention to formulating the  "Commercial Banks Law," the "Law of Negotiable Instruments," and  other relevant rules and regulations and pass them as quickly as  possible, defining the rights and duties of state-owned  commercial banks. In this way, the commercial banks can have  rules and regulations to follow in their operations. Moreover,  we should step up the auditing and supervisory power of the  People's Bank and correspondingly establish self-disciplinary  supervisory organizations among banks to develop a set of  omnidirectional supervisory and management systems, thus  ensuring the normal, safe, and orderly operations of state-owned  commercial banks.</p>

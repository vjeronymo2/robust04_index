			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / DTI backs Sellafield search for job-creation schemes A SEARCH for job-creating innovations will start at the Sellafield nuclear-waste reprocessing site in Cumbria next week. The Department of Trade and Industry is spending Pounds 38,000 on a study in which consultants from Price Waterhouse will try to discover which of Sellafield's many technological innovations of the past four decades can be marketed to create new jobs in the coastal strip that stretches for 50 miles from Maryport to Barrow-in-Furness. About 5,000 construction jobs are being shed at Sellafield now that building work is ending at British Nuclear Fuels' Pounds 1.85bn Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp), Europe's biggest single investment project of the 1980s. Thousands of jobs are to go at the VSEL submarine yards in Barrow-in-Furness thanks to the 'peace dividend'. Many hopes in west Cumbria are pinned on the Price Waterhouse research, the first technology-transfer project in Britain backed by the DTI specifically to aid business creation. The purpose of the study is to select a product and assemble a business package in order to tempt a manufacturer to take it up. The one condition is that the product must be made in west Cumbria. The project, likely to take at least a year to the manufacturing stage, is not seen as a rapid route to jobs. Sharp contraction in steelmaking, loss of coal mining, low levels of formation of small businesses and failure to attract much new inward investment were overshadowed in the 1980s by the jobs boom at Sellafield and VSEL. But unemployment has risen by up to 50 per cent in the past year in some parts of west Cumbria and jobless rates of up 25 per cent are expected. British Coal's decision to phase out opencast mining in Cumbria and Albright &amp; Wilson's ending of phosphate rock processing at Whitehaven will cost 500 direct jobs and have serious knock-on effects for the ports of Workington and Whitehaven and British Rail's line along the coast. Volvo's impending closure of its Workington bus plant, where 370 people work, has damaged morale and jobs. News that Dawnfresh, a fish processor that employs 140 people in Whitehaven, is moving to central Scotland has heightened concern over Copeland and Barrow's lack of assisted-area status. West Cumbria's poor communications exacerbate the difficulties. The area has no motorways and air links, and even its main coastal road is not a dual carriageway. The local private and public sectors are acknowledging the need for self-help. 'It's pointless our sitting in our splendid isolation throwing stones at everybody - we have to help ourselves,' said Mr Tim Knowles, who is chairman in Cumbria of the Confederation of British Industry, head of UK corporate affairs at BNFL and general manager of the mainly BNFL-funded West Cumbria Development Fund. Belated recognition of the structural troubles has spurred various diversification initiatives in the past few years, many of them heavily funded by BNFL. West Cumbria's flagship scheme is the Westlakes Science and Technology Park near Sellafield, a WCDF/Rural Development Commission partnership. The first business has just moved in and BNFL is contributing Pounds 2.5m for an Environmental Research Institute on the site. The county's public and private sectors are completing arrangements for a campaign for this summer to raise Cumbria's national profile. 'I don't know whether that many people realise the Lake District is in a place called Cumbria,' Mr Knowles said. 'It's the best place in the world to live.'</p>

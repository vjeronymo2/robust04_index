			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, The Netherlands (3): Competition is intensifying following removal of curbs - Savings COMPETITION in the Dutch savings market is hotting up following the removal of barriers preventing banks and insurers from owning shares in each other. While Dutch banks are linking up with insurers to sell life assurance products, insurers without bank connections are selling traditional bank products such as money market funds and savings deposits. 'Competition is getting tougher than before', says Mr Robertus Hazelhoff, chairman of the Netherlands' biggest bank, ABN Amro. 'High interest rates have made consumers more conscious of competition.' As barriers to cross-border European trade in services are dismantled, insurance companies and banks from neighbouring countries are also entering the fray. Meanwhile a slowdown in the Dutch economy and changes in tax rules, which have reduced the tax advantages of a single premium bond, sales of which boomed last year, have also increased the pressure. The involvement of Dutch banks in insurance is not a new phenomenon. Indeed in 1989, the year before deregulation, banks acting as agents for insurance companies, sold 13 per cent of all insurance policies. But since 1990 there has been a qualitative change. So-called 'allfinanz' is best known in the Netherlands by virtue of the merger which created Internationale Nederlanden Groepe, the biggest bank insurance venture of its kind in Europe. The merger's early months, following its agreement in March 1991, were not entirely trouble free. One problem was a short boycott of ING products by brokers. The issue remains a sensitive one in the ING boardroom and insurance sales at NMB and Postbank branches are being only gradually increased The merger is far from popular in the Dutch financial markets where analysts are critical of the ING management's failure to reduce costs. However, first-quarter 1992 figures show that the group is recovering from these initial difficulties. Moreover, the performance of the Netherlands' second- and third-largest allfinanz ventures, those linking Amev with VSB Bank and Rabobank with Interpolis, has been much more impressive. Amev's sales of life assurance products grew by 24 per cent in 1991 while in 1991 Interpolis, the Tilburg-based insurer, doubled its income from sales of new life insurance premiums between 1990 and 1991, following its takeover by Rabobank. Interpolis' share of the market for new life business grew from 8 per cent to 14 per cent. Salomon Brothers, the US securities house, expects the trend to continue. 'Over the last 10 years, direct sales have grown and now account for between 20 and 25 per cent of total sales,' it said in a recent publication and it predicted a doubling in market share by banks in the next few years. Insurance companies without bank connections have hit back by launching their own savings products. Aegon, the second-largest Dutch life assurance company, has entered the market by setting up its own bank subsidiary. At the end of 1991, Aegon's mortgage bank subsidiary, Friesch-Groningsche Hypotheekbank, acquired a general banking license and has subsequently marketed a deposit savings account which yields returns several basis points higher than those available from mainstream banks. The Dutch subsidiary of Equity &amp; Law, the UK life assurance company owned by France's AXA group, and the French bank, Credit Lyonnaise have also entered the savings market with similar high-yielding products. The new entrants in the market are helped by their ability to use the country' highly efficient payments and inter-bank clearing system, in which payments for utilities such as gas, water and electricity can all be debited directly without the use of cheques. This has caused some consternation among bankers. 'We've built up the infrastructure and now they are taking advantage of it,' complains a senior executive at Rabobank. 'We don't like it very much but there is nothing we can do about it. From a legal point of view it is very difficult to refuse them,' adds Mr Hazelhoff of ABN Amro. Meanwhile, there are also some indications that some life assurance savings could be diverted into deposit accounts and money market funds. The amount of a single premium bond investment which Dutch savers can reduce from their income tax bills was reduced earlier this year. Analysts identify the removal of the tax advantage as one of the reasons why life assurance growth has appeared this year. Analysts are expecting premiums to grow by between 8 and 10 per cent this year, compared with 15 per cent last year. 'There is absolutely no doubt about the slowdown,' says Mr Herman J. van Everdingen, analyst with Van Meer James Capel in Amsterdam. Van der Meer sees competition for life assurance products intensifying as the acceptance of unit-linked policies, in which policyholders win greater rewards and accept a greater share of the risk, becomes more widespread. 'In the old days, premiums were calculated on the basis of a 4 per cent yield. It was relatively easy to make a profit,' he says.</p>

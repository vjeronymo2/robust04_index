This was achieved through an operation conducted in  the town of Tijuana, Baja California, during which Federal  Judicial Police agents captured two presumed drug dealers  attempting to smuggle the shipment into the United States.    The ephedrine, a chemical component essential for processing  cocaine base and producing amphetamines, was being transported  by Martin Flores and Carlos Denis Diaz, who had received the  product from Guadalajara, Jalisco. There is another individual  implicated in trafficking with this drug, named "Ezequiel," who  is now being sought by federal agents.    The drugs were located in the parcel section of the Tijuana  Bus Terminal. The two presumed drug dealers went there, picking  up the drugs to be delivered and later smuggled into the United  States.    When making their preliminary statements, the subjects under  arrest admitted that this was the fifth time that they had  engaged in this type of work, claiming that they were each to  receive $500 for the service.    The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office ordered a detailed  investigation to locate the one or more owners of the chemical,  which is used for the so-called "cuts" in cocaine, providing the  drug with a greater stimulating potential.    Based on the investigations being conducted by the social  representative, it will be determined today whether the two  presumed accused have connections with cocaine distribution  rings established in Mexico and the United States.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Shingles drug output ordered suspended Japan's ministry of health and welfare yesterday ordered the suspension of production of a shingles drug whose side effects allegedly killed 15 patients last year. The ministry said Nippon Shoji violated the Drugs, Cosmetics and Medical Instruments Law, as the company only reported one death of a patient during clinical trials, when in fact three patients had died. The suspension will last 105 days from next Monday. Sorivudine, the shingles drug, was brought to the market last September, but was withdrawn two months later following the deaths. Until now, the health ministry, Nippon Shoji and doctors have been blaming each other for the deaths. Doctors and the company have been pointing fingers at the ministry for allowing the drug to be marketed in the first place, while the doctors have been blamed for not reading the warning against prescribing Sorivudine along with certain other drugs. In order to avoid criticism, the ministry is not withdrawing official approval of Sorivudine, since it would raise questions over why the government authorised the drug in the first place. Meanwhile, Nippon Shoji is under investigation from the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, for alleged insider trading. A total of 139 company employees and their relatives are alleged to have sold the company's stock ahead of the announcement of the deaths. Analysts say the suspension would be a blow to Nippon Shoji's earnings. Some 91 per cent of the company's revenue comes from drug wholesaling, but profit margins on the business are thin and about a quarter of earnings derive from drug manufacturing.</p>

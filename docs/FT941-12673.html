			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Politics restrain Tokyo as region powers ahead Equity prices dropped by 1.3 per cent as purchases by foreign investors failed to offset arbitrage unwinding and institutional profit-taking amid growing political uncertainty, writes Wayne Lionel Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average settled 246.42 lower at 18,891.79, after moving between 19,324.73 and 18,811.78. The Topix index of all first section issues shed 13.82 to 1,536.50 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index dipped 4.25 to 1,266.15. Brokers said that the recent euphoria surrounding what many speculated as the inevitable passage of the political reform bills of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, proved unable to sustain a Nikkei rally for the third straight session. The prime minister threatened yesterday to resign, after a meeting with a joint committee of both houses of parliament, if his political agenda was not passed by the lower house. A general consensus among market participants is that investor sentiment is firm, and that any political headway will fuel a major equity rally. Without the political reform package, however, plans for the government's economic stimulus package, or for the deregulation of domestic financial markets, will receive no attention, according to the government. This will mean a blow to hopes for an end to a bear market, already in its fourth year, and will place more pressure on the Bank of Japan to reduce the official discount rate, which is already at a record low. Volume was estimated at 430m shares, compared with Wednesday's 398m. Profit-taking pushed banking shares lower. Industrial Bank of Japan retreated Y120 to Y3,130, Fuji Bank dropped Y60 to Y2,050 and Sakura Bank lost Y40 at Y1,470. The consumer electronic sector weakened as the yen appreciated against the dollar. Pioneer Electronic slipped Y110 to Y2,810, Sony Y20 to Y5,850 and TDK Y20 to Y3,950. In spite of the day's losses, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone advanced Y19,000 to Y874,000 on the strength of reports that it might enter the multimedia market by acquiring a stake in a US-based software development house. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 77.68 down at 20,754.64 in volume of 106m shares. Roundup Pacific Rim markets produced a strong performance, with advances in many of the markets attributed to a series of domestic news and developments. TAIWAN saw a strong rebound in the financial sector, while investors were generally encouraged by suggestions that the Securities and Exchange Commission might raise the ceiling for foreign investment to Dollars 20bn from Dollars 5bn. The index rose 176.89, or 3 per cent, to 6,022.39 as turnover swelled to TDollars 88.2bn from TDollars 53.9bn. The financial sector improved by 6 per cent. Textiles, which have been active this week on expectations of a recovery in the industry, saw heavy profit-taking, with Shinkong Synthetic Fibres and Ruentex both down 70 cents at TDollars 26.40 and TDollars 27.80 respectively. KUALA LUMPUR extended its strong rebound on the back of retail and institutional buying, with the composite index finishing 44.93, or 4.4 per cent, up at 1,074.24. Brokers said a large local institution was seen accumulating shares, while easing of trading restrictions by stockbroking firms saw a return of retail investors. HONG KONG put in a powerful early advance and then maintained the higher levels for the rest of the day. The Hang Seng index rose 230.85, or 2.1 per cent, to 11,470.42, regaining almost all of Wednesday's loss as fears dissipated over the future of Sino-British relations. Turnover eased to a provisional HKDollars 7.36bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 8.45bn. SEOUL finished at a four-year high as investors concentrated on buying blue chip stocks. The composite index added 13.10 at 907.44. Sentiment was helped by reports that the Korea Stock Market Stabilisation Fund would no longer liquidate its holdings. SINGAPORE regained some lost ground, closing 1.4 per cent firmer in a technical rebound led by a strong recovery in the Malaysian stock market. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 30.81 ahead at 2,286.28. MANILA edged forward in moderate buying that took the composite index 17.24 higher to 3,002.85. AUSTRALIA was lifted by strong overseas buying and firmer gold prices. The All Ordinaries index closed 28.8, or 1.3 per cent, up at 2,250.7 and the gold shares index 68.9, or 2.7 per cent, stronger at 2,625.1. Turnover totalled ADollars 676.2m. NEW ZEALAND finished at its highest point since September 1989, but on comparatively low volume. The NZSE-40 capital index gained 24.31, or 1 per cent, at 2,308.42. BANGKOK added 2.7 per cent following better than expected results from Thai Farmers Bank, up Bt5, or 4 per cent, at Bt123. The SET index advanced 38.95 to 1,498.09.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Time to sing a new song - The new head of English National Opera tells Lucy Kellaway of his plans to boost attendance In the shop next door to the London Coliseum, T-shirts bearing the slogan Everyone Needs Opera have been reduced to Pounds 7.99. Posters advertising last season's more obscure operas have been slashed to 50p. The giddy days are over when clever branding brought the world and its wife to see far-out productions at the English National Opera. The market has changed, the management has changed and the strategy has changed. Dennis Marks, ENO's new general director, sits in his poky office under the roof of London's second opera house humming one of the arias in La Boheme under his breath. That opera, which opened last week, is the most popular ever written. And with it, ENO is trying to re-establish itself as Britain's most popular opera company. 'Accessibility,' Marks says emphatically. 'That one word is at the centre of everything we are trying to do. We are trying to take musical theatre to the widest number of people regardless of their capacity to pay.' In marketing terms, it is a tall order. Getting people to go to the opera when they are fighting to pay the mortgage is not easy. ENO has been successful in branding itself in the 1980s; the challenge for the 1990s is to capitalise on the brand name with more direct ways of getting bottoms on seats. The racy advertisements featuring bare-chested stage hands and sopranos in negligees have won awards and done their job, says Marks, while the ENO corporate logo is in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Less successful has been the recent Everyone Needs Opera slogan, which Marks has decided to withdraw. 'One day I walked out of Leicester Square tube and saw someone in a sleeping bag under one of the Everybody Needs Opera posters. It exposed the company as being underaware of what was going on around it.' Marks has no plans for finding a replacement for the unhappy slogan, arguing that people know that ENO exists. To remind them again would be a waste of money. 'What we must do is to cross the gap between perception and getting people in.' Like most other theatres, ENO's subscriptions have fallen in the recession, as have advance bookings. Instead, people buy tickets on the day - or don't, depending on how rich they feel. This has had a serious effect on the company's profits - each annual percentage point fall from the capacity audience cuts profits by Pounds 100,000 a year. Falling audiences have led to a deficit of more than Pounds 2m. Unless the tide is turned, ENO will have no chance of meeting this year's budget. To fight back, the company has just installed a state-of-the-art computerised ticket system which allows it to keep tabs on everyone who has ever been to the Coliseum. 'We know what sort of buyer you are, what you have been to see,' says Marks. The aim is for the right kind of publicity to reach the right kind of customer. ENO has rolled its public relations, development and press departments into a single unit, which is devising tactics for talking to the audience more directly. It has relaunched its subscription scheme and is trying to lure the audience back to booking in advance. It has tried to find out why its numbers have fallen, and is targeting sectors of the possible audience - such as people living outside London - that have been staying at home in droves. The company is also trying to market itself better to sponsors - which are being expected to make up the shortfall left by the dwindling grant from the Arts Council. ENO recognises that it will never get much of the corporate entertainment market with its tatty opera house. Instead, it is concentrating efforts on companies in complementary lines of business. 'The kind of work ENO does is something that is attractive to companies that are interested in development,' says Marks. ENO was recently given money by management consultancy KPMG as part of its 'future positive' campaign. But whether the new team can bring it off depends on the operas themselves. 'We have to be like the car in the Volkswagen advertisement  - we have to be the brilliant fast one, but also the reliable one. What we are is a company people can go to as they go to a cinema.' Depending on which metaphor you prefer, La Boheme is either the opera equivalent of the reliable car or of Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, the critics verdict so far is that the gear changes were too obvious and the special effects wanting.</p>

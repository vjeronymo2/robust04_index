			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Pressure grows for Bihac truce: US aligns with Europe and Russia for settlement in former Yugoslavia The US, its European allies and Russia joined forces yesterday to press for a ceasefire in the Bosnian enclave of Bihac and a broader settlement in former Yugoslavia. Mediators from the five-nation contact group - comprising the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - held secret talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic at a remote villa. In a day of hectic diplomatic activity in former Yugoslavia, Washington and Brussels, the contact group also called for an immediate truce in Bihac and in Bosnia as a whole. Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, said Washington would 'seriously consider' any request for troops to help oversee the withdrawal of UN peacekeepers from Bosnia. But he hoped that no pull-out would be necessary. His comments were welcomed in Europe as a sign that the US administration, unlike Congress, remained sympathetic to its allies' concerns. In Bihac, blood-letting dragged on as two mortar rounds exploded within the notionally UN-protected 'safe area'. A man was killed. Diplomatic recriminations over Bosnia also continued, with European Union foreign ministers angrily rejecting an attack by Mr Robert Dole, leader-elect of the Senate's Republican majority, on the stance of Britain and France. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said Mr Dole's comments - calling for an immediate UN withdrawal and arms deliveries to Bosnia - reflected a mistaken view about what outside forces could do to end the fighting. Mr Dole said he hoped to narrow his differences with the UK in a trip to Europe starting today. 'Nato's inability to respond to a war of aggression on south-eastern Europe raises serious questions about Nato's future plans to expand to central and eastern Europe,' Mr Dole said before he left. Mr Hurd, in a clear reference to US calls for tougher air action, said peace in the Bihac area 'will not be achieved by fostering illusions about what Nato air power can achieve'. The UN was continuing yesterday to work for a ceasefire accord between Bosnia's Moslem-led government - which favours a three-month truce - and the Serbs, who prefer any truce to be indefinite. British officials said the contact group mediators were briefing Mr Milosevic on the group's latest ideas, which are reported to include a further easing of sanctions on Serbia if he fully recognises Croatia. The group, in a significant concession, has also indicated that it will consider allowing the Bosnian Serbs a 'special relationship' with Serbia if they accept the international peace plan. The idea of 'confederal ties' between the Bosnian Serbs and Belgrade was firmly rejected by the Bosnian government last night, and western officials emphasised that the issue could not even be raised unless the Serbs agreed to the existing peace proposals. France, meanwhile, launched a fresh appeal to the UN and Nato to 'ensure the respect' of safe havens in Bosnia. Paris called for a renewed effort to find an overall settlement that took no account of recent Serb gains in the Bihac area.

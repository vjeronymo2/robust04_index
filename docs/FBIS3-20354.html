			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stefano Marroni: "It Will Be Tough for Whoever </F> Governs"]    [Excerpts] Rome -- "What can I say? If the opinion polls  are right, Chancey Gardiner [fictional character] would say that  the Right has won and the progressive forces have lost. And if  they are wrong, that the progressive forces have won and the  Right has lost. Well, I go along with that. And I would add  that, whatever happens, it will be very tough for Silvio  Berlusconi and his men to govern...." [passage omitted]    It was immediately clear that, as far as the Democratic  Alliance [AD] leaders were concerned, the exit polls must be  taken with a pinch of salt: "The discrepancy between the  maximum and minimum for the two sides," Giorgio Bogi pointed out  sarcastically, "is the same as exists between life and  death...." "I am almost certain," Ferdinando Adornato added,  that this evening's newspaper headlines will announce a major  victory for the Right and that by tomorrow it will have  disappeared. Having said that, it is obvious that there has  been a success on their part. But this shows that the AD was  right about everything -- and from the outset. We were right to  oppose the cartel including Communist Renewal, we were right to  fight for a single symbol instead of our dividing behind so many  little banners. And above all, we were right to argue that the  progressive forces could not win without the center, that the  agreement with Mario Segni, [Pact for Italy leader], was  essential. We were not heeded, and this is what has happened;  the center has disappeared and the Right has won. But we must go  back to this -- with Mino Martinazzoli, [secretary of the  Italian Popular Party, PPI] in Segni's place, perhaps. Be that  as it may, to an understanding between the progressive forces  and the center...."    The same stance was adopted by Willer Bordon, who seemed  astonished by the observation that he did not seem to be  mourning the AD's failure in the proportional quota: "We never  had in mind some minor party commanding 4 percent: We were  formed with a greater ambition, and it is no coincidence that  everyone now is talking in terms of a democratic party, a single  parliamentary group for all the progressive forces. In this  respect, we certainly have not been defeated. Of course, it  would certainly have been better if we had succeeded in the  proportional quotas, too; but if we really did gain 3 percent,  it means that we have half as many votes as Bossi. And that is  not bad for a party that was formed only a year ago."    The fact remains that the Right is now preparing to govern,  dispelling the illusion that the "ordinary society" on which  Adornato pinned his hopes was progressive. But Adornato is not  surrendering: "True, ordinary society did vote prevalently for  the Right. But this confirms that ordinary society needed to be  offered a less old, a less `political' image than that provided  by the Left. Like it or not, the contest was more between `old  and new' than between `Right and Left.' And Berlusconi seemed  newer than Achille Occhetto [secretary of the aDemocratic Party  of the Left, PDS]." Is anyone to blame for the Right's victory?  "Many people," Adornato replied, "but two in particular --  Occhetto and Segni. They did not trust each other, each was  afraid of being subordinate to the other. Then one of them  thought that he could be prime minister or, at most, yield his  position to Carlo Ciampi, while the other was reduced to playing  the Mario Scelba. It is they that have brought us to this...."</p>

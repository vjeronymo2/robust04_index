			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Assemble Nationale (Elections '93): Socialists to pay price of jobs failure - Persistent unemployment is the big issue in the French election IF THERE is one overwhelming reason why France's Socialist ministers seem certain to lose their jobs in this month's parliamentary election, it is the country's unemployment rate, standing at 10.5 per cent in January and expected to go higher. This issue has occupied more broadcast airtime and filled more newspaper column inches than any other in the campaign. All the more so because the mainstream parties are not united within themselves on the best prescription for unemployment - although, broadly, the right wants to cut labour costs while the left prefers work-sharing. Only on the extremes are simple solutions offered. Mr Georges Marchais, the Communist party leader, plugs on for a reduction in the working week from 39 to 35 hours with no cuts in pay, while Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front leader, blames immigrants for displacing French workers. France's unemployment rate is no worse than Britain's or Italy's, and better than Spain's, despite some calculations by the opposition. The latter claims the true number of jobless is nearly double the 2,992,600 recorded in January. To arrive at a total of 5m-6m French citizens 'excluded' from the labour market, they include not only young people in government short-term work schemes but everyone drawing welfare payments. Yet France has special problems. One is that its unemployment rate seems to rise just as fast as other countries' in bad economic times, but to fall far less during good times. Its jobless rate hit 10.5 per cent in 1987, but in the three following boom years, it fell only 1.5 percentage points, compared to a 3-point drop in (western) Germany and a 5-point fall in Britain. Predictably, this puts a high share (30 per cent at present) of people into the category of the long-term unemployed, defined as those without a job for more than a year. When he took office last April, Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy made a bold, not to say rash, promise to take all long-term unemployed (some 900,000 at the time) off the dole queues within six months. Virtually all the long-term jobless were given in-depth interviews. Some found a place in the labour market and many others were put in training schemes. But it was like trying to keep the Atlantic out with a mop. By November, for every person taken off the dole, someone else had fallen into their 13th month of unemployment. Another black spot is youth unemployment. Of those under 25, one in five is without a job. Part of the blame lies with France's generally excellent school system, which reserves technical and vocational training for those who have passed its all-round educational tests. Hence, tailoring a more specific apprenticeship system to France's unemployment as well as industrial needs has been a big theme of the campaign. A study published by the Paribas bank yesterday claims that the country's guaranteed minimum wage, known as the SMIC, is in large part responsible for pricing the least qualified workers out of the job market. It notes that the SMIC has doubled in real terms over the past 20 years, rising far faster than average pay. When he was finance minister, Mr Beregovoy suggested a lower SMIC for young workers. But he got no support from fellow Socialists, and even the opposition has steered away from altering the minimum wage. But the opposition has attacked the French system of loading most of the cost of the welfare system not on general income tax but on company payrolls. These 'social charges' can add an extra 40 per cent to the cost for an employer of taking on a new worker. The opposition's general thrust has been to call for these charges to be gradually transferred to the national budget and financed out of general taxation. But, in the short term, the RPR Gaullists and centre-right UDF disagree over precisely how to do this without increasing the already swollen budget deficit. Virtually the only new Socialist theme during the campaign has been work-sharing, the idea of spreading available work around more people. Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader, has ridiculed this as unfeasible because those in existing jobs will not accept less pay for less work. Most Socialists, including Mr Chirac's expected presidential challenger in 1995, former prime minister Mr Michel Rocard, have conceded that work-sharing would mean pay cuts. But others point out that extra productivity can both maintain pay rates and increase employment. One result of the debate about unemployment has been initiatives by employers, such as that by the AXA insurance company in suggesting employment for life in return for flexible work patterns and lifetime training.

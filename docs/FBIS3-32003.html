In a press release  supporting the initiative of the business sector to halt all  activities for a two-week period, the president of the new  office of the chamber has called on the international community  to lift the embargo. Frantz Robert Monde considers that by this  measure the international community is killing, impoverishing,  and destabilizing the basic institutions of democracy and is  marginalizing the Haitian people. Through the resolution of the  Chamber of Commerce, the president of the Chamber of Deputies  thinks that the Haitian private sector has denounced the embargo  and has sounded an alarm.</p>
